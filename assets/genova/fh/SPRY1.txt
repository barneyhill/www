# SPRY1

## Overview
SPRY1 (sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 1) is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in modulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. The protein, categorized as a signaling antagonist, plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. SPRY1 is characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich SPRY domain, which is essential for its function in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling. The protein's structural features, such as the beta-sandwich fold and beta-hairpin 'finger' motif, facilitate its interaction with other proteins, including FK506-binding protein (FKBP) and zDHHC17, influencing pathways like Akt/FoxO/Myocardin and ERK. Clinically, SPRY1 is implicated in several conditions, including syndromic craniosynostosis and various cancers, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the context (MasoumiMoghaddam2014The; Tooze2022Craniosynostosis; Yuchi2015Crystal).

## Structure
The SPRY1 protein, encoded by the SPRY1 gene, features a conserved cysteine-rich SPRY domain, which is crucial for its function in regulating receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. The primary structure of SPRY1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure of the SPRY1 domain includes beta strands and 3_10 helices, contributing to its overall beta-sandwich fold, a common structural motif in eukaryotic proteins (BauerováHlinková2020Structure; Yuchi2015Crystal).

The tertiary structure of SPRY1 is characterized by a distinctive beta-hairpin 'finger' motif, which is stabilized by a conserved tryptophan residue, suggesting a functional role in protein-protein interactions (Yuchi2015Crystal). This motif is part of the SPRY1 domain's involvement in binding to the FK506-binding protein (FKBP), which is essential for the function of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) (Yuchi2015Crystal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity of SPRY1, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variant isoforms could result in different functional roles, but specific isoforms are not mentioned in the context. Overall, the structural features of SPRY1 are integral to its role in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
SPRY1 (sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In human aortic smooth muscle cells (hAoSMCs), SPRY1 promotes differentiation by enhancing Akt activity, which phosphorylates and inactivates FoxO proteins, particularly FoxO3a. This action relieves the repression on Myocd expression, a key regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) marker gene expression, thereby promoting VSMC differentiation (Yang2013Spry1).

SPRY1 is also involved in maintaining the phenotype of VSMCs by regulating the Akt/FoxO/Myocardin signaling pathway. It enhances and sustains Akt activation, which is necessary for VSMC marker expression and cell proliferation (Yang2013Spry1). In contrast, SPRY1 negatively regulates primitive hematopoiesis and endothelial cell function during embryogenesis. It is expressed in hemangioblasts and acts as a feedback inhibitor of RTK-mediated ERK activation, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Yang2011Spry1).

In the context of skin aging, SPRY1 expression increases with age in human skin keratinocytes, suggesting a role in the aging process through changes in its expression and methylation status (Yang2019Mechanism).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SPRY1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In humans, a complete loss of SPRY1 function due to a homozygous nonsense variant has been associated with syndromic craniosynostosis, inner ear malformations, and minor renal abnormalities. This suggests a significant role for SPRY1 in cranial and renal development, with potential species-specific differences in phenotypic expression compared to mice (Tooze2022Craniosynostosis).

In cancer, SPRY1 acts as a tumor suppressor in several contexts. Its downregulation is linked to the progression of medullary thyroid carcinoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. In medullary thyroid carcinoma, decreased SPRY1 expression due to promoter methylation is associated with tumorigenesis (MasoumiMoghaddam2014The). In prostate cancer, SPRY1 downregulation is linked to unrestrained FGF-induced signaling, contributing to tumor progression (MasoumiMoghaddam2014The). In triple-negative breast cancer, SPRY1 promotes malignancy by stabilizing EGFR protein and facilitating EGF-mediated activation, with its suppression leading to reduced tumor growth and metastasis (He2016Suppression).

In ovarian cancer, SPRY1 expression inversely correlates with cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its role in inhibiting cancer cell motility and survival (MasoumiMoghaddam2014Thea). These findings highlight the complex role of SPRY1 in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the cellular context.

## Interactions
SPRY1, a protein involved in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways, participates in several critical interactions with other proteins. It is known to interact with FKBP12, a protein that binds to ryanodine receptors (RyRs). This interaction is mediated by specific residues within the SPRY1 domain, such as L719, H736, L737, and F674, which play crucial roles in the SPRY1-FKBP interface. The F674 side-chain fits into a pocket on the FKBP surface, suggesting a cation-pi interaction with R40 (Yuchi2015Crystal). Mutations in the SPRY1 domain, such as N760D, can significantly affect FKBP binding by altering the folding of the domain (Yuchi2015Crystal).

SPRY1 also interacts with the enzyme zDHHC17, which S-acylates SPRY1. This interaction is maintained even with a W130A mutation in zDHHC17, although the binding is reduced by 40-60% (Butler2023Sacylation). In cancer cell lines, SPRY1 has been shown to interact with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), inhibiting migration and invasion, and it also affects the ERK and AKT signaling pathways by increasing PTEN activity (MasoumiMoghaddam2014The). These interactions highlight SPRY1's role in modulating signaling pathways involved in cell growth, differentiation, and cancer progression.
