# NUTM2A

## Overview
NUTM2A is a gene that encodes the protein NUT family member 2A, which is involved in various cellular processes. The NUT family member 2A protein is categorized as a nuclear protein, playing a role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. This gene has garnered attention due to its involvement in chromosomal rearrangements and fusion events that are implicated in several malignancies, including hematological cancers and myeloid sarcoma. The NUTM2A gene's rearrangements, such as the formation of fusion genes with other oncogenes, have been shown to disrupt critical signaling pathways, contributing to oncogenesis and disease progression (Zerkalenkova2021BTK; Kamens2023Malignant). Understanding the function and interactions of NUTM2A is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving diagnostic strategies in cancer treatment.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
NUTM2A is implicated in various malignancies through chromosomal rearrangements and fusion events. In childhood acute leukemia, a novel chromosomal translocation t(10;11)(q22;q23.3) involving NUTM2A and KMT2A has been identified. This translocation represents the first case of NUTM2A rearrangement in hematological malignancies, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Zerkalenkova2021BTK).

NUTM2A is also involved in myeloid sarcoma through the formation of a CIC-NUTM2A fusion gene. This fusion disrupts receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways, leading to the upregulation of ETS transcription factors and other oncogenic targets. The CIC-NUTM2A fusion has been shown to activate pathways such as RAS, RAP1, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT, contributing to leukemogenesis and the malignant progression of myeloid sarcoma (Kamens2023Malignant). Murine models have confirmed the pathogenicity of this fusion, demonstrating enhanced self-renewal and aggressive leukemia development (Kamens2023Malignant).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of NUTM2A rearrangements in both hematological and solid tumors, underscoring the importance of molecular analysis in diagnosing and understanding these malignancies.
