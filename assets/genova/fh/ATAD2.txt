# ATAD2

## Overview
ATAD2, or ATPase family AAA domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation. The protein, also referred to as ATAD2, is a non-canonical ATP-dependent histone chaperone characterized by its AAA+ ATPase domains and a bromodomain, which allows it to interact with acetylated histones and other chromatin-associated proteins. This interaction is crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling, DNA replication, and repair processes (Cho2023Structure; Morozumi2015Atad2). ATAD2 is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells and male germ cells, where it functions as a transcriptional co-activator. It is also implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is associated with oncogenic pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Morozumi2015Atad2; Liu2022TumorPromoting).

## Structure
The ATAD2 protein is a non-canonical ATP-dependent histone chaperone with a complex molecular structure. It features a conserved multidomain architecture, including an N-terminal acidic domain, two AAA+ ATPase domains, a bromodomain, a C-terminal domain, and a long C-terminal linker (CTL) that connects the bromodomain and C-terminal domain (Cho2023Structure). The AAA+ domains are characterized by a large α/β nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and a small α-helical bundle domain (HBD), which oligomerize into hexameric rings with ATP binding pockets at the subunit interfaces (Cho2023Structure).

The bromodomain of ATAD2 is a chromatin reader domain that recognizes acetylated lysine residues on histone tails. It is structured as a canonical four-helix bundle, consisting of helices αZ, αA, αB, and αC, with ZA and BC loops forming a hydrophobic pocket for acetyl-lysine coordination (Gay2018Disulfide; Cho2023Structure). A unique feature of the ATAD2 bromodomain is the presence of a disulfide bridge, which influences ligand recognition (Gay2018Disulfide).

ATAD2 forms a hexameric spiral assembly, with subunits arranged in a right-handed spiral, stabilized by interactions between the N-terminal linker domain and adjacent domains (Cho2023Structure). The protein's structure is dynamic, with histone binding inducing conformational changes that activate ATAD2 (Cho2023Structure).

## Function
ATAD2, also known as ATAD2A, is a conserved AAA ATPase-bromodomain factor that plays a significant role in chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation in healthy human cells. It is highly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and male germ cells, where it acts as a transcriptional co-activator and is involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA replication, and DNA repair (Morozumi2015Atad2). ATAD2 is an abundant nucleosome-bound protein present on active genes, and its bromodomain is guided by histone acetylation, which increases chromatin accessibility and histone dynamics, essential for the activity of highly expressed genes (Morozumi2015Atad2).

In ES cells, ATAD2 is crucial for maintaining cell proliferation during differentiation by supporting specific gene expression programs (Morozumi2015Atad2). It binds preferentially to acetylated histone H4, particularly at sites H4K5ac and H4K12ac, through its bromodomain, maintaining chromatin dynamics and accessibility (Morozumi2015Atad2). ATAD2 is involved in various chromatin-templated functions, such as transcription, chromatin remodeling, and RNA splicing, and is associated with chromatin remodeling complexes and factors controlling histone/DNA modification (Morozumi2015Atad2). Despite its role in normal physiological settings, ATAD2 is often upregulated in various cancers, suggesting its potential as a drug target for bromodomain inhibitors (Morozumi2015Atad2).

## Clinical Significance
The ATAD2 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression and involvement in oncogenic pathways. In colorectal cancer, ATAD2 promotes cell proliferation through the pRb-E2F1 pathway and enhances angiogenesis by increasing VEGFA secretion (Liu2022TumorPromoting). In breast cancer, ATAD2 overexpression is linked to 8q24 amplification and activation of MYC pathways, affecting tumor grade and metastasis (Liu2022TumorPromoting). It also plays a role in DNA damage response and repair (Hwang2022miR302).

In lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, ATAD2 overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes and promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration through the PI3K/AKT pathway (Fu2023ATPase; Hao2022Effect). In prostate cancer, ATAD2 acts as a co-regulator of the androgen receptor, enhancing cancer cell proliferation (Fu2023ATPase). In ovarian cancer, ATAD2 affects the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, contributing to chemotherapy resistance (Liu2022TumorPromoting).

ATAD2's role in cancer progression is further highlighted by its involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, influencing cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Caron2010Functional). Its overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior, making it a potential therapeutic target (Fu2023ATPase).

## Interactions
ATAD2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. It binds to acetylated histones, particularly histone H4, through its bromodomain, which is crucial for its role in chromatin dynamics and cancer progression (Boussouar2013Malignant; Cho2022Structure). The protein also interacts with transcription factors such as c-Myc, E2F, androgen receptor (AR), and estrogen receptor (ER), acting as a coactivator to enhance transcriptional activity (Fu2023ATPase; Nayak2021Oncogenic).

ATAD2's ATPase domain is involved in protein multimerization and coactivating functions, interacting with proteins like NCOA3 and HDAC11 (Nayak2021Oncogenic). It also forms complexes with ESR1, SUMO2, SPTN2, and MYC, which are significant for its oncogenic potential (Nayak2021Oncogenic). In the context of cancer, ATAD2 interacts with the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway, promoting metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Cao2021ATAD2).

ATAD2 is involved in the DNA damage response, interacting with CHK1/2 and potentially promoting BRCA1 expression (Fu2023ATPase). It also plays a role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process by regulating EMT markers and influencing signaling pathways such as PI3K-AKT-mTOR and MAPKs (Fu2023ATPase).
