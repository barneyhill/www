# RAD51C

## Overview
RAD51C is a gene that encodes the RAD51 paralog C protein, a crucial component of the DNA repair machinery involved in homologous recombination. This protein is part of the RAD51 family, which plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. RAD51 paralog C is characterized as an ATPase, containing Walker A and B motifs essential for its function. It forms part of the BCDX2 complex and the CX3 complex with XRCC3, both of which are vital for DNA replication fork protection and repair processes (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3). Mutations in the RAD51C gene have been linked to increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in hereditary cancer syndromes (Pelttari2011RAD51C; Osorio2012Predominance). The gene's role in DNA repair underscores its importance in preventing genomic instability and tumorigenesis (Liu2004RAD51C).

## Structure
The RAD51C protein is a member of the RAD51 family, which is involved in DNA repair and homologous recombination. Its molecular structure includes several key features that contribute to its function. The primary structure of RAD51C contains Walker A and B ATP binding motifs, which are essential for its ATPase activity and interaction with other proteins (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3). The secondary structure of RAD51C includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which form part of its ATPase core domain (Bonilla2020RAD51).

In terms of tertiary structure, RAD51C has a unique polymerization motif that allows it to interact with XRCC3, forming a heterodimer. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing RAD51 filaments during DNA replication (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a hetero-tetramer with RAD51B, RAD51D, and XRCC2, which is important for its role in DNA repair processes (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3).

The RAD51C protein also contains a nuclear localization sequence, which is important for its cellular localization and function (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3). Specific domains, such as the C-terminal domain (CTD) and N-terminal domain (NTD), play significant roles in its interaction with XRCC3 and other RAD51 paralogs (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3). The RAD51C-XRCC3 complex is stabilized by ATP binding, highlighting the importance of the ATPase activity in its function (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3).

## Function
RAD51C is a crucial component of the DNA repair machinery in human cells, primarily involved in homologous recombination (HR), a key process for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. It is part of the RAD51 paralog family and forms a complex with XRCC3, known as the CX3 complex, which is essential for DNA replication fork protection, restart, and reversal (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3). RAD51C stabilizes RAD51 filaments at replication forks, preventing their disassembly and ensuring efficient DNA repair and replication (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it forms nuclear foci independently of RAD51, suggesting a role in assisting the assembly of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments at DNA break sites (Bennett2005Cellular). RAD51C also regulates the ubiquitination and degradation of RAD51, maintaining its stability during DNA repair processes (Bennett2005Cellular).

Mutations in RAD51C can lead to defects in DNA repair, replication fork protection, and replication fork restart, contributing to genomic instability and increased cancer susceptibility (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3). The gene's function is critical for maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis (Liu2004RAD51C).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAD51C gene are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. RAD51C is considered a moderate to high-risk susceptibility gene for ovarian cancer, with specific mutations such as c.93delG and c.837+1G>A linked to a significantly increased risk of familial ovarian cancer, particularly in the absence of breast cancer (Pelttari2011RAD51C). In Finnish populations, these mutations are more prevalent, possibly due to founder effects, and are notably more frequent among ovarian cancer cases with a family history of the disease (Pelttari2011RAD51C).

RAD51C mutations have also been implicated in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Studies have identified several pathogenic variants, including missense mutations like G153D and T287A, which disrupt protein interactions crucial for DNA repair, thereby contributing to cancer susceptibility (Clague2011RAD51C). The presence of RAD51C mutations is associated with a lower mean age of onset for breast cancer compared to sporadic cases, and these mutations are often found in families with a history of both breast and ovarian tumors (Osorio2012Predominance).

Additionally, RAD51C mutations are linked to a Fanconi anemia-like disorder, characterized by impaired DNA repair, although patients do not exhibit the hematological abnormalities typical of Fanconi anemia (Vuorela2011Further).

## Interactions
RAD51C is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for DNA repair through homologous recombination. It forms part of two distinct protein complexes: the BCDX2 complex, which includes RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and XRCC2, and another complex with XRCC3. The BCDX2 complex is involved in strand annealing and binding to Holliday junctions, while the RAD51C-XRCC3 complex is part of the Holliday junction resolvase complex (Liu2002Involvement; Rajesh2009The).

RAD51C interacts directly with RAD51D, and through this interaction, it can be indirectly associated with XRCC2, forming a stable complex (Liu2002Involvement). The RAD51C-XRCC3 complex is capable of catalyzing homologous pairing, a critical step in DNA repair, with RAD51C acting as a catalytic subunit and XRCC3 enhancing this activity (Kurumizaka2001Homologous-pairing).

The RAD51C-XRCC3 complex has been structurally characterized, revealing extensive interfaces between the proteins, which are crucial for their function in DNA replication and repair. Mutations in RAD51C affecting these interactions have been linked to cancer susceptibility (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3). RAD51C also interacts with RAD51, although this interaction is less robust compared to XRCC3 (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3).
