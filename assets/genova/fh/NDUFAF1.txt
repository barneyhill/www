# NDUFAF1

## Overview
NDUFAF1 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 1, which is a crucial mitochondrial assembly factor involved in the biogenesis of Complex I of the electron transport chain. This protein functions as a chaperone, facilitating the assembly and stabilization of Complex I intermediates without being part of the final structure. It interacts with several other proteins, such as ECSIT and ACAD9, to ensure the proper assembly and function of Complex I, which is essential for efficient electron transfer and ATP production in mitochondria (Vogel2005Human; Mimaki2012Understanding). Mutations in the NDUFAF1 gene are associated with severe mitochondrial disorders, including fatal infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Leigh syndrome, highlighting its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Diaz2011Mitochondrial; Fassone2011Mutations).

## Function
NDUFAF1 is a mitochondrial assembly factor essential for the proper assembly and function of Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) in the electron transport chain. It plays a critical role in the stabilization and incorporation of subunits into Complex I, ensuring efficient electron transfer and ATP production. NDUFAF1 is localized in the mitochondria, where it is more abundant than in total cell protein extracts, indicating its specific mitochondrial function (Vogel2005Human). It is involved in the assembly and stability of Complex I intermediates, particularly the ~460-kDa and ~830-kDa complexes, and is associated with several Complex I subunits, including ND1, ND2, ND3, ND6, NDUFB6, NDUFA6, NDUFA9, NDUFS3, and NDUFS7 (Vogel2007Human; Mimaki2012Understanding).

NDUFAF1 acts as a chaperone, transiently interacting with early intermediates of Complex I assembly, aiding in the assembly process without being part of the final functional structure (Vogel2007Human). Its expression is regulated by testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4), which binds to its promoter, suggesting a transcriptional regulation mechanism (Mimaki2012Understanding). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining normal mitochondrial function and morphology, impacting cellular energy metabolism and overall organismal energy homeostasis (Vogel2007Cytosolic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFAF1 gene are linked to fatal infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle due to isolated complex I deficiency. These mutations lead to a significant reduction in NDUFAF1 protein levels and abnormal complex I assembly, resulting in severe cardiac conditions (Fassone2011Mutations). The pathogenicity of these mutations is supported by their absence in control subjects and their conservation across species (Fassone2011Mutations). 

NDUFAF1 mutations can also cause mitochondrial disorders, as the gene is crucial for the assembly of complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Deficiencies in complex I are associated with a range of clinical conditions, including Leigh syndrome and other mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, which often result in symptoms like muscle weakness, neurodegeneration, and metabolic dysfunction (Diaz2011Mitochondrial).

The interaction between NDUFAF1 and the Ecsit protein is essential for the stability and assembly of complex I. Disruption of this interaction, such as through Ecsit knockdown, leads to decreased NDUFAF1 levels and impaired complex I assembly, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction (Vogel2007Cytosolic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NDUFAF1 in maintaining mitochondrial health and its role in disease when mutated or dysregulated.

## Interactions
NDUFAF1 is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I and interacts with several other proteins during this process. It is known to copurify with ECSIT and ACAD9, which are also putative complex I assembly factors (Fassone2011Mutations; fassone2012biochemical). The interaction between NDUFAF1 and ECSIT is particularly significant, as ECSIT is a protein that localizes to mitochondria and interacts with NDUFAF1 in high-molecular-weight complexes ranging from 500 to 850 kDa (Vogel2007Cytosolic). Structural predictions suggest a strong interaction between ECSIT and NDUFAF1, with specific contact sites identified on both proteins (Pei2021Human).

NDUFAF1 is also associated with intermediate complexes of approximately 600 and 700 kDa, which are crucial for the assembly and stability of complex I (Vogel2005Human; Mckenzie2010Assembly). These interactions are essential for the proper assembly of complex I, as evidenced by the fact that knockdown of ECSIT reduces the levels of mature complex I and NDUFAF1 protein, indicating their interdependent roles in complex I biogenesis (fassone2012biochemical).
