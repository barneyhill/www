# IL21R

## Overview
The IL21R gene encodes the interleukin 21 receptor, a type I cytokine receptor that plays a pivotal role in the immune system. This receptor is primarily involved in mediating the effects of interleukin-21 (IL-21), a cytokine that influences various immune responses. The IL21R protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular domain with two fibronectin type III domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. It forms a heterodimeric complex with the common gamma chain (γc) to facilitate signal transduction, as the IL21R alpha-chain lacks intrinsic signaling ability (Li2010Interleukin21; Davis2007Interleukin21). The receptor is expressed on several immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, and is crucial for the regulation of immune responses through pathways such as JAK-STAT, MAPK, and PI3K (Leonard2016IL21; ParrishNovak2002Interleukin21). Mutations in the IL21R gene are associated with immunodeficiency disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune responses (Edeer2021Combined; Cagdas2021Genomic).

## Structure
The IL21R protein is a type I cytokine receptor with a complex molecular structure. It consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain includes two fibronectin type III domains that form a V-shaped structure, with the cytokine binding site located at the tip (Siupka2015A). A key feature of the extracellular domain is the WSXWS motif, which is crucial for the receptor's function and transport to the plasma membrane (Siupka2015A). This motif is part of a W-R-W ladder structure, where an arginine is sandwiched between two tryptophans, and is maintained regardless of ligand binding (Siupka2015A).

The IL21R protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation at asparagine 54, which is essential for its transport to the plasma membrane (Siupka2015A). The receptor forms a heterodimeric complex with the common gamma chain (γc) for signal transduction (Davis2007Interleukin21). This complex is necessary for the receptor's signaling capabilities, as the IL21R alpha-chain lacks intrinsic signaling ability (Li2010Interleukin21). The IL21R gene is located on human chromosome 16p11 (ParrishNovak2000Interleukin).

## Function
The IL21R (interleukin 21 receptor) is a critical component of the immune system, primarily involved in mediating the effects of interleukin-21 (IL-21), a cytokine that influences various immune responses. IL21R is expressed on the surface of several immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, and is involved in both innate and adaptive immunity (Leonard2016IL21; ParrishNovak2002Interleukin21). 

In healthy human cells, IL21R plays a significant role in the regulation of immune responses by activating several signaling pathways, such as the JAK-STAT, MAPK, and PI3K pathways. These pathways lead to the activation of transcription factors like STAT3, which is more potently activated by IL-21 in T cells compared to other STAT proteins (Spolski2014Interleukin21:). IL21R is crucial for the proliferation and activation of T and B cells, as well as the cytolytic activity of NK cells (ParrishNovak2002Interleukin21). 

IL21R is also involved in the generation of plasma cells and memory B cells, as well as immunoglobulin class switching, which are essential for effective antibody responses (Leonard2016IL21). The receptor's signaling can induce apoptosis in certain immune cells, helping to maintain immune homeostasis and prevent excessive immune responses (Leonard2016IL21).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL21R gene are associated with a range of immunodeficiency disorders. IL-21R deficiency, caused by biallelic inactivating mutations, leads to combined immunodeficiency (CID), characterized by increased susceptibility to recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, as well as opportunistic infections like Cryptosporidium cholangitis (Cagdas2021Genomic). Patients with IL-21R deficiency often present with hypogammaglobulinemia, reduced memory B cells, and impaired T and NK cell functions, contributing to severe clinical manifestations such as bronchiectasis, liver disease, and growth retardation (Cagdas2021Genomic).

IL-21R mutations can also lead to immune dysregulation and increased risk of malignancies, such as marginal zone lymphoma, as seen in a case involving a novel homozygous mutation (Edeer2021Combined). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used successfully in some cases to restore immune function and treat associated malignancies (Edeer2021Combined).

Additionally, polymorphisms in the IL21R gene, such as rs3093301, have been linked to an increased risk of autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), highlighting the gene's role in immune regulation and disease susceptibility (Webb2009A).

## Interactions
The interleukin-21 receptor (IL21R) interacts with interleukin-21 (IL-21) to form a receptor complex that includes the common gamma chain (γc), which is essential for signal transduction. This complex activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, influencing immune cell functions (Asao2001Cutting). The IL21R contains two fibronectin III domains that form a V-shaped structure, with the cytokine binding site at the tip. The interaction between IL-21 and IL21R is mediated by specific residues in IL-21, such as Arg 5, Arg 9, Gln 12, Arg 76, and Lys 73, which form a pocket for Met 70 of IL21R (Hamming2012Crystal).

A key structural feature of IL21R is the WSXWS motif, which is involved in forming a sugar bridge crucial for the receptor's transport to the plasma membrane. This sugar bridge stabilizes the receptor structure and is essential for proper cell surface expression (Siupka2015A). Additionally, WSB-1, a novel molecule containing WD-40 repeats and a SOCS-box domain, interacts with the intracytoplasmic region of IL21R. WSB-1 enhances the maturation of IL21R from an N-linked glycosylated form to a fully glycosylated mature form, moderating its degradation (Nara2011WSB1).
