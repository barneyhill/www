# ERCC6L2

## Overview
ERCC6L2 is a gene that encodes the ERCC excision repair 6 like 2 protein, which is a member of the Snf2 family of helicase-like proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in DNA repair processes, particularly in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is crucial for repairing double-strand breaks in DNA. As an ATP-dependent DNA translocase, ERCC6L2 is involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and cell proliferation, thereby contributing to genomic stability. The protein is active in the cell nucleus, where it interacts with various RNA binding proteins and DNA repair factors, playing a role in RNA processing, mRNA elongation, and export. Additionally, ERCC6L2 is implicated in class switch recombination of lymphocyte immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, promoting antibody diversification. Mutations in the ERCC6L2 gene are associated with hematological disorders such as bone marrow failure and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining genomic integrity and cellular health (Tummala2018Genome; Liu2020ERCC6L2; Baccelli2023ERCC6L2related).

## Structure
ERCC6L2 encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes. The primary structure of the ERCC6L2 protein is defined by its specific amino acid sequence, which determines its functional properties. The secondary structure of the protein includes common motifs such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of ERCC6L2 describes its overall three-dimensional conformation, which is essential for its interaction with other molecules and its role in DNA repair.

The protein may also exhibit a quaternary structure, involving the assembly of multiple subunits, although specific details on this aspect are not provided. ERCC6L2 contains specific domains, such as helicase domains, which are critical for its function in unwinding DNA during repair processes. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the activity and function of the ERCC6L2 protein, potentially affecting its role in cellular processes.

Splice variant isoforms of ERCC6L2 may exist, leading to different protein forms with distinct functions. These isoforms can result in variations in the protein's structure and function, contributing to its versatility in DNA repair mechanisms.

## Function
The ERCC6L2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes, particularly in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is essential for repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. This protein is part of the Snf2 family of helicase-like proteins and functions as an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. It is involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and cell proliferation, contributing to genomic stability by facilitating the repair of DNA lesions (Liu2020ERCC6L2; Baccelli2023ERCC6L2related).

ERCC6L2 is active in the cell nucleus, where it interacts with various RNA binding proteins and DNA repair factors. It plays a role in RNA processing, mRNA elongation, and export, and helps resolve DNA-RNA hybrid structures, minimizing transcription-associated genome instability (Tummala2018Genome). The protein is also involved in class switch recombination (CSR) of lymphocyte immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, promoting antibody diversification by ensuring proper orientation-specific joining of DNA ends (Liu2020ERCC6L2).

In healthy cells, ERCC6L2's function is critical for maintaining transcriptional integrity and preventing genome instability, which is vital for proper cell cycle progression and overall cellular health (Tummala2018Genome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ERCC6L2 gene are associated with several hematological disorders, primarily bone marrow failure (BMF) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Biallelic germline mutations in ERCC6L2 can lead to defects in the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway, resulting in genome instability and mitochondrial dysfunction. This predisposes individuals to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML, particularly a high-risk subtype characterized by TP53 mutations and erythroid predominance, resembling AML M6 (Douglas2019ERCC6L2; Baccelli2023ERCC6L2related).

The ERCC6L2-related disease is marked by a high risk of progression to MDS and AML, with a specific variant, c.1424del, being enriched in the Finnish population and linked to M6 AML, an aggressive form of the disease (Baccelli2023ERCC6L2related). Patients with ERCC6L2 mutations often exhibit hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and transcription inhibitors, indicating compromised DNA repair capacity (Tummala2018Genome).

ERCC6L2 mutations also lead to increased formation of R loops, which are DNA-RNA hybrids that can compromise genome integrity if not properly resolved. This contributes to transcription-associated genome instability, further linking ERCC6L2 mutations to bone marrow failure and leukemogenesis (Tummala2018Genome). The clinical implications of these mutations are significant, as they pose challenges in treatment strategies and preemptive approaches for affected individuals (Baccelli2023ERCC6L2related).

## Interactions
ERCC6L2 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA repair and RNA processing. It interacts with DNA-PK, a key player in the DNA damage response, and is involved in transcription-associated DNA repair (Tummala2018Genome). ERCC6L2 also interacts with the SFPQ-NONO complex, which is involved in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), suggesting a role in forming a stable pre-ligation complex and stimulating end joining (Francica2020Functional). 

The protein is recruited to DNA damage sites independently of several other proteins, such as KU70 and XLF, and interacts with end-joining factors like MRI/CYREN in a DNA-independent manner (Liu2020ERCC6L2). ERCC6L2's interaction with SFPQ was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, indicating a direct interaction in the nucleus (Francica2020Functional). 

ERCC6L2 is also associated with RNA binding proteins involved in mRNA elongation and export, and it specifically binds to the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), helping resolve DNA-RNA hybrid structures and minimizing transcription-associated genome instability (Baccelli2023ERCC6L2related). These interactions highlight ERCC6L2's multifaceted role in maintaining genome stability and facilitating DNA repair processes.
