# B4GALT3

## Overview
B4GALT3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 3, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the formation of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains by catalyzing the transfer of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues, forming beta-1,4 linkages. These chains are integral components of various glycoconjugates, including N-glycans and O-glycans, which are essential for cellular functions such as communication, adhesion, and signaling (Hennet2002The; Sun2016B4GALT3). B4GALT3 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the diversity of oligosaccharide structures, impacting immune response and development (Hennet2002The; Sun2016B4GALT3). The gene's expression and activity have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (He2024Development; Wei2023Beta1).

## Structure
The B4GALT3 protein is a Type II transmembrane glycoprotein, characterized by a specific molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It begins with an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain consisting of four residues, followed by a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that anchors the protein in the membrane. The protein also features a stem region and a catalytic domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This catalytic domain contains four N-linked glycosylation sites, which are important for the protein's function and stability (Liao2016Identification).

The B4GALT3 protein is involved in the synthesis of glycoconjugates and saccharide structures, specifically in the formation of the first N-acetyllactosamine unit of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. This function is shared with other B4GALT proteins, although each has distinct roles in glycosylation processes (Liao2016Identification).

Post-translational modifications of B4GALT3 may include glycosylation, which is consistent with its role as a glycoprotein, and potentially phosphorylation, although specific details on phosphorylation are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and modifications are essential for its function in cellular processes such as invasion, proliferation, and metastasis in various cancers (Liao2016Identification).

## Function
B4GALT3 encodes the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 3, which is involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues, forming a beta-1,4 linkage, a critical step in the formation of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. These chains are components of N-glycans, O-glycans, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycan chains, which are essential for various cellular functions (Sun2016B4GALT3).

B4GALT3 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in glycosylation, a crucial post-translational modification process. This process is vital for cell-cell communication, adhesion, and signaling, impacting immune response and development (Hennet2002The; Sun2016B4GALT3). The enzyme's activity contributes to the diversity of oligosaccharide structures, which are important for maintaining cellular and molecular stability (Hennet2002The).

While the specific biological role of B4GALT3 in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, its involvement in glycan metabolism suggests it plays a significant role in the synthesis and modification of glycans, which are crucial for various cellular functions (Li2015Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the B4GALT3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, demonstrating its clinical significance. In cervical cancer, B4GALT3 is upregulated and contributes to oncogenic activities by promoting cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This upregulation is mediated by miR-27a, which enhances B4GALT3 expression, leading to increased tumor cell motility and invasive potential (Sun2016B4GALT3). 

In bladder cancer, B4GALT3 plays a contrasting role. It is targeted by miR-1247-3p, and its expression is modulated by circUBXN7, which acts as a sponge for miR-1247-3p. Silencing B4GALT3 in bladder cancer cells enhances cell viability and invasive capacity, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Liu2018Circular).

B4GALT3 is also associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including cervical squamous cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where its high expression correlates with tumor proliferation and metastasis (He2024Development; Wei2023Beta1). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
B4GALT3 (beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 3) is involved in glycosylation processes that affect protein interactions, particularly with integrins. In the context of human placenta, B4GALT3 modifies the glycosylation of β1-integrin, which plays a significant role in cell adhesion and invasion. This modification enhances cell adhesion to laminin and suppresses cell migration and invasion in trophoblast-like cells. The interaction is mediated through changes in glycosylation patterns, as demonstrated by the use of a β1-integrin-blocking antibody, which suppresses B4GALT3-enhanced cell adhesion (Liao2015β1).

In cervical cancer cells, B4GALT3 is upregulated by miR-27a, leading to increased β1-integrin levels. This upregulation enhances the stability of β1-integrin, suggesting a role for B4GALT3 in facilitating β1-integrin stability and affecting cell motility and invasion (Sun2016B4GALT3).

In the tumor immune microenvironment, B4GALT3 influences the glycosylation of integrin alpha-L (ITGAL), affecting T cell activity. B4GALT3 deficiency leads to altered glycosylation patterns, which enhance T cell activation and migration, contributing to tumor suppression (Wei2023Beta1). These interactions highlight the role of B4GALT3 in modulating integrin functions through glycosylation changes.
