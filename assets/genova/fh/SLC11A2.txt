# SLC11A2

## Overview
SLC11A2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 11 member 2, commonly referred to as DMT1 (Divalent Metal Transporter 1). This protein is a transmembrane transporter that plays a crucial role in the uptake and transport of divalent metal ions, particularly iron, across cell membranes. DMT1 is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains and functions as a proton-coupled symporter, facilitating the transport of Fe²⁺ ions in conjunction with protons. It is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the duodenum, erythroid cells, brain, and kidney, where it is essential for maintaining iron homeostasis. The protein's activity is vital for processes such as dietary iron absorption and the release of iron from endosomes during transferrin receptor-mediated uptake. Mutations in the SLC11A2 gene can lead to disorders of iron metabolism, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as anemia and neurodegenerative diseases (Montalbetti2013Mammalian; Gunshin2005Slc11a2a; Robertson2024Knockdown).

## Structure
The SLC11A2 gene encodes a protein known as DMT1, which is involved in the transport of divalent metal ions, particularly iron. The protein is composed of approximately 560-570 amino acids and has a native size of about 65 kDa. However, due to N-glycosylation, its expression in various cells is reported to be in the range of 90-100 kDa, which is necessary for its expression on the plasma membrane (Montalbetti2013Mammalian). 

SLC11A2 is predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs) with intracellular amino- and carboxyl-termini. These domains form a channel that facilitates the transport of metal ions across the cell membrane (Montalbetti2013Mammalian). The protein's structure includes a conserved hydrophobic core of 10 TMDs, which is crucial for H+-dependent metal transport (Montalbetti2013Mammalian). 

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are important for its function and localization (Neves2011Natural). Multiple isoforms of SLC11A2 exist due to alternative splicing, which affects its cellular localization and function (Neves2011Natural). The protein's structure is characterized by the LeuT fold, common to many secondary transporters, which provides selective transition-metal transport (Bozzi2021Molecular).

## Function
SLC11A2, also known as DMT1, is a critical protein involved in iron metabolism. It functions as a divalent metal ion transporter, primarily facilitating the uptake of Fe²⁺ ions across cell membranes. This protein is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the proximal duodenum, immature erythroid cells, brain, and kidney, where it plays a vital role in maintaining iron homeostasis (Montalbetti2013Mammalian; Gunshin2005Slc11a2a).

In the duodenum, SLC11A2 is located on the apical membrane of enterocytes, where it mediates the absorption of dietary iron. It is also active in endosomal membranes, where it transports iron from endosomes to the cytosol during transferrin receptor-mediated uptake, a process crucial for erythroid precursor cells to acquire iron for hemoglobin synthesis (Montalbetti2013Mammalian; Gunshin2005Slc11a2a).

SLC11A2 operates as a proton-coupled symporter, with a 1:1 stoichiometry for Fe²⁺ and H⁺ transport, although under certain conditions, Fe²⁺ transport can occur uncoupled from H⁺. This protein's activity is essential for normal iron homeostasis, as evidenced by severe iron-deficiency anemia in models lacking SLC11A2 (Montalbetti2013Mammalian; Gunshin2005Slc11a2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC11A2 gene, also known as DMT1, are associated with several iron metabolism disorders. These mutations can lead to hypochromic microcytic anemia, characterized by impaired iron absorption and utilization. In particular, the G185R mutation in the Belgrade rat and similar mutations in humans result in defective iron transport, causing anemia and iron overload in the liver (Montalbetti2013Mammalian; Gunshin2005Slc11a2a). The G75R mutation affects the trafficking and subcellular localization of the DMT1 protein, leading to its accumulation in lysosomes and reduced protein levels, which contributes to anemia (RomeroCortadellas2022New).

Alterations in SLC11A2 expression can also impact iron homeostasis and are implicated in conditions like iron-refractory iron-deficiency anemia (IRIDA), particularly following bariatric surgery. Mutations such as 1285G-C and 1246C-T have been linked to this condition, affecting the conformation and function of the DMT1 protein (PIATTO2022DOES). In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, increased expression of SLC11A2 in microglia has been observed in Alzheimer's disease, contributing to iron accumulation and inflammation, which may exacerbate disease progression (Robertson2024Knockdown). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLC11A2 in various iron-related disorders.

## Interactions
SLC11A2, also known as DMT1, is involved in the transport of divalent metal ions, particularly iron, across cell membranes. It interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its function in metal ion homeostasis. One significant interaction is with the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which facilitates iron uptake by endocytosis of the transferrin-iron complex. This interaction is essential for the release of iron from transferrin within endosomes, where SLC11A2 transports the iron into the cytoplasm (Illing2012Substrate).

SLC11A2 is also part of a network of protein interactions involving ATP7A, a copper-transporting ATPase. ATP7A interacts with SLC11A2, SLC31A2, and ATOX1, suggesting that SLC11A2 may be involved in broader metal ion transport and homeostasis beyond iron alone (Kavian2023Association). These interactions highlight the role of SLC11A2 in maintaining cellular metal ion balance and its potential involvement in various physiological and pathological processes related to metal ion transport.
