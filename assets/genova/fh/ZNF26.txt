# ZNF26

## Overview
ZNF26 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 26, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 26 is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology, where it has been associated with cell cycle regulation and proliferation. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZNF26 expression is notably upregulated and correlates with poor patient prognosis, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene (Liu2021Identification). The protein's interactions with cell cycle-related proteins such as CDK2, CCNE2, CDK6, and CHEK1 further underscore its involvement in promoting cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation (Liu2021Identification). Additionally, ZNF26's expression is influenced by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and microRNA interactions, highlighting its complex regulatory network within the cell (Liu2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF26 has been identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC). High expression levels of ZNF26 are associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Liu2021Identification). The gene is significantly upregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, and its expression is positively correlated with cell cycle-related proteins such as CDK2, CCNE2, CDK6, and CHEK1, which are involved in promoting cell proliferation (Liu2021Identification). Knockdown experiments in CRC cell lines have shown that reducing ZNF26 expression inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation, suggesting that ZNF26 plays a role in regulating the cell cycle by affecting the transition between the G1 and S phases (Liu2021Identification).

The study also highlights the involvement of ZNF26 in epigenetic regulation, as its expression is negatively correlated with DNA methylation in CRC (Liu2021Identification). These findings suggest that alterations in ZNF26 expression or its interactions with other cellular components can significantly impact CRC progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions. However, the study does not provide specific information on ZNF26 mutations or its role in diseases beyond CRC.

## Interactions
ZNF26, a zinc finger protein, is implicated in various interactions that influence cellular processes, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). It is positively correlated with cell cycle-related proteins such as CDK2, CCNE2, CDK6, and CHEK1, suggesting its role in promoting cell proliferation and progression through the cell cycle (Liu2021Identification). The study by Liu et al. indicates that ZNF26's high expression is associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients, and its knockdown results in inhibited cell proliferation and changes in cell cycle phase distribution, specifically an increase in the G1 phase and a decrease in the S phase (Liu2021Identification).

Bioinformatic analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses, have identified genes positively associated with ZNF26 that are enriched in pathways like Herpes simplex virus 1 infection and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Liu2021Identification). These interactions suggest that ZNF26 may participate in multiprotein complexes or engage in transient interactions that modulate gene expression and cellular processes. The study also explores potential mechanisms for ZNF26's abnormal expression, including DNA methylation and microRNA interactions, indicating that downregulated miRNAs in CRC are associated with the upregulation of ZNF26 (Liu2021Identification).
