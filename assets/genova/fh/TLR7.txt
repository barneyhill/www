# TLR7

## Overview
TLR7, or Toll-like receptor 7, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein involved in the innate immune response. The protein, also referred to as Toll-like receptor 7, is a member of the Toll-like receptor family, which plays a pivotal role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLR7 is primarily expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells, where it recognizes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) from viruses, thereby initiating immune responses crucial for antiviral defense. Structurally, TLR7 is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs in its extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain in the cytoplasmic region, which are essential for its function and signaling (Wei2009Homology; Asami2021Structural). The gene's location on the X chromosome and its involvement in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, highlight its clinical significance, particularly in the context of gene dosage effects and immune regulation (Deane2007Control; Souyris2018Female).

## Structure
TLR7 is a type I transmembrane protein involved in the innate immune response, characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs in the extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain, and a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain in the cytoplasmic region (Wei2009Homology; Asami2021Structural). The ECD of TLR7 forms a horseshoe-shaped structure composed of multiple LRRs, which are crucial for ligand recognition and receptor dimerization (Asami2021Structural). TLR7 contains a unique Z-loop insertion within its LRRs, which is important for receptor maturation (Asami2021Structural).

The protein can exist in open (inactive) and closed (active) conformations, with ligand binding inducing the closed form necessary for signaling (Tojo2020Structural; Asami2021Structural). TLR7 has two distinct ligand-binding sites: Site 1, conserved between TLR7 and TLR8, is essential for receptor dimerization, while Site 2 enhances the binding affinities of Site 1 ligands (Zhang2018Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, occur on the insertion-free faces of the ECD, although these glycans are nonfunctional for ligand binding (Wei2009Homology).

The quaternary structure involves homodimerization, which is essential for its functional activity (Asami2021Structural). The structural dynamics and interactions of TLR7 are regulated by associated proteins like Unc93B1 and syntenin-1, which influence its trafficking and signaling (Asami2021Structural).

## Function
TLR7 (Toll-like receptor 7) is a crucial component of the innate immune system, primarily expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and B cells. It recognizes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) from viruses, triggering immune responses that are vital for antiviral defense. Upon activation by ssRNA, TLR7 initiates a MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, leading to the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are essential for controlling viral infections (Diebold2004Innate; Lund2004Recognition).

TLR7 is located in endosomal compartments, where it detects viral RNA introduced into the cell via endocytosis. This recognition process is critical for the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which produce high levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) in response to viral infections (Diebold2004Innate). The activation of TLR7 also enhances the expression of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, as well as T cell co-stimulatory capacity, which are important for adaptive immunity (Birmachu2007Transcriptional).

In addition to its role in antiviral defense, TLR7 activation can modulate immune responses by inducing anergy in CD4+ T cells, preventing their proliferation and cytokine secretion. This mechanism may contribute to immune regulation during chronic viral infections (DominguezVillar2014TLR7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TLR7 gene are implicated in several autoimmune diseases, most notably systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). TLR7 is located on the X chromosome, and its increased gene dosage, such as through duplication or escape from X chromosome inactivation, is associated with a higher risk of developing SLE, particularly in females (Souyris2018Female). Overexpression of TLR7 can lead to spontaneous autoimmunity, characterized by the production of autoantibodies against RNA-related antigens, and is linked to severe inflammatory responses and conditions like splenomegaly and anemia (Deane2007Control; Christensen2006Toll-like).

In murine models, TLR7 overexpression results in a lupus-like syndrome, while TLR7 deficiency is protective against autoimmunity, reducing the severity of symptoms such as kidney disease and increasing survival rates (Deane2007Control; Christensen2006Toll-like). The Yaa locus, which includes a duplication of TLR7, exacerbates lupus-like syndromes by promoting B cell activation and autoantibody production (Pisitkun2006Autoreactive). Additionally, genetic variations in TLR7, such as the SNP rs3853839, are associated with SLE susceptibility and various clinical manifestations, including arthritis and photosensitivity (Wang2014Genetic). These findings underscore the critical role of TLR7 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate its role in the immune response. TLR7 interacts with the MyD88 adaptor protein, forming a complex known as the Myddosome, which is essential for downstream signaling and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-12p40 (Javmen2019Frontline). The TIR domains of TLR7 are crucial for these interactions, allowing the recruitment of adapter proteins necessary for signal transduction (Asami2021Structural).

TLR7 also interacts with the chaperone protein Unc93B1, which is vital for its trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the endolysosome. Unc93B1 maintains TLR7's stability and regulates its signaling by remaining associated with it in the endolysosome, where it restricts TLR7 signaling through syntenin-1, a negative regulator (Asami2021Structural).

Additionally, TLR7 forms a signaling complex with solute carrier SLC15A4 and TASL, which is crucial for TLR7-mediated responses and the activation of IRF5, highlighting the role of endosomal compartments as signaling platforms (Asami2021Structural). These interactions underscore the complex regulatory mechanisms that control TLR7 activity and its role in immune signaling.
