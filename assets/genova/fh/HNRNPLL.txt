# HNRNPLL

## Overview
The HNRNPLL gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L-like (hnRNPLL) protein, a member of the RNA-binding protein family that plays a pivotal role in RNA processing, particularly in alternative splicing and mRNA stability. This protein is characterized by its four RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, which facilitate its interaction with specific RNA sequences and influence gene expression. hnRNPLL is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is integral to the regulation of lymphocyte homeostasis and differentiation, especially within T and B cells, which are vital components of the adaptive immune system. It is notably involved in the alternative splicing of CD45 mRNA, a process crucial for T cell maturation and function, and in the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. Additionally, hnRNPLL has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in the regulation of CD44 splicing during epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer, where it acts as a metastasis suppressor (Sakuma2017HNRNPLL; Oberdoerffer2008Regulation; Chang2016RNA‐binding).

## Structure
The HNRNPLL gene encodes the hnRNP LL protein, which is composed of four RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains. These domains are organized in tandems, specifically RRM1 and RRM2, and RRM3 and RRM4, separated by unstructured linkers (Lannes2017Interaction). The N-terminal region of hnRNP LL is unstructured and contains serine- and glycine-rich regions (Lannes2017Interaction). The RRM1 and RRM2 domains are responsible for binding to the BCL2 promoter i-motif DNA sequence, with RRM3 and RRM4 showing no binding capacity (Lannes2017Interaction). 

The secondary structure of the RRM domains includes β-sheets and α-helices, which are typical of RRM folds (Lannes2017Interaction). The tandem construct RRM12, which includes RRM1 and RRM2, shows a conserved secondary and tertiary structure similar to known structures of murine RRM1 and RRM2 (Lannes2017Interaction). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate the function of hnRNP LL, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided. Alternative splicing may produce different isoforms, potentially affecting the protein's role in cellular processes.

## Function
The HNRNPLL gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L-like (hnRNPLL) protein, which plays a critical role in RNA processing, particularly in alternative splicing and mRNA stability. hnRNPLL is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cellular responses. It is a key regulator of lymphocyte homeostasis and differentiation, especially in T and B cells, which are essential components of the adaptive immune system (Chang2016RNA‐binding).

In T cells, hnRNPLL is involved in the regulation of CD45 alternative splicing, a process crucial for the transition from naïve to memory T cells. It induces the skipping of specific exons in the CD45 mRNA, affecting the expression of different CD45 isoforms, such as CD45RO, which is associated with memory T cells (Oberdoerffer2008Regulation; Cho2014The). This splicing regulation is mediated through hnRNPLL's binding to CA repeat elements and other motifs within introns and 3' UTRs of mRNAs (Chang2015RNA-binding).

hnRNPLL also plays a role in B-cell to plasma-cell differentiation by regulating the splicing of immunoglobulin heavy chain mRNA, influencing the balance between membrane-associated and secreted forms (Chang2016RNA‐binding). Its expression is upregulated in activated T cells and plasma cells, highlighting its importance in immune cell function and differentiation (Chang2016RNA‐binding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HNRNPLL gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of immune cell function and cancer. In colorectal cancer, HNRNPLL acts as a metastasis suppressor by regulating the alternative splicing of CD44 during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Downregulation of HNRNPLL is associated with increased expression of CD44 variable exons, such as CD44v6, which correlates with poor prognosis and enhanced metastatic potential in colorectal cancer cells (Sakuma2017HNRNPLL).

In the immune system, HNRNPLL is crucial for the alternative splicing of CD45 pre-mRNA in T cells, influencing the expression of different CD45 isoforms that are essential for T cell activation and function. Mutations in HNRNPLL can lead to defects in T cell survival and function, as seen in studies where altered splicing of genes like Senp2 affects T cell lifespan (Cho2014The). Although HNRNPLL mutations do not significantly impact B-cell development, they can affect certain aspects of B-cell differentiation, such as germinal center B cell formation, due to extrinsic effects on T-cell help (Yabas2021Loss).

## Interactions
HNRNPLL interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and regulation. It is involved in the regulation of CD45 alternative splicing in T and B cells by associating with CD45 transcripts, specifically exon 4 sequences. This interaction is demonstrated through RNA-immunoprecipitation and quantitative RT-PCR, showing that hnRNPLL physically interacts with CD45 transcripts (Oberdoerffer2008Regulation).

In colorectal cancer, HNRNPLL binds to CD44 pre-mRNA, influencing the expression of variable exons during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This binding affects the splicing of CD44, particularly the CD44v6 isoform, which is associated with cancer progression (Sakuma2017HNRNPLL).

HNRNPLL also interacts with the BCL2 promoter i-motif DNA sequence. The RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of hnRNP LL, specifically RRM1 and RRM2, bind to the i-motif DNA, potentially leading to transcriptional activation of the BCL2 gene. This interaction involves the unfolding of the i-motif structure, which may influence gene expression regulation (Roy2016Interaction; Lannes2017Interaction).

HNRNPLL competes with hnRNP L in the splicing regulation of the CHRNA1 gene. It enhances exon inclusion by outcompeting hnRNP L for binding to specific RNA sequences, highlighting its role in modulating splicing events (Rahman2013HnRNP).
