# COL22A1

## Overview
The COL22A1 gene encodes the collagen type XXII alpha 1 chain, a protein belonging to the Fibril-Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple helices (FACIT) family. This protein is characterized by its unique triple helix structure, which is essential for its role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissue junctions. Collagen type XXII is predominantly localized at critical junctions such as the myotendinous junctions in skeletal and cardiac muscle, the articular cartilage-synovial fluid interface, and the dermal-epidermal junction in the skin. It functions as a cell adhesion ligand, interacting with integrins and other extracellular matrix components to stabilize these junctions. The protein is also involved in bone remodeling and fibrotic processes, highlighting its multifaceted role in tissue architecture and disease (Charvet2013Knockdown; Koch2004A; Watanabe2019A).

## Structure
The COL22A1 gene encodes the collagen type XXII alpha 1 chain, a member of the FACIT (Fibril-Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple helices) collagen family. The protein is characterized by a triple helix structure, typical of collagens, which is formed by three polypeptide chains. The primary structure of collagen type XXII includes Gly-X-Y repeats, where X and Y are frequently proline and hydroxyproline, contributing to the stability of the triple helix (Charvet2013Knockdown).

The secondary structure involves alpha helices, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds. The tertiary structure is further stabilized by these bonds, allowing the protein to maintain its functional conformation. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of these triple helices into a larger, functional protein complex (Charvet2013Knockdown).

Post-translational modifications such as hydroxylation and glycosylation are common in collagen proteins, enhancing their stability and function. The COL22A1 protein also contains specific domains, including collagenous and non-collagenous domains, which are crucial for its role in tissue architecture and integrity (Charvet2013Knockdown). These structural features enable COL22A1 to contribute to the stability of tissue junctions, such as the myotendinous junction in muscles.

## Function
The COL22A1 gene encodes collagen type XXII alpha 1 chain, a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissue junctions. It is a member of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices) protein family and is specifically localized at tissue junctions such as the myotendinous junctions in skeletal and heart muscle, the articular cartilage-synovial fluid junction, and the border between the anagen hair follicle and the dermis in the skin (Koch2004A). Collagen XXII is deposited in the basement membrane zone of these junctions and is associated with the extrafibrillar matrix in cartilage, acting as a cell adhesion ligand for skin epithelial cells and fibroblasts (Koch2004A).

In muscle tissue, COL22A1 is involved in the stabilization and maintenance of muscle attachments, contributing to efficient transmission of contractile forces. It interacts with the integrin α7β1 linkage system, which is essential for muscle fiber attachment to the extracellular matrix (Charvet2013Knockdown). The protein is also expressed in osteoblasts, where it is implicated in bone remodeling, particularly in maintaining trabecular bone mass (Zhao2021Decreased). In the context of fibrosis, COL22A1 is upregulated by TGFβ and is involved in the fibroblast to myofibroblast transition, a key process in fibrotic responses (Watanabe2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the COL22A1 gene, which encodes collagen type XXII alpha 1 chain, have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In zebrafish, knockdown of the col22a1 gene results in a muscular dystrophy-like phenotype characterized by muscle fiber detachment, reduced contractile force, and impaired swimming ability. This phenotype is linked to defects in the myotendinous junction (MTJ), a critical structure for muscle attachment and force transmission. The study suggests that COL22A1 is essential for maintaining MTJ stability, and its disruption can lead to muscle weakness and detachment, akin to muscular dystrophy (Charvet2013Knockdown).

In humans, mutations in COL22A1 have been associated with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where they correlate with higher tumor mutation burden and poorer prognosis. These mutations are linked to immune-related signaling pathways and increased infiltration of immune cells, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses in cancer (Zhang2022COL22A1).

Additionally, COL22A1 has been associated with serum creatinine levels, an important marker for kidney function, indicating potential clinical significance in renal health (Pattaro2010A). These findings highlight the diverse roles of COL22A1 in various diseases and conditions.

## Interactions
COL22A1, encoding collagen type XXII alpha 1 chain, participates in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in tissue integrity. It is known to interact with components of microfibrils, such as fibrillins and collagens VI, rather than being directly associated with collagen-containing fibrils (Koch2004A). COL22A1 also binds to integrins, specifically integrins α1β1 and α2β1, which suggests a role in cell-matrix interactions (Koch2004A). 

In the context of muscle attachment, COL22A1 interacts with the integrin α7β1 linkage system, which is essential for muscle fiber attachment to the extracellular matrix. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the myotendinous junction (MTJ) (Charvet2013Knockdown). The protein is suggested to interact with integrin α7, laminin α2, and α-dystroglycan, which are key components of the MTJ linkage systems (Charvet2013Knockdown). 

In systemic sclerosis, COL22A1 is identified as a TGFβ-inducible gene, mediating fibroblast to myofibroblast transition, and is involved in the regulation of fibrosis-related genes such as ACTA2 (Watanabe2019A). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of COL22A1 in various tissue types and conditions.
