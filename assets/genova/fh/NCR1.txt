# NCR1

## Overview
NCR1 is a gene that encodes the natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 1, commonly referred to as NKp46, which is a transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. This receptor plays a crucial role in the immune system by mediating the recognition and destruction of virus-infected and tumor-transformed cells. NKp46 is characterized by its extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, which are essential for binding to various ligands, including viral hemagglutinins and tumor-associated molecules (Lai2012Role; Bottino2000The). The receptor's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are vital for its stability and ligand interactions (Glasner2015Identification). The expression and activity of NKp46 are tightly regulated by cytokines and transcription factors, ensuring its pivotal role in immune surveillance and homeostasis (Lai2012Role; Hudspeth2013Natural).

## Structure
The NCR1 protein, also known as NKp46, is a receptor primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. It features immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region, which are crucial for its function in recognizing and binding to ligands on target cells (Lai2012Role). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which significantly influence its stability and function. Specifically, O-glycosylations at threonine residues 222 and 225 are essential for its activity, particularly in recognizing influenza virus hemagglutinin and potentially tumor cells (Glasner2015Identification). These glycosylations are crucial for the protein's interaction with its ligands, highlighting their importance in NCR1's functional integrity (Glasner2015Identification).

The NCR1 protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its activity and interactions. The regulation of NCR1 expression is influenced by transcription factors such as RUNX3, which binds to specific motifs in the NCR1 promoter, enhancing its expression in NK cells (Lai2012Role). This regulation is crucial for maintaining the specific expression of NCR1 in NK cells, contributing to its role in the immune response.

## Function
The NCR1 gene encodes the NKp46 receptor, a critical component of the immune system, primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. NKp46 is involved in the recognition and elimination of tumor-transformed and virus-infected cells. It functions as a major activating receptor, capable of inducing cytotoxicity and cytokine release upon binding to its ligands, which include viral hemagglutinins and bacterial components (Bottino2000The; Barrow2019The). The receptor is characterized by two extracellular Ig-like domains and a transmembrane region that associates with ITAM signaling adaptors, facilitating signal transduction upon activation (Barrow2019The).

In healthy human cells, NKp46 plays a pivotal role in immune surveillance by mediating the clearance of cells lacking MHC class I molecules, such as certain tumor cells and pathogen-infected cells (Bottino2000The). Its expression is regulated by cytokines like IL-2, which modulate its activity and enhance its role in tumor eradication (Hudspeth2013Natural). The receptor's function is also influenced by interactions with inhibitory receptors and HLA class I molecules, ensuring a balanced immune response (Bottino2000The). NKp46's ability to recognize a broad range of ligands underscores its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and effective pathogen defense (Barrow2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NCR1 gene, which encodes the NKp46 receptor, have significant clinical implications. The C14R point mutation in the signal peptide of NCR1 impairs NKp46 surface expression, leading to its accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum. This mutation disrupts NK cell and innate lymphoid cell (ILC) function, affecting their ability to control tumor growth and metastasis, as evidenced by increased lung metastases in affected mice (Almeida2018A). 

Alterations in NCR1 expression are also linked to immune escape mechanisms in liver cancer. The upregulation of miR-544 in liver cancer patients leads to the downregulation of NCR1, reducing NK cell cytotoxicity and promoting tumor immune escape (Pan2018MiR544). 

In autoimmune diseases, NKp46 is implicated in type 1 diabetes, where its deficiency is associated with resistance to the disease, suggesting a role in the cytotoxicity of pancreatic β-cells (Barrow2019The). These findings underscore the importance of NCR1 in immune regulation and its potential impact on disease progression and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
NCR1, also known as NKp46, is a receptor on natural killer (NK) cells that participates in various interactions crucial for immune response. It interacts with signaling adaptor proteins such as CD3ζ and FcεRIγ through its transmembrane domain, which contains a positively charged arginine residue. These interactions are essential for the receptor's surface expression and activation signaling, leading to NK cell activation and cytokine secretion (Pazina2017Regulation; Barrow2019The).

NCR1 also engages with viral hemagglutinins, such as those from the influenza virus, facilitating the recognition and eradication of infected cells. This interaction is dependent on sialic acid and glycosylation, particularly O-glycosylations, which are crucial for the receptor's ability to bind to viral hemagglutinin (Glasner2015Identification; Glasner2012Elucidating).

In addition to viral interactions, NCR1 recognizes ligands on tumor cells, contributing to the prevention of tumor metastasis. The receptor can bind to unknown ligands expressed by metastatic cell lines, leading to NK cell activation and degranulation, which are critical for controlling tumor spread (Glasner2012Recognition). These interactions highlight NCR1's role in immune surveillance against both viral infections and cancer.
