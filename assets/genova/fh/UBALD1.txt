# UBALD1

## Overview
UBALD1 is a gene that encodes the protein UBA-like domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a UBA-like domain, typically associated with binding ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, suggesting its potential involvement in ubiquitination pathways and protein degradation. UBALD1 has been implicated in cellular stress responses and inflammatory pathways, as evidenced by its interactions with proteins involved in these processes (Bertomeu2018A; Ramirez2021Epigenetics). The protein's interactions with mitochondrial malonyl coenzyme A decarboxylase, the 60S ribosomal subunit, and RNA polymerase II mediator subunit further underscore its diverse functional roles within the cell. Despite these insights, the precise biological functions and clinical implications of UBALD1 remain areas of active research.

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
UBALD1, also known as FAM100A, is a protein that participates in various interactions within the cell. It contains a UBA-like domain, which is typically involved in binding ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, suggesting a potential role in ubiquitination pathways or protein degradation processes. UBALD1 has been shown to interact with several proteins, including mitochondrial malonyl coenzyme A decarboxylase (MLYCD), the 60S ribosomal subunit RPL9, and the RNA polymerase II mediator subunit MED8. These interactions were identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen (Bertomeu2018A).

In a study using proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) and mass spectrometry, 49 statistically significant interactions for UBALD1 were identified, with 19 of these involving proteins previously annotated in stress response pathways (Bertomeu2018A). This highlights the potential involvement of UBALD1 in cellular stress responses.

Additionally, UBALD1 has been associated with IL-8 secretion and NF-kappa-B signaling, indicating a possible role in inflammatory pathways (Ramirez2021Epigenetics). However, the specific mechanisms and implications of these interactions remain to be fully elucidated.
