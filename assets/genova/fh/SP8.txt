# SP8

## Overview
SP8 is a gene that encodes the Sp8 transcription factor, a member of the Sp family of transcription factors characterized by zinc finger motifs. The Sp8 transcription factor plays a pivotal role in various developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system and limb development. It is crucial for the differentiation and migration of olfactory bulb interneurons and is involved in the regulation of neuroblast proliferation and survival. Additionally, Sp8 is implicated in osteoblast differentiation, with its expression being modulated by bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2). The gene's expression and function are conserved across multiple species, including humans, mice, and zebrafish. Clinically, alterations in SP8 expression have been linked to the progression of certain cancers, such as hepatoblastoma, where it contributes to tumor aggressiveness through pathways involving growth factors like FGF8 (Milona2004Genomic; Wagner2020SP8).

## Structure
The Sp8 transcription factor is a member of the Sp family of transcription factors, characterized by several distinct domains. The primary structure of Sp8 includes a sequence of 508 amino acids in the Sp8L isoform and 490 amino acids in the Sp8S isoform, with the latter lacking the first 18 residues (Milona2004Genomic). The protein contains an amino-terminal hydrophobic Sp-motif, a buttonhead box (BTD), and three classical Cys2-His2 zinc finger structures located towards the carboxy-terminal domain, which are crucial for DNA binding (Milona2004Genomic).

The secondary structure of Sp8 includes predicted alpha-helices within the amino-terminal domain A (residues 1-53) (Milona2004Genomic). The tertiary structure is not explicitly detailed in the available context, but the presence of zinc fingers suggests a folded conformation that facilitates DNA interaction. The quaternary structure is not described, indicating a lack of information on protein subunit interactions.

Sp8 is expressed in various human tissues, with higher expression in certain osteoblast-like cells, and its expression can be induced by BMP-2, suggesting a role in osteoblast differentiation (Milona2004Genomic). The Sp8 gene encodes two transcript variants, Sp8L and Sp8S, which are conserved across species such as mice and zebrafish (Milona2004Genomic).

## Function
The Sp8 transcription factor is a zinc finger protein that plays a critical role in the development and differentiation of olfactory bulb interneurons. It is expressed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the rostral migratory stream (RMS), where it regulates the survival, migration, and molecular specification of neuroblasts and interneurons. Sp8 is particularly important for the differentiation of calretinin-positive and non-dopaminergic GABAergic interneurons in the olfactory bulb, contributing to the diversity of these neuronal subtypes (Waclaw2006The).

Sp8 is involved in the proliferation of neuroblasts and acts as a terminal selector gene crucial for the long-term survival of calretinin-expressing periglomerular interneurons, which constitute a significant portion of olfactory bulb interneurons (Gaborieau2018A). The transcription factor is also essential for the correct migration of neuroblasts, as its absence leads to defects in both tangential and radial migration, resulting in increased apoptotic cell death in the SVZ, RMS, and olfactory bulb (Li2017Transcription).

In addition to its role in the brain, Sp8 is implicated in limb development and osteoblast differentiation, with its expression being induced by BMP-2, suggesting a role in mesenchymal differentiation (Milona2004Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SP8 gene have been implicated in the progression of hepatoblastoma (HB), a rare liver cancer in children. SP8 is identified as a transcription factor that, when upregulated, promotes an aggressive phenotype in HB by activating the growth factor FGF8. This upregulation is associated with the aggressive C2 subtype of HB and poor patient outcomes. SP8-induced FGF8 expression contributes to metastasis by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that enhances cell motility, self-renewal, migration, and invasion (Wagner2020SP8).

The study suggests that targeting SP8 could be a therapeutic strategy, as demonstrated by the anti-tumorigenic effects of the SP transcription factor inhibiting drug mithramycin A (MMA). MMA can inhibit SP8-induced effects in liver cancer cell lines, specifically by reducing colony formation and self-renewal in SP8-high expressing hepatoma cell lines (Wagner2020SP8). These findings indicate that SP8, through FGF8 activation, contributes to the aggressive nature of HB, suggesting a potential link between SP8 expression and tumor aggressiveness (Wagner2020SP8).

## Interactions
The SP8 transcription factor is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in developmental processes. SP8 binds to the Ccnd1 locus at regions of active chromatin, particularly at the promoter/exon1 region and exon 5, which includes part of the 3' UTR. This binding suggests that SP8 directly influences Ccnd1 expression, activating gene expression from the Ccnd1 Ex5 region (Borello2018SP8). SP8 also interacts with other transcription factors such as PAX6 and βcatenin. It counteracts the repressive effect of PAX6 on the Ccnd1 Ex1 fragment, indicating a competitive binding scenario (Borello2018SP8).

In the context of forebrain patterning, SP8 interacts with the Emx2 protein. Biochemical in vitro experiments have shown that SP8 can bind to the full-length Emx2 protein, which is important for the correct positioning of cortical domains along the anterior-posterior axis (Zembrzycki2007Genetic). SP8 also interacts with the Dlx family of transcription factors, particularly Dlx5, in the limb bud ectoderm. This interaction involves the ZF domain of SP8 and is necessary for its regulatory functions, although SP8 can act as both an activator and a repressor depending on the context (PérezGómez2020Sp8regulatory).
