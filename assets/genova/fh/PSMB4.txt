# PSMB4

## Overview
PSMB4 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit beta 4, a critical component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by PSMB4, categorized as a protease, plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by facilitating the breakdown of ubiquitinated proteins. This process is vital for regulating the cell cycle, modulating cellular stress responses, and ensuring proper cellular function. PSMB4 is integral to the assembly and activity of the proteasome complex, interacting with various proteins to influence proteasome function and cellular processes. Its involvement in protein turnover is significant in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with implications in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, where its expression levels can affect disease progression and prognosis (LÖSCHER2005Interaction; MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon; Larsson2022Pancancer).

## Structure
PSMB4, also known as the proteasome 20S subunit beta 4, is a component of the 20S core proteasome complex, which plays a crucial role in protein degradation. The primary structure of PSMB4 includes a specific sequence of amino acids, with a 45 amino acid-long N-terminal propeptide sequence that is processed during the assembly of the 20S proteasome (MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon). The secondary structure of PSMB4 consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function (Coux1996STRUCTURE).

In terms of tertiary structure, PSMB4 forms a compact, globular shape with a unique fingerlike shaped C-terminal region. This region intercalates between β subunits during the assembly of the 20S core proteasome, facilitating the dimerization of two half-proteasomes into the mature 20S particle (MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon). The quaternary structure of PSMB4 involves its integration into the cylindrical architecture of the proteasome complex, where it contributes to the proteolytic activities essential for protein degradation (Coux1996STRUCTURE).

Common post-translational modifications of PSMB4 may include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can influence its activity and interactions within the proteasome complex (Coux1996STRUCTURE).

## Function
PSMB4 encodes a subunit of the 20S core proteasome, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. This system is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and modulating various cellular processes. PSMB4, also known as the β7 subunit, is part of the β-ring of the 20S proteasome and is involved in the assembly of the proteasome complex (MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon). 

The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to protein turnover and cellular stress responses. It interacts with various proteins, including viral proteins and components of signaling pathways, suggesting a role in transducing external signals to internal protease activities (LÖSCHER2005Interaction). PSMB4's interaction with proteins like SNEV and Bassoon indicates its involvement in regulating proteasome activity and assembly, which is essential for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (LÖSCHER2005Interaction; MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon). 

In neurons, PSMB4 is implicated in controlling the abundance of presynaptic proteins, affecting synaptic function and potentially playing a role in neurodegenerative diseases (MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PSMB4 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and autoinflammatory syndromes. In the context of cancer, PSMB4 is frequently overexpressed and amplified in several cancer types, including breast, ovarian, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages, suggesting its role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy (Jiang2022Comprehensive; Larsson2022Pancancer). PSMB4 is also linked to adverse clinical outcomes in cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Li2021Integrated).

In the realm of autoinflammatory conditions, mutations in PSMB4 are associated with proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes (PRAAS), which include chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures (CANDLE) syndrome. These mutations can lead to a sterile type I interferon gene signature, a common pathological feature of PRAAS (Papendorf2023Identification). The interaction of PSMB4 with other proteins, such as Bassoon, also plays a role in neurodegenerative conditions, where its inhibition can lead to protein aggregation and neurodegeneration (MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon).

## Interactions
PSMB4, a β subunit of the 20S core proteasome, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in protein degradation and cellular processes. It interacts with the NS1 protein of the Influenza A virus (IAV), which is crucial for viral replication. This interaction facilitates the degradation of NS1, thereby suppressing IAV replication. PSMB4's interaction with NS1 does not significantly alter PSMB4 expression levels, but it does reduce NS1 protein levels, particularly in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Yang2022Cellular).

PSMB4 also interacts with the presynaptic scaffolding protein Bassoon (Bsn), which inhibits proteasome activity. This interaction affects the degradation of proteasomal substrates, suggesting a regulatory role of Bsn in proteasome activity through its binding to PSMB4. The interaction is significant in neurons, where Bsn fragments can normalize increased proteasome activity in Bsn-deficient mice (MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon).

Additionally, PSMB4 interacts with the U-box E3 ligase SNEV, a conserved interaction across species. SNEV does not accumulate upon proteasome inhibition, indicating it may escort substrates to the proteasome rather than being degraded itself (LÖSCHER2005Interaction).
