# MCCC2

## Overview
The MCCC2 gene encodes the beta subunit of the mitochondrial enzyme 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC), which is a member of the biotin-dependent carboxylase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the catabolism of the essential amino acid leucine, facilitating the conversion of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, a critical step in leucine degradation (L2016Biochemical; Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA). The protein product of MCCC2, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase subunit 2, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis, as it prevents the accumulation of toxic metabolites (Liu2023MCCC2). Mutations in the MCCC2 gene can lead to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency, a metabolic disorder with a variable phenotype (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA). Additionally, MCCC2 has been implicated in cancer biology, where it interacts with various proteins to influence pathways related to cancer progression, such as the P38 MAPK pathway in gastric cancer and telomere maintenance in colorectal cancer (Liu2023MCCC2; He2024ECHDC2).

## Structure
The MCCC2 gene encodes the beta subunit of the 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) enzyme, which is involved in leucine catabolism. The primary structure of the MCCC2 protein consists of a sequence of 438 amino acids, as determined in studies involving red seabream, which shows high homology to the human MCCC2 protein (Abe2004Isolation). The protein contains a carboxyltransferase (CT) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA).

The tertiary structure of MCCC2 is inferred from the crystal structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa MCC holoenzyme, which shares significant sequence identity with the human enzyme. This structure provides insights into the unique holoenzyme architecture of MCCC2 compared to other biotin-dependent enzymes (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA). The quaternary structure of the MCC enzyme is a heterododecamer, composed of six alpha and six beta subunits, with MCCC2 contributing to the beta subunits (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA).

Mutations in the MCCC2 gene can affect the protein's folding, stability, and function, particularly in the catalytic core and substrate binding regions, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA).

## Function
The MCCC2 gene encodes the beta subunit of the mitochondrial enzyme 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC), which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of the essential amino acid leucine. This enzyme is part of the biotin-dependent carboxylase family and is involved in the conversion of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, a key step in leucine degradation (L2016Biochemical; Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA). The beta subunit, encoded by MCCC2, contains the carboxyltransferase (CT) domain and is targeted to the mitochondria, where it contributes to energy production and metabolic homeostasis (L2016Biochemical; Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA).

In healthy human cells, MCCC2 is essential for maintaining normal mitochondrial activity and energy production, as it facilitates the breakdown of leucine and prevents the accumulation of toxic metabolites (Liu2023MCCC2). The proper function of MCCC2 is vital for preventing metabolic disorders, as mutations in this gene can lead to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency, characterized by the accumulation of organic acids due to impaired leucine catabolism (Liu2023MCCC2). This highlights the gene's importance in cellular metabolism and energy regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MCCC2 gene can lead to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency, a metabolic disorder characterized by developmental delay, feeding difficulties, and metabolic crises. This condition is caused by mutations in either the MCCC1 or MCCC2 genes, which encode the α and β subunits of the enzyme, respectively. The disorder presents with a highly variable phenotype, ranging from severe neonatal onset with neurological involvement to asymptomatic adults. Common biochemical markers include increased urinary levels of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid and 3-methylcrotonylglycine, as well as 3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine in blood and urine (Grünert20123methylcrotonylCoA).

Alterations in MCCC2 expression are also implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MCCC2 acts as an oncogene, promoting cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Its expression is upregulated in CRC tumor tissues, with the highest levels in metastatic tumors. High MCCC2 expression is associated with longer overall survival in CRC patients (Liu2023MCCC2). In prostate cancer, MCCC2 promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis, correlating with unfavorable clinical features such as lymph node metastasis and high Gleason scores (p&gt; MethylcrotonoylCoA; He2020&lt). In hepatocellular carcinoma, high MCCC2 expression is linked to poor prognosis and supports the oncogenic function of leucine (Chen2021MCCC2).

## Interactions
MCCC2, or methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase subunit 2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cancer progression. In gastric cancer cells, MCCC2 interacts with ECHDC2 and NEDD4. ECHDC2 binds with NEDD4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of MCCC2, which subsequently inhibits the P38 MAPK pathway and reduces aerobic glycolysis and proliferation in these cells (He2024ECHDC2).

In prostate cancer, MCCC2 is implicated in the GLUD1-p38 MAPK signaling pathway. It regulates GLUD1 protein expression, which is associated with cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This interaction suggests that MCCC2 plays a role in modulating the signaling pathways that contribute to cancer aggressiveness (p&gt; MethylcrotonoylCoA; He2020&lt).

In colorectal cancer, MCCC2 forms a complex with TRF2, a component of the shelterin complex involved in telomere maintenance. This interaction is crucial for telomere protection and may involve telomeric-repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), suggesting a potential MCCC2-TRF2-TERRA complex that could be important for telomerase recruitment to telomeres (Liu2023MCCC2). These interactions highlight MCCC2's role in mitochondrial regulation and telomere maintenance, contributing to its function as an oncogene in colorectal cancer.
