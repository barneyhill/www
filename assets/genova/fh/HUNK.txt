# HUNK

## Overview
HUNK (hormonally up-regulated Neu-associated kinase) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, signal transduction, and homeostasis. The HUNK protein plays a critical role in regulating epithelial cell proliferation and maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in tissues such as the intestinal epithelium and renal distal tubules. It acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation, thereby preventing uncontrolled cell growth and contributing to tissue homeostasis. HUNK is also implicated in cancer biology, where it interacts with key signaling molecules to influence cancer progression and metastasis, notably in breast and colorectal cancers. Its involvement in these pathways underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Sakai2007Expression; Han2023HUNK; Williams2019HUNK; Reed2015HunkMakv).

## Structure


## Function
HUNK (hormonally up-regulated Neu-associated kinase) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating cell proliferation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy cells, HUNK acts as a negative regulator of epithelial cell proliferation. This function is evident in the intestinal epithelium, where HUNK kinase deficiency leads to increased cell proliferation and migration, although normal intestinal physiology is maintained (Reed2015HunkMakv). HUNK is also expressed in the kidney, particularly in the distal tubules, where it suppresses proliferative responses. In renal distal tubular cells, overexpression of HUNK inhibits angiotensin II-induced c-fos gene transcription and transforming growth factor-β production, which are associated with reduced cell proliferation (Sakai2007Expression).

HUNK's activity is linked to its role in signal transduction pathways, influencing cellular metabolism and homeostasis. It is active in the cytoplasm and may interact with various signaling molecules to exert its regulatory effects. The protein's involvement in maintaining normal cellular growth and differentiation highlights its importance in preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation, which is crucial for tissue homeostasis and function (Sakai2007Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The HUNK gene, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a significant role in various cancers, particularly breast cancer. Alterations in HUNK expression are associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer. HUNK is implicated in promoting tumor cell survival by regulating apoptosis and autophagy, making it a potential therapeutic target to overcome resistance to HER2 inhibitors (Yeh2014Regulation; Yeh2011Hunk). In HER2/neu-induced mammary tumorigenesis, HUNK is necessary for maintaining the tumorigenic phenotype, and its inhibition leads to increased apoptosis and reduced tumor growth (Yeh2011Hunk).

HUNK also affects breast cancer metastasis by phosphorylating EGFR, which sustains signaling and promotes metastasis, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (Williams2019HUNK). In colorectal cancer, HUNK inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis through its interaction with GEF-H1, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Han2023HUNK). High HUNK expression correlates with HER2 amplification and poor outcomes, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer prognosis and therapy (RamosSolis2022HUNK).

## Interactions
HUNK (hormonally up-regulated Neu-associated kinase) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. In colorectal cancer cells, HUNK interacts with GEF-H1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, through specific amino acid sequences (58-320 of HUNK and 470-985 of GEF-H1). This interaction is crucial for HUNK's role in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by promoting RhoA activity, which subsequently activates the RhoA/LIMK-1/CFL-1 signaling pathway, stabilizing actin filaments and inhibiting EMT (Han2023HUNK). The interaction between HUNK and GEF-H1 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and pull-down assays, demonstrating a direct binding between the proteins (Han2023HUNK).

In breast cancer, HUNK phosphorylates the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) at threonine 654, enhancing EGFR stability and downstream signaling, which is associated with increased metastasis. This phosphorylation event is linked to higher stages of breast cancer and correlates with decreased overall survival in patients (Williams2019HUNK). HUNK's interaction with EGFR is critical for maintaining EGFR expression by impeding its ubiquitination and degradation, thus influencing cancer cell behavior (Williams2019HUNK).
