# HYAL4

## Overview
HYAL4 is a gene that encodes the protein hyaluronidase 4, a chondroitin sulfate-specific endo-β-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. This enzyme is distinct from other hyaluronidases as it does not degrade hyaluronic acid but specifically targets chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains, playing a critical role in the catabolism of CS in human cells (Kaneiwa2009Identification; Yamada2022Characterization). The HYAL4 protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, with a predicted glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor that may facilitate its localization to the cell surface (MaciejHulme2021New). It is involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Kaneiwa2009Identification). The expression of HYAL4 is tissue-specific, predominantly found in the placenta, skeletal muscle, and testis, indicating specialized roles in these organs (Kaneiwa2012Identification). Additionally, HYAL4 has been implicated in various cancers, where its mutations and altered expression contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (MaciejHulme2021New).

## Structure
The HYAL4 protein is encoded by the HYAL4 gene located on chromosome locus 7q31.3. It has two confirmed isoforms: a full-length variant consisting of 481 amino acids and a shorter variant with 349 amino acids. The full-length variant is predicted to be a transmembrane protein with cytoplasmic N- and C-termini and an extracellular catalytic domain. It also features a putative glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor at the C-terminus, which may remove the transmembrane domain, suggesting a role in cell surface localization (Yamada2022Characterization; MaciejHulme2021New).

The primary structure of HYAL4 includes potential phosphorylation sites at Y43, T88, and Y296, and an acetylation site at E193 near the catalytic residue E147. The protein also has four potential N-glycosylation sites, with a confirmed complex N-glycan at position 177 (MaciejHulme2021New). The major catalytic domain of HYAL4 resembles a (β/α)8 TIM barrel structure, which is crucial for substrate binding and hydrolytic degradation. The C-terminal domain, modeled using ab initio methods, indicates a novel fold and possibly a novel function (Jedrzejas2005Structures).

The shorter isoform lacks the C-terminal peptide linker and transmembrane domains, suggesting it is secreted. Both isoforms possess catalytic activity, with the full-length version preferring CS-D motifs and the shorter variant preferring CS-C motifs (MaciejHulme2021New).

## Function
HYAL4, or hyaluronidase 4, is a chondroitin sulfate-specific endo-β-N-acetylgalactosaminidase that plays a crucial role in the catabolism of chondroitin sulfate (CS) in human cells. Unlike other hyaluronidases, HYAL4 does not act on hyaluronic acid but specifically targets CS chains, breaking them down into smaller oligosaccharides (Kaneiwa2009Identification; Yamada2022Characterization). This enzymatic activity is essential for the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Kaneiwa2009Identification).

HYAL4 exhibits a preference for highly sulfated CS substrates, particularly those containing D units, which are known to have specific biological functions, such as promoting neurite outgrowth (Yamada2022Characterization). The enzyme is active in lysosomes, with an optimal pH of 4.5-5.0, but it may also function on the cell surface due to a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor (Kaneiwa2009Identification; Yamada2022Characterization).

The expression of HYAL4 is limited to specific tissues, including the placenta, skeletal muscle, and testis, suggesting specialized roles in these organs (Kaneiwa2012Identification). Its activity contributes to the regulation of CS-specific functions in tissues, potentially impacting processes like myogenesis and fertilization (Yamada2022Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
The HYAL4 gene is implicated in various cancers due to mutations and alterations in its expression. Mutations in HYAL4 have been identified in 12 out of 15 cancer types analyzed in the Cancer Genome Atlas project. Approximately 4% of endometrial tumors exhibit mutations in HYAL4 that disrupt protein structure. Other cancers with HYAL4 mutations include colorectal, stomach, lung, bladder, glioblastoma, leukemia, head and neck, ovarian, breast, and kidney cancers, with a prevalence of about 0.25-1.8% (MaciejHulme2021New).

In testicular cancer, there is an upregulation of HYAL4 protein, which is crucial for the proliferation of P53 negative human cancer cells. HYAL4's interaction with NEK4 is significant in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process essential for cancer cell migration and invasion (MaciejHulme2021New). In kidney cancer, increased HYAL4 mRNA expression is noted in clear cell renal cell carcinomas, correlating with metastasis. In bladder cancer, HYAL4 activity is linked to the release of CD44, MMP-9, and Akt signaling, associated with metastasis and patient mortality. The v1 protein variant of HYAL4 shows chemotherapeutic resistance, suggesting a role in chemoresistance (MaciejHulme2021New). These findings suggest that HYAL4 may be a novel target for cancer treatment.

## Interactions
HYAL4, also known as hyaluronidase 4, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with CD44, a stem cell marker and hyaluronic acid receptor. The novel splice variant of HYAL4, referred to as HYAL4-V1, interacts with CD44 by removing chondroitin sulfate from it, leading to the generation of soluble CD44 (sCD44). This interaction is crucial for the malignant functions of HYAL4-V1 in bladder cancer, as it promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis (Lokeshwar2020A).

HYAL4 also interacts with NEK4, a kinase involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is important in cancer development. NEK4 acts as a positive regulator for EMT, enhancing cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting that HYAL4 may contribute to cancer stem cell maintenance and therapeutic resistance (MaciejHulme2021New).

Additionally, HYAL4 has been identified to interact with proteins such as Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, spermatogenic (GAPDHS), Isoleucine tRNA Synthetase 2 (IARS2), and NIMA Related Kinase 4 (NEK4), although these interactions are speculative and not directly linked to chondroitin sulfate biology (MaciejHulme2021New).
