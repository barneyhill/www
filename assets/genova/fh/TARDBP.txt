# TARDBP

## Overview
TARDBP is a gene that encodes the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in RNA processing, including transcription regulation, splicing, and transport. TDP-43 is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family and is characterized by its two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a glycine-rich C-terminal domain, which are essential for its interaction with RNA and other proteins (Ayala2008Structural; FrançoisMoutal2019Structural). The protein is predominantly located in the nucleus but can shuttle to the cytoplasm, where it is involved in cellular stress responses and neuronal function (Makokha2019Regulation). TDP-43 is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), where it is a major component of pathological inclusions (Rutherford2008Novel; Van2008TARDBP). Mutations in TARDBP can lead to toxic gain-of-function effects, contributing to disease pathogenesis through altered RNA binding and protein aggregation (Rutherford2008Novel; Moreno2015A).

## Structure
TARDBP encodes the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein involved in RNA processing and associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and FTLD. The primary structure of TDP-43 consists of 414 amino acids. It features two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a glycine-rich C-terminal domain (CTD) (Ayala2008Structural; FrançoisMoutal2019Structural). The RRMs are crucial for binding to UG-rich RNA sequences, with RRM1 being essential for nucleic acid binding and RRM2 acting as a regulatory switch (Lukavsky2013Molecular; FrançoisMoutal2019Structural).

The secondary structure of TDP-43 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with the RRMs forming a 5-stranded beta sheet with two alpha helices (FrançoisMoutal2019Structural). The CTD contains a conserved, partially α-helical region crucial for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and protein-protein interactions (Conicella2020TDP43).

TDP-43 forms homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, and is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and cleavage (Ayala2008Structural; FrançoisMoutal2019Structural). These modifications, along with splice variant isoforms, influence its function and localization, contributing to its role in disease pathogenesis (Ayala2008Structural; FrançoisMoutal2019Structural).

## Function
The TARDBP gene encodes the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. TDP-43 is primarily located in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in RNA processing, including transcription regulation, splicing, and transport. It binds to UG-rich RNA sequences, which is crucial for maintaining RNA stability and regulating gene expression (Makokha2019Regulation; Baralle2021Characterization).

TDP-43 is involved in the regulation of transcription and pre-mRNA splicing, influencing the expression of various genes. It is known to autoregulate its expression through a negative feedback loop involving its 3'UTR, although it does not significantly modulate its own transcription (Baralle2021Characterization). The protein's activity is modulated by the presence of specific regulatory elements within the TARDBP gene, such as the 5'UTR and intron 1, which enhance transcriptional activity and mRNA stability (Baralle2021Characterization).

In addition to its nuclear functions, TDP-43 can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it may influence cellular stress responses and neuronal function. This shuttling ability is essential for its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes (Makokha2019Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TARDBP gene, which encodes the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), are implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). TDP-43 is a major component of the ubiquitinated inclusions found in these conditions, collectively known as TDP-43 proteinopathies (Rutherford2008Novel; Van2008TARDBP). In ALS, TARDBP mutations are found in approximately 3% of familial cases and 1.5% of sporadic cases, with certain mutations like p.A382T being particularly prevalent in specific populations, such as Sardinia (Lattante2013TARDBPandFUSMutations). These mutations often lead to a toxic gain of function, potentially through novel protein interactions or intracellular accumulation of TDP-43 fragments, which can result in apoptosis (Rutherford2008Novel).

TARDBP mutations have also been associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) without motor neuron disease, as seen with the N267S mutation, which creates a new phosphorylation site and reduces protein expression (Borroni2009Mutation). The pathogenic mechanisms of these mutations may involve disruptions in RNA binding and alterations in TDP-43 dynamics within the nucleus (Moreno2015A). These findings underscore the genetic heterogeneity and complex pathogenesis of TDP-43-related neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
TARDBP, also known as TDP-43, is a protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA metabolism and gene regulation. TDP-43 is part of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family and is involved in gene transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, and transport. It binds to RNA motifs, particularly (TG)n and a variant (TG)nTA(TG)m, and is enriched in genes related to synaptic function, RNA metabolism, and neuronal development (Sephton2011Identification).

TDP-43 forms high molecular mass complexes in both HeLa and rat brain nuclear extracts, indicating its association with RNA. It binds to exonic and intronic regions of genes, with a notable enrichment in 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) (Sephton2011Identification). TDP-43's nuclear interactome includes 25 co-precipitating proteins, many of which are RNA-binding proteins, splicing factors, and translation factors involved in RNA metabolism. Notable interactors include MECP2, SFRS1, and PTBP2, which are involved in RNA splicing and regulation (Sephton2011Identification).

Peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) interacts with TARDBP, influencing its function and assembly in hnRNP complexes. This interaction is crucial for mRNA processing and is linked to neurodegenerative diseases like ALS (Lauranzano2015Peptidylprolyl). PPIA's enzymatic activity is necessary for efficient interaction, and its depletion leads to TARDBP aggregation, highlighting its role as a disease modifier (Lauranzano2015Peptidylprolyl).
