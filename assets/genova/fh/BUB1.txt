# BUB1

## Overview
BUB1 is a gene that encodes the BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase, a crucial component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) in human cells. This kinase plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis by preventing the premature onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle microtubules. The BUB1 protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain with tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, essential for protein-protein interactions, and a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain responsible for phosphorylating key substrates such as CDC20. This phosphorylation activity is vital for inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), thereby maintaining genomic stability. BUB1's interactions with other checkpoint proteins, such as BubR1, Mad1, and Mad2, further underscore its role as a scaffold at the kinetochore, coordinating the recruitment of proteins essential for SAC function (Johnson2004Bub1; Kang2008Structure; BolanosGarcia2009The).

## Structure
The BUB1 protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain and a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain. The N-terminal region, spanning residues 29-230, features a series of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. These motifs form a right-handed superhelical structure composed of antiparallel alpha helices, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and specific salt bridges, such as between residues D56 and R106 (BolanosGarcia2009The). The TPR motifs are involved in binding to the kinetochore protein Blinkin, with conserved motifs like GN/DD and GIG playing a critical role in this interaction (BolanosGarcia2009The).

The kinase domain of BUB1, located in the C-terminal region, adopts a canonical kinase fold with two lobes, where ATP binding and substrate recognition occur. This domain is essential for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) function, as it phosphorylates key substrates like CDC20 (Kang2008Structure). The N-terminal extension of the kinase domain is necessary for its activity, organizing the ATP-binding pocket and activation segment (Kang2008Structure).

BUB1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which are important for its function in the mitotic checkpoint. The protein also exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
The BUB1 gene encodes a spindle checkpoint kinase that plays a critical role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation during mitosis in human cells. BUB1 is essential for the spindle assembly checkpoint, a mechanism that prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the spindle microtubules. This is achieved through the phosphorylation of Cdc20, an activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), thereby inhibiting premature sister chromatid separation (Kang2008Structure).

BUB1 is active at the kinetochores, where it recruits other checkpoint proteins such as BubR1, Mad1, and Mad2, facilitating their localization and function. This recruitment is crucial for maintaining the spindle checkpoint and ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation (Johnson2004Bub1; Kang2008Structure). BUB1 also plays a unique role in chromosome congression, the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate, which is distinct from other checkpoint proteins (Meraldi2005A).

The kinase activity of BUB1 is necessary for its function, with its N-terminal extension and KEN boxes being critical for substrate recruitment and phosphorylation specificity (Kang2008Structure). Through these mechanisms, BUB1 contributes to genomic stability by coordinating multiple pathways that inhibit the APC/C and delay anaphase onset until proper chromosome alignment is achieved (Kang2008Structure).

## Clinical Significance
The BUB1 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromosome segregation and cell cycle regulation. Overexpression of BUB1 is linked to tumorigenesis in several cancers, including bladder cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, lymphoma, and ovarian cancer (Jiang2021BUB1). In bladder cancer, BUB1 interacts with the STAT3 signaling pathway, enhancing STAT3 activity and promoting cancer cell proliferation. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of STAT3, which is necessary for the expression of STAT3 target genes involved in cell survival and proliferation (Jiang2021BUB1). Pharmacological inhibition of BUB1 has been shown to suppress bladder cancer cell proliferation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Jiang2021BUB1).

In sarcomas, BUB1 overexpression is associated with poorer overall and disease-free survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker. The gene is involved in pathways related to cell cycle regulation and is linked to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy, contributing to cancer predisposition (Long2021Expression). In neuroblastoma, high BUB1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and is associated with processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell apoptosis, highlighting its role as an oncogene and prognostic biomarker (Song2022bub1).

## Interactions
BUB1 is a key component of the spindle assembly checkpoint and interacts with several proteins to ensure proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. It forms a complex with BUB3, which is crucial for its localization to the kinetochore. The interaction between BUB1 and BUB3 is mediated by a conserved domain within the NH2-terminal region of BUB1, specifically between amino acids 201-300, which is essential for kinetochore localization (Taylor1998The).

BUB1 also interacts with the kinetochore protein KNL1 through its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which bind to the KI motifs in KNL1. This interaction is important for the recruitment of BUB1 and BUBR1 to the kinetochore (Krenn2012Structural). Additionally, BUB1 interacts with Blinkin, a protein required for chromosome alignment and the mitotic checkpoint. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region of BUB1 and is crucial for its kinetochore recruitment (Kiyomitsu2007Human; BolanosGarcia2009The).

BUB1 also forms a complex with the Mad1-Mad2 complex, either directly or indirectly through CENP-E, to facilitate checkpoint signaling (SharpBaker2001Spindle). These interactions highlight BUB1's role as a scaffold at the kinetochore, coordinating the recruitment of various proteins essential for spindle checkpoint function.
