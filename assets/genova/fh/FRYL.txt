# FRYL

## Overview
FRYL is a gene that encodes the FRY like transcription coactivator protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation. The FRYL protein is characterized by its structural domains, such as the furry domain (FD) and leucine-zipper motifs, which facilitate its role as a transcription coactivator. These structural features enable FRYL to interact with other proteins, such as the Ldb1-Lhx1 complex, playing a crucial role in developmental processes like kidney development (Espiritu2018The). Clinically, alterations in FRYL expression have been associated with the progression of aggressive forms of prostate cancer and its involvement as a fusion partner in treatment-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia, highlighting its potential oncogenic role (Naidoo2021MicroRNA1205).

## Structure
The FRYL protein is a paralog of the fry gene and is found in vertebrates. It contains a furry domain (FD) composed of HEAT/Armadillo repeats, which are crucial for its function (Espiritu2018The). In addition to the FD, FRYL includes two leucine-zipper motifs and a coiled-coil structure in the C-terminal region, with five less conserved regions interspersed between them. These structural features are highly conserved among vertebrates and play a role in mediating various cellular functions, including the repression of microRNA (miRNA) expression (Espiritu2018The).

The quaternary structure of FRYL is suggested by its ability to form complexes, such as with the Ldb1-Lhx1 complex, which is involved in kidney development (Espiritu2018The). The interaction between FRYL and the Lhx1-Ldb1 complex is facilitated by the C-terminal leucine zipper/coiled coil domain (LZ) and the Furry domain (FD), which are thought to aid in FRYL's nuclear localization and transcriptional activity (Espiritu2018The). While specific details about the primary amino acid sequence are not provided, the presence of these domains and motifs implies a complex secondary and tertiary structure (Espiritu2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FRYL gene have been implicated in the progression of prostate cancer (PCa), particularly in its aggressive forms such as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Studies have shown that FRYL is significantly overexpressed in these aggressive prostate cancer types compared to benign prostate tumors, suggesting a potential role in the disease's advancement (Naidoo2021MicroRNA1205). The overexpression of FRYL in prostate cancer tissues compared to normal tissues indicates its involvement in tumor progression (Naidoo2021MicroRNA1205).

FRYL has also been identified as a fusion partner of the MLL gene in treatment-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), suggesting its potential oncogenic role in various cancers, including PCa and ALL (Naidoo2021MicroRNA1205). The gene's transcriptional activation properties further indicate its role as a transcription factor and potential fusion partner in cancer progression (Naidoo2021MicroRNA1205).

In the context of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) associated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) resistance, FRYL is overexpressed, although its knockdown does not significantly affect NED, indicating that its role in this process may be limited (Naidoo2021MicroRNA1205). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FRYL in cancer, particularly in prostate cancer.
