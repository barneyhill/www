# LAIR2

## Overview
Leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 2 (LAIR2) is a gene that encodes a soluble protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The LAIR2 protein functions primarily as a receptor and plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses. Unlike its homolog LAIR1, which is a membrane-bound receptor, LAIR2 lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, classifying it as a secreted protein. It acts as a decoy receptor by binding to collagen with higher affinity than LAIR1, thereby preventing LAIR1 from interacting with collagen and inhibiting immune cell activation. This mechanism is significant in various physiological processes, including placental development and immune regulation at the maternal-fetal interface, as well as in pathological conditions such as autoimmune diseases and cancer (Nordkamp2011Enhanced; Ramos2020Cancer; Meyaard1997LAIR1).

## Structure
LAIR2 is a soluble protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and contains one immunoglobulin-like domain. It shares approximately 84% homology with the extracellular region of LAIR1, another member of the same family, but lacks both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, indicating its role as a secreted protein (Wang2023Dissecting; Meyaard1997LAIR1). LAIR2 is known to bind collagen with higher affinity than LAIR1, acting as a decoy receptor to modulate immune responses by preventing LAIR1 from interacting with collagen (Ramos2020Cancer; Lebbink2009Identification).

The protein is encoded by the LAIR2 gene, which produces two main isoforms, LAIR2a and LAIR2b, with molecular weights of approximately 18 kDa and 15 kDa, respectively. These isoforms contain one immunoglobulin-like domain each. A third variant, LAIR2c, does not encode an intact immunoglobulin-like domain (Founds2010LAIR2). LAIR2 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common for proteins in the immunoglobulin superfamily, although specific modifications for LAIR2 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
LAIR2 (leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 2) is a soluble receptor that plays a significant role in immune regulation by modulating the activity of immune cells. It functions primarily as an antagonist to LAIR1, an inhibitory receptor that binds to collagen and is expressed on various immune cells. By competing with LAIR1 for collagen binding, LAIR2 prevents the inhibitory signaling that would otherwise suppress immune cell activation, thereby maintaining an active immune response (Nordkamp2011Enhanced; Camargo2015Differential).

In the context of placental development, LAIR2 is expressed by extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) and is involved in the remodeling of maternal spiral arterioles. This remodeling is crucial for ensuring adequate maternal blood flow to the placenta, which is essential for fetal development. LAIR2's expression in EVTs suggests it plays a role in modulating immune interactions at the maternal-fetal interface, potentially by antagonizing LAIR1 on leukocytes, thus maintaining immune tolerance during pregnancy (Founds2013LAIR2expressing; Apps2011Genomewide).

LAIR2 is also thought to coat the extracellular matrix, particularly collagen, preventing LAIR1-expressing cells from interacting with collagen. This action helps maintain the activation of decidual leukocytes, such as NK cells, at sites of EVT invasion, which is crucial for successful placentation (Founds2010LAIR2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LAIR2 gene have been associated with several autoimmune diseases and conditions. In pemphigus foliaceus (PF), an autoimmune blistering skin disease, certain polymorphisms in the LAIR2 gene are linked to increased susceptibility. Specifically, the SNP rs2287828 is associated with higher LAIR2 mRNA levels and increased risk of PF, suggesting a genetic dominance of susceptibility associated with the presence of the T allele (Camargo2015Differential).

LAIR2 expression is also implicated in hypothyroidism. The rs2287828 variant is associated with a higher risk of both clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism, with increased LAIR2 mRNA and protein levels observed in affected patients (Elsayed2023Association).

In cutaneous T cell lymphoma, LAIR2 is identified as a marker of resistance to histone deacetylase inhibitors, with elevated expression levels in resistant cases. This suggests that LAIR2 may contribute to disease progression by promoting T cell activation and migration (Andrews2019Novel).

In rheumatoid arthritis, increased levels of LAIR2 in synovial fluid and urine suggest its role in ongoing synovial activation and tissue destruction, potentially serving as a biomarker for inflammation (Nordkamp2011Enhanced).

## Interactions
LAIR2, a soluble member of the Ig-like receptor family, primarily interacts with collagen, a major component of the extracellular matrix. This interaction is significant in various physiological and pathological contexts. LAIR2 binds to collagen with higher affinity than its homologue LAIR-1, acting as a decoy receptor that can modulate immune responses by antagonizing the inhibitory effects of LAIR-1 on immune cells (Nordkamp2011Enhanced; Ramos2020Cancer). 

In the context of platelet function, LAIR2/Fc has been shown to inhibit collagen-induced platelet activation and adhesion. It specifically interferes with the binding of collagen to Glycoprotein VI (GpVI) and von Willebrand factor (VWF), crucial components in platelet-collagen interactions, without affecting the interaction between collagen and integrin a2b1 (Lenting2010Efficient). 

In cancer immunotherapy, LAIR2 is utilized in the form of NC410, a LAIR-2 Fc fusion protein, which blocks the interaction between LAIR-1 and collagen. This blockade is particularly beneficial in tumors with an immune-excluded phenotype, as it enhances T cell expansion and cytotoxic activity by preventing immune cell sequestration in collagen-rich tumor stroma (Ramos2020Cancer). 

In rheumatoid arthritis, LAIR2 is a more efficient antagonist of the LAIR-1-collagen interaction than soluble LAIR-1, suggesting its role in modulating immune responses in inflammatory conditions (Nordkamp2011Enhanced).
