# MRGPRX3

## Overview
MRGPRX3 is a gene that encodes the MAS related GPR family member X3, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various physiological processes. GPCRs are a large family of transmembrane receptors that play crucial roles in cellular signal transduction by responding to a variety of external stimuli. The protein encoded by MRGPRX3 is implicated in modulating sensory perception and has been studied for its potential role in pain and itch signaling pathways. Understanding the function and interactions of MRGPRX3 can provide insights into its clinical significance, particularly in the context of developing therapeutic targets for conditions related to sensory dysfunction.
