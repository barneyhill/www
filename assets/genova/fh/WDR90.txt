# WDR90

## Overview
WDR90 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 90 protein, which is integral to the structural integrity of centrioles, essential components of the cell's cytoskeleton involved in cell division and ciliogenesis. The protein is characterized by an N-terminal DUF667 domain and multiple WD40 repeats, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and microtubule binding (Steib2020WDR90; ValeraPérez2019WDR90). WDR90 is evolutionarily conserved and plays a critical role in stabilizing the microtubule triplets of centrioles, ensuring proper localization of inner core proteins such as POC5 and Centrin-2 (Steib2020WDR90). Additionally, WDR90 is involved in the NLRC4 inflammasome pathway, contributing to immune responses against pathogens like Salmonella Typhimurium (ValeraPérez2019WDR90).

## Structure
The WDR90 protein is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal DUF667 domain and multiple WD40 repeats. The DUF667 domain is homologous to the ciliary inner junction protein FAP20 and is responsible for binding to microtubules, a function conserved across species (Steib2020WDR90). The WD40 repeats form beta-propeller structures, which are common in proteins involved in protein-protein interactions (ValeraPérez2019WDR90). These structural motifs contribute to the protein's tertiary structure, facilitating its role in maintaining centriole architecture integrity (Steib2020WDR90).

WDR90 is suggested to form a homodimer, which may enhance its interaction with microtubules and tubulin (Steib2020WDR90). The protein is recruited to centrioles during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, coinciding with centriole elongation and the assembly of the inner central core (Steib2020WDR90). The DUF667 domain also interacts with free tubulin dimers, forming oligomers that bind to microtubules, indicating a dual binding capability similar to FAP20 (Steib2020WDR90). The WD40 domains are depicted as green boxes in molecular diagrams, highlighting their structural significance (ValeraPérez2019WDR90).

## Function
WDR90 is a centriolar microtubule wall protein crucial for maintaining the architectural integrity of centrioles, which are essential for cell division and the assembly of cilia and flagella. It localizes specifically to the central core region of centrioles and is evolutionarily conserved across species, including humans and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Steib2020WDR90). WDR90 plays a significant role in stabilizing the microtubule triplets that form the centriole structure, ensuring the proper localization of inner core proteins such as POC5 and Centrin-2, which are vital for microtubule triplet stability and overall centriole integrity (Steib2020WDR90).

The protein is recruited to centrioles during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, coinciding with procentriole elongation and the formation of the central and distal parts of the nascent procentriole (Steib2020WDR90). WDR90's interaction with microtubules is facilitated by its N-terminal DUF667 domain, which can bind to microtubules and potentially stabilize them, although the full-length protein may be subject to autoinhibition or interactions with other proteins (Steib2020WDR90). This stabilization is crucial for maintaining the cylindrical shape and integrity of centrioles, preventing structural abnormalities that could affect processes like ciliogenesis (Steib2020WDR90).

## Interactions
WDR90 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in maintaining centriole architecture and participating in immune responses. As a centriolar microtubule wall protein, WDR90 interacts with microtubules and tubulin dimers, potentially forming oligomers that bind to microtubules. This interaction is facilitated by its N-terminal DUF667 domain, which directly binds to microtubules and tubulin dimers, suggesting a conserved function across species (Steib2020WDR90).

In the context of the inflammasome pathway, WDR90 is identified as a component of the NLRC4 inflammasome, interacting specifically with the NLRC4 receptor. This interaction alters the cellular distribution of NLRC4, but not other inflammasome receptors like NLRP3 and AIM2, indicating a specific role in mediating inflammasome-dependent resistance to Salmonella Typhimurium infection (ValeraPérez2019WDR90).

WDR90 also interacts with centriolar proteins such as Centrin-2 and POC5, playing a role in their proper localization within the centriole. Depletion of WDR90 affects the localization of these proteins, highlighting its structural role in centriole integrity (Steib2020WDR90).
