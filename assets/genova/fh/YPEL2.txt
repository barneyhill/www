# YPEL2

## Overview
YPEL2 is a gene that encodes the protein yippee like 2, which is characterized by its highly conserved Yippee domain. This domain is integral to the protein's function, particularly in cellular stress response mechanisms, due to its zinc-finger-like metal-binding pocket that contributes to structural stability (Turan2023Dynamic). Yippee like 2 is categorized as a protein involved in oxidoreductase activity, playing a crucial role in oxidative stress protection and cellular stress signaling (Turan2023Dynamic). The protein is implicated in maintaining redox homeostasis and cellular proliferation by acting as a sensor for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and participating in RNA metabolic processes (Turan2023Dynamic). Yippee like 2's interactions with proteins such as ELAVL1 and SQSTM1 highlight its involvement in stress granule dynamics and RNA processing, underscoring its significance in cellular defense mechanisms (Turan2023Dynamic).

## Function
YPEL2 is involved in cellular stress surveillance and plays a critical role in maintaining redox homeostasis and cellular proliferation. It functions as a 'reader/sensor' for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is involved in the repair and removal of oxidized substrates, which is essential for cell survival (Turan2023Dynamic). The Yippee domain of YPEL2 contains cysteine pairs that may form a zinc-binding pocket, potentially involved in sequestering ROS (Turan2023Dynamic). YPEL2 interacts with various proteins involved in oxidative stress response, such as SQSTM1, which is involved in autophagy, and TARDBP, an RNA-binding protein, suggesting its role in preventing the aggregation of oxidized proteins (Turan2023Dynamic).

YPEL2 is also implicated in RNA metabolic processes, including RNA folding, mRNA maturation, stability, export, translation, and degradation (Turan2023Dynamic). It participates in the formation and disassembly of stress granules, which are crucial for cellular stress responses (Turan2023Dynamic). YPEL2's interactions with proteins like ELAVL1 and SQSTM1, and its localization to stress granules in response to oxidative stress, further highlight its role in cellular stress surveillance (Turan2023Dynamic). These functions suggest that YPEL2 is integral to cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress and in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the YPEL2 gene have been associated with various cancers, particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In ccRCC, YPEL2 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade, and higher expression levels are linked to better overall survival and disease-specific survival. This suggests that YPEL2 may function as a tumor suppressor, as its knockdown promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in ccRCC cell lines (Wang2022Comprehensive).

YPEL2 is also implicated in the immune microenvironment of ccRCC, with its expression positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. This indicates a potential role in tumor immunity (Wang2022Comprehensive).

In other cancers, YPEL2 expression is altered in papillary renal cell carcinoma and is significantly downregulated in pancreatic cancer, suggesting a broader role in tumor progression and metastasis (Wang2022Comprehensive).

Additionally, YPEL2 is involved in cellular stress responses, interacting with proteins that manage oxidative stress and RNA metabolic processes. These interactions may contribute to its role in cancer and stress-related conditions (Turan2023Dynamic).

## Interactions
YPEL2 is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular stress surveillance. It interacts with the RNA-binding protein ELAVL1 and the selective autophagy receptor SQSTM1. These interactions are significant in the context of stress granule (SG) formation and disassembly, particularly under oxidative stress conditions induced by sodium arsenite. YPEL2 co-localizes with ELAVL1 in cytoplasmic structures reminiscent of processing bodies or stress granules, and this interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays (Turan2023Dynamic). 

YPEL2 also interacts with proteins involved in RNA and mRNA metabolic processes, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, and regulation of gene silencing by miRNA. These interactions indicate YPEL2's involvement in RNA storage and processing, especially under stress conditions (Turan2023Dynamic). The protein's interaction partners include ADSS, EEF1D, G3BP1, ELAVL1, and SQSTM1, identified through mass spectrometry analyses and validated by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Turan2023Dynamic). 

The Yippee domain of YPEL2 is linked to oxidoreductase, RNA binding/hydrolase, and chaperone functions, suggesting potential roles in managing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining redox homeostasis (Turan2023Dynamic).
