# FRMPD4

## Overview
The FRMPD4 gene encodes the FERM and PDZ domain containing 4 protein, a neural scaffolding protein that plays a pivotal role in synaptic signaling and dendritic spine morphogenesis. This protein is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the cortex and hippocampus, where it is integral to cognitive functions and memory. The FRMPD4 protein is characterized by its N-terminal WW, PDZ, and FERM domains, as well as C-terminal PDZ-binding domains, which facilitate interactions with key proteins such as PSD-95 and Homer1. These interactions are crucial for the formation and maintenance of excitatory synapses and dendritic spines, which are essential for synaptic strength and plasticity (Piard2017FRMPD4). Mutations in the FRMPD4 gene are linked to X-linked intellectual disability and other neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal synaptic function and neuronal connectivity (Honda2010Copynumber; Piard2017FRMPD4).

## Structure
The FRMPD4 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in cellular signaling. It contains an N-terminal WW domain, a PDZ domain, and a FERM domain, as well as C-terminal PDZ-binding domains (Piard2017FRMPD4). The WW domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the PDZ domain is crucial for binding to other proteins such as PSD-95, which is important for the formation of excitatory synapses and dendritic spines (Piard2017FRMPD4). The FERM domain is involved in interactions with the guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain of the DLG4 protein, with specific residues such as Glu591 forming hydrogen bonds that are critical for this interaction (Pan2024Genetic).

Mutations in these domains, such as the Glu591Ala variant in the FERM domain, can disrupt these interactions, leading to severe intellectual disability (Pan2024Genetic). The protein's structure is further influenced by its ability to form complexes with other proteins, such as Homer1 and proline-directed kinases, which are essential for its role in dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic signaling (Piard2017FRMPD4). The FRMPD4 protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in the brain, particularly in the cortex and hippocampus, where it is abundantly expressed (Piard2017FRMPD4).

## Function
The FRMPD4 gene encodes a neural scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic signaling in the brain. It is primarily expressed in the brain cortex and hippocampus, where it contributes to cognitive functions and memory by maintaining synaptic structure and function (Piard2017FRMPD4). The FRMPD4 protein contains N-terminal WW, PDZ, and FERM domains, as well as C-terminal PDZ-binding domains, which facilitate interactions with actin filaments, b-PIX, and PSD-95. These interactions are essential for the formation of excitatory synapses and dendritic spines (Piard2017FRMPD4).

In healthy cells, FRMPD4 is involved in the formation of excitatory synapses and regulation of dendritic spine density, which are critical for cognitive functions and memory. The C-terminal PDZ ligand of FRMPD4 binds to the PDZ domain of PSD-95, a critical interaction for synapse formation. FRMPD4 also interacts with Homer1 to form a complex that regulates mGluR1/5 signaling, important for normal cognitive processes (Piard2017FRMPD4). Overexpression of FRMPD4 in hippocampal neurons increases dendritic spine density, while decreased expression reduces it, highlighting its role in maintaining synaptic strength and plasticity (Piard2017FRMPD4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FRMPD4 gene are associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), characterized by a range of cognitive impairments and developmental delays. These mutations include deletions, nonsense mutations, frame-shift mutations, and missense mutations, all of which disrupt the normal function of the FRMPD4 protein (Piard2017FRMPD4). Clinical features linked to these mutations include moderate to severe intellectual disability, language delay, seizures, and behavioral or psychiatric disturbances (Piard2017FRMPD4). 

One specific mutation, FRMPD4 p.Cys618ValfsX8, results in a truncated protein that lacks critical binding sites, impairing its interaction with proteins such as PSD-95 and HOMER1. This disruption affects dendritic spine density and synapse formation, contributing to cognitive impairments (Piard2017FRMPD4). 

In addition to point mutations, copy-number variations involving FRMPD4, such as duplications, have been identified in patients with mild mental retardation and autism, suggesting a broader role for FRMPD4 in neurodevelopmental disorders (Honda2010Copynumber). The gene's involvement in these conditions underscores its importance in maintaining normal synaptic function and neuronal connectivity.

## Interactions
FRMPD4 is a neural scaffolding protein that plays a significant role in synaptic signaling and dendritic spine morphogenesis. It interacts with several key proteins, including PSD-95 and Homer1, which are crucial for maintaining synaptic structure and function. The C-terminal PDZ domain of FRMPD4 is essential for its interaction with PSD-95, a protein necessary for the formation of excitatory synapses and regulation of dendritic spine density. Mutations that disrupt this interaction, such as FRMPD4 p.Cys618ValfsX8, lead to reduced binding and affect spine density (Piard2017FRMPD4).

FRMPD4 also interacts with Homer1, forming a complex with proline-directed kinases (PDKs) and mGluR1/5. This interaction is regulated by ERK phosphorylation at the Homer binding site and is crucial for down-regulating mGluR5 signaling. The FRMPD4 p.Cys618ValfsX8 mutation results in a truncated protein lacking the Homer1 binding site, leading to enhanced mGluR1/5 signaling, which is implicated in cognitive impairments (Piard2017FRMPD4).

These interactions underscore the role of FRMPD4 in maintaining synaptic integrity, and disruptions in these interactions are associated with intellectual disabilities and other neuropsychiatric disorders (Piard2017FRMPD4).
