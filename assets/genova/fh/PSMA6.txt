# PSMA6

## Overview
PSMA6 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 6, a critical component of the proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered structure, consisting of 28 subunits arranged in four stacked rings, forming a barrel-shaped core. PSMA6 is one of the seven alpha subunits that form the outer rings of the 20S core proteasome, playing a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and regulatory functions of the proteasome (Coux1996STRUCTURE). The protein encoded by PSMA6 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and response to oxidative stress. It is also implicated in several signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and is associated with various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders (Broering2016Hepatic; Kakumu2017Identification).

## Structure
The PSMA6 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the 20S core proteasome, specifically forming part of the outer α rings. The primary structure of PSMA6 consists of 246 amino acid residues (Gomes2013Genetics). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in proteasome subunits (Löwe1995Crystal). The tertiary structure of PSMA6 contributes to its compact, globular shape, essential for its role in the proteasome complex (Löwe1995Crystal).

In the quaternary structure, PSMA6 assembles with other alpha subunits to form the outer rings of the cylindrical 20S proteasome core, which is crucial for the proteasome's function in protein degradation (Coux1996STRUCTURE). The α subunits, including PSMA6, are involved in forming a barrier to the proteolytic chamber and serve as binding sites for regulatory complexes (Coux1996STRUCTURE).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation are known to modulate the function of the PSMA6 protein, affecting its role in the proteasome complex (Gomes2013Genetics; Vimer2020Comparative). These modifications are important for the regulation of proteasome activity and its interactions with other cellular components.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The PSMA6 gene, encoding a subunit of the proteasome complex, is implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein degradation and regulation of inflammatory processes. Alterations in PSMA6 expression or genetic variations have been associated with cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery disease (CAD). A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1048990, has been linked to increased MI risk in Japanese populations, although its impact appears limited in Caucasian populations (Bennett2008The; Takashima2007Validation). The PSMA6 gene is also associated with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), with the G allele of a specific SNP showing a potential link to increased risk (Buraczynska2016Association).

In the context of cancer, PSMA6 is upregulated in lung cancer and other malignancies, suggesting an oncogenic role. Its overexpression in lung cancer cells correlates with increased cell proliferation and survival, making it a potential therapeutic target (Kakumu2017Identification). Additionally, PSMA6 genetic variations have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and response to interferon-β therapy, indicating its involvement in neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases (Paramonova2021Genetic).

## Interactions
PSMA6, a component of the 20S core proteasome, participates in various protein interactions essential for its function in protein degradation. Within the 26S proteasome, PSMA6 interacts directly with other core subunits such as PSMA2-5 and PSMB6-7, forming part of the structural framework of the proteasome complex. This interaction is crucial for the assembly and stability of the proteasome, facilitating its role in degrading ubiquitinated proteins (Drew2017Identifying).

PSMA6 is also involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is manipulated by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to protect against apoptosis and promote viral replication. This suggests that PSMA6 may interact with components of this pathway, potentially influencing cellular responses to viral infection (Broering2016Hepatic).

In the context of cancer, PSMA6 has been identified as a key protein in the proteasome pathway, particularly in metastatic gastric cancer, where it is upregulated and may interact with other proteasome subunits to influence cancer progression and metastasis (Ding2020Proteomic). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PSMA6 in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
