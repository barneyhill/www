# IGFBP6

## Overview
The IGFBP6 gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP-6), a member of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein family. This protein is primarily involved in modulating the activity of insulin-like growth factors, particularly IGF-II, by binding to them with high affinity, thereby inhibiting their actions. IGFBP-6 is characterized by a unique molecular structure, including a thyroglobulin type 1 fold in its C-terminal domain, which facilitates its interaction with IGF-II. Beyond its role in IGF binding, IGFBP-6 is involved in various cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell migration, and cellular senescence. It also interacts with other cellular components, including the vitamin D receptor, influencing cell signaling and gene expression. Alterations in IGFBP6 expression have been linked to several diseases, including cancers and fibrotic conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Bach1994Recombinant; Zhao2020Decreased; Micutkova2011Insulinlike).

## Structure
The insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP-6) is characterized by a unique molecular structure that distinguishes it from other IGFBPs. The primary structure of IGFBP-6 includes 16 cysteines, which form eight disulfide linkages, contributing to its stability and function (Neumann1998Identification). The secondary structure of IGFBP-6 features an extended N-terminal subdomain and a C-terminal domain with a thyroglobulin type 1 fold. The N-terminal subdomain, comprising residues 1-45, lacks a well-defined secondary structure but contains a potential cation-binding site (Chandrashekaran2007The). The C-terminal domain includes an α-helix, a loop, and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, stabilized by disulfide bonds (Headey2004Cterminal).

IGFBP-6's tertiary structure is defined by its unique disulfide connectivity, particularly in the N-terminal region, which contributes to its high affinity for IGF-II over IGF-I (Neumann1999The). The C-terminal domain's structure facilitates interactions with IGF-II, involving specific residues that form a hydrophobic binding site (Headey2004Cterminal). Post-translational modifications, such as O-glycosylation, have been identified, affecting the protein's function and stability (Neumann1998Identification). The structural features of IGFBP-6 are crucial for its role in modulating IGF actions, particularly in IGF-II-dependent pathways.

## Function
IGFBP-6 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6) is a protein that plays a significant role in modulating the activity of insulin-like growth factors, particularly IGF-II, by binding to them with high affinity. This binding inhibits the actions of IGF-II, which is crucial for regulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival (Bach1994Recombinant). IGFBP-6 is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell migration, and is expressed in quiescent, non-dividing cells and during the differentiation of various cell types (Micutkova2011Insulinlike).

In healthy human cells, IGFBP-6 functions as a negative regulator of cellular senescence, promoting cell proliferation and survival. It is upregulated during replicative senescence of human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs), and its overexpression has been shown to delay the onset of senescence, allowing cells to undergo additional population doublings and reducing apoptotic cell death (Micutkova2011Insulinlike). IGFBP-6 also influences the expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which is a marker of cellular senescence, suggesting its role in cell cycle regulation (Micutkova2011Insulinlike). The protein is active in the extracellular space, where it modulates the availability and activity of insulin-like growth factors, impacting processes such as cell growth and differentiation (Marinaro1999HaCaT).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IGFBP6 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), decreased expression of IGFBP6 is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. Low IGFBP6 levels correlate with poor survival in CRC patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhao2020Decreased). In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), IGFBP6 is downregulated, which may contribute to tumor progression. It is suggested to inhibit NSCLC cell growth by activating programmed cell death, highlighting its role as a tumor suppressor (Venuto2023IGFBP6).

IGFBP6 is also involved in fibrotic conditions. In Dupuytren's disease, IGFBP6 is downregulated, while IGF-II is upregulated, affecting cellular contractility and proliferation. This suggests that IGFBP6 and IGF-II are key regulators in the disease's pathology (Raykha2013IGFII). In primary myelofibrosis, IGFBP6 modulates fibroblast activation and is involved in the fibrotic transformation of the bone marrow (Longhitano2021IGFBP6sonic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of IGFBP6 in various pathological conditions, where its altered expression or interaction with other molecules can influence disease progression and patient outcomes.

## Interactions
IGFBP6 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6) is known for its high-affinity binding to insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), which it inhibits by preventing IGF-II from interacting with its receptors (Forbes2012Insulin-Like; Ahmad2011Serine). This interaction is facilitated by the C-domain of IGFBP-6, which adopts a thyroglobulin type 1 fold and involves a hydrophobic surface patch for binding (BACH2005IGFbinding). The binding site on IGFBP-6 overlaps with the IGF-I receptor binding site, providing a structural basis for its inhibitory effects on IGF actions (BACH2005IGFbinding).

IGFBP-6 also interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the nucleus, inhibiting VDR function and its interaction with the retinoid-X-receptor (RXR), which blocks osteoblastic differentiation (Forbes2012Insulin-Like). Additionally, IGFBP-6 binds to a broad range of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which can modulate its interactions with IGF-II and other ligands, influencing IGF-independent actions (Forbes2012Insulin-Like). These interactions highlight IGFBP-6's role in modulating cell signaling and gene expression beyond its traditional role in IGF binding.
