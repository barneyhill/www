# MFSD6L

## Overview
MFSD6L is a gene that encodes the protein major facilitator superfamily domain containing 6 like, which is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters. Proteins in this superfamily are characterized by their ability to facilitate the transport of a wide variety of substrates across cellular membranes, typically featuring a structure composed of 12 transmembrane segments (Perland2017Characteristics). While the precise function of the MFSD6L protein remains to be fully elucidated, its evolutionary conservation and neuronal co-expression patterns suggest a potentially significant role in cellular transport processes (Perland2017Characteristics). The gene has been implicated in certain genetic conditions, such as pediatric cataracts, and its expression levels have been associated with prognosis in ovarian cancer, indicating its potential clinical significance (Chiu2018FBXL7; Aldahmesh2012Genomic).

## Structure
MFSD6L is a protein that belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), which is characterized by a common structure of 12 transmembrane segments (TMS) (Perland2017Characteristics). This structural feature is typical for MFS proteins and is crucial for their function as transporters across cell membranes. The protein consists of 586 amino acids, as noted in the study, but specific details about its primary sequence or any unique motifs are not provided in the available context (Perland2017Characteristics).

The secondary and tertiary structures of MFSD6L are not explicitly detailed in the context, but the presence of 12 TMS suggests a typical MFS fold, which involves a helical arrangement that facilitates solute transport. There is no information on quaternary structure or whether MFSD6L forms multimeric complexes.

The context does not provide specific information on post-translational modifications, splice variant isoforms, or distinct domains within MFSD6L. The protein's evolutionary conservation and neuronal co-expression suggest a potentially significant role in cellular transport processes, although its exact function remains to be elucidated (Perland2017Characteristics).

## Clinical Significance
The MFSD6L gene has been implicated in certain genetic conditions, particularly in the context of pediatric cataracts. A study conducted by Aldahmesh et al. identified a novel variant in the MFSD6L gene that segregated with cataract and severe psychomotor delay in a family from Saudi Arabia. This variant was predicted to be highly pathogenic based on its conservation level and protein structure. It was absent in a significant number of control subjects, suggesting its potential role in the disease (Aldahmesh2012Genomic). However, another study by Patel et al. did not find an association between a missense variant in MFSD6L and cataract in a specific patient, indicating that the link between MFSD6L and cataracts may not be consistent across all cases (Patel2016Novel).

The MFSD6L gene is also mentioned in the context of ovarian cancer. High levels of MFSD6 transcripts have been associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients, particularly those receiving taxol adjuvant therapy. This suggests that alterations in MFSD6 expression may influence cancer outcomes, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (Chiu2018FBXL7). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance of MFSD6L mutations and expression alterations.
