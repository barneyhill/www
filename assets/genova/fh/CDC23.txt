# CDC23

## Overview
CDC23 is a gene that encodes the cell division cycle 23 protein, a crucial component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby facilitating the orderly progression through mitosis. The CDC23 protein is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, and is ubiquitously expressed, localizing to centromeres and the mitotic spindle. Its interactions with other APC/C components, such as CDC16 and CDC27, underscore its importance in maintaining genomic stability and ensuring proper cell division. Alterations in CDC23 expression have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2011CDC23; Prinz1998The; Zhao1998HumanCDC23:cDNA).

## Structure
The human CDC23 protein is encoded by a cDNA sequence of 3140 base pairs, resulting in a protein with 591 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 68,293 Da (Zhao1998HumanCDC23:cDNA). The primary structure of CDC23 includes nine tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) units, which are 34-amino-acid motifs involved in protein-protein interactions (Zhao1998HumanCDC23:cDNA). These TPR units are arranged with a block of eight tandem repeats in the carboxy-terminus and an additional, disconnected, upstream repeat (Zhao1998HumanCDC23:cDNA).

The TPR motifs are characterized by α-helical regions punctuated by proline-induced turns, suggesting a secondary structure that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Zhao1998HumanCDC23:cDNA). The tertiary structure likely involves the formation of amphipathic alpha-helices, which are common in TPR-containing proteins and aid in their interaction capabilities (Lamb1994Cdc16p).

CDC23 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a large multisubunit complex essential for mitosis, indicating its involvement in a quaternary structure with other proteins such as CDC16 and CDC27 (Lamb1994Cdc16p; Zhao1998HumanCDC23:cDNA). The protein is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to the centromeres and mitotic spindle, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation (Zhao1998HumanCDC23:cDNA).

## Function
CDC23 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. In healthy human cells, CDC23 plays a vital role in the degradation of cell cycle proteins, facilitating the transition through different phases of mitosis. The APC/C, with CDC23 as a key component, targets specific proteins for ubiquitination, marking them for proteasomal degradation. This process is essential for the regulation of mitosis, ensuring that cells progress through the cell cycle in a controlled manner (Prinz1998The).

CDC23, along with other APC/C components like Cdc27, is involved in the proteolysis of Cdc20, a regulatory protein whose degradation is necessary for cell cycle progression. The degradation of Cdc20 by the APC/C is mediated through two pathways: one dependent on destruction boxes and another independent of them, highlighting the complex regulatory mechanisms in which CDC23 is involved (Prinz1998The). The activity of CDC23 is crucial during the S phase and early mitosis, where it helps maintain genomic stability by ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once per cell cycle (Prinz1998The). CDC23 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, underscoring its importance in maintaining cell division fidelity.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDC23 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), CDC23 is overexpressed and plays a significant role in regulating cancer cell phenotypes, including proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Knockdown of CDC23 in thyroid cancer cell lines results in inhibited cell growth, reduced colony formation, and cell cycle arrest, suggesting its crucial role in cancer cell proliferation and survival (Zhang2011CDC23). The overexpression of CDC23 in PTC is not associated with common somatic mutations such as BRAF V600E or RET/PTC3, nor is it modulated by sex hormones, although it is upregulated in male patients compared to female patients (Zhang2011CDC23).

In liver cancer, CDC23 is highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and its knockdown suppresses proliferation, migration, and invasion of these cells. This suggests that CDC23 may regulate malignant behaviors through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, making it a potential therapeutic target for liver cancer (Zhang2023CDC23).

Despite its location within a commonly deleted segment in myeloid leukemias, no mutations in CDC23 have been detected in leukemia cells with 5q deletions, indicating it is unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of these leukemias (Zhao1998HumanCDC23:cDNA).

## Interactions
CDC23, also known as MCM10, is involved in several critical interactions essential for DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. It physically interacts with components of the DNA replication initiation complex, including DNA polymerase α/primase, where it stimulates primase activity in vitro (Locovei2006The). CDC23 also interacts with the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) components, such as Mcm2, 4, 5, and 6, and facilitates chromatin binding of Cdc45 (Locovei2006The). It is required for the efficient phosphorylation of the Mcm2-7 complex by the Dfp1-Hsk1 kinase, interacting directly with Dfp1-Hsk1 (Lee2003The).

CDC23 acts as a scaffold protein, assembling the pre-RC due to its interactions with the Mcm complex and the Orc complex, as shown in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Lee2003The). It also interacts with the ARS-binding protein 1 (Abp1), which is involved in DNA replication and chromosome segregation (Locovei2006The). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CDC23 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and interacts with other core components like Cdc16p and Cdc27p, as well as kinetochore components such as Slk19p and Okp1p (Melloy2004Changes).
