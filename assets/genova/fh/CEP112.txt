# CEP112

## Overview
CEP112 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 112, a critical component of the centrosome involved in maintaining genomic stability and facilitating proper cell division. The protein plays a pivotal role in microtubule organization and centrosome function, which are essential for accurate spindle formation and chromosome segregation during mitosis (Jakobsen2011Novel). CEP112 interacts with key proteins such as BRCA1, contributing to DNA repair and genomic stability, and is implicated in the structural integrity of centrioles, which are vital for cell division and sperm morphology (Sha2019Loss‐of‐function; Panda2018Noncoding). The gene's mutations have been linked to acephalic spermatozoa, a condition affecting male fertility, underscoring its clinical significance (Sha2019Loss‐of‐function).

## Function
CEP112 (centrosomal protein 112) is a crucial component of the centrosome, playing a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division. In healthy human cells, CEP112 is involved in centrosome function and microtubule organization, which are essential for accurate spindle formation and chromosome segregation during mitosis (Jakobsen2011Novel). It interacts with BRCA1, a protein critical for DNA repair and genomic stability, to stabilize its function and ensure proper centrosome and spindle assembly. This interaction is vital for maintaining genomic stability and proper mitotic regulation (Panda2018Noncoding).

CEP112 is localized at the centrosome, contributing to its structural integrity and facilitating accurate cell cycle progression. It plays a role in the nucleation and assembly of microtubules during chromosomal segregation, which is crucial for error-free centrosomal duplication and cytokinesis (Panda2018Noncoding). The protein is also implicated in the function of centrioles, which are vital for cell division and the connection between the sperm head and tail, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal sperm morphology and function (Sha2019Loss‐of‐function). These functions underscore the critical role of CEP112 in cellular and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP112 gene have been associated with the acephalic spermatozoa phenotype, a rare form of teratozoospermia characterized by the presence of headless sperm in the ejaculate. This condition severely impairs male fertility. In a study involving two infertile patients with this phenotype, whole-exome sequencing identified deleterious mutations in CEP112. One patient exhibited a homozygous mutation c.496C > T:p.(Arg166X) in exon 5, while the other had biallelic mutations c.2074C > T:p.(Arg692Trp) and c.2104C > T:p.(Arg702Cys) in exon 20. These mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and are believed to impact the coiled-coil domain of CEP112, potentially affecting its protein function. The study suggests that these mutations may be responsible for the acephalic spermatozoa phenotype by disrupting the normal morphology and function of sperm, particularly at the sperm head-tail junction (Sha2019Loss‐of‐function).

While genetic defects are known to be associated with acephalic spermatozoa, the specific role of CEP112 in this condition had not been previously reported, highlighting its clinical significance in male infertility (Sha2019Loss‐of‐function).

## Interactions
CEP112 is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in centrosome function and genomic stability. It has been identified as a component of the basal foot in primary cilia, where it is in close proximity to centriolar marker CEP135 and basal foot marker CNTRL, suggesting its involvement in the basal foot structure (Nguyen2020Comparative). Despite its localization, knockout experiments indicate that CEP112 might have unique functions beyond a structural role, as its absence does not affect basal foot protein recruitment or ciliogenesis (Nguyen2020Comparative).

CEP112 interacts with the noncoding RNA Ginir, which affects its cellular localization and function. Ginir RNA overexpression disrupts the interaction between CEP112 and BRCA1, a protein crucial for centrosomal function and genomic stability, leading to mislocalization and genomic instability (Panda2018Noncoding). This interaction is significant in the context of oncogenesis, as Ginir RNA acts as an oncogene by associating with centrosomal proteins like CEP112 (Panda2018Noncoding).

CEP112 also interacts with BRCA1, with a stable interaction demonstrated between the C-terminal of BRCA1 and a domain near the C-terminal region of CEP112 (Panda2018Noncoding). This interaction is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper centrosome function (Panda2018Noncoding).
