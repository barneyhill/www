# SNAPC2

## Overview
SNAPC2 is a gene that encodes the small nuclear RNA activating complex polypeptide 2, a critical component of the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (SNAPc). This protein complex is integral to the transcriptional regulation of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and III. As a part of the SNAPc, SNAPC2 plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex, thereby influencing gene expression and RNA processing within the nucleus. The protein encoded by SNAPC2 is categorized as a transcription factor due to its involvement in the recruitment and stabilization of RNA polymerases at snRNA promoters. Its interactions within the complex, particularly with SNAPC4, underscore its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and ensuring accurate gene expression and RNA maturation (Thiedig2020Functional; James2012Genomic).

## Function
SNAPC2 is a subunit of the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (SNAPc), which is essential for the transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes by RNA polymerase II and III. This complex is involved in the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex, playing a critical role in gene expression regulation and RNA processing within the nucleus (Thiedig2020Functional; James2012Genomic).

SNAPC2 specifically associates with the C-terminal part of SNAPC4 and is positioned upstream of the proximal sequence element (PSE), indicating its orientation and function within the transcription complex (James2012Genomic). The presence of SNAPC2 at these sites suggests its involvement in the recruitment and stabilization of RNA polymerases at snRNA promoters, facilitating efficient transcription initiation (James2012Genomic).

In healthy human cells, SNAPC2, as part of the SNAP complex, is crucial for the transcription of snRNA genes, which are vital for the proper functioning of the spliceosome and other RNA processing activities. This activity is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and ensuring accurate gene expression and RNA maturation (Thiedig2020Functional).

## Interactions
SNAPC2 is a component of the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (SNAPc), which plays a crucial role in the transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. Within the SNAPc complex, SNAPC2 interacts with other subunits such as SNAPC1 and SNAPC4. SNAPC2 is specifically noted for its association with the C-terminal part of SNAPC4, suggesting a specific orientation within the complex (James2012Genomic). 

SNAPC2 is involved in the transcription initiation of both RNA polymerase II and III, particularly in the transcription of snRNA genes. It is part of a complex that binds to the proximal sequence element (PSE) of snRNA promoters, facilitating the recruitment of RNA polymerases to these sites (Rengachari2022Structural). Although SNAPC2's direct interactions with other proteins are not extensively detailed, it is implied to contribute to the stability and activity of the SNAPc complex (Rengachari2022Structural).

The SNAPc complex, including SNAPC2, is involved in the transcription of fewer than 100 promoters, indicating its specialized role in gene expression regulation (James2012Genomic). SNAPC2's interactions within the SNAPc complex are essential for its function in snRNA gene transcription.
