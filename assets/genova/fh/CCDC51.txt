# CCDC51

## Overview
The CCDC51 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein known as MITOK, which is integral to the function and morphology of mitochondria. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain and transmembrane helical domains, classifying it as a transmembrane protein (Zeitz2021Mutated). MITOK plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial fission, a process crucial for maintaining mitochondrial dynamics, and is involved in forming mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels, which are essential for regulating mitochondrial membrane potential and energy homeostasis (Zeitz2021Mutated; Edington2024Human). The protein's interactions with other mitochondrial proteins, such as Drp1, further underscore its role in mitochondrial fragmentation and energy regulation (Edington2024Human). Mutations in CCDC51 have been linked to autosomal recessive rod-cone dystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance in retinal health (Zeitz2021Mutated).

## Structure
The CCDC51 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein known as MITOK, which consists of 411 amino acids. The protein features a predicted N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, a coiled-coil domain spanning amino acids 111-173, and two transmembrane helical domains, TM1 and TM2, located at amino acids 202-222 and 387-407, respectively (Zeitz2021Mutated). CCDC51 is an inner membrane mitochondrial protein with both N- and C-termini exposed toward the internal matrix, while the region between the transmembrane domains is located in the intermembrane space (Zeitz2021Mutated). 

The protein functions as the pore-forming subunit of a mitochondrial ATP channel, with MITOSUR as the ATP-binding subunit (Zeitz2021Mutated). Immunolocalization studies have confirmed its mitochondrial localization, showing colocalization with mitochondrial markers such as ATP synthase subunit beta (Zeitz2021Mutated). Western blot analyses have identified a band at the expected size of 46 kDa for CCDC51, with a potential second isoform of approximately 47 kDa observed in mouse and human retina (Zeitz2021Mutated). The presence of these structural features suggests a role in mitochondrial morphology and function, although specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided.

## Function
The CCDC51 gene encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane protein known as MITOK, which plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and morphology in healthy human cells. CCDC51 is involved in mitochondrial fission events, a process essential for maintaining normal mitochondrial dynamics and morphology. Depletion of CCDC51 leads to mitochondrial hyperfusion, indicating its importance in promoting mitochondrial fission and preventing excessive fusion (Edington2024Human). The protein is functionally conserved with the yeast protein Mdm33, and its presence is associated with increased fission activity, marking a subset of mitochondrial fission sites (Edington2024Human).

CCDC51 also forms part of the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mitoK(ATP)) channels, which are vital for regulating the mitochondrial membrane potential and facilitating potassium ion transport into the mitochondrial matrix. This function is essential for maintaining the proton gradient necessary for ATP synthesis, thereby supporting cellular energy homeostasis (Zeitz2021Mutated). In the retina, CCDC51 is expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors, suggesting a role in energy production in these cells (Zeitz2021Mutated). Overall, CCDC51 is integral to mitochondrial function, influencing energy metabolism and ion homeostasis in human cells (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC51 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial protein MITOK, have been implicated in autosomal recessive rod-cone dystrophy (RCD), a type of inherited retinal disorder. A specific mutation, c.244_246delins17 p.(Trp82Valfs*4), has been identified as a candidate gene defect for this condition. This mutation leads to a frameshift, potentially resulting in a truncated protein or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which may cause mitochondrial dysfunction in the retina and contribute to photoreceptor degeneration (Zeitz2021Mutated).

The study of a consanguineous family revealed that the affected individual was homozygous for this mutation, while unaffected family members were either heterozygous or did not carry the mutation, supporting the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (Zeitz2021Mutated). The mutation is considered ultra-rare, as it is not reported in current variant databases and no other convincing biallelic disease-causing variants in CCDC51 were found in a large cohort of RCD cases (Zeitz2021Mutated).

The CCDC51 protein is highly conserved across species and is localized in mitochondria, particularly in the retina's rod and cone photoreceptors. Defects in mitochondrial function due to CCDC51 mutations could lead to RCD, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in retinal diseases (Zeitz2021Mutated).

## Interactions
CCDC51 is known to form a protein complex with ABCB8/MITOSUR, which localizes to the mitochondria and mediates ATP-dependent potassium currents across the inner membrane. This interaction suggests a role for CCDC51 in mitochondrial function, particularly in ion homeostasis and energy regulation (Priyanka2021CoiledCoil). 

CCDC51 also interacts with Drp1, a protein involved in mitochondrial fission. Overexpression of CCDC51 in human cells promotes Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission, indicating a functional relationship between these proteins. This interaction is crucial for CCDC51's role in mitochondrial fragmentation, as evidenced by the lack of effect in Drp1 knockout cells (Edington2024Human).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCDC51 is part of a network of interactions with proteins such as VPS54, NKX2-1, VPS53, COMMD9, and VPS51. These interactions are associated with the upregulation of CCDC51 in HCC tumors and are linked to poor overall survival in patients, suggesting a role in cancer progression and the tumor microenvironment (Li2023Identification).

CCDC51 is also associated with early endosomes in an EGF-dependent manner, although specific interactions with other proteins in this context are not detailed (Gosney2024EGFR).
