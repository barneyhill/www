# ZNF787

## Overview
ZNF787 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 787, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their roles in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its interaction with nucleic acids and other proteins, categorizing it as a transcription factor. Zinc finger protein 787 is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcription, RNA splicing, and neurogenesis, and has been associated with several pathological conditions such as cancer and viral infections. The gene's expression and function are linked to significant biological pathways, influencing cellular behavior and disease progression (Zhang2024Chemical; Morselli2020Whole; Cancela2022Structural).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF787 has been implicated in the prognosis of gastric cancer, particularly affecting female patients. Elevated expression of ZNF787 is associated with increased migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, contributing to a poor prognosis. This is due to its role in altering the expression of proteins such as MMP-2, MMP-9, and ICAM-1, while reducing the expression of timp-1, which collectively enhance the aggressive behavior of the cancer (Li2019Differences).

In the context of neurogenesis, ZNF787 has been identified as a potential driver of network changes during neuronal differentiation. Alterations in its expression can influence neuronal features, suggesting its involvement in neurogenesis and possibly affecting conditions related to neural development (gysi2018comparing).

ZNF787 is also associated with body mass index (BMI) through gene-environment interactions. A specific SNP linked to ZNF787 showed significant interactions with environmental factors such as total calorie intake, highlighting its potential role in metabolic conditions (Jung2021Identification).

In pancreatic cancer, ZNF787 has been identified as a characteristic gene related to m6A methylation patterns, which are associated with poor prognosis. This suggests a role in the regulation of cancer-related pathways (Fang2021Characterization).

## Interactions
ZNF787, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions within the cell, particularly in the context of transcription and neurogenesis. It is part of a cluster of proteins that play roles in RNA splicing and nucleic acid-template transcription within the cell nucleus. These proteins, including ZNF787, exhibit molecular functions associated with protein binding and nucleic acid binding, and are linked to processes such as carcinogenesis and cancer development (Zhang2024Chemical).

In the context of neurogenesis, ZNF787 has been identified as having specific links in network changes during the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). It acts as a potential driver of miR-124 induced network changes, and its overexpression in wildtype cells alters the expression of genes with neuronal functions, suggesting its role as a repressor of neuronal features (Morselli2020Whole).

ZNF787 has also been found to insert into the Pro region of the hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is important for viral replication. This interaction suggests a potential role in viral adaptation and immune evasion strategies (Cancela2022Structural).
