# TAS2R30

## Overview
TAS2R30 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 2 receptor member 30, which is part of the bitter taste receptor family within the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in detecting bitter compounds. The TAS2R30 protein is primarily expressed in taste receptor cells on the tongue, where it contributes to the perception of bitterness, influencing dietary preferences and toxin avoidance (Behrens2016G; Razzaghi2024Structurefunction). Beyond its gustatory function, TAS2R30 is also expressed in extra-oral tissues, such as the skin, where it may play roles in immunity and cellular responses to environmental stimuli (Shaw2018Personalized). Additionally, TAS2R30 is implicated in cellular processes in acute myeloid leukemia cells, suggesting broader physiological and potentially pathological roles (Salvestrini2020Denatonium).

## Structure
The TAS2R30 gene encodes a bitter taste receptor that is part of the TAS2R family, which belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven transmembrane domains (TMDs), which are connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops (Behrens2016G). The primary structure of TAS2R30 consists of a sequence of amino acids, with a notable single amino acid variation (L252F) in the third extracellular domain that affects sensitivity to bitter compounds like amarogentin and quassin (Roudnitzky2015Receptor).

The secondary structure includes these transmembrane alpha helices, which are typical of GPCRs. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, forming a structure that allows interaction with bitter compounds. Although specific details on the quaternary structure of TAS2R30 are not provided, TAS2Rs can form homo- and heterooligomers in vitro (Behrens2016G).

Post-translational modifications of TAS2R30 include glycosylation, which is crucial for receptor function. A highly conserved site for Asn-linked glycosylation is located in the second extracellular loop, and additional N-glycosylation sites may be present (Behrens2016G). These modifications are essential for proper receptor trafficking and function.

## Function
TAS2R30 is a member of the bitter taste receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors involved in the perception of bitter compounds. These receptors are primarily located on the surface of taste receptor cells in the tongue, where they detect bitter substances and trigger signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of bitterness, influencing dietary choices and toxin avoidance (Razzaghi2024Structurefunction).

Beyond their role in taste perception, TAS2R30 and other TAS2Rs are expressed in various extra-oral tissues, including the skin, where they are involved in physiological processes such as immunity and cellular responses to environmental stimuli (Shaw2018Personalized; Razzaghi2024Structurefunction). In the skin, TAS2R30 expression is influenced by factors such as sun exposure, sex, and age, suggesting a role in skin functions and innate immunity (Shaw2018Personalized).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, TAS2R30 is functional and participates in signaling cascades that lead to calcium release from intracellular stores, indicating its involvement in cellular processes beyond taste perception (Salvestrini2020Denatonium). This receptor's activity in AML cells suggests potential roles in cancer biology, although its specific functions in healthy human cells remain less defined.
