# PACS1

## Overview
PACS1 is a gene that encodes the phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1, a multifunctional protein involved in intracellular protein trafficking. This protein plays a critical role in the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments, where it regulates the localization and sorting of membrane proteins, including furin and the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor. PACS1 is characterized by its interaction with clathrin adaptors and its regulation by casein kinase 2, which phosphorylates the protein to modulate its function. Beyond its trafficking role, PACS1 is implicated in maintaining chromosomal integrity and genomic stability through interactions with histone deacetylases. Mutations in the PACS1 gene are linked to Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by intellectual disability and distinct craniofacial features (Arnedo2022Molecular; Thakur2022Phosphofurin; Mani2020The).

## Structure
The PACS1 protein is composed of 963 amino acids and features several distinct domains and regions. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal atrophin-1-related region (ARR), a furin-binding region (FBR), a middle region (MR), and a C-terminal region (CTR) (Arnedo2022Molecular; Thakur2022Phosphofurin). The FBR is crucial for binding client proteins and contains a CK2-binding motif, which is involved in phosphorylation at the S278 residue within the MR autoregulatory domain (Arnedo2022Molecular; Thakur2022Phosphofurin).

The secondary structure of PACS1 is largely disordered, lacking well-defined globular domains, although ab-initio modeling suggests a globular domain between residues V117 and D300 and a C2 domain-like structure between P98 and E261 (Arnedo2022Molecular; Thakur2022Phosphofurin). The protein's tertiary structure is not fully elucidated, but it is suggested to have a globular domain and a C2 domain-like structure (Arnedo2022Molecular).

PACS1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 (CK2), which regulates its interaction with other proteins (Thakur2022Phosphofurin). The protein interacts with clathrin adaptors AP-1 and AP-3, and the monomeric adaptor GGA3, facilitating its role in protein trafficking (Arnedo2022Molecular).

## Function
PACS1 (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1) is a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in protein trafficking within cells, particularly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomal compartments. It is involved in the regulation of the localization and sorting of various membrane proteins, including furin, cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), and other proteins with acidic cluster motifs. PACS1 mediates the endosome-to-TGN retrieval of these proteins, a process essential for proper cellular function and homeostasis (Scott2006A; Youker2009At).

PACS1 functions by binding to phosphorylated acidic cluster motifs on its cargo proteins, a process regulated by protein kinase CK2. This binding is crucial for the trafficking and localization of proteins like furin, which is involved in the activation of proprotein substrates (Wan1998PACS1). In addition to its role in protein trafficking, PACS1 is also involved in maintaining chromosomal integrity and genomic stability. It interacts with class I histone deacetylases, HDAC2 and HDAC3, to regulate chromatin dynamics, which is essential for chromatin maturation and DNA replication (Mani2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PACS1 gene are primarily associated with Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome (SHMS), also known as PACS1 Neurodevelopmental Disorder (PACS1-NDD). This rare autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and distinctive craniofacial features, such as a bulbous nasal tip, downturned angle of the mouth, and thin lips (Arnedo2022Molecular; Thakur2022Phosphofurin; Schuurs‐Hoeijmakers2016Clinical). The condition is most commonly linked to a recurrent de novo mutation, c.607C>T, which results in the substitution of arginine with tryptophan at position 203 in the PACS1 protein (p.Arg203Trp) (TenorioCastaño2021Schuurs–Hoeijmakers; SchuursHoeijmakers2012Recurrent).

This mutation is believed to cause a gain-of-function effect, disrupting normal protein trafficking and leading to the clinical manifestations observed in affected individuals (Arnedo2022Molecular; Liu2021A). In addition to intellectual disability and facial dysmorphisms, patients may experience seizures, hypotonia, and various congenital anomalies affecting the heart, brain, eyes, and kidneys (Van2021PACS1Neurodevelopmental; Schuurs‐Hoeijmakers2016Clinical). The disorder's pathogenesis involves impaired neural crest cell migration and specification, as demonstrated in zebrafish models (Thakur2022Phosphofurin; SchuursHoeijmakers2012Recurrent).

## Interactions
PACS1 (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular trafficking. It interacts with heterotetrameric adaptor complexes, specifically AP-1 and AP-3, but not AP-2, forming a ternary complex with furin and AP-1. This interaction is essential for the correct localization of proteins such as furin and the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) from the trans-Golgi network (Crump2001PACS1).

PACS1 also binds to CK2, specifically the CK2b subunit, through a cluster of basic amino acids in the PACS-1 FBR region. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of CI-MPR trafficking and enhances CK2's kinase activity, which is important for the phosphorylation of PACS1 itself (Scott2006A).

Additionally, PACS1 forms a complex with GGA3 and CK2, which is vital for the endosome-to-TGN retrieval step of acidic cluster-containing cargo proteins. This complex regulates the trafficking of CI-MPR, with PACS1 directing CK2 to phosphorylate and inactivate GGA3, affecting its binding to CI-MPR (Scott2006A).

PACS1 also interacts with HDAC2 and HDAC3, playing a role in chromatin maturation and genomic stability by protecting these proteins from proteasomal degradation (Mani2020The).
