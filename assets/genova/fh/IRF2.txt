# IRF2

## Overview
IRF2, or interferon regulatory factor 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of immune response and cell differentiation. The protein product, also named interferon regulatory factor 2, is a member of the IRF family of transcription factors and is characterized by its unique DNA-binding domain, which does not share homology with other known DNA-binding motifs (Uegaki1995Secondary). As a transcription factor, IRF2 plays a dual role, acting as both a repressor and activator of gene expression depending on the cellular context. It is particularly significant in modulating the expression of genes involved in antiviral responses, natural killer cell development, and inflammasome activation (Persyn2022IRF2; Ren2015Division; Benaoudia2019A). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2, and HCFC2, are crucial for its regulatory functions (Childs2003Identification; Sun2017HCFC2). Alterations in IRF2 expression have been linked to various diseases, including atopic dermatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Nishio2001Mutation; Mei2017Prognostic; Yi2012Interferon).

## Structure
The IRF2 protein, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of interferon-related genes, has a distinct molecular structure characterized by its DNA-binding domain. This domain is located in the N-terminal region and consists of 113 amino acids (Harada1994Structure; Uegaki1995Secondary). The secondary structure of IRF2 includes three alpha helices and four beta strands that form an antiparallel beta-sheet. The helices are arranged on one side of the beta-sheet, creating a bundle (Uegaki1995Secondary). The sequence of these elements is α1-β1-β2-loop-α2-loop-α3-β3-loop-β4, with the beta strands arranged in the order β1-β2-β4-β3 (Uegaki1995Secondary).

The tertiary structure of IRF2 is suggested to have similarities with the C-terminal DNA binding domain of bacterial activator protein (CAP) and yeast heat shock transcription factor, despite lacking sequence homology (Uegaki1995Secondary). The IRF2 protein can bind to DNA as a dimer, as indicated by crystallographic studies (Kusumoto1998Crystallographic). The presence of repeated proline residues, which often disrupt regular secondary structures, is noted in unordered or loop regions (Uegaki1995Secondary). The IRF2 protein does not share sequence homology with known DNA binding motifs like helix-turn-helix, basic-leucine zipper, or Zn-finger, indicating a unique structure within the IRF family (Uegaki1995Secondary).

## Function
IRF2 (interferon regulatory factor 2) is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression related to immune responses and cell differentiation. In healthy human cells, IRF2 plays a dual role as both a transcriptional repressor and activator, depending on the context. It is crucial for maintaining chromatin accessibility and histone modifications at the TLR3 promoter, which is essential for transcriptional activation during antiviral responses. IRF2 facilitates histone modifications such as H3K4me3 and H3K9/K14ac, and recruits the BAF complex to maintain an open chromatin structure, preparing the chromatin for rapid transcription induction upon viral infection (Ren2015Division).

IRF2 is also involved in the development and functional maturation of natural killer (NK) cells. It regulates the proliferation and differentiation of NK cells from hematopoietic stem cells, influencing their cytotoxic function and cytokine secretion. Knockdown of IRF2 results in impaired NK cell function, highlighting its importance in immune cell development (Persyn2022IRF2).

Additionally, IRF2 regulates caspase-4 expression, playing a key role in non-canonical inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation (Benaoudia2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IRF2 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In atopic dermatitis (AD), mutations in the IRF2 gene, particularly in the promoter region, have been associated with the disease's pathogenesis. The -467G allele and a specific haplotype were found to be preferentially transmitted to AD-affected children, suggesting a genetic link to the condition, especially in the Japanese population (Nishio2001Mutation).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression of IRF2 is linked to increased recurrence probability and is associated with poor prognosis. The IRF2/IRF1 ratio is a significant indicator of malignancy progression, with a higher ratio correlating with greater metastatic potential. Downregulation of IRF2 has been shown to reduce invasion ability and decrease the expression of STAT3 and MMP9, highlighting its role in tumor invasion (Yi2012Interferon).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), elevated IRF2 expression is associated with worse overall survival and increased NF-κB activity, which may contribute to tumorigenesis. High IRF2 levels are linked to distant metastasis and poor clinical outcomes, making it a potential prognostic biomarker for CRC (Mei2017Prognostic).

## Interactions
IRF2 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. It binds specifically to the C-terminal repression domain of IRF-2 binding proteins 1 and 2 (IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2), which act as co-repressors. These interactions are essential for IRF2's ability to repress transcription independently of histone deacetylation (Childs2003Identification). IRF2 also interacts with the bromodomain protein Celtix-1, which associates with transcriptionally active chromatin and may influence the expression of IRF2-responsive genes (Staal2000Molecular).

IRF2 forms complexes with HCFC2, which facilitates its binding to DNA, particularly at the IRF-E site in the TLR3 promoter. This interaction is crucial for the transcription of TLR3 and is necessary for IRF2's function as both a transcriptional activator and repressor (Sun2017HCFC2). The DNA binding of IRF2 involves a helix-turn-helix domain and specific amino acids that mediate contact with DNA, highlighting its structural basis for DNA interaction (Antonczyk2019Direct). These interactions underscore IRF2's role in modulating gene expression in response to various cellular signals.
