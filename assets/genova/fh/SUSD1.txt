# SUSD1

## Overview
SUSD1 is a gene that encodes the sushi domain-containing 1 protein, a member of the SUSD protein family characterized by the presence of sushi (complement control protein, CCP) domains. These domains are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly within the complement system of innate immunity, suggesting a potential role in complement regulation. The SUSD1 protein is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular region that includes two sushi domains and three EGF-like domains, two of which have calcium ion binding sites, indicating possible involvement in cellular signaling and structural integrity (Gialeli2018Novel; Liu2010Identification). SUSD1 is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, where it is notably present in the primary motor cortex, suggesting a role in brain development and function (GonzálezCalvo2022Synapse). While the specific functions of SUSD1 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in immune modulation and potential interactions in cancer and neurological diseases underscore its clinical significance (Gialeli2018Novel; Yang2022HsacircRNA0088036).

## Structure
The SUSD1 protein is part of the SUSD protein family, which includes six transmembrane proteins, each containing one or more sushi (CCP) domains. SUSD1 is approximately 82 kDa in size and features an extracellular region with two sushi domains and three EGF-like domains, two of which have calcium ion binding sites. It also includes a transmembrane domain with a very short cytoplasmic extension (Gialeli2018Novel). The sushi domains, also known as complement control protein (CCP) modules, are typically involved in protein-protein interactions. These domains are common in proteins related to the complement system of innate immunity, suggesting a potential role in complement regulation (Gialeli2018Novel; GonzálezCalvo2022Synapse).

SUSD1 is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, endocrine tissues, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and pancreas (Gialeli2018Novel). In the brain, SUSD1 is expressed in the human primary motor cortex, with the highest expression level found in excitatory neurons, indicating a potential role in brain development and function (GonzálezCalvo2022Synapse). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
The SUSD1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the SUSD protein family, characterized by the presence of sushi domains, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. SUSD1 consists of an extracellular part with two sushi domains and three EGF-like domains, two of which have calcium ion binding sites, and a transmembrane domain with a short cytoplasmic extension (Gialeli2018Novel). In humans, SUSD1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, endocrine tissues, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and pancreas (Gialeli2018Novel).

The specific functions of SUSD1 in healthy human cells are not well-documented, but it is suggested that proteins in the SUSD family may play roles in regulating the complement cascade and other cellular processes (Gialeli2018Novel). The presence of sushi domains in SUSD proteins raises the possibility that they may regulate complement activity, although direct experimental evidence is still needed to confirm these roles (Gialeli2018Novel). Additionally, SUSD1 is involved in metal ion binding and calcium ion binding, which suggests a role in cellular signaling and structural integrity (Liu2010Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The SUSD1 gene has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the circular RNA hsa_circ_0088036, derived from the SUSD1 gene, is significantly upregulated in patients. This upregulation is associated with disease onset and age at blood collection, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for ALS (Dolinar2019Circular). 

In bladder cancer, hsa_circRNA_0088036 is also upregulated, promoting cancer progression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that sponges miR-140-3p, affecting the expression of the oncogene FOXQ1. This circRNA's expression correlates with larger tumor size and greater metastasis, indicating its role in cancer progression and potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Yang2022HsacircRNA0088036).

The SUSD1 gene is also mentioned in the context of veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency (VODI), where it shows differential expression, although the specific clinical significance of these alterations is not detailed (Cliffe2012Clinical). These findings highlight the diverse roles of SUSD1 in disease pathology.

## Interactions
SUSD1, a member of the Sushi domain-containing protein family, is characterized by its complement control protein (CCP) domains, also known as Sushi domains, which are typically involved in immune response and cell adhesion interactions. Despite its potential roles, specific protein interactions involving SUSD1 are not well-documented. However, some studies have suggested possible interactions and roles in cellular processes.

In the context of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), SUSD1 was identified as a protein influenced by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib, although the exact nature of its interaction with the Gab2 protein in CML cells remains to be further explored (Halbach2016Axitinib). Additionally, SUSD1 has been implicated in the regulation of the complement cascade, suggesting a potential role in immune system modulation, although direct experimental evidence is limited (Gialeli2018Novel).

In the realm of cancer research, a circular RNA derived from the SUSD1 gene, hsa_circRNA_0088036, has been studied for its role in bladder cancer progression. This circRNA acts as a competing endogenous RNA, influencing the expression of oncogenes, but it does not appear to directly affect SUSD1 mRNA and protein levels (Yang2022HsacircRNA0088036).
