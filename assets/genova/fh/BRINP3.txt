# BRINP3

## Overview
BRINP3, or BMP/retinoic acid inducible neural specific 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in neural-specific functions, particularly in the regulation of cell cycle progression and neurogenesis. The protein is characterized by a MACPF domain, which is typically associated with membrane interaction and pore formation, although its specific role in BRINP3 remains to be fully elucidated (Ni2017Repurposing; Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). Additionally, BRINP3 contains a coiled-coil domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions, and it is glycosylated, with several conserved N-glycosylation sites (Kawano2004Identification). Predominantly localized in the cytoplasmic space, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum, BRINP3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and neuronal differentiation (Kawano2004Identification; Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). The gene's expression is notably high in specific brain regions, such as the olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and hippocampus, suggesting its involvement in region-specific neural functions (Kawano2004Identification).

## Structure
BRINP3 is a protein that is highly conserved across species, including humans, mice, and rats, with over 98% identity (Kawano2004Identification). The protein is composed of 760 to 783 amino acid residues and contains several distinct structural features. It has a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide, which is necessary for membrane targeting and secretion, although there is no evidence that BRINP3 is secreted (Kawano2004Identification; Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental).

BRINP3 includes a MACPF domain, which spans approximately one-third of the protein and is associated with membrane interaction and pore formation, though its functionality in BRINP3 is not fully understood (Ni2017Repurposing; Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). The protein also contains a predicted single coiled-coil domain, which is important for protein-protein interactions (Kawano2004Identification). 

BRINP3 is glycosylated, with several potential N-glycosylation sites conserved among BRINP family members (Kawano2004Identification). The protein is predicted to be soluble, lacking a transmembrane domain, and is localized in the cytoplasmic space, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (Kawano2004Identification; Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). 

The C-terminal region of BRINP3 is cysteine-rich and may contain an annexin-like domain, although this has not been confirmed (Ni2017Repurposing). The protein's structure suggests potential roles in cell cycle regulation and neurogenesis (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental).

## Function
BRINP3 is a neural-specific gene that plays a significant role in the regulation of cell cycle progression, particularly at the G1/S transition, where it acts to suppress cell cycle progression in neuronal cells (Kawano2004Identification). This function is crucial during neurogenesis and neuronal maturation, as BRINP3 expression is detectable from the early stages of sympathetic neuron differentiation (Kawano2004Identification). In the adult brain, BRINP3 mRNA is expressed in specific regions such as the olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and hippocampus, suggesting its involvement in region-specific and stage-specific functions (Kawano2004Identification).

BRINP3 is also involved in the proliferation and migration of gonadotrope cells in pituitary adenomas, although it does not protect these cells from apoptosis due to growth factor withdrawal (ShortsCary2007Bone). The protein localizes to the mitochondria in these cells, indicating a potential role in cellular energy metabolism or signaling pathways related to cell proliferation (ShortsCary2007Bone). Despite its mitochondrial localization, BRINP3's overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and migration, particularly under growth-restricted conditions (ShortsCary2007Bone).

## Clinical Significance
BRINP3 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels or genetic variations. In neurodevelopmental disorders, BRINP3 is associated with anxiety and ADHD. Mice lacking the Brinp3 gene exhibit behaviors consistent with these disorders, such as reduced anxiety and altered sociability, suggesting its role in modulating anxiety-related behaviors (Berkowicz2016Mice). Genetic variations at the 1q25.2 locus, where BRINP3 is located, have been linked to ADHD, and altered methylation states of BRINP3 are associated with schizophrenia (Berkowicz2016Mice).

In oncology, BRINP3 is significantly overexpressed in gonadotrope cell pituitary adenomas, where it promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis (ShortsCary2007Bone). This overexpression is not due to genetic mutations, suggesting a regulatory mechanism at play (ShortsCary2007Bone).

BRINP3 is also linked to inflammatory conditions such as peri-implantitis. A polymorphic variant, rs1342913, is associated with this condition, highlighting a genetic predisposition to peri-implantitis and potentially chronic periodontitis (Casado2015Different). These findings underscore the gene's clinical significance across various medical fields.
