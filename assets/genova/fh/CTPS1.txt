# CTPS1

## Overview
CTPS1, or CTP synthase 1, is a gene that encodes the enzyme CTP synthase 1, which is crucial for the de novo synthesis of cytidine triphosphate (CTP). This enzyme is categorized as a synthetase and plays a vital role in nucleotide metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of RNA and DNA. CTP synthase 1 catalyzes the conversion of uridine triphosphate (UTP) to CTP, a reaction that is essential for maintaining the nucleotide pool balance necessary for cell proliferation and nucleic acid synthesis (van1995Cytidine; Martin2020Impaired). The enzyme is highly expressed in T lymphocytes and is upregulated in response to T cell receptor stimulation, underscoring its importance in immune responses (Martin2020Impaired). CTPS1 is also involved in broader cellular processes, including interactions with proteins related to cytoskeletal organization and pyrimidine synthesis (Higgins2008Human). Mutations in the CTPS1 gene can lead to immunodeficiency disorders, while its overexpression has been linked to certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Martin2020Impaired; Lin2022CTPS1).

## Structure
CTP synthase 1 (CTPS1) is an enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of cytidine triphosphate (CTP), essential for RNA and DNA synthesis. The primary structure of CTPS1 consists of a 591-amino-acid polypeptide chain, which includes an N-terminal synthetase domain and a C-terminal glutaminase domain (Lin2022CTPS1). The secondary structure of CTPS1 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of many enzymes, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of CTPS1 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. CTPS1 can form a quaternary structure as a homotetramer, a common feature that allows for cooperative interactions between subunits, enhancing its functional efficiency. The enzyme is known to interact with other proteins, such as tubulin, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, specifically at Serine 575 (S575), which suggests that phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification affecting its function (Higgins2008Human).

CTPS1 also interacts with various proteins, including those involved in cytoskeletal organization and pyrimidine synthesis, indicating its role in broader cellular processes beyond nucleotide synthesis (Higgins2008Human).

## Function
CTPS1 (CTP synthase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the de novo synthesis of cytidine triphosphate (CTP), a nucleotide essential for DNA and RNA synthesis. It catalyzes the ATP-dependent amination of uridine triphosphate (UTP) to CTP, a process crucial for maintaining the nucleotide pool balance necessary for cell proliferation and nucleic acid synthesis (van1995Cytidine; Martin2020Impaired). CTPS1 activity is particularly important during the S phase of the cell cycle, where the demand for nucleotides is high to support DNA replication (Martin2020Impaired).

In healthy human cells, CTPS1 is highly expressed in T lymphocytes and is upregulated in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, facilitating rapid cellular proliferation and the production of effector molecules necessary for immune responses (Martin2020Impaired). CTPS1 is also crucial for the proliferation and differentiation of certain immune cells, such as invariant natural killer T (iNKT) and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, indicating its importance in immune cell expansion and maintenance (Martin2020Impaired).

CTPS1 is regulated by phosphorylation, which increases its catalytic turnover and facilitates its active tetrameric form, essential for its enzymatic function (Han2005Expression). This regulation ensures the proper synthesis of CTP, supporting both nucleotide metabolism and membrane phospholipid synthesis pathways (Han2005Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTPS1 gene are associated with a combined immunodeficiency phenotype, primarily due to a hypomorphic homozygous mutation. This mutation leads to severe viral infections early in life, particularly with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Martin2020Impaired; Latour2018Inherited). Patients with CTPS1 deficiency exhibit a marked reduction in the proliferation of T cells in response to T-cell receptor activation, although other T-cell effector functions remain intact (Martin2020Impaired). The deficiency is characterized by reduced numbers of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and memory B cells (Martin2020Impaired).

CTPS1 overexpression has been linked to certain cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In TNBC, the YBX1/CTPS1 axis promotes tumor progression, with high CTPS1 expression correlating with poorer prognosis (Lin2022CTPS1). In MCL, high CTPS1 expression is associated with unfavorable outcomes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Durand2024Selective). CTPS1's role in these cancers highlights its involvement in cell proliferation and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CTP synthase 1 (CTPS1) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing its function and localization within the cell. One significant interaction is with tubulin, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK 293 cells, where tubulin coimmunoprecipitated with CTPS1. This interaction is dependent on CTPS1, as preabsorbing the α-CTPS1 antibody with the antigenic peptide abrogated the coimmunoprecipitation. CTPS1 also specifically interacts with α-tubulin, but not with protein-A agarose alone, indicating an α-tubulin-dependent interaction (Higgins2008Human).

CTPS1 also interacts with the peptidyl prolyl isomerase Pin1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner at Ser 575. This interaction was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Higgins2008Human). Additionally, CTPS1 is part of a multi-enzyme complex involving carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydrooratase (CAD), which are involved in pyrimidine synthesis (Higgins2008Human).

Phosphorylation plays a crucial role in CTPS1 regulation, with glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) phosphorylating CTPS1 at Ser-571, a site conserved among mammals. This phosphorylation may influence CTPS1 activity by affecting its tetramerization or by recruiting proteins that alter its function (Higgins2007Regulation).
