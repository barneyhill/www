# GPC3

## Overview
GPC3, or glypican 3, is a gene that encodes the glypican-3 protein, a member of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. These proteins are anchored to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and play crucial roles in modulating cell signaling pathways, including Wnt, Hedgehog, and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) pathways (Filmus2008Glypicans; Filmus2008The). Glypican-3 is involved in regulating cell growth and development, acting as both a promoter and inhibitor of various signaling pathways depending on the cellular context. It is particularly significant in liver development and is implicated in several pathological conditions, including Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome and various cancers, where its expression is often dysregulated (Capurro2005Glypican-3; CanoGauci1999Glypican3–Deficient). The protein's ability to interact with multiple signaling molecules underscores its multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Capurro2014Glypican3; Ho2011Glypican3:).

## Structure
Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan anchored to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The primary structure of GPC3 includes a core protein with heparan sulfate chains, which are crucial for its function in modulating signaling pathways such as Wnt and Hedgehog (Filmus2008Glypicans; Capurro2014Glypican3). The secondary structure of GPC3 is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, with 14 conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, stabilizing its tertiary structure (Filmus20123.7; Fransson2004Novel).

GPC3 contains specific domains, including N-terminal and C-terminal regions. The C-terminal domain is particularly significant as it carries glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, which are involved in interactions with other proteins, such as Frizzled in the Wnt signaling pathway (Capurro2014Glypican3). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in GPC3 and play a role in its functional diversity (Fransson2004Novel). GPC3 is also subject to cleavage by furin-like endoproteases, resulting in distinct N-terminal and C-terminal subunits, which are linked by disulfide bonds (Mauro2023Glypican3; Filmus20123.7). Splice variant isoforms of GPC3 exist, contributing to its diverse roles in cellular processes (Fransson2004Novel).

## Function
Glypican 3 (GPC3) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a significant role in regulating cell growth and development. It is anchored to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and is involved in modulating several key signaling pathways, including Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt, and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) (Filmus2001Glypicans; Filmus2008The). GPC3 acts as a negative regulator of the Hedgehog signaling pathway by binding to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) with high affinity, competing with the receptor Patched1 (Ptc1) for binding, and promoting endocytosis and degradation of Hh, thereby inhibiting the pathway (Filmus2008The).

In healthy cells, GPC3 is involved in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis. It is suggested to negatively regulate IGF-II activity, potentially by competing for IGF-II binding, although no direct interaction has been detected (Filmus2001Glypicans). GPC3 is also implicated in the regulation of other growth factors, such as BMP4, and may interact with various molecules independently of its heparan sulfate chains (Filmus2001Glypicans). The protein is active in the extracellular matrix and cell membrane, influencing liver development and growth (Liu2009Investigation). GPC3's expression is developmentally regulated, with high expression during embryogenesis and organogenesis, and limited expression in adult tissues like the lung and ovaries (Liu2009Investigation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPC3 gene are associated with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS), an X-linked overgrowth disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal overgrowth, distinct facial features, and various skeletal and visceral anomalies (Ho2011Glypican3:; CanoGauci1999Glypican3–Deficient). GPC3-deficient mice exhibit several features of SGBS, including developmental overgrowth and abnormal lung and kidney development, although some features like hernias and heart defects are not present (CanoGauci1999Glypican3–Deficient).

In cancer, GPC3 expression is notably altered. It is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it promotes tumor growth by stimulating Wnt signaling, and is associated with poor prognosis (Li2020The; Capurro2005Glypican-3). GPC3 is also overexpressed in other cancers such as melanoma and ovarian clear-cell carcinoma, making it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy (Ho2011Glypican3:). Conversely, GPC3 acts as a tumor suppressor in some cancers, such as breast cancer and malignant mesothelioma, where its expression is often silenced due to promoter hypermethylation (Kim2003The; Murthy2000Expression). In lung adenocarcinoma, GPC3 expression is significantly decreased, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Kim2003The).

## Interactions
Glypican-3 (GPC3) is involved in several key interactions with proteins that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). GPC3 interacts with Wnt proteins, forming complexes with Frizzled receptors, which are crucial for the activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is facilitated by the heparan sulfate (HS) chains of GPC3, which enhance the binding to Frizzled proteins, such as FZD4, FZD7, and FZD8 (Capurro2014Glypican3). The cysteine-rich domain of Frizzled proteins mediates this interaction, and specific sulfations on the HS chains are critical for Wnt binding (Li2020The).

GPC3 also interacts with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and growth factor receptors, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), forming multiprotein complexes that influence cell growth and motility (Akutsu2010Association). In the Hedgehog signaling pathway, GPC3 binds to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and competes with the receptor Patched1 (Ptc1) for Hh binding, acting as a negative regulator of the pathway (Filmus2008The). These interactions underscore GPC3's multifaceted role in modulating various signaling pathways in cancer.
