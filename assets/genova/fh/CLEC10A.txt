# CLEC10A

## Overview
CLEC10A is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain containing 10A, also known as CD301 or macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL). This protein is a C-type lectin receptor predominantly expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages, playing a crucial role in the immune system by recognizing specific carbohydrate structures on glycoproteins. The protein's structure includes a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and a transmembrane domain, which are essential for its function in immune response modulation and cellular localization. CLEC10A is involved in various immune processes, including endocytosis, cytokine secretion, and immune tolerance, and has been implicated in conditions such as cancer and dermatitis due to its interactions with glycan structures and signaling pathways (Tang2022CLEC10A; Heger2018CLEC10A; Kanemaru2019Clec10a).

## Structure
CLEC10A, also known as CD301 or MGL, is a protein characterized by its C-type lectin receptor structure, primarily expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages. The protein features a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that is crucial for its ability to recognize glycan structures, particularly those with terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine. This domain is integral to its function in immune response modulation.

Structurally, CLEC10A includes a single transmembrane domain, which anchors the protein in the cell membrane. This transmembrane domain is essential for its localization and function within the cellular environment. The protein can form homodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure, which may enhance its binding capabilities and functional interactions.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in CLEC10A, potentially affecting its stability, localization, and interaction with other molecules. These modifications are typical for proteins involved in immune recognition and response, as they can influence the protein's affinity for specific glycan structures.

The structural features of CLEC10A, including its CRD, transmembrane domain, and potential for homodimerization, underscore its role in the immune system, particularly in recognizing and binding specific carbohydrate structures on pathogens or host cells.

## Function
CLEC10A, also known as CD301 or macrophage galactose-type lectin, is a C-type lectin receptor primarily expressed on CD1c+ dendritic cells (DCs) and alternatively activated macrophages. It plays a significant role in the immune system by recognizing and binding to specific carbohydrate structures, such as N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), on glycoproteins. This binding is crucial for the receptor's function in endocytosis, where it internalizes upon ligand binding, facilitating antigen uptake and presentation (Heger2018CLEC10A; Hoober2020ASGR1).

CLEC10A is involved in enhancing cytokine secretion when stimulated by toll-like receptor 7/8 ligands, which is important for immune signaling and response (Heger2018CLEC10A). It also plays a role in modulating immune responses by promoting immune tolerance through the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10, which helps prevent overreaction of the immune system (Hoober2020ASGR1).

The receptor is active on the cell surface and within endocytic pathways, influencing cellular communication and immune surveillance. Its rapid internalization upon antibody binding suggests its potential as a target for antigen delivery in immunotherapeutic strategies (Heger2018CLEC10A). CLEC10A's expression is downregulated upon DC maturation, indicating its role in the early stages of immune response (Hoober2020ASGR1).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC10A has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In breast cancer, higher expression levels of CLEC10A are associated with improved overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Tang2022CLEC10A; Kurze2019Immature). CLEC10A expression is linked to immune cell infiltration in breast cancer, correlating with subtypes such as B cells, CD8 T cells, and macrophages, indicating its role in regulating tumor immune infiltration (Tang2022CLEC10A).

In the context of dermatitis, particularly house dust mite-induced dermatitis, a mutation in the Clec10a gene in NC/Nga mice leads to increased hypersensitivity and severe dermatitis. This mutation impairs the transport of Clec10a to the cell surface, resulting in heightened inflammatory responses (Kanemaru2019Clec10a). The absence of Clec10a leads to increased production of inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, exacerbating dermatitis symptoms (Kanemaru2019Clec10a). These findings suggest that CLEC10A plays a critical role in modulating immune responses and inflammation in various conditions.

## Interactions
CLEC10A, also known as the macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL), is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in immune response modulation. CLEC10A recognizes and binds to specific carbohydrate structures, such as the Tn and sialyl Tn antigens, which are often found on mucins in cancer cells. This binding is crucial for its role in immune interactions, particularly in the context of cancer and inflammatory responses (Kurze2019Immature).

In ovarian cancer, CLEC10A interacts with glycoproteins carrying the Tn glycan cluster, such as ERp44, NUCB1, and IGFBP7, which are expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues. These interactions are significant for tumor-dendritic cell interactions and may influence T cell modulation (Napoletano2020Investigating).

CLEC10A also participates in signaling pathways through interactions with proteins like spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1). These interactions are crucial for its role in regulating inflammatory responses, such as those induced by house dust mite (HDM) exposure, where CLEC10A inhibits cytokine production through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling (Kanemaru2019Clec10a).

In breast cancer, CLEC10A's recognition of immature O-glycans is linked to the upregulation of glycosyltransferases like GalNT6, which affects glycan synthesis and presentation on the cell surface (Kurze2019Immature).
