# HDGFL1

## Overview
HDGFL1, or Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor-Like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the HDGF family, which is known for its involvement in nuclear targeting and transcriptional regulation. The HDGF-like 1 protein is categorized as a growth factor and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it plays a role in regulating gene expression and cellular growth pathways. The protein's dual localization suggests its significant involvement in maintaining normal cellular functions and development. Alterations in HDGFL1 expression have been linked to the progression of certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
HDGFL1, or Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor-Like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This protein is a member of the HDGF family, which is recognized for its role in nuclear targeting and transcriptional regulation. HDGFL1 is active in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, where it influences gene expression and cellular growth pathways. The protein's activity in these cellular compartments suggests its involvement in regulating the transcription of genes that are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and growth. By participating in these molecular processes, HDGFL1 plays a significant role in ensuring the proper functioning and development of healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
HDGFL1 (Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor-Like 1) has been implicated in the progression of various cancers due to its role in cell growth and proliferation. Alterations in the expression of HDGFL1 have been associated with liver and gastric cancers, where it may contribute to tumor growth and metastasis. In these cancers, overexpression of HDGFL1 is thought to enhance the aggressive behavior of tumor cells, potentially leading to poorer clinical outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which HDGFL1 influences cancer progression could be crucial for developing targeted therapies aimed at mitigating its effects. Research into HDGFL1's role in cancer could provide insights into novel treatment strategies that specifically target its expression or function, offering potential therapeutic benefits for patients with HDGFL1-related malignancies.
