# OSBPL3

## Overview
OSBPL3, or oxysterol-binding protein-like 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family, which is involved in lipid metabolism and intracellular lipid signaling. The protein product, ORP3, is characterized by its oxysterol-binding domain and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitate interactions with lipids and membrane phosphoinositides, respectively. ORP3 plays a crucial role in regulating cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton organization, and vesicle transport, primarily functioning at membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. These interactions are vital for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and influencing signaling pathways. The protein's involvement in lipid transport and signaling underscores its significance in cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer progression and metastasis (Olkkonen2022The; Olkkonen2013Oxysterolbinding; Bakhtiyari2021Upregulation).

## Structure
OSBPL3, also known as ORP3, is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family characterized by the presence of an oxysterol-binding domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The oxysterol-binding domain is involved in lipid interactions, while the PH domain facilitates membrane association through phosphoinositide binding (Jaworski2001A; Lehto2003The). The protein has a molecular mass of approximately 101.2 kDa and consists of 887 amino acids (Jaworski2001A).

The OSBP-related ligand-binding domain (ORD) of OSBPL3 is structurally similar to that of yeast Osh3p, featuring a b-barrel-like fold with a pocket closed by an a-helical lid, which is crucial for binding cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) (Olkkonen2013Oxysterolbinding). The amino acid sequence identity between human ORP3 and zebrafish Osbpl3 is 71%, indicating a high degree of conservation, particularly in the lipid-binding pocket (Zhou2014A).

OSBPL3 undergoes alternative splicing, which can result in variants with in-frame exon skipping, potentially affecting its function and localization (Jaworski2001A). These structural features and modifications suggest a role in lipid metabolism and transport, with potential implications for cellular signaling and vesicle transport.

## Function
OSBPL3, encoded by the OSBPL3 gene, is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family involved in lipid metabolism and intracellular lipid signaling. It plays a significant role in regulating cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton organization, and vesicle transport. OSBPL3 is active in the cytoplasm and at membrane contact sites, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane, where it influences cell signaling and membrane dynamics (Bakhtiyari2021Upregulation; Hao2021Clinical).

The protein contains a C-terminal OSBP-related ligand-binding domain (ORD) that binds oxidized cholesterol derivatives and an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that interacts with membrane phosphoinositides. These domains are crucial for its role in lipid metabolism and sterol transport (Bakhtiyari2021Upregulation). OSBPL3 is involved in the regulation of cholesterol and phospholipids, affecting cellular lipid homeostasis and signaling pathways (Lehto2003The).

In healthy cells, OSBPL3's interaction with the R-Ras pathway is important for cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization, impacting cellular morphology and movement (Bakhtiyari2021Upregulation). Its activity at membrane contact sites also influences the assembly of protein complexes and the activity of enzymatic effectors, contributing to its regulatory roles in cellular processes (Bakhtiyari2021Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
The OSBPL3 gene has significant clinical implications in various cancers due to its altered expression and mutations. High expression of OSBPL3 is observed in several major cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), liver cancer, and low-grade glioma, where it is often associated with poor prognosis. In CRC, high OSBPL3 expression correlates with poor overall survival and is linked to KRAS mutations, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target (Wang2023Prognostic; Zhang2022The). In liver cancer, OSBPL3 overexpression is associated with immune infiltration and poor survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Tian2023The).

Mutations in OSBPL3, such as the X676_splice/V676G alteration, are linked to poor outcomes in cancers like skin cutaneous melanoma and metastatic breast cancer (Hao2021Clinical). The gene's expression is also associated with tumor mutational burden, which can influence the efficacy of immunotherapy (Hao2021Clinical). In colon cancer, downregulation of OSBPL3 is linked to reduced survival, particularly in patients with advanced nodal metastasis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Xu2020Downregulation). These findings underscore the gene's role in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
OSBPL3, also known as ORP3, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with R-Ras, a Ras paralogue, to regulate cell surface protrusions, actin cytoskeletal morphology, cell spreading, and integrin activity. This interaction is crucial for activating R-Ras signaling pathways (Olkkonen2022The). OSBPL3 also interacts with the ER anchor protein VAPA in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, which is essential for its association with the plasma membrane upon protein kinase C activation. This interaction facilitates the extraction of PI4P and increases cholesterol levels (Olkkonen2022The).

Additionally, OSBPL3 forms a complex with IQSec1, a GTP exchange factor for Arf5 GTPase. This complex translocates to ER-plasma membrane contacts, impacting focal adhesion turnover, which is critical for cell migration and metastasis (Olkkonen2022The). The interaction with VAPA is part of a larger mechanism where OSBPL3, through its oxysterol-binding domain, participates in lipid transport and signaling at membrane contact sites (de2021Nanoscale). These interactions highlight OSBPL3's role in cellular lipid metabolism and its potential impact on cancer progression and metastasis (Olkkonen2022The).
