# ELF4

## Overview
ELF4, or E74 like ETS transcription factor 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, which are characterized by their ability to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. The protein encoded by ELF4, also referred to as ELF4, plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including immune response, cell cycle regulation, and cellular homeostasis. As a transcription factor, ELF4 is involved in the activation of immune-related genes and is essential for the development and function of natural killer (NK) and NK-T cells. It also participates in the regulation of the cell cycle and DNA damage response, influencing the activity of tumor suppressor pathways. ELF4's interactions with other proteins and its involvement in transcriptional networks underscore its significance in both normal physiology and disease states, such as cancer and immunodeficiency disorders (Suico2016Roles).

## Structure
The ELF4 gene encodes a protein that is 663 amino acids long and includes several distinct regions and domains. It features an activation domain at the N-terminal region and an ETS domain, which is responsible for binding to a DNA consensus sequence (Suico2016Roles). The protein also contains a serine/threonine-rich region and a proline-rich region. Two nuclear localization signals are located at amino acids 173-183 and 196-202, indicating its primary localization in the nucleus (Suico2016Roles).

Post-translational modifications of ELF4 include ubiquitination and degradation in the nucleus, as well as phosphorylation at the C-terminal region, particularly at serine and threonine residues from 641-657 amino acids (Suico2016Roles). These modifications are crucial for the protein's function and stability.

ELF4 can interact with various proteins at either the N-terminal or C-terminal region, allowing it to function as a transcriptional activator or through interactions with partner proteins (Suico2016Roles). The protein's structure and modifications enable it to play significant roles in immune response, signaling, and other cellular processes. The presence of different isoforms due to alternative splicing is also a characteristic of ELF4, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The ELF4 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various biological processes, particularly in the immune system and cell cycle regulation. In healthy human cells, ELF4 is involved in the activation of immune-related molecules such as interleukin (IL)-3 and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in myeloid and T cell lines, contributing to immune responses (Suico2016Roles). It also regulates the expression of the human beta defensin 2 (HβD2) and IL-8, which are crucial for recruiting leukocytes to infection sites (Suico2016Roles).

ELF4 is essential for the development and function of natural killer (NK) and NK-T cells, including the expression of the perforin gene and secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ (Suico2016Roles). It interacts with the STING-MAVS-TBK1 complex during viral infections, leading to the activation of type I interferon responses (Suico2016Roles). ELF4 also plays a role in cell cycle progression by driving the transition from the G1 to S phase and facilitating the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (Suico2016Roles).

In addition to its immune functions, ELF4 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by influencing the activity of the tumor suppressor p53 and participating in the cellular DNA damage response (Suico2016Roles). It is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate the transcription of target genes (Suico2016Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ELF4 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. ELF4 plays a significant role in maintaining intestinal health, and its suppression is linked to increased susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CAC). In UC, ELF4 deficiency leads to impaired function of innate lymphoid cells type 3 (ILC3s), resulting in increased inflammation and a higher risk of CAC (Du2021Suppression). ELF4 is also crucial for DNA damage repair, and its suppression can lead to increased DNA damage and tumorigenesis, particularly in the context of colitis-associated cancer (Du2021Suppression).

Mutations in ELF4 have been linked to immunodeficiency disorders. For instance, a W231R mutation in ELF4 is associated with a novel X-linked autoinflammatory and immunodeficiency disease (X-AIDE), characterized by recurrent infections and inflammation due to impaired immune responses (Sun2022Loss). ELF4 mutations can also lead to X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia with growth hormone deficiency (XLH-GHD), a rare disorder marked by chronic infections and tissue inflammation (Suico2016Roles).

In cancer, ELF4's role is complex, acting as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor depending on the context. It is implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers, where aberrant interactions with oncofusion proteins can disrupt its normal function (Suico2016Roles).

## Interactions
ELF4, a member of the ETS transcription factor family, engages in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with proteins such as AML1, PML, and STING, which are involved in immune response and signaling pathways (Suico2016Roles). ELF4 also forms complexes with AML1/ETO, affecting its transactivating ability and potentially contributing to the dysregulation of myeloid differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Suico2016Roles). 

In the context of cancer, ELF4 interacts with nucleophosmin (NPM1), where the wild-type NPM1 inhibits ELF4 activity, but mutant NPM1 does not, potentially enhancing ELF4's transactivation potential (Suico2016Roles). ELF4 also binds to the promoter regions of target genes, such as human beta defensin 2 (HβD2) and perforin, to activate transcription, playing a crucial role in immune responses (Suico2016Roles).

In glioblastoma, ELF4 is part of a miRNA-transcription factor network, interacting with miRNAs like miR-124 and miR-128, which regulate its expression. ELF4 directly regulates genes involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and lipid homeostasis, impacting glioblastoma cell survival and identity (Kosti2022ELF4).
