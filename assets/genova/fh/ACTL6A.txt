# ACTL6A

## Overview
ACTL6A is a gene that encodes the protein actin-like 6A, which is a member of the actin-related protein family. This protein is a critical component of chromatin remodeling complexes, particularly the BAF (BRG1/BRM-associated factor) complex, where it plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. Actin-like 6A is involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells and facilitating neuronal differentiation. It interacts with several key proteins, such as beta actin and SMARCA4/BRG1, to enhance chromatin binding and ATPase activity, although it does not possess ATPase activity itself (Marom2017Heterozygous; Lu2015Actl6a). The protein's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications and its ability to form complexes with other proteins, which are essential for its role in chromatin remodeling and regulation. ACTL6A is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Sima2019The; Marom2017Heterozygous).

## Structure
ACTL6A, or actin-like 6A, is a protein characterized by its actin fold, a structural motif common among actin-related proteins. This fold is integral to its function in chromatin remodeling. The protein is known to form complexes with other proteins, contributing to its quaternary structure. These complexes are essential for its role in chromatin remodeling, as they facilitate interactions with other molecular components.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are believed to regulate the function of ACTL6A. These modifications can influence the protein's activity and interactions, although specific sites and effects of these modifications are not detailed in the available context.

ACTL6A may also exist in different splice variant isoforms. These isoforms can potentially alter the protein's structure and function, although specific details about the differences between these isoforms are not provided. The presence of these variants suggests a level of functional diversity, allowing ACTL6A to participate in various cellular processes.

Overall, the structural features of ACTL6A, including its actin fold and ability to form protein complexes, are crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling and regulation.

## Function
ACTL6A (actin-like 6A) is a crucial component of the BAF (BRG1/BRM-associated factor) complex, a chromatin remodeling complex that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. This protein is involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state of embryonic stem cells and epidermal progenitor cells, and it is essential for proper neuronal and hematopoietic development (Marom2017Heterozygous). In neural development, ACTL6A is replaced by ACTL6B, facilitating the transition from the neural progenitor npBAF complex to the neural-specific nBAF complex, which is necessary for mitotic exit and neuronal differentiation (Marom2017Heterozygous).

ACTL6A interacts with beta actin (ACTB) and SMARCA4/BRG1, enhancing the chromatin binding and ATPase activity of the BAF complex, although it does not possess ATPase activity itself (Marom2017Heterozygous). It is also a part of the Tip60-p400 complex, which is crucial for maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells by preventing differentiation into primitive endoderm (Lu2015Actl6a). ACTL6A's interaction with Nanog, a key pluripotency factor, promotes Nanog's binding to target genes, supporting its role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency (Lu2015Actl6a).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ACTL6A gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and intellectual disability. In cancer, ACTL6A is frequently amplified and overexpressed in various types, including ovarian, cervical, and lung cancers, correlating with poor patient survival and aggressive tumor phenotypes (Wang2021Potential; Sima2019The; Zhang2019ACTL6A). It plays a role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion, contributing to cancer progression (Sima2019The; Shrestha2021Abstract). ACTL6A also interacts with the Hippo signaling pathway, influencing cancer cell proliferation and motility (Dang2020Actinlike).

In the context of intellectual disability, heterozygous variants in ACTL6A are associated with developmental disorders. These variants can lead to impaired protein interactions within the BAF complex, resulting in intellectual disability and developmental delays (Marom2017Heterozygous). The gene is highly intolerant to loss-of-function variations, suggesting haploinsufficiency as a potential mechanism for these disorders (Marom2017Heterozygous). These findings underscore the importance of ACTL6A in both oncogenic processes and neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
ACTL6A, also known as BAF53A, is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with YAP/TAZ proteins, stabilizing them by preventing their degradation through disruption of their interaction with β-TrCP, a ubiquitin ligase that targets them for proteasomal degradation. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization and nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ, enhancing their transcriptional activity in glioma cells (Ji2018Actin).

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), ACTL6A interacts with Sox2 and p53 proteins. It co-localizes and co-immunoprecipitates with Sox2, suggesting a role in regulating the Notch1 signaling pathway, which is involved in cell differentiation. The interaction with p53 is also significant, as it modulates ACTL6A expression and influences cell differentiation (Zhong2019ACTL6A).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ACTL6A is co-amplified with p63, forming a complex that represses differentiation-promoting genes like WWC1. This complex regulates chromatin accessibility and gene expression, maintaining an undifferentiated, proliferative state in cancer cells (Saladi2017ACTL6A).
