# PSMC6

## Overview
PSMC6 is a gene that encodes the protein proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 6, which is a critical component of the 26S proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. The protein belongs to the AAA (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) family and plays a pivotal role in the ATP-dependent unfolding and translocation of ubiquitinated proteins into the proteasome core for degradation. This process is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and regulating various biological processes, including cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Tanahashi1998Chromosomal; Mao2020Structure). PSMC6 is part of the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, where it contributes to substrate recognition and processing, and interacts with other proteasome subunits to facilitate its function (Xiong2024The; Shi2017CRISPR). The gene's expression and regulation have been implicated in several diseases, including osteoporosis and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2020PSMC6; Kao2021Prognoses).

## Structure
PSMC6, also known as RPT6, is a subunit of the 26S proteasome complex, which plays a crucial role in protein degradation. The protein is part of the AAA (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) family and features a conserved ATPase domain. Structurally, PSMC6 is organized with an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain, an oligonucleotide-and oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domain, and a C-terminal AAA domain (Mao2020Structure). The AAA domain of PSMC6 has a unique fold that is important for substrate engagement, consisting of an N-terminal α/β subdomain and a smaller C-terminal α-helical subdomain (Mao2020Structure).

In the quaternary structure, PSMC6 forms part of a heterohexameric ATPase ring within the 26S proteasome's regulatory particle. This ring acts as a mechanical motor, unfolding substrates and translocating them through the central pore, a process powered by ATP hydrolysis (Mao2020Structure). PSMC6 is unique among the RPT subunits as it does not insert into the core particle, suggesting it may serve as a pivotal anchor for the proteasome's dynamic mechanism (Xiong2024The). The protein's structure is integral to the proteasome's function in substrate recognition and translocation.

## Function
PSMC6 is a subunit of the 26S proteasome, a complex essential for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. It functions as an ATPase, providing the energy required for unfolding and translocating substrates into the proteasome core, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating protein turnover (Tanahashi1998Chromosomal). The 26S proteasome, where PSMC6 is a component, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and protein quality control (Tanahashi1998Chromosomal).

PSMC6 is part of the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, which is involved in recognizing and processing ubiquitinated proteins for degradation. This activity is vital for cellular homeostasis and the regulation of numerous signaling pathways (Shi2017CRISPR). The ATPase activity of PSMC6 is necessary for the proteasome's function, particularly in the context of drug resistance in multiple myeloma cells, although its specific role in healthy human cells is not directly addressed in the studies (Shi2017CRISPR).

In addition to its role in protein degradation, PSMC6 is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation, as seen in studies involving osteoblasts, where it influences the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Zhang2020PSMC6).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSMC6 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly osteoporosis and various cancers. In the context of osteoporosis, PSMC6 is known to promote osteoblast apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. This mechanism has been studied in an ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis mouse model, where PSMC6 knockout resulted in increased bone mineral density and reduced apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for osteoporosis treatment (Zhang2020PSMC6).

In cancer, PSMC6 is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and is associated with poor survival outcomes. It is involved in pathways related to cancer progression, such as calcium-mediated signaling and hormone-related pathways, indicating its oncogenic role (Kao2021Prognoses). PSMC6 is also overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), with its expression linked to poor prognosis and potential as a diagnostic marker. The gene's overexpression in LUAD is associated with less methylated promoter regions, which may contribute to its upregulation (Ullah2022Evaluating). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PSMC6 in both osteoporosis and cancer, suggesting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
PSMC6, a subunit of the 26S proteasome complex, plays a crucial role in protein degradation by interacting with other proteasome subunits and regulatory particles. It is part of the 19S regulatory particle (RP) and forms the RPT ring, which anchors the 19S RP to the 20S core particle (CP) of the proteasome. This interaction is essential for the proteasome's function, as it facilitates the unfolding and translocation of substrate proteins into the proteasome for degradation through ATP hydrolysis (Xiong2024The).

PSMC6 also interacts with the deubiquitinase Rpn11, stimulating its activity and aiding in the opening of the α-ring gated channel, which is necessary for substrate entry into the proteasome (Xiong2024The). In the context of Alzheimer's disease, PSMC6 is part of a network of proteasome subunits, including PSMA2, PSMA4, and PSME1, that exhibit significant intercorrelation, suggesting enhanced coordination among existing proteasomes to counterbalance the reduced total number of proteasomes (Xiong2024The).

In multiple myeloma, PSMC6 has been identified as a key gene conferring resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Its absence leads to resistance, highlighting its role in proteasome function and drug response (Shi2017CRISPR).
