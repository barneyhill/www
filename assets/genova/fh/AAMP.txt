# AAMP

## Overview
The AAMP gene encodes the angio-associated migratory cell protein, a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as cell migration and angiogenesis. AAMP is characterized by its structural features, including WD40 repeat domains and immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate its role as an adaptor or scaffold in multi-protein complexes. These structural elements enable AAMP to participate in dynamic protein-protein interactions, contributing to its involvement in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. The protein's functions are essential for processes like wound healing and tissue regeneration, where efficient cell movement and structural reorganization are necessary. AAMP's role in angiogenesis is particularly significant, as it supports the formation of new blood vessels, ensuring adequate blood supply to tissues. This function is vital for maintaining vascular health and aiding in tissue growth and repair (Reid2011Interaction; Beckner1996AAMP; Ren2023A).

## Structure
The angio-associated migratory cell protein (AAMP) is a 434 amino acid protein involved in cell migration and angiogenesis. It was initially predicted to be a 452 amino acid protein with a heparin-binding motif, but further analysis confirmed the absence of this domain (Reid2011Interaction). AAMP contains six WD40 repeat domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and are part of intracellular multimeric complexes involved in regulatory events (Reid2011Interaction; Beckner1996AAMP). These WD40 repeats contribute to the protein's role as an adaptor or scaffold in multi-protein complexes, forming a β-propeller fold (Reid2011Interaction).

AAMP also includes two immunoglobulin-like domains, suggesting its inclusion in the immunoglobulin superfamily (Reid2011Interaction; Beckner1996AAMP). The protein is predicted to have a putative membrane association domain, which may play a role in its interaction with other proteins, such as the thromboxane A2 receptor isoforms TPα and TPβ (Reid2011Interaction). AAMP's structure allows it to participate in dynamic, reversible interactions, potentially accounting for its multifunctional role in migratory cells (Beckner1996AAMP).

## Function
AAMP (angio associated migratory cell protein) is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to cell migration and angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels. In healthy human cells, AAMP plays a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility by interacting with actin filaments. This interaction is crucial for processes such as wound healing and tissue regeneration, where efficient cell movement and structural reorganization are necessary for recovery and repair. AAMP is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it contributes to these cellular dynamics (Ren2023A).

The protein's involvement in angiogenesis is particularly important for maintaining vascular health and supporting tissue growth and repair. By facilitating the formation of new blood vessels, AAMP helps ensure adequate blood supply to tissues, which is essential for delivering nutrients and oxygen and removing waste products. This function is vital in both normal physiological conditions and in response to injury, where rapid vascularization can aid in healing (Ren2023A).

While the specific functions of AAMP in healthy cells are not extensively detailed in the provided context, its role in these fundamental processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Interactions
AAMP (angio-associated migratory cell protein) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the Nod2 protein, a member of the NLR family, through its internal domain containing WD40 repeats. This interaction was identified via a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed in human cells. AAMP's interaction with Nod2 suggests a role in modulating Nod2-mediated NF-κB activation, acting as a negative regulator (Bielig2009A).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, AAMP interacts with cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), a GTPase involved in cytoskeletal regulation. This interaction enhances cell motility by promoting pseudopodia formation, crucial for migration and invasion. AAMP overexpression increases CDC42 activation, while its knockdown reduces it (Yao2021Angioassociated).

AAMP also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in NSCLC cells, promoting EGFR dimerization and phosphorylation, which activates downstream signaling pathways like ERK1/2 MAPK, involved in cell growth and proliferation (Yao2019Angioassociated).

Additionally, AAMP interacts with the TPα and TPβ isoforms of the human thromboxane A2 receptor, with specific regions within the C-tail domains of these receptors being critical for interaction. This interaction is constitutive and modulated by receptor activation (Reid2011Interaction).
