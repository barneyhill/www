# LILRA2

## Overview
LILRA2 is a gene that encodes the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A2, a receptor involved in immune regulation. This receptor is part of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) family and is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate its role in immune signaling. LILRA2 is primarily expressed on immune cells such as monocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, where it plays a critical role in recognizing bacterially cleaved immunoglobulins and fibrinogen, thereby activating immune responses. The receptor's activation is mediated through its association with the FcRγ chain, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), leading to the production of reactive oxygen species and cytokines. LILRA2's unique ability to bind specific ligands and its involvement in immune signaling pathways make it a significant player in both innate and adaptive immunity, with implications in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Lewis2020Leukocyte; Yamazaki2020Molecular; Li2024Fibrinogen).

## Structure
LILRA2 is a member of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) family, characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains. The extracellular region of LILRA2 typically consists of four Ig-like domains (D1, D2, D3, and D4) (Yamazaki2020Molecular). The binding site for its interaction with N-truncated immunoglobulins is located on domain 2, featuring a hydrophobic patch composed of residues V121, W152, and W154, which are crucial for binding (Yamazaki2020Molecular). This interaction is enthalpy-driven with a small entropy loss, suggesting a hydrophobic effect and/or maintenance of conformational flexibility upon complex formation (Yamazaki2020Molecular).

LILRA2 does not bind to HLA class I molecules, likely due to structural differences despite high sequence identity with other group 1 LILRs (Hirayasu2015Functional). It has a unique functional SNP that results in an alternative splicing isoform lacking three amino acids in the stalk region, which is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and microscopic polyangiitis (Hirayasu2015Functional).

The receptor is an activating LILR, featuring a positively charged Arg residue in the transmembrane domain that facilitates coupling with the FcRγ chain containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (Kuroki2012Molecular). This structural configuration is essential for its role in immune signaling.

## Function
LILRA2, also known as leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A2, is an immune regulatory receptor expressed on various immune cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. It plays a crucial role in the immune response by recognizing and binding to bacterially cleaved immunoglobulins, specifically N-truncated immunoglobulins, which are generated by bacterial proteases. This interaction is characterized by a strong avidity effect and is enthalpically driven, suggesting a hydrophobic effect and/or maintenance of conformational flexibility upon binding (Yamazaki2020Molecular).

LILRA2 is involved in activating immune responses by stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neutrophils and inducing cytokine production in monocytes. This activation occurs through ITAM signaling pathways, likely involving co-association with FcRγ on neutrophils (Lewis2020Leukocyte). The receptor's ability to detect altered antibodies and activate immune cells helps the body respond to microbial infections and counteract bacterial evasion strategies (Nottelet2021The).

LILRA2 does not bind to HLA class I molecules, distinguishing it from other LILR family members, and is involved in modulating immune responses, potentially influencing conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis (Truong2018Leukocyte; Hirayasu2015Functional).

## Clinical Significance
LILRA2 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in immune response regulation. Alterations in LILRA2 expression are associated with lepromatous leprosy, where its expression is elevated in lesions, suggesting a role in the disease's pathology by modulating immune responses and contributing to a Th2 cytokine response (Trowsdale2015Surveillance; Hirayasu2015Functional). In rheumatoid arthritis, the number of LILRA2-expressing cells in synovial tissue correlates with disease severity, indicating its involvement in inflammatory processes (Hirayasu2015Functional).

A unique single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in LILRA2, which disrupts the splice acceptor site of intron 6, is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and microscopic polyangiitis, highlighting its genetic influence on autoimmune conditions (Hirayasu2015Functional). LILRA2's interaction with fibrinogen is also significant in inflammatory responses, as it can alter cytokine production in monocytes, potentially contributing to diseases like microscopic polyangiitis (Li2024Fibrinogen).

In breast cancer, LILRA2 may influence the immune environment by inhibiting dendritic cell differentiation and promoting a Th2 response, which could support tumor progression (GotoYamaguchi2018Therapeutic). These findings underscore LILRA2's clinical significance in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
LILRA2, a member of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor family, participates in several interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in immune regulation. It specifically binds to bacterially cleaved immunoglobulins (N-truncated Igs), recognizing the exposed variable light (V_L) and N-terminal peptide of the cleaved variable heavy (V_H) chain. This interaction is characterized by enthalpically driven binding with minimal entropy loss, suggesting a hydrophobic effect and maintenance of conformational flexibility (Yamazaki2020Molecular). The binding involves a hydrophobic patch on LILRA2 domain 2, with key residues such as V121, W152, and W154 being crucial for this interaction (Yamazaki2020Molecular).

LILRA2 also interacts with fibrinogen, an endogenous ligand, which induces inflammatory responses. This interaction is implicated in the upregulation of inflammation-related genes and is linked to TNF signaling pathways. LILRA2 recognizes solid-phase fibrinogen, which is present on platelet surfaces during clot formation and on bacterial surfaces, potentially playing a role in immune responses against bacterial invasion (Li2024Fibrinogen). These interactions highlight LILRA2's role in recognizing and responding to microbial infections and inflammatory processes, contributing to both innate and adaptive immunity.
