# DUOX1

## Overview
The DUOX1 gene encodes the dual oxidase 1 protein, a member of the NADPH oxidase family, which is primarily involved in the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) across various tissues. This transmembrane enzyme plays a critical role in cellular processes such as thyroid hormone biosynthesis, epithelial cell integrity, and wound healing. DUOX1 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple transmembrane helices, an extracellular peroxidase-like domain, and calcium-binding EF-hand motifs that regulate its activity (Wu2021Structures; Ohye2010Dual). The protein forms a functional heterotetrameric complex with DUOXA1, which is essential for its maturation and localization to the plasma membrane (Wu2021Structures). DUOX1's enzymatic activity is modulated by calcium ions, which enhance its ability to transfer electrons from NADPH to oxygen, producing H2O2 (Wu2021Structures). Mutations in the DUOX1 gene have been associated with congenital hypothyroidism, highlighting its clinical significance in thyroid health (Liu2019Identification).

## Structure
The human dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1) protein is a complex structure with several distinct domains. It is a glycoprotein composed of 1551 amino acids and contains seven transmembrane helices, an extracellular peroxidase-like domain, and a long intracellular loop with two EF-hand motifs, which are calcium-binding sites crucial for its regulatory function (Ohye2010Dual). The protein forms a heterotetrameric complex with DUOXA1, organized into three layers: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytosolic (Wu2021Structures).

The extracellular layer features large N-terminal peroxidase homology domains (PHD) of DUOX1, which, despite their homology, lack key residues for heme binding, suggesting limited enzymatic activity (Wu2020Structure). The transmembrane domain (TMD) includes 24 helices and two heme-binding sites, coordinated by conserved histidines, facilitating electron transfer (Wu2021Structures). The cytosolic layer contains the catalytic dehydrogenase (DH) domain, which binds NADPH and FAD, essential for the protein's catalytic activity (Wu2020Structure).

DUOX1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which are important for its function and stability (Ohye2010Dual). The protein's activity is regulated by calcium, with calcium ions enhancing its catalytic activity by stabilizing the dehydrogenase domain (Wu2021Structures).

## Function
DUOX1 (dual oxidase 1) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a reactive oxygen species involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, DUOX1 is primarily active in the plasma membrane and is crucial for maintaining epithelial cell integrity and wound healing (CHEN2016Dual). It is highly expressed in thyroid tissue, where it catalyzes the production of hydrogen peroxide necessary for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones (Wu2021Structures).

DUOX1 is part of the NOX protein family and functions by transferring electrons from intracellular NADPH to extracellular oxygen, resulting in the production of hydrogen peroxide (Wu2021Structures). The enzyme's activity is regulated by intracellular calcium concentrations, with calcium ions enhancing its catalytic activity by stabilizing the dehydrogenase domain for electron transfer (Wu2021Structures). DUOX1 forms a heterotetrameric complex with DUOXA1, which is essential for its maturation and proper localization to the plasma membrane (Wu2021Structures).

In addition to its role in thyroid hormone synthesis, DUOX1 is involved in host defense mechanisms and cellular signaling, contributing to the regulation of reactive oxygen species levels in various tissues (CHEN2016Dual).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DUOX1 gene have been implicated in congenital hypothyroidism (CH), a condition characterized by insufficient thyroid hormone production. Specifically, a heterozygous missense mutation in DUOX1, resulting in an arginine-to-glutamine substitution at amino acid 1307 (p.R1307Q), has been associated with transient congenital hypothyroidism. This mutation leads to a partial defect in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, which is crucial for thyroid hormone synthesis (Liu2019Identification). The impaired H2O2 generation due to DUOX1 mutations disrupts the iodine organification process necessary for thyroid hormone production, contributing to the development of CH (Liu2019Identification).

In addition to congenital hypothyroidism, alterations in DUOX1 expression have been linked to various thyroid conditions. While DUOX1 plays a minor role compared to DUOX2 in H2O2 production, its proper function is essential for maintaining thyroid hormone synthesis. The presence of DUOX1 mutations can exacerbate the severity of CH, especially when combined with mutations in other related genes such as DUOX2 (De2019DUOX). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DUOX1 in thyroid health and disease.

## Interactions
DUOX1, a member of the NADPH oxidase family, forms a complex with the auxiliary protein DUOXA1, which is essential for its maturation and activity. This complex is a symmetric 2:2 heterotetramer, stabilized by extensive inter-subunit interactions. DUOXA1 is crucial for the proper maturation and plasma membrane localization of DUOX1, and its N-terminus is vital for hydrogen peroxide generation. Specific interactions include the insertion of DUOXA1 side chains (F8, F10, Y11) into a hydrophobic groove of DUOX1, and electrostatic interactions between K15 of DUOXA1 and D1077 of DUOX1 (Wu2021Structures).

The DUOX1-DUOXA1 complex undergoes conformational changes upon calcium activation, which affects electron transfer efficiency and catalytic activity. The EF-hand calcium-binding module of DUOX1, which includes EF1 and EF2 domains, binds calcium ions and is crucial for the protein's activation. These interactions are mainly hydrophobic and involve specific residues, facilitating the interaction with cofactors such as FAD and NADPH (Wu2021Structures).

DUOX1 also interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in the context of DUOXA1-mediated hydrogen peroxide production, which can inhibit differentiation and induce apoptosis in muscle cells (Sandiford2014Dual). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving DUOX1 in cellular processes.
