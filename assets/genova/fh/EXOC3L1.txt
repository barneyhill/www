# EXOC3L1

## Overview
EXOC3L1 is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 3 like 1, which is a part of the exocyst complex, an octameric protein assembly involved in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. This protein plays a crucial role in exocytosis, a process essential for intercellular communication and the release of cellular contents. EXOC3L1 is implicated in various cellular functions, including lipid metabolism, insulin secretion, and vascular biology, due to its involvement in the trafficking of lipid receptors and its expression in diverse tissues such as the heart, liver, and vascular endothelium (MATSUMOTO2021Overexpressed; Lanktree2015Genetic). Additionally, EXOC3L1 has been associated with apoptosis regulation, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (MATSUMOTO2021Overexpressed). The gene's expression and interactions have clinical significance, particularly in cancer prognosis and lipid metabolism, underscoring its potential as a biomarker for various conditions (Lanktree2015Genetic; Zhang2022A).

## Function
EXOC3L1, a component of the exocyst complex, plays a significant role in cellular processes such as exocytosis, which is crucial for intercellular communication and the release of cellular contents. This protein is involved in the trafficking of lipid receptors, impacting lipid metabolism and influencing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations. A genetic study identified a significant association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near EXOC3L1 and increased HDL levels, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism (Lanktree2015Genetic).

EXOC3L1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, cerebellum, pituitary, adrenal gland, and pancreatic islets. It is involved in regulating insulin secretion, indicating its role in metabolic processes (MATSUMOTO2021Overexpressed). The protein is also strongly expressed in vascular endothelium, suggesting a role in vascular biology (Lanktree2015Genetic).

In terms of cellular localization, EXOC3L1 is part of the exocyst complex, which targets vesicles to specific sites on the plasma membrane, facilitating processes like cell growth, secretion, and membrane protein recycling. This positioning allows EXOC3L1 to contribute to cell signaling and communication, impacting various physiological functions (MATSUMOTO2021Overexpressed).

## Clinical Significance
The EXOC3L1 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, EXOC3L1 expression is differentially regulated across multiple tumor types, influencing clinical outcomes and immune microenvironments. High expression of EXOC3L1 is associated with shorter overall survival in adrenocortical carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, but longer survival in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Zhang2022A). The gene's expression also correlates with immune cell infiltration, affecting tumor prognosis and suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment strategies (Zhang2022A).

In the context of lipid metabolism, a genetic meta-analysis identified a significant association between variations in the EXOC3L1 gene and increased HDL cholesterol concentrations in African American populations. This association highlights the importance of population-specific genetic variations in understanding lipid metabolism (Lanktree2015Genetic).

EXOC3L1 has also been linked to apoptosis, where its overexpression induces apoptosis in Chinese hamster ovary cells, contrasting with the anti-apoptotic role of its isoform Sec6 (MATSUMOTO2021Overexpressed). These findings suggest that EXOC3L1 may play diverse roles in different physiological and pathological contexts.

## Interactions
EXOC3L1, a component of the exocyst complex, is involved in various protein interactions essential for cellular processes. It is part of the exocyst complex, which is an octamer composed of EXOC1-8, playing a crucial role in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. This complex is vital for the fusion of post-Golgi carriers with the plasma membrane, facilitating the secretion of soluble proteins (Pereira2022The). While specific interactions of EXOC3L1 within the exocyst complex are not detailed, it is known to be a homolog of EXOC3, which interacts with other exocyst components like EXOC5 and EXOC6, indicating a potential similar role for EXOC3L1 (Pereira2022The).

EXOC3L1 has been implicated in apoptosis regulation, where its overexpression in Chinese hamster ovary cells leads to increased markers of apoptosis, such as caspase 3 activity. This suggests that EXOC3L1 may interact with apoptotic pathways, contrasting with other exocyst components like Sec6, which suppress apoptosis (MATSUMOTO2021Overexpressed). The specific protein interactions facilitating these apoptotic effects remain to be fully elucidated. Overall, EXOC3L1's interactions within the exocyst complex and its role in apoptosis highlight its multifaceted involvement in cellular processes.
