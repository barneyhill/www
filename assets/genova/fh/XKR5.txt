# XKR5

## Overview
XKR5 is a gene that encodes the XK related 5 protein, which is a transmembrane protein involved in cellular signaling pathways. The protein plays a critical role as a negative regulator of oncogenic signaling, particularly in the context of the KIT/D816V mutation, which is associated with various hematological malignancies. XKR5 is specifically phosphorylated by the mutant KIT/D816V, but not by the wild-type KIT, highlighting its selective interaction and regulatory function. This phosphorylation event is crucial for the downregulation of key signaling molecules such as ERK, AKT, and p38, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and transformation. The unique interaction between XKR5 and KIT/D816V, independent of SRC family kinases, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by aberrant KIT signaling (Sun2018XKrelated).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
XKR5 is implicated in the regulation of KIT/D816V-mediated transformation, which is significant in several hematological malignancies. The KIT/D816V mutation is commonly associated with diseases such as mastocytosis and core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF AML) (Sun2018XKrelated). XKR5 acts as a negative regulator of KIT/D816V signaling by inhibiting downstream pathways like AKT, ERK, and p38, which are crucial for cell survival and proliferation. Alterations in XKR5 expression or function can impact these signaling pathways, potentially influencing the progression of diseases associated with KIT mutations (Sun2018XKrelated).

XKR5 is phosphorylated by the KIT/D816V mutation, but not by the wild-type KIT, highlighting its specific interaction with this oncogenic mutant. This phosphorylation is essential for XKR5's role as a negative regulator, and its inhibition by dasatinib, a KIT/D816V inhibitor, suggests potential therapeutic implications (Sun2018XKrelated). The gene's involvement in modulating cellular signaling pathways associated with KIT suggests that it may play a role in preventing excessive kinase activity that could lead to apoptosis rather than transformation, thus impacting the development and progression of certain cancers (Sun2018XKrelated).

## Interactions
XKR5 is known to interact specifically with the oncogenic mutant KIT/D816V, but not with the wild-type KIT. This interaction results in the phosphorylation of XKR5 at specific tyrosine residues (Tyr 369, Tyr 487, and Tyr 543), which is crucial for its function as a negative regulator of KIT signaling. The phosphorylation of XKR5 leads to the downregulation of key signaling molecules such as ERK, AKT, and p38, thereby reducing cell proliferation and colony-forming capacity in semi-solid medium. This suggests that XKR5 acts as a novel negative regulator of KIT-mediated transformation (Sun2018XKrelated).

The interaction between XKR5 and KIT/D816V is selective, as XKR5 does not bind to the wild-type KIT or other KIT mutants. This specificity was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy, which demonstrated colocalization of KIT/D816V with XKR5 (Sun2018XKrelated). The phosphorylation of XKR5 by KIT/D816V is independent of SRC family kinases, which are typically involved in KIT activation, indicating a unique pathway for XKR5's regulatory role (Sun2018XKrelated).
