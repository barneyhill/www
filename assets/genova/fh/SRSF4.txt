# SRSF4

## Overview
The SRSF4 gene encodes the serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 4, a member of the serine-/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, which is integral to the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is characterized by its RNA binding domains and a long arginine-/serine-rich (RS) domain, which are essential for its function in splice site selection and exon inclusion, thereby contributing to mRNA diversity and gene expression (Masaki2020Multiple). SRSF4 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, through its ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing mRNA export, stability, and translation (Gabriel2015Role; Masaki2020Multiple). Clinically, mutations in the SRSF4 gene have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and bone marrow failure, and its expression levels can affect the response to chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin, highlighting its potential significance in both genetic disorders and cancer therapy (Gabriel2015Role; Miano2024Impaired).

## Structure
The SRSF4 protein, a member of the serine-/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, is characterized by its distinct structural domains. It contains one or two RNA binding domains (RBD) at the amino-terminus, which facilitate RNA binding, and an arginine-/serine-rich (RS) domain at the carboxy-terminus, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Masaki2020Multiple). The RS domain is notably long and composed predominantly of serine/arginine dipeptides, making SRSF4 the largest SR protein (Masaki2020Multiple). This domain is highly phosphorylated, a post-translational modification that influences the protein's splicing activity and nucleocytoplasmic transport (Masaki2020Multiple).

The RS domain also contains multiple nuclear localization signals (NLSs), which are essential for the nuclear localization of SRSF4. Specifically, four NLSs have been identified within this domain, two of which are classical-type NLSs composed of basic residues (Masaki2020Multiple). These NLSs suggest that SRSF4 utilizes different nuclear import pathways, contributing to its functional diversity in mRNA processing (Masaki2020Multiple). The presence of multiple splice variant isoforms further adds to the functional versatility of SRSF4, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
The SRSF4 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the serine-/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, which plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing, a process essential for gene expression. SRSF4 is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing by influencing splice site selection and exon choice, thereby contributing to mRNA diversity and gene expression (Masaki2020Multiple). The protein is characterized by a long RS domain, which is essential for its nuclear localization and speckle localization, thought to be sites for splicing factor storage and reassembly (Masaki2020Multiple). SRSF4 can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, mediating mRNA export, stability, and translation (Masaki2020Multiple).

In healthy human cells, SRSF4 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to RNA and modulates splice site selection, impacting cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Gabriel2015Role). The RS domain of SRSF4 contains multiple nuclear localization signals (NLSs), which facilitate its nuclear import through different pathways (Masaki2020Multiple). The phosphorylation status of the RS domain influences the shuttling properties of SR proteins, indicating that nucleocytoplasmic transport and nuclear speckle localization are complex and regulated processes (Masaki2020Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SRSF4 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly those involving mitochondrial dysfunction and bone marrow failure. A study identified a missense variant, p.R235W, in the SRSF4 gene in an 8-year-old patient and his mother, both exhibiting symptoms of leukopenia, lymphopenia, and neutropenia. This variant was associated with reduced SRSF4 protein expression and altered mitochondrial function, leading to low mTOR phosphorylation and imbalances in proteins regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics. These molecular dysfunctions were linked to decreased ATP synthesis and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, contributing to the clinical phenotype observed in the patients (Miano2024Impaired).

The SRSF4 gene is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells, particularly in response to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Alterations in SRSF4 expression can influence splicing events that lead to apoptosis. Knockdown of SRSF4 has been shown to reduce cisplatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting its role in mediating the effects of this drug on cancer cells (Gabriel2015Role). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of SRSF4 in both hematological disorders and cancer treatment.

## Interactions
SRSF4, a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, plays a significant role in RNA splicing by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is involved in the alternative splicing of exon 6 in Fas pre-mRNA, where it binds to a novel enhancer on exon 6. This binding is crucial for the inclusion of exon 6, which influences whether the Fas protein is membrane-bound and pro-apoptotic or soluble and anti-apoptotic (Jang2018Binding).

SRSF4 also interacts with RNA through specific binding motifs, as revealed by CLIP (cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) analyses. These studies have shown that SRSF4 has distinct RNA targets and binding motifs, which are essential for its role in splicing regulation (Jeong2017SR). The interactions of SRSF4 with RNA are context-dependent, suggesting variability based on cellular conditions (Jeong2017SR).

In the context of cisplatin-induced modifications of pre-mRNA splicing, SRSF4 is identified as a key regulator. It binds to GA-rich pentamers in RNA, with a preference for exons near the 5′ splice site, and is involved in the splicing changes and apoptotic processes induced by cisplatin treatment (Gabriel2015Role).
