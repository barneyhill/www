# CFAP95

## Overview
CFAP95, or cilia and flagella associated protein 95, is a gene that encodes a microtubule inner protein (MIP) crucial for the structural integrity and function of cilia. The protein encoded by CFAP95 is integral to the NWE module, which interacts with tubulin subunits to stabilize the axonemal structure, essential for ciliary function (Andersen2024Uncovering). CFAP95 forms complexes with other proteins, such as FAP67 and NME7, which are vital for the assembly of the outer doublet in cilia, thereby maintaining the structural integrity of cilia and centrosomes (Andersen2024Uncovering). The protein's role is particularly significant in photoreceptor cilia, where it is located at the A09/A10 seam, and mutations in CFAP95 are linked to ciliopathies, underscoring its importance in healthy ciliary function (Zhang2023Centriole).

## Function
CFAP95, or cilia and flagella associated protein 95, is a microtubule inner protein (MIP) that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cilia. It is part of the NWE module, which is characterized by conserved motifs that interact with tubulin subunits, particularly at the A-tubule seam in axonemal doublets. This interaction suggests that CFAP95 contributes to the stability and assembly of the axonemal structure, which is essential for ciliary function (Andersen2024Uncovering).

CFAP95 is involved in forming complexes with other proteins, such as FAP67 and NME7, which are important for the assembly of the outer doublet in cilia. These interactions are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of cilia and centrosomes, which are key components in cell motility and signaling (Andersen2024Uncovering).

In the context of photoreceptor cilia, CFAP95 is located at the A09/A10 seam, indicating its role as a MIP in these structures. Mutations in CFAP95 and other MIPs are associated with ciliopathies, highlighting its importance in maintaining healthy ciliary function (Zhang2023Centriole).

## Interactions
CFAP95 is a protein involved in the structural integrity and function of cilia, participating in various interactions within the axonemal doublet luminal niche. It is part of a complex with NME7 and other NWE module-containing proteins, such as FAP68 and SPAG8, which are crucial for the assembly of outer doublets in cilia (Andersen2024Uncovering). The NWE module in CFAP95 facilitates its interaction at the seam heterotypic tubulin lattice interface, where it makes specific contacts with tubulin subunits on adjacent protofilaments. The conserved tryptophan in the NWE motif contacts the tubA subunit of protofilament A9, while the asparagine and glutamate residues form hydrogen bonds with the tubB subunit of the neighboring A10 protofilament (Andersen2024Uncovering).

CFAP95 is also part of the A09/A10 MIP complex, which is conserved across species and observed in both centrioles and motile cilia axonemes (Zhang2023Centriole). This complex includes other proteins like CFAP53, CFAP161, SPAG8, NME7, and CFAP141, suggesting a role in maintaining the structural stability of cilia and potentially in modulating ciliogenesis (Andersen2024Uncovering; Zhang2023Centriole).
