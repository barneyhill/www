# MCM10

## Overview
MCM10 is a gene that encodes the minichromosome maintenance 10 replication initiation factor, a protein essential for DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a replication factor and plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of DNA replication by interacting with various components of the replication machinery. MCM10 is involved in the activation of the Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) helicase complex, facilitating the recruitment of DNA polymerase alpha and other replication factors to replication origins. Structurally, the MCM10 protein forms a hexameric ring, which serves as a docking module for assembling replication machinery, and contains domains that interact with both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. The gene's function is critical for maintaining genomic stability, and mutations in MCM10 have been linked to clinical conditions such as immune dysfunction and cardiomyopathy, as well as cancer progression due to its role in telomere maintenance and replication stress (Thu2014MCM10:; Baxley2017Mcm10:; Baxley2021Biallelic).

## Structure
The human MCM10 protein is a crucial factor in DNA replication, characterized by a complex molecular structure. It forms a hexameric ring with a double-layered assembly and sixfold symmetry, featuring large central and smaller lateral channels, as well as inner chambers (Okorokov2007Hexameric). This structure suggests a role as a docking module for assembling replication machinery. MCM10 contains several domains, including an N-terminal domain (NTD) with a coiled-coil motif essential for self-association, and a highly conserved internal domain (ID) that interacts with DNA and other proteins (Perez-Arnaiz2017An).

The internal domain of MCM10, particularly in Xenopus laevis, reveals a unique DNA binding architecture composed of an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-fold (OB-fold) and a zinc finger motif, which are crucial for its interaction with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Warren2008Structural). The zinc fingers are positioned on the outer surface, facilitating a sliding clamp type of binding to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (Okorokov2007Hexameric). MCM10 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its function during the cell cycle (Okorokov2007Hexameric). Despite its critical role, MCM10 shows low sequence homology across species and lacks conserved protein domains, making its function less understood (Okorokov2007Hexameric).

## Function
MCM10 is a crucial protein involved in the initiation and progression of DNA replication in human cells. It plays a significant role in the activation of the Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) helicase complex, which is essential for DNA unwinding and replication initiation (Thu2014MCM10:; van2012Mcm10). MCM10 interacts with both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, facilitating the recruitment of replication factors such as DNA polymerase alpha (Pol-α) and replication protein A (RPA) to replication origins (Thu2014MCM10:; Thu2013Enigmatic). 

During the S phase of the cell cycle, MCM10 stabilizes the replication fork, supporting the elongation phase by aiding in the synthesis of Okazaki fragments and maintaining the association of Pol-α and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at the replication fork (Baxley2017Mcm10:). MCM10's interactions with these proteins are crucial for efficient DNA synthesis and the prevention of replication stress, which can lead to genomic instability (Baxley2017Mcm10:). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it ensures proper progression through the S phase and helps maintain genomic integrity (Thu2014MCM10:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MCM10 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to their impact on telomere maintenance and genomic stability. Bi-allelic variants in MCM10 have been linked to immune dysfunction and cardiomyopathy, conditions characterized by telomere shortening and replication stress (Baxley2021Biallelic). Patients with these mutations may present with natural killer (NK) cell deficiency, leading to increased susceptibility to viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Mace2019Human). The mutations result in impaired NK cell maturation and function, with a notable reduction in the CD56 bright subset of NK cells (Mace2019Human).

In addition to immune dysfunction, MCM10 mutations are associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), often accompanied by thymic and splenic hypoplasia (Baxley2021Biallelic). The mutations can lead to chronic replication stress and genomic instability, contributing to the clinical phenotypes observed (Baxley2021Biallelic).

MCM10 overexpression has been observed in various cancers, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis. This overexpression is linked to cancer progression, as MCM10 is crucial for maintaining genomic stability during cell proliferation (Baxley2021Biallelic). The gene's unique role in telomere maintenance distinguishes it from other replication factors, such as CDC45 and MCM4 (Baxley2021Biallelic).

## Interactions
MCM10 is a crucial protein in DNA replication, interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate replication initiation and progression. It binds directly to DNA polymerase alpha (pol α) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), with its internal domain (ID) playing a significant role in these interactions. The Mcm10-ID region contains an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold and a zinc finger motif, which are essential for binding both single-stranded (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (Warren2008Structural).

MCM10 also interacts with the CMG helicase complex, which includes Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and GINS, enhancing helicase activity and stabilizing the replication fork. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of pol α to the replication origins (Mayle2018Mcm10; van2012Mcm10). MCM10's interaction with Cdc45 is particularly important, as it modulates their DNA-binding properties, with the internal and C-terminal domains of MCM10 enhancing Cdc45's affinity for DNA (Di2013The).

Additionally, MCM10 interacts with the And-1 protein, which is involved in recruiting DNA polymerase α to chromatin, and this interaction is most prominent during the S phase of the cell cycle (Zhu2007Mcm10). MCM10's interactions with these proteins and nucleic acids underscore its essential role in DNA replication and genomic stability.
