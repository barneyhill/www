# GLMN

## Overview
The GLMN gene encodes the glomulin protein, a critical regulator of ubiquitination processes within human cells. Glomulin is primarily expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and plays a vital role in maintaining vascular integrity by modulating smooth muscle cell proliferation and endothelial cell function. Although glomulin lacks known functional or structural domains, it interacts with several proteins, including FKBP12 and components of the cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), such as RBX1, to inhibit E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This inhibition is crucial for cellular homeostasis and protein degradation regulation. Mutations in the GLMN gene are associated with glomuvenous malformations (GVMs), benign vascular lesions that manifest as nodular skin lesions. These mutations disrupt normal blood vessel formation, leading to the clinical presentation of GVMs, which are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with variable expressivity (Brouillard2013Genotypes; Duda2012Structure; Aerts2011GLMN).

## Structure
The GLMN gene encodes a protein that spans approximately 55 kbp and consists of 19 exons, with the first exon being non-coding. The protein is composed of 594 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 68 kDa (Aerts2011GLMN). In silico analysis of the glomulin protein reveals no known functional or structural domains, but potential phosphorylation and glycosylation sites have been identified (Aerts2011GLMN). 

GLMN is known to interact with FKBP12 and the C-terminal part of the HGF receptor, c-MET. It binds to the inactive, non-phosphorylated form of c-MET and is released in a phosphorylated form upon activation by HGF, leading to the phosphorylation of p70 S6 protein kinase (Aerts2011GLMN). GLMN also interacts with the RING domain of RBX1, inhibiting E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and adopts a HEAT-like repeat fold that binds the E2-interacting surface of RBX1 (Suzuki2017Shigella). 

A truncated form of glomulin, called FAP48, with an altered carboxy-terminal end, was isolated from a Jurkat-cell library. FAP48 presents 70% homology with glomulin but was not detected in other tissues, suggesting it might be an aberrant transcript (Aerts2011GLMN).

## Function
The GLMN gene encodes the glomulin protein, which plays a significant role in regulating ubiquitination processes in healthy human cells. Glomulin is primarily expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and is involved in maintaining vascular integrity by interacting with proteins that modulate smooth muscle cell proliferation and endothelial cell function (Duda2012Structure). 

At the molecular level, glomulin interacts with the RBX1 protein, a component of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), by binding to the RING domain of RBX1. This interaction inhibits the E3 ligase activity by masking the E2-binding surface, thereby affecting the SCF FBW7 complex involved in the ubiquitination of substrates like CyclinE (Duda2012Structure). This regulatory mechanism is crucial for maintaining proper cellular functions, as it influences protein degradation and cellular homeostasis (Duda2012Structure).

Glomulin's inhibition of E3 ligase activity is a mechanism by which cellular proteins can control ubiquitination, potentially affecting a subset of CRL activities in vivo (Duda2012Structure). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular processes that ensure proper blood vessel formation and stability (Wang2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GLMN gene, which encodes the protein glomulin, are primarily associated with glomuvenous malformations (GVMs). These are benign vascular lesions characterized by raised, nodular, and often painful skin lesions that range in color from pink to purplish-dark blue. GVMs are typically present at birth and expand during childhood, primarily affecting the skin and subcutis (Brouillard2013Genotypes; Unknownauthors2009Hemangiomas). The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity (Brouillard2013Disorders).

The GLMN gene is located on chromosome 1p21-22, and mutations result in a loss of function, leading to the development of GVMs. These mutations include nonsense, splice-site, and frame-shift changes, which disrupt normal blood vessel formation (Brouillard2013Genotypes; Brouillard2007Genetic). The most common mutation, c.157_161del, is found in a significant number of cases, indicating a strong founder effect (Brouillard2013Genotypes).

GVMs are distinguished from other venous malformations by the presence of glomus cells around distended venous channels. These cells are abnormally differentiated smooth muscle cells, and their presence is a hallmark of the condition (Unknownauthors2009Hemangiomas). The genetic basis of GVMs involves a 'two-hit' hypothesis, where a second somatic mutation may be necessary for the phenotypic expression of the malformations (McMahon2022GLMNcausing).

## Interactions
Glomulin (GLMN) interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (cIAP1 and cIAP2), which are part of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of RING-E3 ligases. This interaction occurs through the RING domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2, inhibiting their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and affecting inflammasome activation (Suzuki2017Shigella). GLMN does not interact with the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) due to the absence of a critical serine residue in XIAP's RING domain, which is essential for GLMN binding (Suzuki2017Shigella).

GLMN also interacts with the Shigella IpaH7.8 E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of GLMN, which is crucial for the activation of NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes during Shigella infection (Suzuki2014Shigella). Additionally, GLMN binds to the RING domain of RBX1, inhibiting its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which suggests a broader role in regulating ubiquitination processes (Suzuki2017Shigella).

GLMN also interacts with FKBP12, an immunophilin involved in the regulation of the TGFbeta signaling pathway, although the exact function of this interaction remains unclear (Aerts2011GLMN).
