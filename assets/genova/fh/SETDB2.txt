# SETDB2

## Overview
SETDB2 is a gene that encodes the protein SET domain bifurcated histone lysine methyltransferase 2, a member of the SUV39 family of lysine methyltransferases. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by specifically methylating lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9), a modification associated with transcriptional repression and heterochromatin formation. The protein is characterized by a bifurcated SET domain, which is crucial for its catalytic activity, and a methyl-CpG-binding domain that facilitates its recruitment to methylated DNA regions. SETDB2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates gene expression patterns essential for normal cellular function and development. It is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of structural left-right asymmetry in the central nervous system and the differentiation of neural cells. Clinically, SETDB2 is implicated in several cancers, where its aberrant expression can influence tumor progression and treatment response (Liu2014Genetic; Torrano2019Emerging; Ocklenburg2015LeftRight).

## Structure
SETDB2 is a member of the SUV39 family of lysine methyltransferases, characterized by a bifurcated SET domain with insertion sequences of 73% homology, derived from a protein with the same insertion (Torrano2019Emerging). The SET domain is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to a lysine residue on target proteins, such as histones (Torrano2019Emerging). This domain is highly conserved among eukaryotes and is characterized by a turn and loop-rich structure with two distinct subdomains comprising antiparallel β-strands separated by a highly variable segment (Torrano2019Emerging). The variable segment coincides with the bifurcating sequences in SETDB2, as well as insertions of entire protein domains (Torrano2019Emerging).

SETDB2 also contains a methyl-CpG-binding domain, which facilitates its recruitment to methylated CpG islands, allowing it to deposit H3K9me3 at nearby histones and stimulate local heterochromatin formation (Torrano2019Emerging). The protein's structure includes pre- and post-SET domains rich in cysteines, which flank the central SET domain, contributing to its structural stability and substrate specificity (Torrano2019Emerging). The SETDB2 insert comprises 218 amino acid residues (Torrano2019Emerging).

## Function
SETDB2, also known as SET domain bifurcated histone lysine methyltransferase 2, is an enzyme involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through histone modification. It specifically methylates lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9), a modification associated with transcriptional repression and heterochromatin formation (Torrano2019Emerging). This activity is crucial for maintaining chromatin architecture and regulating transcription during cell and tissue development (Torrano2019Emerging).

In healthy human cells, SETDB2 plays a significant role in the regulation of structural left-right asymmetry in the central nervous system by suppressing the expression of the fibroblast growth factor 8 gene (fgf8) (Ocklenburg2015LeftRight). It is also involved in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into neural cells and in controlling the fate of neural precursor cells during development (Ocklenburg2015LeftRight).

SETDB2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates gene expression patterns essential for normal cellular function and organismal development. Its role in epigenetic regulation is critical for processes such as transcriptional repression, cell differentiation, and development, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (Torrano2019Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
SETDB2 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in epigenetic regulation. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, SETDB2 promotes oncogenesis by suppressing the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN2C, similar to SETDB1's repression of CDKN2A in melanoma (Torrano2019Emerging). In breast cancer, SETDB2 is often deleted, with lower mRNA levels associated with shorter survival, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Liu2014Genetic). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly AML1-ETO positive cases, high SETDB2 expression correlates with poor prognosis and is linked to leukemogenesis through epigenetic upregulation by the AML1-ETO fusion protein (p&gt; Mu2020&lt; Oncogenic).

SETDB2 is also involved in drug resistance and tumor progression. Aberrant expression is linked to metastatic spread in renal cell tumors and poor prognosis in gastric cancer (Torrano2019Emerging). It is upregulated in response to therapies targeting proliferative cells, suggesting a role in adaptive resistance (Torrano2019Emerging). SETDB2's involvement in immune response regulation, particularly in suppressing antibacterial NFkB target genes, may contribute to cancer cell survival during treatment (Torrano2019Emerging). These findings highlight SETDB2's clinical significance in cancer progression and treatment response.

## Interactions
SETDB2, a histone lysine methyltransferase, is involved in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is a component of the transcriptional repression complex, where it plays a role in modulating gene silencing. SETDB2's ability to interact with nucleic acids suggests it may influence chromatin structure, thereby affecting gene expression. These interactions are crucial for cellular processes such as development and differentiation, highlighting the importance of SETDB2 in maintaining proper cellular function. The protein's involvement in these complexes and interactions underscores its role in the dynamic regulation of chromatin and gene expression, which is essential for various biological processes.
