# SNX33

## Overview
SNX33 is a gene that encodes the protein sorting nexin 33, a member of the sorting nexin family characterized by the presence of a BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain and a Phox (PX) domain. Sorting nexin 33 is involved in various cellular processes, including endocytosis and membrane remodeling, by modulating cellular membranes and the cytoskeleton. The protein is known for its role in the endocytosis and processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and prion protein, as well as in actin polymerization. Through its SH3 domain, sorting nexin 33 interacts with proteins such as dynamin and WASP, and it plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways. The protein's function in APP processing is particularly relevant in the context of Alzheimer's disease, as it influences the non-amyloidogenic pathway, thereby reducing amyloid-beta peptide production (Dislich2010Specific; Zhang2018The).

## Structure
SNX33 is a member of the sorting nexin family, characterized by the presence of a BAR domain and a Phox (PX) domain. The BAR domain is a three-helix bundle that forms a crescent-shaped structure, crucial for homodimerization and membrane tubulation activities (Dislich2010Specific). This domain allows SNX33 to bind and induce membrane curvature, a key feature for its role in endocytosis and actin polymerization (Dislich2010Specific). The integrity of the BAR domain is essential, as mutations, such as the deletion of the third helix, disrupt dimerization and membrane-tubulating functions (Dislich2010Specific).

SNX33 also contains an SH3 domain, which facilitates interactions with proteins like dynamin and WASP, although it is not required for homodimerization (Dislich2010Specific). The PX domain aids in membrane association by binding specific phosphoinositides, contributing to the protein's role in intracellular trafficking (van2010SNX–BAR).

SNX33 does not typically form heterodimers with its homologs SNX9 and SNX18, due to specific amino acids in the BAR domain that prevent such interactions (Dislich2010Specific). The protein's structure and interactions underscore its specificity and functional roles in cellular processes.

## Function
SNX33 (sorting nexin 33) is a protein involved in several key cellular processes, primarily related to endocytosis and membrane remodeling. It is a member of the BAR domain-containing protein family, which plays a crucial role in cellular protein trafficking by modulating cellular membranes and the cytoskeleton (Dislich2010Specific). SNX33 is known to form homodimers through its BAR domain, which is essential for its function in membrane tubulation, a process that is lost when the BAR domain is truncated (Dislich2010Specific). This protein is active in the cytoplasm and endosomes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways.

SNX33 is involved in the endocytosis and processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the prion protein, as well as in actin polymerization. It binds through its SH3 domain to proteins such as dynamin and WASP, and interacts with the metalloprotease ADAM15 (Dislich2010Specific). In healthy human cells, SNX33 expression reduces the rate of APP endocytosis, which increases cell surface APP levels and promotes its cleavage by α-secretase, thus favoring the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing (Zhang2018The). This function is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease, as it reduces the production of amyloid-beta peptides.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SNX33 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly neurological disorders. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, SNX33 plays a significant role in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Donepezil, a drug used in Alzheimer's treatment, has been shown to up-regulate SNX33 expression, which in turn modulates APP processing. This modulation results in increased levels of soluble APP alpha (sAPPα) and decreased levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ), suggesting a protective effect against Alzheimer's pathology (TakadaTakatori2019Donepezil). The study indicates that SNX33 is crucial for these effects, as its inhibition reverses the changes induced by donepezil (TakadaTakatori2019Donepezil).

The up-regulation of SNX33 by donepezil is independent of the nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor pathways, indicating a unique mechanism of action (TakadaTakatori2019Donepezil). Alterations in SNX33 expression or function could have significant implications for Alzheimer's disease pathology, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (TakadaTakatori2019Donepezil). However, the study does not directly address the clinical significance of SNX33 gene mutations, focusing instead on the effects of donepezil treatment on SNX33 expression and APP processing (TakadaTakatori2019Donepezil).

## Interactions
SNX33 is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its SH3 domain. It interacts with the metalloprotease ADAM15, with specific isoforms of ADAM15 showing a robust capacity for intracellular association with SNX33. This interaction is influenced by the presence of proline clusters in ADAM15 isoforms, which dictate their specificity for binding with SNX33 (Kleino2009Alternative). 

SNX33 also forms homodimers through its BAR domain, a process that is crucial for its function. The BAR domain allows SNX33 to homodimerize while preventing heterodimerization with other BAR domain-containing proteins like SNX9 and SNX18 under normal conditions. However, heterodimerization with SNX9 can occur under strong overexpression conditions (Dislich2010Specific). 

SNX33 is involved in actin polymerization and interacts with proteins such as dynamin and WASP through its SH3 domain. These interactions are significant for its role in cellular processes like endocytosis and actin-rich protrusion formation at the leading edge of cells (Dislich2010Specific). SNX33's interaction with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is also notable, as it regulates APP endocytosis, impacting β-amyloid peptide accumulation, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (Hanley2020Sorting).
