# CR1L

## Overview
The CR1L gene encodes the complement C3b/C4b receptor 1-like protein, which is a receptor involved in the immune system, particularly within the complement pathway. This protein is structurally characterized by short consensus repeats (SCRs), which are motifs commonly found in complement regulatory proteins. The CR1L protein is primarily associated with cell membranes and plays a role in immune response modulation by binding to complement components, specifically iC4, but not iC3. Although the expression of CR1L is not prominent in adult human tissues, it is detected in fetal tissues, suggesting a potential role in fetal development, possibly in hematopoiesis or lymphopoiesis. The CR1L protein's interactions, particularly with iC4, indicate its involvement in immune regulation and its potential cooperative role in viral restriction, as evidenced by studies in murine models (Logar2004A; Brown2020Liverexpressed).

## Structure
The CR1L protein is characterized by the presence of short consensus repeats (SCRs), which are common motifs in complement regulatory proteins. The human CR1L transcript encodes a protein composed of 6.5 SCRs, with a molecular weight of approximately 45,000 Da, and includes five potential N-glycosylation sites (Logar2004A). The first six SCRs of human CR1L are closely related to SCRs 1-6 of human CR1, while the seventh SCR is homologous to CR1 SCR 9 (Logar2004A). The protein is predominantly located in the membrane fraction of COS-7 cells, with some presence in the cytosol and tissue culture supernatant (Logar2004A).

The CR1L protein specifically binds to iC4, but not iC3, indicating a specific binding affinity (Logar2004A). The genomic analysis revealed that the human CR1L transcript undergoes a splicing event that removes the SCR 7b exon, replacing it with an exon containing a stop codon (Logar2004A). Despite the presence of a stop codon in SCR 7, the human CR1L cDNA is highly homologous to the chimpanzee CR1L sequence (Logar2004A). The study does not provide detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific domains, or prominent folds of the CR1L protein (Logar2004A).

## Function
The CR1L gene encodes a protein that is involved in the immune system, particularly within the complement pathway. This protein is similar to the complement receptor 1 (CR1) and is thought to participate in binding complement components C3b and C4b, which are crucial for immune response modulation and maintaining homeostasis (Logar2004A). The CR1L protein is primarily active on cell surfaces, contributing to processes such as phagocytosis and the regulation of inflammation (Logar2004A).

In terms of cellular localization, the CR1L protein predominantly localizes in the membrane fraction, with some presence in the cytosol and tissue culture supernatant (Logar2004A). This localization suggests its involvement in membrane-associated immune functions. The protein has been shown to bind specifically to iC4, indicating a potential role in the immune response, although it does not bind to iC3 (Logar2004A).

Despite these insights, the expression of CR1L in adult human tissues is not prominent, as neither CR1L mRNA nor protein was detected in adult bone marrow or other adult tissues. However, CR1L transcripts were identified in fetal tissues, suggesting a role in fetal development, possibly in hematopoiesis or lymphopoiesis (Logar2004A).

## Interactions
The human CR1L protein has been shown to interact specifically with the complement component iC4, but not with iC3. This interaction was demonstrated through affinity chromatography experiments, where CR1L exhibited substantial binding to iC4, indicating a specific physical interaction with this complement component (Logar2004A). The CR1L protein is expressed in hematopoietic and fetal lymphoid tissues, suggesting a role in immune regulation through its interaction with iC4 (Logar2004A).

In murine models, the CR1L ortholog, mCr1l, has been found to physically interact with the protein mCd302. This interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that mCr1l and mCd302 may work together to mediate an anti-HCV phenotype by enhancing the expression of certain antiviral genes (Brown2020Liverexpressed). The interaction between mCr1l and mCd302 also appears to play a role in restricting hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry into cells, as their coexpression in Huh-7.5 cells impedes HCV cell entry (Brown2020Liverexpressed). These findings highlight the potential cooperative role of CR1L in immune responses and viral restriction.
