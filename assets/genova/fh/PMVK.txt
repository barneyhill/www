# PMVK

## Overview
The PMVK gene encodes the enzyme phosphomevalonate kinase, a crucial component of the mevalonate pathway, which is integral to cholesterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis. As a kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of mevalonate 5-phosphate to mevalonate 5-diphosphate, a pivotal step in the production of sterols and non-sterol isoprenoids (Olivier1999Characterization; Kovacs2002Central). This enzyme is localized in peroxisomes and is regulated in response to dietary sterol levels, reflecting its role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (Olivier1999Characterization). The PMVK gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, liver, and pancreas, underscoring its importance in lipid metabolism (Olivier1999Characterization). Mutations in PMVK are linked to skin disorders such as porokeratosis and have implications in cancer prognosis, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Atzmony2019SecondHit; Aersilan2022MicroRNA874; Wang2016Lossoffunction).

## Function
Phosphomevalonate kinase (PMVK) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the mevalonate pathway, which is essential for cholesterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis. PMVK catalyzes the conversion of mevalonate 5-phosphate into mevalonate 5-diphosphate, a key step in the production of sterols and non-sterol isoprenoids (Olivier1999Characterization; Kovacs2002Central). This reaction is the fifth step in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and occurs within peroxisomes, where PMVK is localized due to a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS-1) at its C-terminus (Olivier1999Characterization; Kovacs2002Central).

The enzyme's activity is regulated in response to dietary sterol levels, in coordination with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis (Olivier1999Characterization). PMVK is highly expressed in tissues such as the heart, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, and pancreas, indicating its importance in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and cellular lipid metabolism (Olivier1999Characterization). The proper functioning of PMVK is crucial for the synthesis of farnesyl diphosphate from acetyl-CoA, highlighting its broader role in cholesterol biosynthesis and the maintenance of cellular functions related to lipid metabolism (Olivier1999Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PMVK gene are associated with several skin disorders, particularly forms of porokeratosis. Linear porokeratosis (LP) is linked to second-hit postzygotic mutations in the PMVK gene, which result in segmental mosaicism. This condition is characterized by keratotic papules and plaques, and the mutations lead to a loss of function in the mevalonate pathway, affecting cell growth and differentiation (Atzmony2019SecondHit). Specific mutations such as p.R110Q, p.E27X, and p.Q127X have been identified in individuals with LP, contributing to the disorder's pathogenesis by disrupting enzyme activity and cellular processes (Atzmony2019SecondHit).

In autosomal dominant disseminated superficial porokeratosis (DSP), a loss-of-function mutation in PMVK, specifically c.412C>T (p.Arg138*), has been identified. This mutation leads to abnormal apoptosis and differentiation of keratinocytes, contributing to the formation of cornoid lamellae in the skin. The mutation disrupts the mevalonate pathway, which is crucial for maintaining normal epidermal function (Wang2016Lossoffunction).

Alterations in PMVK expression are also implicated in cancer. In breast cancer, high PMVK expression is associated with poor prognosis, while miR-874, a microRNA targeting PMVK, can inhibit cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis (Aersilan2022MicroRNA874).
