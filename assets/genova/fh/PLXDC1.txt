# PLXDC1

## Overview
PLXDC1, or plexin domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The protein, also known as Tumor Endothelial Marker-7 (TEM-7), is characterized by its large extracellular domain, transmembrane domain, and intracellular domain, and is notably expressed in tumor endothelial cells (Cheng2014Identification). As a receptor, PLXDC1 interacts with the Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF), influencing downstream signaling pathways crucial for cellular behavior such as migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis (Wu2024Potential). Additionally, PLXDC1 plays a role in pathological conditions, including glioblastoma and diabetic retinopathy, where its expression is associated with diseased blood vessels and tumor progression (Cheng2014Identification; Falchetti2018Glioblastoma).

## Structure
PLXDC1 is a transmembrane protein characterized by distinct structural domains. It comprises a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain, sharing about 50% homology with its family member PLXDC2 (Cheng2014Identification). The extracellular domain is divided into specific regions: domain A (19-127), domain B (128-242), domain C (243-292), and domain D (293-359) (Cheng2014Identification). Domain B is particularly crucial for binding to the Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF) (Cheng2014Identification).

The cytoplasmic domain of PLXDC1 contains a conserved cysteine residue involved in forming disulfide bonds, which are essential for the protein's oligomerization and interaction with PEDF (Cheng2014Identification). This domain also includes potential phosphorylation sites, which may play a role in downstream signaling (Cheng2014Identification).

PLXDC1 can form homooligomers in the absence of PEDF, and PEDF binding leads to the dissociation of these oligomers, promoting monomer formation (Cheng2014Identification). This oligomerization and dissociation are crucial for its function as a receptor, influencing its signaling capabilities (Cheng2014Identification). The protein is also known as Tumor Endothelial Marker-7 (TEM-7) and is highly expressed in tumor endothelial cells (Cheng2014Identification).

## Function
PLXDC1, also known as plexin domain containing 1, is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in cell signaling and interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is involved in the regulation of cell behavior, including migration, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis, by interacting with other cell surface receptors or ECM components (Wu2024Potential). Although PLXDC1 does not directly participate in ECM synthesis or degradation, it influences the ECM's composition and physical properties by modulating interactions between cells and the ECM, thereby affecting the activity of molecules involved in ECM dynamics (Wu2024Potential).

In healthy human cells, PLXDC1 is expressed on the cell surface and is regulated by the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which influences its localization rather than its overall expression levels (Gaultier2010LDL). This regulation suggests a role for PLXDC1 in cell signaling pathways, potentially affecting processes like long-term potentiation in neurons (Gaultier2010LDL). PLXDC1 is also known as tumor endothelial marker 7 and is enriched in endothelial cells, particularly in diseased blood vessels, indicating its involvement in vascular biology (Cheng2014Identification).

## Clinical Significance
PLXDC1 has been implicated in the progression and treatment resistance of glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor. In the context of bevacizumab treatment, an anti-angiogenic therapy, PLXDC1 is upregulated, leading to an infiltrative growth pattern in glioblastoma by enhancing perivascular spreading. This process is associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, where PLXDC1 silencing increases epithelial markers and reduces mesenchymal markers, thereby inhibiting the infiltrative growth induced by bevacizumab (Falchetti2018Glioblastoma). Inhibition of PLXDC1 has been shown to prevent this bevacizumab-induced infiltrative growth, suggesting its critical role in tumor invasion and as a potential therapeutic target (Falchetti2018Glioblastoma).

PLXDC1 is also identified as a transmembrane receptor for Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF), involved in various physiological and pathological conditions. It is highly expressed in tumor endothelial cells and is associated with diseased blood vessels, such as in diabetic retinopathy. Alterations in PLXDC1 expression or its interactions could impact PEDF signaling pathways, potentially affecting inflammatory responses and cell death (Cheng2014Identification).

## Interactions
PLXDC1, or plexin domain containing 1, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It acts as a receptor for the multifunctional factor Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF). In the absence of PEDF, PLXDC1 forms homooligomers, and PEDF binding leads to the dissociation of these oligomers, which is crucial for activating downstream signaling pathways (Cheng2014Identification). The extracellular domain B of PLXDC1 is important for binding to PEDF, and the cytoplasmic domain's terminal cysteine plays a role in oligomerization (Cheng2014Identification).

PLXDC1 is also involved in interactions with the rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV). It interacts with the gH/gL glycoprotein complex of RRV, facilitating viral entry into host cells. Overexpression of PLXDC1 enhances the attachment of RRV, suggesting a role in viral entry (Großkopf2021Plxdc). The interaction of PLXDC1 with RRV is influenced by specific residues in the gH domain, and differences in interaction patterns between PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 may be due to expression levels or functional differences (Großkopf2021Plxdc).

In glioblastoma, PLXDC1 is involved in the perivascular spreading of tumor cells, interacting with the endothelium in the context of bevacizumab-induced infiltrative growth (Falchetti2018Glioblastoma).
