# OR5H2

## Overview
OR5H2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily H member 2, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odorants, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways in the olfactory epithelium (Laron2023Congenital). Beyond olfaction, OR5H2 and other olfactory receptors are expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, where they participate in diverse physiological processes, including the regulation of blood pressure and glucose homeostasis (Laron2023Congenital). The expression of OR5H2 is influenced by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), suggesting its involvement in cellular processes beyond olfaction, such as cell proliferation and cancer biology (Zhao2023LSTM). The gene's role in health and disease, particularly its potential implications in cancer, is an area of ongoing research (Gazzellone2024From).

## Function
OR5H2 is a member of the olfactory receptor family, specifically part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are primarily known for their role in detecting odorants in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific molecules and initiate a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Laron2023Congenital). Beyond their role in olfaction, olfactory receptors like OR5H2 are ectopically expressed in various tissues, including the testes, lung, intestine, skin, heart, and blood. In these tissues, they are involved in multiple physiological processes, such as the regulation of blood pressure and glucose homeostasis (Laron2023Congenital).

OR5H2 expression is positively regulated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), as demonstrated by increased mRNA and protein levels in response to IGF-1 in endometrial cancer cell lines (Laron2023Congenital). This suggests a link between the IGF-1 axis and olfactory receptors, indicating that OR5H2 may play a role in cellular processes beyond olfaction, potentially influencing cell proliferation and cancer biology (Zhao2023LSTM). However, the specific function of OR5H2 in healthy human cells remains less clearly defined.

## Clinical Significance
The OR5H2 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes. In the context of Laron Syndrome (LS), a condition characterized by congenital IGF-1 deficiency, OR5H2 is notably downregulated. This downregulation is associated with the protective effect against cancer observed in LS patients, suggesting a potential role of OR5H2 in cancer biology (Laron2023Congenital; Gazzellone2024From). The expression of OR5H2 is positively regulated by IGF-1, as demonstrated by increased mRNA and protein levels in endometrial cancer cell lines, indicating that alterations in IGF-1 signaling can affect OR5H2 expression (Laron2023Congenital).

In cancer research, OR5H2 has been identified as frequently mutated in certain cancer cohorts, although these mutations do not appear to affect mRNA expression levels, suggesting they may not be biologically relevant (kwan2020investigation). Despite this, the link between IGF-1 regulation and OR5H2 expression highlights a potential interaction that could influence cancer development or progression. The exact mechanisms by which OR5H2 contributes to these processes remain an area of active investigation.
