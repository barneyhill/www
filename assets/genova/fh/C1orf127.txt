# C1orf127

## Overview
C1orf127 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 127. This protein is currently not categorized into a specific functional class such as kinases or receptors, and its precise biological role remains to be fully elucidated. However, it is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, as suggested by its involvement in genetic loci associated with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke and other conditions (Ding2023Biomarker; Jones2019A). The gene resides within a topologically associated domain that may influence its expression through enhancer activity, highlighting its potential regulatory complexity (Jones2019A). While C1orf127 has been linked to traits such as excessive hairiness and observed in certain tumor contexts, further research is needed to clarify its functional significance and potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Endo2018Genomewide; DomingoSabugo2021Distinct).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
C1orf127 has been implicated in various medical conditions through its association with genetic loci and expression patterns. In the context of non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke, C1orf127 is included in a 90% credible gene set associated with a specific patient cluster characterized by folic acid, which shows a significantly lower risk of disability (Ding2023Biomarker). This suggests a potential protective role in stroke outcomes.

The gene is also located within a topologically associated domain (TAD) that includes the CASZ1 gene, with the rs11121615 variant showing enhancer activity that may influence the expression of C1orf127. This variant is suggested to play a role in gene regulation within its TAD, potentially affecting C1orf127 expression (Jones2019A).

In a study on Japanese females, C1orf127 was mentioned in relation to hair-related traits, specifically excessive hairiness, although the association was not validated in further data (Endo2018Genomewide). Additionally, deletions affecting C1orf127 were observed in the context of lung carcinoid tumors, although the clinical significance of these deletions was not detailed (DomingoSabugo2021Distinct). These findings indicate that alterations in C1orf127 may be involved in diverse conditions, though its precise clinical significance remains under investigation.
