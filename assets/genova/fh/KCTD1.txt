# KCTD1

## Overview
KCTD1 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 1, which is a member of the KCTD family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain and a C-terminal domain (CTD), which facilitate its role as a transcriptional repressor and regulator of cellular signaling pathways (Balasco2024Structural; Pinkas2024A). The KCTD1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and the formation of multimeric complexes with its paralog KCTD15, which are essential for ectodermal and neural crest cell functions (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15; Ruangchan2024Genetic). Clinically, mutations in the KCTD1 gene are associated with conditions such as Scalp-Ear-Nipple syndrome and aplasia cutis congenita, highlighting its significance in human development and disease (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15; Hu2020KCTD1).

## Structure
The KCTD1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain and a C-terminal domain (CTD), both contributing to its pentameric assembly. The BTB domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions and features an N-terminal extension that stabilizes the pentamer through domain-swap interactions, which are essential for binding the transcription factor TFAP2A (Pinkas2024A). The CTD of KCTD1 shares structural homology with other KCTD family members, such as KCTD5 and KCTD12, and adopts a β-propeller fold with a central channel that binds sodium and iodide ions. This ion-binding property is significant for its function in regulating salt reabsorption in the kidney (Balasco2024Structural; Pinkas2024A).

The protein's quaternary structure is a pentamer, with the BTB domain forming a ring of intersubunit interactions that stabilize the assembly. Mutations in this region, such as P20S, can destabilize the protein and affect its binding affinity to TFAP2A (Balasco2024Structural; Pinkas2024A). The presence of a tightly restricted ion-bound channel in the CTD is unique to KCTD1, distinguishing it from other KCTD proteins with more open channels (Pinkas2024A).

## Function
KCTD1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, KCTD1 functions as a transcriptional repressor, particularly inhibiting the activity of the transcription factor AP-2α. This repression is achieved through the BTB domain of KCTD1, which binds to AP-2α, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity without affecting its protein stability (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15; Ding2008The; Skoblov2013Protein). KCTD1 also plays a role in the regulation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator by binding to β-catenin and promoting its degradation, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions (Ruangchan2024Genetic).

KCTD1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it participates in the formation of multimeric complexes with its paralog KCTD15. These complexes are essential for ectodermal and neural crest cell functions, contributing to the development of skin appendages, cranial structures, and renal function (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular differentiation and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCTD1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably Scalp-Ear-Nipple (SEN) syndrome. This rare genetic disorder is characterized by scalp defects, ear anomalies, and nipple malformations. Mutations in KCTD1 disrupt its ability to repress the transcription factor AP-2α, leading to increased transcriptional activity and contributing to the symptoms of SEN syndrome, which also include ectodermal abnormalities and progressive renal fibrosis (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15; Hu2020KCTD1).

KCTD1 mutations are also linked to aplasia cutis congenita (ACC), a congenital defect primarily affecting the midline scalp. These mutations impair the function of KCTD1/KCTD15 complexes, which are crucial for ectodermal and neural crest cell functions, leading to ACC and related cranial defects (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15).

In addition, KCTD1 variants are associated with isolated dental anomalies, such as tooth agenesis and taurodontism. Specific mutations, like Arg241Gln and Pro243Ser, affect protein interactions and signaling pathways, contributing to these dental conditions (Ruangchan2024Genetic).

KCTD1 is also implicated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), where its overexpression is associated with increased NF-κB activity, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Buono2023A).

## Interactions
KCTD1 is known to interact with several proteins, forming both stable and transient complexes that influence various cellular functions. One of the primary interactions of KCTD1 is with the transcription factor AP-2α. KCTD1 binds to the N-terminal activation domain of AP-2α, inhibiting its transactivation function. This interaction is mediated by the BTB domain of KCTD1 and has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation assays, and GST pull-down assays (Ding2008The). KCTD1's inhibition of AP-2α affects the transcriptional activities of AP-2α-dependent promoters, such as erbB-2, which is significant in breast cancer development (Ding2008The).

KCTD1 also forms multimeric complexes with KCTD15, another member of the KCTD protein family. These proteins can form heteropentamers, which are stable in various stoichiometries. The interaction between KCTD1 and KCTD15 is crucial for their function in ectodermal and neural crest cell activities, and they can compensate for each other's loss in certain cell types (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15). These interactions highlight the role of KCTD1 in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in complex cellular processes.
