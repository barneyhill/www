# ADAP1

## Overview
ADAP1 is a gene that encodes the protein ArfGAP with dual PH domains 1, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) primarily involved in T cell signaling. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the KRAS-ERK-AP-1 signaling pathway, which is essential for T cell activation, proliferation, and immune response. ArfGAP with dual PH domains 1 is recruited to the immune signalosome upon T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 stimulation, where it interacts with key signaling molecules such as LCK, PKCθ, ZAP70, and PI3K, facilitating the activation of transcription factors like AP-1 and NF-κB (Ramirez2022ADAP1; Ramirez2021ADAP1). Beyond its immunological functions, ADAP1 has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder, and plays a role in immune-related conditions such as immune thrombocytopenia (Coe2018Neurodevelopmental; Xiong2022ADAP).

## Function
The ADAP1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in T cell signaling and activation. It functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for KRAS, facilitating the conversion of GTP to GDP, which is essential for KRAS activation and subsequent ERK signaling. This signaling pathway is vital for T cell activation, proliferation, and immune response (Ramirez2022ADAP1; Ramirez2021ADAP1). ADAP1 is involved in the KRAS-ERK-AP-1 signaling pathway, promoting ERK phosphorylation and interacting with proteins such as PKCθ, which are critical for T cell activation and transcriptional responses (Ramirez2022ADAP1; Ramirez2021ADAP1).

In T cells, ADAP1 is recruited to the immune signalosome upon TCR and CD28 stimulation, where it interacts with early regulators of T cell signaling, including LCK, PKCθ, ZAP70, and PI3K. This interaction is crucial for the activation of transcription factors like AP-1 and NF-κB, which are important for T cell activation and HIV-1 transcription (Ramirez2022ADAP1). ADAP1's expression is increased upon T cell stimulation, indicating its role in modulating T cell signaling and transcriptional programs during transitions from resting to activated states (Ramirez2021ADAP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADAP1 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, ADAP1 has been identified as a candidate gene associated with developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. The gene was found to be a missense outlier in statistical models analyzing de novo mutations, suggesting its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disease pathology (Coe2018Neurodevelopmental).

ADAP1 also plays a role in immune-related conditions. It has been linked to immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoimmune disorder characterized by low platelet counts. Underexpression of ADAP1 in splenic macrophages is associated with increased platelet phagocytosis, contributing to thrombocytopenia. This suggests that ADAP1 acts as an intracellular immune checkpoint in macrophage phagocytosis, and its deficiency leads to enhanced proinflammatory signaling (Xiong2022ADAP).

In T cells, ADAP1 is involved in the KRAS-ERK-AP-1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for T cell activation and proliferation. Loss of ADAP1 results in reduced T cell proliferation and impaired immune signaling, potentially leading to immune disorders and affecting the reactivation of latent HIV-1 (Ramirez2022ADAP1).

## Interactions
ADAP1 is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in T cell signaling and HIV-1 reactivation. It co-purifies with components of the early T cell signalosome, including LCK, PKCθ, ZAP70, and PI3K, upon TCR/CD28 stimulation, indicating its recruitment to the immune signalosome and interaction with early regulators of T cell signaling (Ramirez2022ADAP1). The interaction between ADAP1 and PKCθ is particularly significant, as PKCθ is crucial for TCR-mediated T cell activation and activates effectors like RasGRP1 and CARMA1, which induce transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB (Ramirez2022ADAP1).

ADAP1 also interacts with KRAS, functioning as a KRAS GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and promoting ERK-AP-1 activation. This interaction is observed in both resting and stimulated T cells, suggesting different roles depending on the cell state (Ramirez2022ADAP1). In resting T cells, ADAP1 may promote GTP-to-GDP conversion to inactivate KRAS, while in stimulated T cells, it facilitates continuous GTP-to-GDP cycling to activate KRAS and downstream signaling (Ramirez2022ADAP1).

These interactions highlight ADAP1's role in modulating the KRAS-ERK-AP-1 signaling axis, which is crucial for latent HIV-1 reactivation and T cell activation (Ramirez2022ADAP1).
