zipper (bHLH-Zip) transcription factor that binds to the sterol regulatory element-1 (SRE1), which is a motif that is found in the promoter of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene and other genes involved in sterol biosynthesis. The encoded protein is synthesized as a precursor that is initially attached to the nuclear membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. Following cleavage, the mature protein translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription. This cleaveage is inhibited by sterols. This gene is located within the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17. Alternative promoter usage and splicing result in multiple transcript variants, including SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, which correspond to RefSeq transcript variants 2 and 3, respectively.
