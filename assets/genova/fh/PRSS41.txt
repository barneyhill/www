# PRSS41

## Overview
PRSS41 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 41, which is a member of the serine protease family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to cleave peptide bonds in proteins, a function that is critical in various physiological processes, including digestion, immune response, and blood coagulation. Serine protease 41 is involved in specific biological pathways and may play a role in cellular processes that are yet to be fully elucidated. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their functions and potential implications in health and disease.
