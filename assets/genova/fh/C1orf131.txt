# C1orf131

## Overview
C1orf131 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 131, or cPERP-A. This protein is primarily involved in cellular processes related to mitosis and ribosome assembly, functioning as a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome in the nucleolus (Wei2024The). C1orf131 plays a critical role in preventing premature recruitment of the helicase DHX37, thereby ensuring proper ribosome assembly (Wei2024The). Beyond its fundamental cellular functions, C1orf131 is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, where it influences cell proliferation and migration through the Akt signaling pathway (Wei2024The). The protein's interactions with various other proteins suggest its involvement in transcriptional regulation, post-translational modifications, and potentially epigenetic modulation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, C1orf131 has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in diverse pathological conditions (Møller2023Integrated).

## Structure


## Function
C1orf131 is involved in several molecular processes in healthy human cells. It encodes a chromosome periphery protein that plays a crucial role in mitosis and is part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, which is essential for ribosome assembly in the nucleolus (Wei2024The). During the formation of the SSU processome, C1orf131 prevents the premature recruitment of the helicase DHX37, indicating its role as a pre-A1 state-specific factor in ribosome assembly (Wei2024The). This function is vital for the early stages of ribosome assembly, which is necessary for protein synthesis.

C1orf131 is also associated with the biogenesis of ribonucleoprotein complexes, as suggested by its subinteractome, which is over-represented by the term 'GO:0022613~ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis' (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). This indicates a potential role in the formation and function of ribonucleoprotein complexes in healthy cells. The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as histone acetyltransferase KAT5, suggest a possible involvement in epigenetic modulation of chromatin (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). These interactions highlight C1orf131's potential role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
C1orf131 is significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis in LUAD patients. Knockdown of C1orf131 in LUAD cells leads to suppressed cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and reduced cell migration, indicating its role in cancer progression through the AKT and p53/p21 signaling pathways and its impact on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Wei2024The). 

C1orf131 is also overexpressed in other cancers, such as liver hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoid neoplasm, and bladder urothelial carcinoma, suggesting its broader role in oncogenesis (Wei2024The). The gene's interactions with proteins like EIF3L, JUN, and PPP2R1A, which are involved in cancer-related pathways, further support its potential involvement in cancer biology (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). 

In addition to its role in cancer, C1orf131 has been identified as one of the top significant genes associated with myocardial infarction in an integrated omics analysis, indicating its potential involvement in cardiovascular diseases (Møller2023Integrated). These findings suggest that C1orf131 could serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
C1orf131, also known as cPERP-A, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes and cancer biology. It interacts with several proteins, including EIF3L, JUN, and PPP2R1A. The interaction with EIF3L is linked to the initiation of protein synthesis, while the interaction with JUN is associated with transcriptional regulation. The interaction with PPP2R1A involves phosphorylation processes, indicating a role in post-translational modifications (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

C1orf131 is also implicated in cancer-related signaling pathways. It interacts with proteins such as CDC73, KRAS, and SMARCB1, which are relevant to oncogenic processes. These interactions suggest that C1orf131 may play a role in signaling pathways critical for cancer progression (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), C1orf131 is involved in the Akt signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and migration. Its knockdown reduces cell migration and delays cell cycle progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in LUAD (Wei2024The). Despite these findings, the specific mechanisms and direct physical interactions of C1orf131, particularly with nucleic acids, remain to be fully elucidated (Wei2024The).
