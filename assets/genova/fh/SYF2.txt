# SYF2

## Overview
SYF2 is a gene that encodes the SYF2 pre-mRNA splicing factor, a nuclear protein integral to the spliceosome complex, which is responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts. This protein plays a pivotal role in pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression, and is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly the transition from the G1 to S phase, thereby promoting cell proliferation (Huang2022Genomewide; Kastner2019Structural). Additionally, SYF2 is implicated in the DNA damage response and alternative splicing regulation, influencing cellular differentiation, proliferation, and survival (Huang2022Genomewide; Tanaka2020ZRANB2). Its expression is notably high in hematopoietic stem cells and T cells, underscoring its importance in both normal cellular function and potential disease development (Huang2022Genomewide).

## Function
SYF2, also known as SYF2 pre-mRNA splicing factor, is a nuclear protein that plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process in gene expression. It is a component of the spliceosome complex, which is responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts, facilitating mRNA maturation (Huang2022Genomewide; Kastner2019Structural). In humans, SYF2 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly in the transition from the G1 to S phase, promoting cell proliferation through its interaction with Cyclin D-type binding protein 1 (Huang2022Genomewide).

SYF2 is also implicated in the DNA damage response, where it is involved in cell cycle checkpoint activation, potentially controlling the replication checkpoint through associations with proteins like MCM3 and PCNA during the S phase (Tanaka2020ZRANB2). This function is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression. SYF2's role in alternative splicing regulation is significant, as it influences the expression of various genes, contributing to cellular differentiation, proliferation, and survival (Huang2022Genomewide; Tanaka2020ZRANB2). Its expression is notably high in hematopoietic stem cells, T cells, and several organs, indicating its importance in both normal cellular function and potential disease development (Huang2022Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The SYF2 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and RNA splicing. It is overexpressed in several cancer types, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it promotes cell proliferation by facilitating the G1-to-S phase transition. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor growth, making SYF2 a potential oncogene and tumor marker (Huang2022Genomewide; Tao2020MicroRNA621).

In breast cancer, SYF2 is involved in resistance to the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin. It regulates alternative splicing events that contribute to drug resistance, particularly through the inclusion of the ECT2-Ex5+ isoform, which is linked to increased tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance (Blijlevens2021Biology; Tanaka2020ZRANB2). SYF2's interaction with other splicing factors, such as ZRANB2, further underscores its role in drug resistance mechanisms (Tanaka2020ZRANB2).

In gastric cancer, SYF2 is a direct target of microRNA-621, which acts as a tumor suppressor. The downregulation of miR-621 leads to increased SYF2 expression, contributing to cancer progression and poor clinical outcomes (Tao2020MicroRNA621). These findings highlight SYF2's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
SYF2, also known as SYF2 pre-mRNA splicing factor, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in pre-mRNA splicing and cell cycle regulation. In humans, SYF2 interacts with the XAB2 protein, which is involved in transcriptional coupling repair and cell cycle regulation (Huang2022Genomewide). It also interacts with CDC40, a gene in yeast that plays a role in cell cycle progression and pre-mRNA splicing (Huang2022Genomewide). SYF2 is part of the Prp19 complex (Prp19C), where it interacts with other components such as Cwc15, Syf1, Isy1, and Ntc20, forming a subcomplex that is essential for the stability and function of Prp19C in transcription elongation and splicing (Henke-Schulz2024The).

SYF2 is also involved in the regulation of alternative splicing events, particularly in the context of breast cancer cell resistance to doxorubicin. It is suggested to associate with ECT2 pre-mRNA as part of the spliceosome, influencing the regulation of 3' splice sites (Tanaka2020ZRANB2). These interactions highlight SYF2's role in complex regulatory networks that govern gene expression and cell cycle processes.
