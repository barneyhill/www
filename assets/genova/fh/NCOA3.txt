# NCOA3

## Overview
NCOA3, or nuclear receptor coactivator 3, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the p160/SRC family of coactivators. The NCOA3 protein functions as a transcriptional coactivator, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with nuclear hormone receptors and various transcription factors. It is characterized by several structural domains, including basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS), and receptor interaction domains (RIDs), which facilitate its interaction with other proteins and its involvement in transcriptional activation (Leo2000Differential; Bulynko2010Nuclear). NCOA3 is implicated in numerous cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism, and is particularly significant in the context of cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and therapeutic resistance (Zhao2003Elevated; Groner2017Role). The protein's ability to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, further enhances its functional versatility and regulatory capacity in various biological pathways (Bulynko2010Nuclear).

## Structure
NCOA3, also known as nuclear receptor coactivator 3, is a member of the p160/SRC family of coactivators and plays a crucial role in transcriptional activation. The protein structure includes several key domains: a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains, receptor interaction domains (RIDs), and transcriptional activation domains (AD1 and AD2) (Leo2000Differential; Bulynko2010Nuclear). The bHLH/PAS domain is highly conserved and facilitates transcription factor binding, while the RIDs contain LXXLL motifs essential for nuclear receptor interaction (Bulynko2010Nuclear). The PAS-B domain specifically interacts with the CID/AD1 domain, which contains LXXLL motifs, and is crucial for complex formation among NCoA family members (Lodrini2008p160SRCNCoA).

NCOA3 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which regulate its activity and interaction with other proteins (Bulynko2010Nuclear). The protein also has several splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity. These structural features and modifications enable NCOA3 to effectively participate in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction pathways.

## Function
NCOA3, also known as nuclear receptor coactivator 3, is a protein that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by acting as a coactivator for nuclear hormone receptors. It enhances the transcriptional activity of these receptors by interacting with various transcription factors and nuclear receptors, thereby modulating gene expression (Lonard2006The; Dasgupta2014Nuclear). NCOA3 is involved in multiple cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism, and is active in the nucleus where it forms part of multiprotein complexes (Lonard2006The; Chiang2009The).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which increases its affinity for transcription factors and enhances its transcriptional activity. These modifications allow NCOA3 to integrate signals from different pathways, coordinating biological functions by modulating gene expression (Dasgupta2014Nuclear). NCOA3 also interacts with thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), which is essential for the activation of several steroid hormone receptors, including estrogen, androgen, and progesterone receptors (Chiang2009The).

In embryonic stem cells, NCOA3 is critical for maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factor Esrrb. It is involved in the transcriptional activation of pluripotency factors, thereby sustaining the self-renewal capacity of these cells (Percharde2012Ncoa3).

## Clinical Significance
NCOA3, also known as AIB1, is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression and amplification. In breast cancer, elevated NCOA3 expression is associated with poor prognosis, including shorter disease-free and overall survival times. It is overexpressed in approximately 64% of breast tumors and amplified in about 10% of primary cases, contributing to aggressive tumor phenotypes and resistance to therapies like tamoxifen (Zhao2003Elevated; Groner2017Role). NCOA3 is also involved in the unfolded protein response and estrogen signaling, which are crucial for tumor growth and resistance to antioestrogens (Gupta2016NCOA3).

In other cancers, such as ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and colorectal, NCOA3 overexpression correlates with disease severity and poor outcomes. It plays a role in promoting metastasis and therapeutic resistance, particularly in hormone-dependent cancers (H.2019The). In thyroid cancer, NCOA3 is overexpressed in over half of the cases, enhancing tumor growth and progression, making it a potential therapeutic target (Li2021NCOA3). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NCOA3 as a biomarker and potential target for cancer therapy.

## Interactions
NCOA3, also known as nuclear receptor coactivator 3, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation. NCOA3 interacts with XBP1, forming part of the IRE1-XBP1-NCOA3 axis, which is significant in breast cancer, particularly in the context of resistance to antioestrogens. This interaction is part of a feedback loop that maintains high levels of NCOA3 and XBP1-S in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (Gupta2016NCOA3). NCOA3 is also phosphorylated by the I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex, enhancing NF-κB-mediated gene expression, which suggests a role in regulating antioestrogen responsiveness (Gupta2016NCOA3).

NCOA3 interacts with thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), a relationship that is essential for the transcriptional activation of nuclear hormone receptors, including estrogen, androgen, and progesterone receptors. This interaction is mediated by specific amino acid motifs in both proteins, with the DXXD motif in TDG and LLXXXL and LLXXL motifs in NCOA3 being crucial for their binding (Chiang2009The).

The PAS-B domain of NCOA3 can interact with the CID/AD1 domain, which contains LXXLL motifs, facilitating complex formation with other NCoA family members and transcription factors such as STAT6 (Lodrini2008p160SRCNCoA). These interactions are important for the transcriptional regulation of nuclear receptors and the recruitment of coactivator complexes to promoter sites (Lodrini2008p160SRCNCoA).
