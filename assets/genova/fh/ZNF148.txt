# ZNF148

## Overview
ZNF148, also known as ZBP-89, is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 148, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which enable it to bind to specific DNA sequences and modulate transcriptional activity. ZNF148 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including muscle differentiation, telomerase activity, and genomic stability. It acts as a negative regulator of muscle differentiation by inhibiting the expression of myogenic transcription factors, thereby maintaining a pluripotent state in muscle cells (Bakke2017Transcription). Additionally, ZNF148 is implicated in cancer biology, where it influences telomerase activity and interacts with tumor suppressor proteins such as p53, highlighting its potential impact on cancer progression and treatment (Bai2002Regulation; Fang2017Functional).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF148, also known as ZBP-89, is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in human cells. It functions primarily as a negative regulator of muscle differentiation by inhibiting the expression of key myogenic transcription factors such as MYOD and MEF2C. This regulation helps maintain a pluripotent state in muscle cells, preventing premature differentiation (Bakke2017Transcription). ZNF148 is also involved in the transcriptional repression of the ENO3 gene in skeletal muscle tissue, indicating its role in muscle fiber regeneration and myogenesis (Bakke2017Transcription).

In addition to its role in muscle differentiation, ZNF148 is implicated in the regulation of TERT expression, which is crucial for telomerase activity and maintaining telomere length. This function is particularly relevant in cancer cell lines, where ZNF148 influences telomerase activity and genomic stability (Fang2017Functional). ZNF148's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression, impacting cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Fang2017Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF148 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. Truncating de novo mutations in ZNF148 are associated with a syndrome characterized by corpus callosum defects, developmental delay, short stature, and dysmorphic features. These mutations result in premature termination codons, leading to a truncated protein that may alter its biological function, potentially causing a loss of function or a dominant negative effect (Stevens2016Truncating). Patients with these mutations exhibit a range of symptoms, including microcephaly, macrocephaly, cardiac defects, and renal abnormalities, with some phenotypes resembling Noonan syndrome (Stevens2016Truncating).

In cancer, ZNF148 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its depletion in breast cancer cell lines leads to increased proliferation and migration, suggesting its role in inhibiting tumor growth. Higher expression levels of ZNF148 are associated with better relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients, particularly those with lymph node-positive cases (Kim2022A). ZNF148 also regulates TERT expression, influencing telomerase activity, which is crucial in cancer biology. Alterations in ZNF148 expression or its interaction with specific genetic variants can impact cancer risk and progression (Fang2017Functional).

## Interactions
ZNF148, also known as ZBP-89, is a zinc finger transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It binds to GC-rich DNA sequences, influencing the transcriptional regulation of target genes (Fang2017Functional). ZNF148 interacts with the C-allele of the SNP rs36115365, affecting the expression of the TERT gene, which is crucial for telomerase activity and cancer risk regulation (Fang2017Functional).

ZNF148 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. It stabilizes p53 by binding to its DNA binding/C-terminal domains, preventing nuclear export and prolonging its half-life, which can lead to growth arrest through p53-dependent and independent mechanisms (Bai2002Regulation). Additionally, ZNF148 is involved in the regulation of the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), where it binds to the RXRα promoter, downregulating its transcription. This interaction plays a role in inhibiting Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication by reducing the transcriptional activity of HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) (Yao2024ZNF148).

These interactions highlight ZNF148's role in modulating gene expression and its potential impact on cancer and viral replication pathways.
