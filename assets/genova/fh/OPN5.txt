# OPN5

## Overview
Opsin 5 (OPN5) is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor protein known as opsin 5, which is part of the opsin family characterized by a seven-transmembrane α-helical structure. This protein functions as a UV-sensitive photoreceptor involved in non-visual photoreception, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes, including the regulation of circadian rhythms and melanogenesis. OPN5 is expressed in several tissues, including the retina, cornea, and skin, where it mediates responses to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) through specific signaling pathways. The gene exhibits alternative splicing, although only one variant encodes the full-length protein necessary for its photoreceptive function. Opsin 5's ability to form a bistable pigment allows it to switch between UV and visible light-absorbing states, which is essential for its function in light-dependent physiological processes (Yamashita2010Opn5; Lan2021Opsin; Kojima2011UV-Sensitive).

## Structure
Opsin 5 (OPN5) is a G protein-coupled receptor characterized by a seven-transmembrane α-helical structure, typical of the opsin family. This structure forms a retinal-binding pocket, where a vitamin A-derivative retinal acts as the chromophore, binding to a conserved lysine residue in helix VII through a Schiff base linkage (Yamashita2010Opn5; Yamashita2014Evolution). The primary structure of OPN5 includes a sequence of amino acids that determine its specific function and interaction with light (Kojima2011UV-Sensitive).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional shape, crucial for its function as a UV-sensitive photoreceptor. OPN5 is capable of forming a bistable pigment, switching between UV and visible light-absorbing states, which is essential for its role in non-visual photoreception (Yamashita2010Opn5; Yamashita2014Evolution).

OPN5 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect its function and localization, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The gene also exhibits alternatively spliced variants, with only one variant encoding the full-length protein necessary for its photoreceptive function (Kojima2011UV-Sensitive).

## Function
Opsin 5 (OPN5) is a UV-sensitive photoreceptor that plays a significant role in various cellular and physiological processes. In human epidermal melanocytes, OPN5 functions as a key regulator of ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced melanogenesis. It acts as a sensor for UVR, initiating a signaling cascade that involves the activation of calcium-dependent G protein-coupled receptors and protein kinase C pathways. This leads to the activation of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which upregulates the expression of tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related proteins, essential for melanin synthesis (Lan2021Opsin).

OPN5 is also involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms in the retina and cornea. It is crucial for the photoentrainment of local circadian oscillators, responding to UV-A and violet light to synchronize these rhythms independently of traditional photoreceptors like rods and cones (Buhr2015Neuropsin).

In the eye, OPN5 participates in a light-dependent pathway that regulates dopamine uptake, influencing vascular development and potentially affecting conditions like retinopathy of prematurity (Nguyen2019An). These functions highlight OPN5's role in non-visual photoreception and its impact on cellular signaling and organismal physiology.

## Interactions
Opsin 5 (OPN5) is a UV-sensitive photoreceptor protein that interacts with G proteins, particularly the Gi subtype, to mediate signal transduction. In mouse models, OPN5 has been shown to activate Gi-type G proteins upon UV exposure, leading to a decrease in cAMP levels, which suggests an inhibitory interaction with adenylate cyclase (Kojima2011UV-Sensitive). This interaction is supported by the co-localization of OPN5 and the alpha subunit of Gi in tissues such as the retina and outer ears, indicating a functional interaction between OPN5 and Gi proteins in these areas (Kojima2011UV-Sensitive).

In human epidermal melanocytes, OPN5 is involved in UVR-induced melanogenesis through a calcium-dependent G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. This pathway involves the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), which is upstream of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), leading to the upregulation of key enzymes in melanin synthesis (Lan2021Opsin). The interaction of OPN5 with calcium channels and the PKC pathway highlights its role in the rapid detection and response to UVR in melanocytes (Lan2021Opsin).
