# HIC2

## Overview
HIC2, or Hypermethylated in Cancer 2, is a gene that encodes the HIC ZBTB transcriptional repressor 2 protein, a zinc finger transcriptional repressor involved in the regulation of gene expression during human development. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding, and a BTB/POZ domain, which is implicated in protein-protein interactions and chromatin remodeling. HIC2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of hemoglobin switching by repressing the transcription of the BCL11A gene, thereby influencing the balance between fetal and adult hemoglobin production (Huang2022HIC2). This regulatory function is particularly significant in fetal erythroid cells, where HIC2 expression is elevated, suggesting its involvement in developmental processes (Huang2022HIC2). The protein's ability to interact with chromatin remodeling complexes and its competitive binding with other transcription factors, such as GATA1, underscore its importance in modulating gene expression (Dykes2018HIC2; Huang2022HIC2).

## Structure


## Function
The HIC2 gene encodes a transcriptional repressor protein that plays a significant role in regulating hemoglobin switching during human development. It functions by repressing the transcription of the BCL11A gene, a key factor in the silencing of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and the activation of adult hemoglobin. HIC2 achieves this by binding to specific enhancer regions of BCL11A, such as the +55 enhancer, reducing chromatin accessibility and GATA1 binding, which are crucial for BCL11A expression (Huang2022HIC2). This repression leads to the de-repression of HBG expression, promoting fetal hemoglobin production (Huang2022HIC2).

HIC2 is expressed at higher levels in fetal erythroid cells compared to adult cells, indicating its role in the developmental regulation of hemoglobin production. Its expression is inversely correlated with BCL11A levels, suggesting a tightly regulated mechanism for hemoglobin switching (Huang2022HIC2). The protein's activity involves chromatin remodeling, as evidenced by increased chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation at HBG genes in cells overexpressing HIC2 (Huang2022HIC2). HIC2's role extends beyond hemoglobin regulation, as it influences a broader fetal transcriptional program, although it does not fully revert cells to a fetal-like state (Huang2022HIC2).

## Interactions
HIC2 interacts with nucleic acids through its zinc finger domains, specifically ZF2-5, which bind to DNA motifs with high affinity. The ZF2-5 domain of HIC2 binds strongly to motif-2 with a dissociation constant (K D ) of 50 nM, indicating a specific interaction with DNA. The crystal structure of the ZF2-5 domain in complex with an oligonucleotide from the +55 enhancer shows that ZF3 and ZF4 are responsible for base pair recognition, involving amino acids such as Gln544, Thr547, Arg550, Arg572, and Tyr574 (Huang2022HIC2).

HIC2 also competes with the GATA1 protein for binding at the BCL11A +55 enhancer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that HIC2 and GATA1 bind to the enhancer in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that HIC2 can displace GATA1 from DNA, indicating a competitive interaction between these proteins at the enhancer site (Huang2022HIC2).

HIC2 may recruit co-repressors via its BTB/POZ domain to alter chromatin accessibility and impede transcription factor binding, although specific co-repressors are not detailed in the provided context (Huang2022HIC2). The protein's interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes are suggested by its homology to HIC1, which is known to interact with complexes such as NuRD and SWI/SNF (Dykes2018HIC2).
