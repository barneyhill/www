# OR2G3

## Overview
The OR2G3 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily G member 3, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it plays a critical role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals. As a transmembrane receptor, it is located in the olfactory epithelium and is responsible for binding specific odorant molecules, which initiates a cascade of intracellular events leading to the perception of smell. Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR2G3 is expressed in other tissues, such as the hypothalamic region and ovarian granulosa cells, suggesting additional roles in reproductive biology and possibly in stress response mechanisms (Cerri2022Clinical; Page2006Genomewide; Tart2013Genomewide).

## Function
The OR2G3 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odorant molecules. These receptors are primarily active in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. This process involves the activation of a G-protein, which subsequently triggers a cascade of intracellular events leading to neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Tart2013Genomewide).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR2G3 has been implicated in other physiological processes. For instance, it is expressed in the hypothalamic region and granulosa cells of the ovarian cortex, suggesting a potential role in reproductive biology (Tart2013Genomewide). The gene has also been associated with the 'Olfactory transduction' pathway, which is enriched in certain conditions, indicating its involvement in broader sensory and possibly regulatory functions (Cerri2022Clinical). The presence of heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoter regions of OR2G3 suggests that it may also be involved in cellular responses to stress, although the evolutionary advantage of this feature remains unclear (Page2006Genomewide).
