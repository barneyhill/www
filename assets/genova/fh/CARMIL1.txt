# CARMIL1

## Overview
CARMIL1 is a gene that encodes the protein capping protein regulator and myosin 1 linker 1, which is a crucial component of the cytoskeleton. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as cell motility, lamellipodia formation, and macropinocytosis. CARMIL1 functions as a scaffold protein, interacting with capping protein (CP) to modulate actin assembly at the leading edge of cells, thereby facilitating cell movement and membrane dynamics (Liang2009Distinct; Edwards2013Physiological). The protein is characterized by several domains, including a pleckstrin homology domain, a leucine-rich repeat domain, a central helical domain, and a proline-rich domain, which contribute to its structural and functional properties (Zwolak2013CARMIL). Mutations in the CARMIL1 gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as hearing loss, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and physiological functions (Mohseni2021Exome).

## Structure
CARMIL1 is a large cytoskeletal scaffold protein composed of approximately 1,370 amino acids, playing a crucial role in cell motility and tissue development. The primary structure of CARMIL1 includes several distinct domains: a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a central helical domain (HD), and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) (Zwolak2013CARMIL).

The PH domain, located at the N-terminus, is involved in membrane interactions and is characterized by a seven-strand beta-barrel capped by a C-terminal alpha-helix, although it exhibits non-canonical features (Zwolak2013CARMIL). The LRR domain, spanning residues 191-638, has a planar horseshoe shape and is involved in protein-protein interactions (Zwolak2013CARMIL). The HD, a 200-amino acid region, facilitates antiparallel dimerization, enhancing membrane binding (Zwolak2013CARMIL).

CARMIL1 functions as a constitutive dimer, with dimerization mediated by the HD and potentially involving the LRR domain (Zwolak2013CARMIL). The PRD contains six canonical SH3-binding PxxP sites, crucial for interactions with other proteins like myosin-I (Zwolak2013CARMIL). The protein's quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is essential for its localization and function at the cell leading edge (Zwolak2013CARMIL).

## Function
CARMIL1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell migration, lamellipodia formation, and macropinocytosis. It interacts with capping protein (CP) to modulate actin assembly at the leading edge of cells, facilitating the formation of lamellipodia, which are actin-rich protrusions critical for cell movement (Liang2009Distinct; Edwards2013Physiological). CARMIL1's interaction with CP is vital for lamellipodial assembly and function, contributing to processes like ruffling and macropinocytosis, which are impaired in CARMIL1-knockdown cells (Edwards2013Physiological).

CARMIL1 is also involved in the regulation of actin dynamics by inhibiting CP's ability to cap actin filaments, thereby promoting actin polymerization (Yang2005Mammalian). This interaction is not required for CARMIL1's localization to the membrane or activation of Rac1, a protein involved in cell signaling and lamellipodia formation (Edwards2013Physiological). CARMIL1 is predominantly active at the cell membrane, particularly at the leading edge of migrating cells, where it influences actin filament dynamics and cell motility (Liang2009Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CARMIL1 gene have been implicated in hearing loss. A specific variant, c.3245G > A, results in the substitution of arginine with glutamine at residue 1082. This alteration potentially disrupts interactions within the CAPZA2 inhibitory region, leading to dysregulation of F-actin capping. Such dysregulation can affect actin assembly, which is crucial for cell motility and intracellular functions. The study identified CARMIL1 as a potential novel candidate gene for hearing loss in Iranian patients, suggesting a possible link between CARMIL1 variants and auditory impairments (Mohseni2021Exome).

Alterations in CARMIL1 expression or function may also contribute to other diseases due to its role in actin cytoskeleton regulation. Disruption in its normal interactions can lead to various conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, as CARMIL1 is involved in cell motility, signaling, and structural integrity. However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from CARMIL1 mutations, aside from hearing loss, are not detailed in the provided context. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical significance of CARMIL1 mutations and their broader impact on human health.

## Interactions
CARMIL1 interacts with capping protein (CP) through specific motifs known as CPI and CSI, which are crucial for its binding and regulatory functions. The interaction between CARMIL1 and CP is essential for modulating actin dynamics by reducing CP's affinity for the barbed ends of actin filaments, thereby promoting CP dissociation and facilitating actin filament uncapping (Edwards2014Capping; Edwards2013Physiological). This interaction is not merely inhibitory but also involves a complex mechanism where CARMIL1 binds to a site on CP distinct from its actin-binding site, suggesting a targeted regulation of CP's capping activity (Edwards2014Capping).

Mutational studies, such as the KR987/989AA point mutant of CARMIL1, have demonstrated the importance of this interaction. The mutant showed significantly reduced binding to CP, failing to prevent CP from capping actin filaments or reverse the capping activity, highlighting the critical role of CARMIL1-CP interaction in actin assembly dynamics (Edwards2013Physiological). CARMIL1 also interacts with other proteins, such as myosin I, indicating its involvement in a broader network of protein interactions that regulate cellular processes like cell motility and membrane trafficking (Uruno2006CARMIL).
