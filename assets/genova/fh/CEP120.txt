# CEP120

## Overview
CEP120, or centrosomal protein 120, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in centriole biogenesis and ciliogenesis. The centrosomal protein 120 is categorized as a centrosomal protein and is integral to the processes of centriole elongation, duplication, and maturation. It is particularly enriched in daughter centrioles and is essential for recruiting other proteins, such as C2CD3 and Talpid3, to nascent centrioles, facilitating the assembly of distal and subdistal appendages necessary for cilia formation (Tsai2019CEP120). The protein's interactions with CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated protein) are crucial for regulating centriole elongation, and its expression levels fluctuate throughout the cell cycle, underscoring its regulatory importance (Lin2013CEP120). Mutations in the CEP120 gene have been linked to various ciliopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions characterized by defective cilia formation and function (Tsai2019CEP120; Roosing2016Mutations).

## Structure
The CEP120 protein is a centrosomal protein involved in centriole elongation and ciliogenesis. It contains several important domains, including an N-terminal microtubule-binding domain essential for binding microtubules, a CPAP-binding domain crucial for centriole duplication, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain necessary for centrosome localization (Betleja2018A). The C-terminal region of CEP120 (amino acids 792-986) is crucial for its interaction with C2CD3, while the middle region (amino acids 416-894) interacts with Talpid3 (Tsai2019CEP120). These interactions are essential for centriole appendage assembly and ciliogenesis (Tsai2019CEP120).

Mutations in CEP120, such as I975S, affect its binding to C2CD3 and impair cilia formation, highlighting the importance of these domains in its function (Tsai2019CEP120). The protein is also involved in limiting the levels of pericentriolar material (PCM) proteins at the centrosome, with higher inhibitory activity at the daughter centriole (Betleja2018A). The structural properties of centrosomal proteins, including CEP120, often feature disordered and coiled-coil regions, which are characteristic of centrosomal proteins (Dos2013Structure). The study of CEP120's structure and interactions provides insights into its role in centriole and cilia function.

## Function
CEP120 (centrosomal protein 120) is a critical component in centriole biogenesis, playing a significant role in centriole elongation, duplication, and maturation. It is particularly enriched in daughter centrioles and is essential for recruiting proteins such as C2CD3 and Talpid3 to nascent centrioles. This recruitment is crucial for the assembly of distal and subdistal appendages, which are necessary for ciliogenesis, the process by which cilia are formed (Tsai2019CEP120).

CEP120 interacts with CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated protein) to regulate centriole elongation. This interaction is vital for the formation of long microtubule-based filaments that are essential for proper centriole structure and function. The protein levels of CEP120 oscillate during the cell cycle, increasing from early S to G2/M phases and decreasing after mitosis, indicating its regulation is critical for centriole formation (Lin2013CEP120).

In quiescent cells, CEP120 helps maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the daughter centriole. Its depletion leads to the accumulation of pericentriolar material and defective ciliary assembly, highlighting its role in centrosome function and primary cilium assembly (Betleja2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP120 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome (JS), Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD), Meckel syndrome (MKS), and Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome (OFD). These conditions are characterized by defects in cilia formation and function, leading to a variety of clinical manifestations such as neurological symptoms, skeletal dysplasia, and organ malformations (Tsai2019CEP120; Roosing2016Mutations; Barroso‐Gil2021Update).

Specific mutations in CEP120, such as I975S, L712F, and L726P, have been shown to impair cilia formation by disrupting interactions with proteins like C2CD3 and Talpid3, which are essential for centriole biogenesis and ciliogenesis (Tsai2019CEP120). The I975S mutation, for example, reduces CEP120's binding to C2CD3, affecting cilia assembly and contributing to the pathology of Joubert syndrome (Tsai2019CEP120).

CEP120 mutations can also lead to complex phenotypes, including occipital encephalocele and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, as observed in some fetuses (Roosing2016Mutations). The phenotypic variability associated with CEP120 mutations underscores the importance of comprehensive genetic analyses in diagnosing ciliopathy-related conditions (Roosing2016Mutations).

## Interactions
CEP120 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for centriole elongation and ciliogenesis. It forms a complex with CPAP, a protein essential for centriole elongation. This interaction is mediated by the central region (C3) of CEP120 and the C terminus (CP3) of CPAP, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Lin2013CEP120). CEP120's interaction with CPAP is necessary for centriole elongation, and its overexpression can lead to the formation of extra-long centrioles (Lin2013CEP120).

CEP120 also interacts with C2CD3 and Talpid3, proteins involved in centriole appendage assembly and ciliogenesis. The C-terminal region of CEP120 (amino acids 792-986) is responsible for its interaction with C2CD3, while the middle region (amino acids 416-894) interacts with Talpid3 (Tsai2019CEP120). These interactions are crucial for recruiting C2CD3 and Talpid3 to the distal ends of centrioles, facilitating the assembly of distal and subdistal appendages necessary for ciliogenesis (Tsai2019CEP120). Mutations in CEP120, such as I975S, can impair its binding to C2CD3, affecting cilia formation (Tsai2019CEP120).
