# PSG3

## Overview
PSG3, or pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein family, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein product of PSG3 is primarily expressed in the placenta, specifically in the syncytiotrophoblast cells, and plays a significant role in placental development and maternal-fetal interactions. As a glycoprotein, it is involved in immune modulation, promoting maternal-fetal tolerance by influencing cytokine production and macrophage activation. The protein is characterized by the presence of an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide, which is crucial for cell attachment and signaling, potentially facilitating embryonic implantation. The regulation of PSG3 expression is complex, involving various transcription factors and responsive elements, highlighting its importance in maintaining a healthy pregnancy (Camolotto2010Expression; Wu1999Effect; Racca2011KrüppelLike).

## Function
PSG3, a member of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein family, plays a crucial role in placental development and function. It is primarily expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast cells of the placenta, which are essential for maternal-fetal exchange and hormone synthesis during pregnancy (Racca2011KrüppelLike). PSG3 is involved in immune modulation, promoting maternal-fetal tolerance by inducing monocytes to synthesize anti-inflammatory cytokines and promoting alternative macrophage activation, which is relevant to the shift from Th1 to Th2-mediated immune responses (Camolotto2010Expression).

The transcriptional regulation of PSG3 involves several key elements, including a Retinoic Acid Responsive Element (RARE) and a GA-binding protein (GABP) consensus site, which are crucial for its promoter activity during trophoblast differentiation (Camolotto2010Expression). The expression of PSG3 is upregulated during trophoblast differentiation, serving as an early marker of this process (Camolotto2010Expression). The regulation of PSG3 is also influenced by transcription factors such as Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), which transactivates the PSG3 promoter, indicating its role in placental gene expression (Racca2011KrüppelLike). These molecular processes underscore the importance of PSG3 in maintaining a healthy pregnancy.

## Interactions
PSG3, a member of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein family, is involved in various interactions that are crucial for its function during pregnancy. One notable feature of PSG3 is the presence of an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide, which serves as a cell attachment site recognized by cell surface receptors. This sequence is suggested to provide positional cues and growth signals to cells during development, potentially preparing the embryo for attachment to the uterine wall and implantation (Wu1999Effect).

Although specific protein interactions of PSG3 are not detailed extensively, it shares structural features with other PSGs, such as PSG1, which interacts with integrin α5β1. This interaction is significant for the adhesion and migration of extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) (Rattila2019Interaction). The BAP3 monoclonal antibody binds to the B2 domain of PSG3, indicating potential shared structural features with other PSGs like PSG1, PSG4, PSG6, PSG7, and PSG8 (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific; Rattila2019Interaction).

The interactions of PSG3, particularly through its RGD sequence, suggest a role in modulating cell adhesion and signaling during early embryonic development, although specific binding partners and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
