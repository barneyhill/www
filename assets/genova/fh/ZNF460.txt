# ZNF460

## Overview
ZNF460 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 460, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs and a KRAB domain, which facilitate its role in DNA binding and transcriptional repression, respectively (Dai2003Characterization). ZNF460 is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, cell differentiation, and proliferation. It has been implicated in the pathophysiology of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, where it is associated with the clearance of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, as well as in several cancers, where its altered expression influences tumor progression and metastasis (Hao2021Overexpression; Gong2024Spatial). The gene is located on chromosome 19q13.1→q13.4 and may produce multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, contributing to its diverse functional roles (Dai2003Characterization).

## Structure
ZNF460 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2 type zinc finger motifs, which are integral to its function as a transcription factor. These motifs are defined by a consensus sequence where a zinc atom is coordinated by cysteine and histidine residues, allowing the protein to fit into the major groove of DNA and interact with specific DNA sequences (Dai2003Characterization). The protein also contains a KRAB domain, a potent transcription repression domain that often interacts with corepressors such as TIF1ß. The KRAB domain is divided into KRAB A and KRAB B boxes, with the A box being essential for repressor activity (Dai2003Characterization).

The gene encoding ZNF460 is located on human chromosome 19q13.1→q13.4, and its structure has been characterized through cloning and sequencing efforts. The study of ZNF460 involved constructing a cDNA library using human fetal brain mRNA, which facilitated the determination of the complete gene sequence (Dai2003Characterization). ZNF460 may have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, a common feature among zinc finger proteins, which can lead to variations in its functional properties. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may also occur, influencing the protein's activity and interactions.

## Function
ZNF460 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a significant role in the regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells. It contains a KRAB domain, which is known for its potent transcription repression capabilities through protein-protein interactions (Dai2003Characterization). ZNF460 is involved in stabilizing lineage commitment during cellular differentiation, although its distinct biological functions are not fully elucidated (Dai2003Characterization).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, ZNF460 has been identified as a transcription factor with high enrichment in gene modules related to the clearance of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting its potential role in promoting neuron survival and clearing pathological hallmarks of the disease (Gong2024Spatial). It is also noted for its enrichment in gene modules associated with neuronal stress responses and degradation processes, indicating its involvement in the regulation of neuronal protection and stress responses (Gong2024Spatial).

ZNF460 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby modulating the transcription of target genes involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation (Dai2003Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF460 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In colon cancer, ZNF460 is significantly overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with increased tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and elevated CA19-9 levels. High ZNF460 expression correlates with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival, making it an independent prognostic factor for colon cancer patients. The gene promotes cancer cell invasion and metastasis through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hao2021Overexpression).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ZNF460 regulates the expression of circular RNA circRPPH1, which is upregulated in TNBC tissues. CircRPPH1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA, sponging miR-326 and leading to the activation of the FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which promotes cancer cell growth and metastasis. This regulatory mechanism highlights ZNF460's role in TNBC progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Zhang2024ZNF460mediated).

ZNF460 also influences breast cancer progression by regulating CD24 expression. It binds to the CD24 promoter, enhancing its expression, which is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients (Wang2024LINC00525).

## Interactions
ZNF460, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, primarily functioning as a transcription factor. It has been shown to bind to specific promoter regions, such as the CD24 promoter in breast cancer, enhancing CD24 expression. This interaction is confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, which demonstrate ZNF460's binding to the CD24 promoter (Wang2024LINC00525). ZNF460 also interacts with the RPPH1 gene promoter in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), promoting the transcription of RPPH1 and the production of circRPPH1, a circular RNA that acts as a molecular sponge for miR-326 (Zhang2024ZNF460mediated).

In the context of Alzheimer's Disease, ZNF460 is identified as a transcription factor with high enrichment in gene modules related to Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle clearance. It interacts with the APOC1 promoter, enhancing its transcription, which is linked to lipid metabolism and AD risk (Gong2024Spatial). Additionally, ZNF460 contains a KRAB domain, known for its role in transcriptional repression through interactions with corepressors like TIF1ß, which enhances repression via direct interactions (Dai2003Characterization). These interactions highlight ZNF460's multifaceted role in gene regulation across different biological contexts.
