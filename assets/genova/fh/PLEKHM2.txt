# PLEKHM2

## Overview
PLEKHM2 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology and RUN domain containing M2, also known as SKIP (SifA and kinesin-interacting protein). This protein is integral to intracellular trafficking and autophagy, particularly in the transport and positioning of lysosomes within cells. PLEKHM2 is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal RUN domain, WD domains, and a carboxy-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins and cellular components (Muhammad2015PLEKHM2mutation; Qiu2023Mechanistic). The protein plays a crucial role in neuronal and cardiomyocyte function, impacting processes such as synaptic maturation and mitochondrial regulation. Mutations in the PLEKHM2 gene have been linked to severe cardiovascular conditions and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Zhang2024PLEKHM2; Muhammad2015PLEKHM2mutation).

## Structure
The PLEKHM2 protein, also known as SKIP (SifA and kinesin-interacting protein), is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in cellular processes. It contains an N-terminal RUN domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with the small GTPase Arl8b, facilitating lysosomal transport and positioning (Qiu2023Mechanistic). The protein also includes two WD domains and a carboxy-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is crucial for membrane association and interaction with other cellular components (Muhammad2015PLEKHM2mutation).

A frameshift mutation in exon 12 of the PLEKHM2 gene results in a truncated protein that lacks the PH domain, potentially leading to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA or rescue of translation by exon skipping (Muhammad2015PLEKHM2mutation). This mutation affects the protein's ability to interact with the late endosomal GTPase Rab9, which is essential for endocytotic trafficking and lysosomal distribution (Muhammad2015PLEKHM2mutation).

The PLEKHM2 protein interacts with kinesin-1, facilitating the motor's activation and the anterograde transport of lysosomes, which is vital for processes such as autophagy and synaptic maturation (BenZvi2022PLEKHM2). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in maintaining lysosomal distribution and function.

## Function
The PLEKHM2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in intracellular trafficking and autophagy in healthy human cells. PLEKHM2 is involved in the anterograde transport of lysosomes, facilitating their movement from the nucleus to the cell periphery along microtubules. This process is mediated by the KINESIN-1 motor protein and involves the recruitment of the small GTPase ARL8, which indirectly couples to KINESIN-1 subunits through PLEKHM2 (Zhang2024PLEKHM2; BenZvi2022PLEKHM2). 

In neurons, PLEKHM2 ensures proper lysosomal distribution, which is crucial for synaptic maturation and neurotransmission. It supports membrane remodeling through lysosomal movement to neurites, aiding in synaptic function (BenZvi2022PLEKHM2). In cardiomyocytes, PLEKHM2 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and regulating oxidative stress. Its deficiency leads to impaired mitochondrial clearance, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and disrupted autophagic flux, contributing to cardiomyopathy (Zhang2024PLEKHM2).

The gene's expression is notably high in the brain and testis, indicating its significant role in these tissues, particularly in neuronal development and function (BenZvi2022PLEKHM2). Overall, PLEKHM2 is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function through its involvement in lysosomal and mitochondrial dynamics.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLEKHM2 gene are associated with several severe cardiovascular conditions, including recessive dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC). These mutations lead to abnormal lysosomal localization and impaired autophagy flux, contributing to the pathogenesis of these cardiac conditions (Muhammad2015PLEKHM2mutation). Specifically, a frameshift mutation in exon 12 of PLEKHM2, identified in a Bedouin family, results in a truncated protein that disrupts normal lysosomal distribution and autophagic processes (Muhammad2015PLEKHM2mutation).

PLEKHM2 deficiency also affects mitochondrial function, leading to impaired mitochondrial clearance and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cardiomyocytes. This contributes to myocardial contractility issues and abnormal calcium handling, which are critical in the progression of cardiomyopathy (Zhang2024PLEKHM2). In addition to cardiovascular implications, PLEKHM2 mutations have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Impaired autophagic flux in neurons derived from patients with PLEKHM2 mutations suggests a role in conditions like epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (BenZvi2022PLEKHM2). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PLEKHM2 in both cardiac and neurological health.

## Interactions
PLEKHM2, also known as pleckstrin homology and RUN domain containing M2, is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the KINESIN-1 motor protein, which is essential for the anterograde transport of lysosomes along microtubules. This interaction is crucial for proper lysosomal distribution and function, impacting processes such as axonal growth and synaptic maturation in neurons (BenZvi2022PLEKHM2).

PLEKHM2 also forms a complex with the BLOC-1-related complex (BORC) and the small GTPase ARL8. This complex is responsible for recruiting ARL8 to the lysosomal membrane, facilitating lysosomal transport and positioning within cells (Korover2023Functional; BenZvi2022PLEKHM2). The interaction with ARL8 is particularly important for binding to microtubules and controlling lysosome positioning, which affects autophagic flux by influencing the formation and fusion rates of autophagosomes (Korover2023Functional).

Additionally, PLEKHM2 interacts with several Rab GTPases, including Rab7, Rab9, and Rab1a, which are involved in endocytotic trafficking and vesicle movement. These interactions are necessary for proper lysosome distribution and function (Muhammad2015PLEKHM2mutation).
