# SDHAF3

## Overview
The SDHAF3 gene encodes the protein succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 3, which is integral to the assembly and stabilization of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex. This complex is a crucial component of both the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, playing a vital role in cellular respiration and energy production. SDHAF3 specifically facilitates the maturation of the SDHB subunit, ensuring the proper function and structural integrity of the SDH complex. The protein is categorized as an assembly factor, and its activity is essential for protecting against reactive oxygen species during the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters. Mutations in SDHAF3, such as the p.Phe53Leu variant, can disrupt its interaction with SDHB, potentially leading to reduced SDH activity and contributing to the pathogenesis of diseases like pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (Dwight2017Analysis).

## Function
SDHAF3, or succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 3, plays a crucial role in the assembly and stabilization of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, which is a key component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In healthy human cells, SDHAF3 is involved in the maturation of the SDHB subunit of SDH, ensuring the proper functioning of the enzyme in cellular respiration and energy production (Dwight2017Analysis).

SDHAF3 is active in the mitochondria, where it facilitates the assembly of the SDH complex by interacting with SDHB. This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and electron transfer capability of the SDH complex, which is vital for efficient cellular respiration (Dwight2017Analysis). The protein's role in SDHB maturation also includes protecting against reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage during the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are critical for the electron transport chain's function (Dwight2017Analysis).

Mutations in SDHAF3, such as the p.Phe53Leu variant, can impair its interaction with SDHB, potentially leading to reduced SDH activity and contributing to the pathogenesis of certain diseases (Dwight2017Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SDHAF3 gene, particularly the c.157 T > C (p.Phe53Leu) variant, have been associated with the development of pheochromocytoma (PC) and paraganglioma (PGL). These conditions are linked to mutations in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits, and SDHAF3 plays a crucial role in the assembly and maturation of these subunits, especially SDHB (Dwight2017Analysis). The p.Phe53Leu variant is more prevalent in individuals with PC/PGL compared to the general population and is predicted to be damaging to protein function. This variant impairs SDH activity and reduces the interaction with SDHB, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis by affecting SDH function and stability, leading to succinate accumulation and tumorigenic pathways such as pseudo-hypoxia and hypermethylation (Dwight2017Analysis).

In familial cases, the SDHAF3 variant has been found alongside SDHB mutations, suggesting a modifying role in the pathology of these tumors (Dwight2017Analysis). Functional studies indicate that while the p.Phe53Leu variant does not significantly impair SDH activity in mammalian cells, it does affect the interaction between SDHAF3 and SDHB, which is critical for SDHB maturation and protection from reactive oxygen species (Dwight2017Analysis). These findings underscore the potential clinical significance of SDHAF3 mutations in the context of SDH-deficient tumors.

## Interactions
SDHAF3, also known as succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 3, plays a crucial role in the assembly and stabilization of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex. It is involved in the maturation of the SDHB subunit, a key component of the SDH complex, which is essential for the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. SDHAF3 interacts with SDHB to facilitate its proper assembly and function. The interaction between SDHAF3 and SDHB is impaired by the p.Phe53Leu variant of SDHAF3, which affects the binding with specific SDHB mutants, such as p.Arg46Gln and p.Arg46Gly, indicating the importance of these residues in the interaction (Dwight2017Analysis).

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that the SDHAF3 p.Phe53Leu variant can still physically interact with SDHB, although the interaction is weakened compared to the wild-type SDHAF3 (Dwight2017Analysis). The SDHB p.Arg242His mutation completely disrupts the interaction with SDHAF3, highlighting Arg242 as a critical site for binding (Dwight2017Analysis). These interactions are vital for the stability and function of the SDH complex, and disruptions can contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases such as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (Dwight2017Analysis).
