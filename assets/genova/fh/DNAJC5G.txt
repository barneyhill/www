# DNAJC5G

## Overview
DNAJC5G is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C5 gamma. This protein is part of the Hsp40 family, which is known for its role as a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding and stress response. The Hsp40 proteins typically function by regulating the activity of Hsp70 proteins, assisting in the stabilization of unfolded proteins, and preventing aggregation. DNAJC5G, like other members of the DnaJ family, contains a J-domain, which is crucial for its interaction with Hsp70 proteins. The specific biological functions and interactions of DNAJC5G are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in cellular stress responses and protein homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
