# RBM14

## Overview
RBM14 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 14, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and DNA repair. The protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a prion-like domain (PLD), which facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins, contributing to its role in cellular stress responses and phase separation (Qin2021RBM14; Jang2020Intrinsically). As an intrinsically disordered protein, RBM14 is crucial in the DNA damage response, particularly in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, where it aids in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Jang2020Intrinsically). Additionally, RBM14 functions as a coactivator for nuclear receptors and is essential for adipocyte differentiation, highlighting its involvement in transcriptional regulation and adipogenesis (Firmin2017The). The protein's interactions with various cellular components underscore its significance in maintaining genomic stability and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Wang2024A; Hu2023RBM14).

## Structure
RBM14 is a human protein characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a prion-like domain (PLD). The protein contains two highly conserved RRMs at the N-terminus, which are crucial for its RNA binding capabilities (Qin2021RBM14). The C-terminal region of RBM14 includes an intrinsically disordered PLD, which is essential for its recruitment to DNA damage sites, particularly in the context of DNA repair processes (Jang2020Intrinsically). This domain is also involved in phase separation, a property that allows RBM14 to form liquid droplets, contributing to its role in RNA metabolism and cellular stress responses (Xiao2019Regulation).

RBM14 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions. The protein is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functional roles (Qin2021RBM14). The structural features of RBM14, including its RRMs and PLD, suggest its involvement in various cellular processes through protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, highlighting its multifunctional nature in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing (Firmin2017The).

## Function
RBM14 (RNA binding motif protein 14) is an intrinsically disordered protein involved in several critical molecular processes within healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the DNA damage response (DDR), particularly in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is essential for repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. RBM14 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)- and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent manner, where it facilitates the generation of RNA:DNA hybrids crucial for efficient DSB repair (Jang2020Intrinsically). 

RBM14 interacts with the KU complex and is necessary for the recruitment and retention of XRCC4, another key protein in the NHEJ pathway, to damaged chromatin (Nishida2017RNA). It also plays a role in regulating the choice between homologous recombination (HR) and NHEJ repair pathways, particularly in transcriptionally inactive regions (Jang2020Intrinsically). 

In addition to its role in DNA repair, RBM14 is involved in transcriptional regulation and adipogenesis. It acts as a coactivator for nuclear receptors, such as PPARγ, and is essential for adipocyte differentiation (Firmin2017The). RBM14 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly of nuclear bodies and the maintenance of genomic stability (Harrison2017RNAbinding).

## Clinical Significance
RBM14 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in RNA processing and regulation. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), a type of non-small cell lung cancer, RBM14 is upregulated and associated with TP53 mutations and different cancer stages. High levels of RBM14 correlate with poorer overall survival in LUAD patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Hu2023RBM14).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), RBM14 is necessary for maintaining the stem-like state of cancer cells. Its knockdown reduces tumorigenicity and increases sensitivity to radiation, highlighting its dual role as both an oncogene and tumor suppressor, depending on the cancer type (Kai2016Roles; Marcelino2017RNA).

RBM14 is also involved in DNA repair processes, particularly in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway for repairing double-strand breaks. Its knockdown impairs the accuracy of NHEJ, leading to increased mutagenic repair, which suggests a role in maintaining genomic stability (Jang2020Intrinsically).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), RBM14 is identified as a candidate biomarker due to its association with circadian rhythm disturbances and immune cell infiltration, although no targeted drugs have been identified for it (Wang2024A).

## Interactions
RBM14 (RNA binding motif protein 14) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the KU protein complex, which is essential for the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair. This interaction is crucial for the generation of RNA:DNA hybrids at double-strand break (DSB) sites, highlighting RBM14's role in maintaining genomic stability (Jang2020Intrinsically).

RBM14 also interacts with α-tubulin, a key component of the microtubule network, during oocyte meiotic maturation. This interaction is important for regulating spindle morphology and ensuring proper chromosome alignment, as RBM14 co-localizes with α-tubulin and affects its acetylation state (Qin2021RBM14).

In the context of viral infections, RBM14 relocalizes to the nucleolus in response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection, a process driven by the viral NS1 protein. This relocalization is necessary for efficient viral replication, indicating that RBM14 is a critical host factor for IAV (Beyleveld2018Nucleolar).

RBM14 is also involved in adipogenesis through its interaction with the long intergenic non-coding RNA Paral1. This interaction is necessary for adipocyte differentiation, as both RBM14 and Paral1 are required for the expression of adipogenic genes (Firmin2017The).
