# ACAP1

## Overview
ACAP1 is a gene that encodes the protein ArfGAP with coiled-coil, ankyrin repeat, and PH domains 1, which is primarily involved in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for ARF6, playing a pivotal role in endocytic recycling processes, particularly in the recycling of integrin β1 and Glut4, which are crucial for cell migration and glucose homeostasis (Li2005Phosphorylation; Li2007An). The ACAP1 protein is characterized by its BAR and PH domains, which are essential for membrane remodeling and curvature induction, facilitating the formation of transport carriers (Pang2014A). The regulation of ACAP1's function is mediated by phosphorylation through the Akt signaling pathway, which is vital for its role in the recycling of integrin β1 (Li2005Phosphorylation). Alterations in ACAP1 expression have been linked to various diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2005Phosphorylation; Yin2022Biological).

## Structure
The ACAP1 protein is characterized by its BAR-PH domain, which plays a crucial role in membrane remodeling and curvature induction. The BAR domain forms a banana-shaped dimer through dimerization, consisting of a bundle of eight helices, with a large hydrophobic interface contributing to high dimerization affinity (Pang2014A). The PH domain, following the BAR domain, is essential for membrane binding and curvature induction. It contains a positively charged patch that interacts with the negatively charged membrane surface and a loop with a bulky hydrophobic residue, likely inserting into the membrane to promote curvature (Pang2014A).

The ACAP1 protein forms a unique lattice structure on membranes, with the basic repeating unit being a tetramer. This structure is stabilized by 'end-to-arch' interactions between dimers, where one end of a BAR-PH dimer interacts with the mid-portion of another dimer (Chan2019ACAP1). The PH domain is critical for these interactions, with specific residues forming salt bridges and hydrogen bonds that stabilize the lattice (Chan2019ACAP1).

The ACAP1 BAR-PH domain exhibits asymmetric dynamics, with only one PH domain of the dimer significantly interacting with the membrane, facilitating membrane curvature (Pang2014A).

## Function
ACAP1 is a protein involved in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics, primarily functioning as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for ARF6. It plays a crucial role in endocytic recycling, particularly in the recycling of integrin β1 and Glut4, which are essential for cell migration and glucose homeostasis, respectively (Li2005Phosphorylation; Li2007An). ACAP1 is part of a novel clathrin coat complex that mediates the recycling of these proteins, challenging the conventional view that coat proteins are not important for endocytic recycling (Li2007An).

The protein contains BAR and PH domains, which are critical for membrane remodeling. The PH domain is responsible for membrane binding and curvature generation, while the BAR domain facilitates clustering at the membrane by interacting with neighboring ACAP1 proteins (Pang2014A). ACAP1's role in membrane dynamics is further supported by its ability to induce membrane curvature and tubulation, which is essential for the formation of transport carriers (Pang2014A).

ACAP1's function is regulated by phosphorylation through the Akt signaling pathway, which is necessary for its role in the stimulation-dependent recycling of integrin β1 (Li2005Phosphorylation). This regulation is crucial for processes such as cell migration, where ACAP1's interaction with integrin β1 at the recycling endosome is modulated by Akt phosphorylation (Li2005Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ACAP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a transcriptome-wide association study identified a putative causal variant, rs61759532, which affects ACAP1 expression levels. The risk allele T of this variant reduces ACAP1 expression in whole blood, suggesting a potential link to SLE pathogenesis (Yin2022Biological). 

ACAP1 is also involved in cell migration processes, which are crucial in cancer progression. Phosphorylation of ACAP1 by Akt is necessary for the recycling of integrin β1, a process that affects cell migration. Mutations at phosphorylation sites S554 and S724, such as S554A and S724A, disrupt ACAP1's interaction with integrin β1, inhibiting cell migration. This highlights the importance of the ACAP1-Akt-β1 pathway in regulating cell migration, with potential implications for cancer metastasis (Li2005Phosphorylation).

In the context of myelomeningocele, a study on amniotic fluid transcriptomics identified ACAP1 as one of the genes with altered expression, suggesting its involvement in spinal cord and neuronal development. This dysregulation may contribute to novel disease mechanisms in myelomeningocele (Tarui2017Amniotic).

## Interactions
ACAP1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in endocytic recycling processes. It forms a complex with clathrin heavy chain (CHC) and Glut4, a glucose transporter, in differentiated adipocytes. This interaction is essential for the proper localization and recycling of Glut4, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Li2007An). ACAP1 binds directly to the middle cytoplasmic loop of Glut4, facilitating its recycling, while clathrin triskelion does not show substantial binding to Glut4 domains (Li2007An).

ACAP1 also interacts with ARF6, a GTPase, where it acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). This interaction is significant for the regulation of Glut4 recycling and glucose uptake in adipocytes (Li2007An). The GAP activity of ACAP1 is crucial for its function in the clathrin coat complex involved in endocytic recycling (Li2007An).

In the context of integrin β1 recycling, ACAP1 interacts with β1 integrin at the recycling endosome. This interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation of ACAP1 at serine 554 by Akt, which is essential for β1 recycling and cell migration (Li2005Phosphorylation). The phosphorylation at S554 and the conformation influenced by S724 are critical for ACAP1's interaction with β1 (Li2005Phosphorylation).
