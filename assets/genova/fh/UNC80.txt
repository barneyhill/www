# UNC80

## Overview
The UNC80 gene encodes the unc-80 homolog, a protein that serves as a vital subunit of the NALCN channel complex, which is integral to neuronal excitability and function. This protein is categorized as a scaffold protein due to its role in recruiting other proteins, such as Src kinases, into the channel complex, thereby facilitating channel activation. The UNC80 protein is characterized by a large, helix-rich structure that forms a stable heterodimer with UNC79, contributing to the regulation of sodium leak currents essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential in neurons. It is predominantly localized in the soma, axons, and dendrites, where it influences dendritic excitability. Mutations in the UNC80 gene are linked to severe neurological disorders, including intellectual disability and hypotonia, underscoring its critical role in neuronal development and function (Perez2015UNC80mutation; Wie2020Intellectual).

## Structure
The UNC80 protein is a critical component of the NALCN channel complex, characterized by a large structure with several distinct domains. It includes a ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) between α43 and α45, and two C3H-type zinc fingers located between α26 and α27, and α46 and α47, which are situated on the surface of the UNC79-UNC80 heterodimer (Kang2022Structure). The protein's structure is essential for its function, with specific regions facilitating interactions with other subunits of the NALCN complex. The N-terminal half of UNC80 is sufficient for its association with NALCN, while the C-terminal region is crucial for dendritic localization and interaction with UNC79 (Wie2020Intellectual).

UNC80 forms a stable heterodimer with UNC79, characterized by a large helix-rich structure in the cytosol, forming a plier-shaped complex through head-to-tail interactions (Kang2022Structure). The interaction between UNC79 and UNC80 occurs at three regions: head, joint, and tail, with specific helices from each protein interacting to form these regions (Kang2022Structure). Sequence alignment studies have shown conserved regions across species, highlighting the evolutionary importance of these structural features (Kschonsak2021Structural).

## Function
The UNC80 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the NALCN channel complex, which plays a significant role in regulating neuronal excitability and maintaining proper neuronal function. In healthy human cells, UNC80 is involved in facilitating the surface localization of the NALCN channel, enhancing its sodium leak current, which is essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential and neuronal excitability (Wie2020Intellectual). UNC80 interacts with other subunits, such as UNC79 and NALCN, to form a functional channel complex that contributes to sodium-leak conductance in neurons (Wie2020Intellectual).

The protein is localized in the soma, axons, and dendrites of neurons, where it regulates dendritic excitability by controlling the NALCN current (Wie2020Intellectual). The C-terminal region of UNC80 is crucial for its dendritic localization, as truncations in this region lead to its retention in the soma and absence in axons and dendrites, which is linked to severe phenotypes (Wie2020Intellectual). UNC80 also acts as a scaffold for Src kinases, recruiting them into the NALCN channel complex, which is necessary for channel activation (Wang2009UNC80). This protein is indispensable for neuronal localization and robust circadian locomotor rhythms (Zhou2022Architecture).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UNC80 gene are associated with several severe neurological disorders. These mutations can lead to a syndrome characterized by hypotonia, severe intellectual disability, dyskinesia, and dysmorphism. Affected individuals often exhibit profound global developmental delay, with minimal acquisition of developmental milestones such as social or verbal skills, and are typically unable to sit or ambulate (Perez2015UNC80mutation). The syndrome is similar to that caused by mutations in the interacting cation channel NALCN, which is involved in basal sodium leak conductance in neurons (Perez2015UNC80mutation).

UNC80 mutations are also linked to autosomal-recessive severe infantile encephalopathy, characterized by profound developmental delay and severe hypotonia, but notably without seizures (Shamseldin2016Mutations). In some cases, mutations in UNC80 result in severe intellectual disability, impaired speech development, and premature death (Wie2020Intellectual). These mutations can disrupt the interaction and localization of the NALCN channel complex, affecting dendritic localization and neuronal function (Wie2020Intellectual).

In animal models, UNC80 deficiency leads to severe apnea and neonatal lethality, highlighting its critical role in respiratory control and neuronal excitability (Wie2020Intellectual).

## Interactions
UNC80 is a critical component of the NALCN channel complex, interacting with several proteins to regulate neuronal excitability. It forms a complex with UNC79 and NALCN, where UNC80 directly associates with NALCN, while UNC79 interacts with UNC80 to form a functional channel complex (Lu2010Extracellular). This interaction is essential for the sensitivity of the NALCN channel to extracellular calcium levels, as demonstrated in studies where UNC80 is necessary for the channel's response to changes in calcium (Lu2010Extracellular).

UNC80 also acts as a scaffold protein, recruiting Src kinases into the NALCN channel complex, which is crucial for channel activation by neuropeptides like substance P. This interaction is specific, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments where wild-type and constitutively active Src kinases co-immunoprecipitate with UNC80, but a dominant-negative Src mutant does not (Wang2009UNC80).

Mutations in UNC80 can disrupt its interactions, leading to significant physiological effects. For instance, a homozygous nonsense mutation in UNC80 has been linked to a syndrome characterized by hypotonia and intellectual disability, suggesting that these mutations may impair the protein's ability to interact with its partners in the NALCN complex (Perez2015UNC80mutation).
