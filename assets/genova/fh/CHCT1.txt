# CHCT1

## Overview
The CHCT1 gene encodes the protein CHD1 helical C-terminal domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its helical C-terminal domain, a structural motif that is often implicated in protein-protein interactions and chromatin remodeling activities. While the specific biological functions of CHD1 helical C-terminal domain containing 1 are still under investigation, proteins with similar domains are known to play roles in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. The study of CHCT1 and its encoded protein is crucial for understanding its potential involvement in cellular pathways and its implications in human health and disease.
