# NPIPB8

## Overview
The NPIPB8 gene encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member B8, a protein that is part of a family known for its interactions with the nuclear pore complex. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The NPIPB8 protein is categorized as a nuclear pore complex-associated protein, and its expression and genetic variations have been linked to several human diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders. Research has highlighted its potential role in immune system regulation, with specific expression patterns and genetic associations suggesting its involvement in conditions such as Crohn's disease (Gabrielsen2016Genetic). Additionally, chromosomal inversions affecting NPIPB8 expression have been observed, although the full clinical implications of these genetic alterations are still under investigation (CarrerasGallo2022The).

## Clinical Significance
NPIPB8 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and genetic variations. In the context of autoimmune diseases, NPIPB8 expression is associated with risk variants for conditions such as Crohn's disease. A significant expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) association was identified with the SNP rs151181, suggesting that changes in NPIPB8 expression could be relevant to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (Gabrielsen2016Genetic). The study also highlights that these eQTL signals appear to be thymus-specific, indicating a potential role in immune self-tolerance and the regulation of immune responses, which are crucial in preventing autoimmune responses (Gabrielsen2016Genetic).

Additionally, NPIPB8 expression is affected by chromosomal inversions, such as those at 16p11.2, which are associated with significant expression changes. This inversion leads to the upregulation of NPIPB8, although the clinical significance of this alteration remains to be fully understood (CarrerasGallo2022The). Furthermore, structural variations in NPIPB8 have been observed in chimpanzees, suggesting potential species-specific traits, but the clinical implications in humans are not directly addressed (Soto2020Identification). Further research is needed to explore the full clinical significance of NPIPB8 expression alterations and genetic variations.
