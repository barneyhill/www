# OR4Q3

## Overview
The OR4Q3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily Q member 3, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the olfactory transduction pathway by detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction that leads to the perception of smell. As part of the extensive olfactory receptor family, OR4Q3 contributes to the diversity and specificity of olfactory detection, being expressed in the olfactory epithelium where it binds specific odorants (Yin2020Functional; Michaelovsky2019Risk). The receptor's activity is integral to sensory perception pathways, underscoring its importance in the biological processes underlying the sense of smell (Yin2020Functional; Michaelovsky2019Risk).

## Function
OR4Q3 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in olfactory transduction, a process that detects odor molecules and initiates a signal transduction pathway leading to the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional; Michaelovsky2019Risk). OR4Q3, like other olfactory receptors, is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (Michaelovsky2019Risk).

The olfactory transduction pathway involves the activation of GPCR signaling, which is crucial for sensory perception pathways (Michaelovsky2019Risk). Although specific details about the role of OR4Q3 in cell biology are not extensively detailed, it is categorized as part of the olfactory receptor family involved in these pathways (Yin2020Functional). The receptor's activity is essential for the detection of odorants and the initiation of olfactory signaling, which are fundamental processes in the sensory perception of smell (Yin2020Functional; Michaelovsky2019Risk).
