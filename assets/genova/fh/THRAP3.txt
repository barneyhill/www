# THRAP3

## Overview
THRAP3, or thyroid hormone receptor associated protein 3, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the nucleus. The protein encoded by THRAP3 is primarily associated with RNA processing and the DNA damage response (DDR), where it plays a critical role in mRNA splicing, export, and stability, thereby contributing to genomic stability and effective DNA repair mechanisms (Vohhodina2017The). As a component of a BRCA1-interacting RNA splicing complex, THRAP3 is involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing and transcript stability, and it interacts with R-loop structures to prevent their accumulation, which is linked to DNA damage and replication stress (Kang2021Thrap3). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as DDX5 and XRN2, further underscore its role in maintaining genomic integrity (Kang2021Thrap3). Additionally, THRAP3 is implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and mutations can influence disease prognosis and treatment responses, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2024Pancancer).

## Structure


## Function
THRAP3 (thyroid hormone receptor associated protein 3) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily within the nucleus. It plays a significant role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by participating in the selective splicing and nuclear export of mRNA transcripts that encode key DDR proteins, such as ATM kinase, BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCL, and RAD51. This function is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and effective DNA repair mechanisms (Vohhodina2017The).

THRAP3 is part of a BRCA1-interacting RNA splicing complex that forms in response to DNA damage, promoting pre-mRNA splicing and transcript stability. It is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage and localizes to nuclear speckles with other splicing factors, suggesting its involvement in RNA processing and regulation (Vohhodina2017The). The protein also interacts with R-loop structures, preventing their accumulation, which is associated with DNA damage and replication stress (Kang2021Thrap3).

In addition to its role in DDR, THRAP3 is involved in the maturation and export of ATM mRNA, with its depletion leading to nuclear retention of these transcripts, indicating its role in promoting mRNA export (Vohhodina2017The). This function is essential for proper cell cycle regulation and cellular responses to DNA damage (Vohhodina2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the THRAP3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In oral squamous cell carcinomas, the THRAP3 gene is often deleted, and it is a site for hepatitis B virus DNA integration in some human liver cancers, suggesting a role in oncogenesis (Beli2012Proteomic). Mutations in THRAP3, such as C301>T (R101*) and C2509>T (R837*), result in truncated proteins that impair DNA repair and mRNA export, potentially acting as cancer driver mutations (Vohhodina2017The). These mutations are associated with defects in DNA double-strand break repair, contributing to genomic instability and cancer development (Vohhodina2017The).

THRAP3 expression levels also vary across different cancer types, influencing prognosis and treatment response. High THRAP3 expression is linked to poor prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma but is associated with prolonged survival in kidney chromophobe, brain lower-grade glioma, and skin cutaneous melanoma (Wang2024Pancancer). In some cancers, THRAP3 acts as a high-risk gene, while in others, it serves as a protective factor (Wang2024Pancancer). These findings highlight THRAP3's potential as a prognostic biomarker and its involvement in cancer-related pathways, including MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and Hippo pathways (Wang2024Pancancer).

## Interactions
THRAP3, or thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 3, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play crucial roles in various cellular processes. It interacts with DDX5, an RNA helicase, in a methylation-dependent manner, which is essential for recruiting XRN2 to R-loops, structures that can lead to genomic instability if not resolved (Kang2021Thrap3). THRAP3 also binds with XRN2, facilitating its role in R-loop resolution (Kang2021Thrap3).

In the context of the DNA damage response, THRAP3 is part of a complex with proteins such as SNIP1, PNN, BCLAF1, and SKIIP, which regulates Cyclin D1 RNA stability (Beli2012Proteomic). It is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, primarily mediated by ATR, and is excluded from DNA damage sites, a process linked to transcriptional inhibition (Beli2012Proteomic).

THRAP3 also interacts with HELZ2β, a coregulator of PPARγ, enhancing PPARγ-mediated transcriptional activation crucial for adipocyte differentiation. This interaction involves THRAP3 binding to helicase motifs in HELZ2β, and it is necessary for the expression of key adipogenic markers (KatanoToki2013THRAP3). These interactions highlight THRAP3's multifaceted role in gene transcription, RNA processing, and cellular differentiation.
