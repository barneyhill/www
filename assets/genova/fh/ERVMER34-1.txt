# ERVMER34-1

## Overview
ERVMER34-1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as endogenous retrovirus group MER34 member 1, envelope. This protein is categorized as an envelope protein, which is typically involved in the processes of viral entry and fusion with host cells. As an endogenous retrovirus, ERVMER34-1 is a remnant of ancient viral infections that have integrated into the human genome. While it is generally inactive under normal physiological conditions, alterations in its expression have been observed in various pathological states, particularly in cancer. The protein encoded by ERVMER34-1 has been implicated in immune system modulation and may contribute to tumor immune evasion and radioresistance, making it a subject of interest for potential therapeutic interventions (FelleyBosco2023Exploring; Stricker2023HERVs).

## Clinical Significance
ERVMER34-1, an endogenous retrovirus, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In mesothelioma, ERVMER34-1 is upregulated compared to normal mesothelial cells, with its env gene preferentially translated in cancer cells. This expression is associated with immune system repression, suggesting a role in immune evasion by tumors (FelleyBosco2023Exploring). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ERVMER34-1 expression is induced by γ-radiation, indicating its potential involvement in radioresistance. This suggests that targeting ERVMER34-1 could help overcome resistance to radiation therapy (Stricker2023HERVs).

Despite these findings, the clinical significance of ERVMER34-1 in terms of specific diseases or conditions due to mutations, expression level changes, or interaction alterations is not fully established. While its expression is noted in certain cancer cell lines, such as the CAL-33 HNSCC cell line, the direct impact on survival or disease progression remains unclear (Agoni2022Alternative). Overall, ERVMER34-1's altered expression in cancer highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target, though further research is needed to clarify its clinical implications.
