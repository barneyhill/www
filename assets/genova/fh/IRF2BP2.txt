# IRF2BP2

## Overview
IRF2BP2 is a gene that encodes the protein interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2, which functions primarily as a transcriptional co-repressor. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a Cys4 zinc finger domain and a C3HC4 RING finger domain, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, respectively (Manjur2019IRF2BP2; Teng2010IRF2BP2). IRF2BP2 is involved in various cellular processes, such as modulating the cellular stress response, immune regulation, and transcriptional repression of lipolysis-related genes (Koeppel2008The; Palmroth2021IRF2BP2; Chen2024Transcriptional). The protein's interactions with other transcription factors and its role in regulating apoptosis and cardiac hypertrophy highlight its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Fang2017Control; Pastor2021The). Clinically, alterations in the IRF2BP2 gene are associated with various diseases, including cancer, inflammatory conditions, and cardiovascular diseases, underscoring its importance in human health (Zhang2015IRF2BP2:; Pastor2021The).

## Structure
The IRF2BP2 protein is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its function as a transcriptional regulator. It contains a conserved N-terminal Cys4 zinc finger domain and a C-terminal C3HC4 RING finger domain. The zinc finger domain is involved in DNA binding and dimerization, while the RING finger domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly in transcriptional repressor complexes (Manjur2019IRF2BP2; Teng2010IRF2BP2). 

IRF2BP2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in three isoforms: IRF2BP2A (587 amino acids), IRF2BP2B (571 amino acids), and IRF2BP2C (163 amino acids). Isoforms A and B share high identity and include both the zinc finger and RING domains, whereas isoform C lacks the zinc finger domain (Teng2011Identification; Pastor2021The). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in the protein's function. Phosphorylation of serine 360 near the nuclear localization signal (NLS) is essential for nuclear import, affecting the protein's localization and function (Teng2011Identification). The protein's nuclear localization is regulated by a phosphorylation-dependent NLS, with specific sequences identified as crucial for nuclear import (Teng2011Identification). 

IRF2BP2 interacts with various proteins, including VGLL4, and is involved in multiple cellular processes, such as muscle differentiation and response to ischemia (Teng2010IRF2BP2).

## Function
IRF2BP2 is a transcriptional co-repressor involved in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in modulating the cellular stress response, particularly in the context of p53-mediated pathways. IRF2BP2 is upregulated in response to genotoxic stress in cells with functional p53, where it helps maintain a growth arrest state, allowing for DNA repair and cell survival. This function is crucial for balancing the decision between growth arrest and apoptosis, contributing to cell survival under stress conditions (Koeppel2008The).

In adipocytes, IRF2BP2 acts as a transcriptional repressor of lipolysis-related genes, including LIPE, which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis. Its expression is inversely correlated with lipolysis, and its deletion leads to increased lipolysis and inflammation, affecting systemic glucose homeostasis (Chen2024Transcriptional).

IRF2BP2 also plays a role in immune regulation by acting as a co-repressor of interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2), modulating interferon signaling pathways. It helps maintain a balance in cytokine signaling by repressing the activation of interferon-stimulated genes, thus preventing excessive immune responses (Palmroth2021IRF2BP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IRF2BP2 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In cancer, IRF2BP2 is implicated through mutations, gene fusions, and changes in expression levels. It is involved in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) through a rare fusion with RARA, affecting clinical features and treatment response. In lung adenocarcinoma and thyroid carcinoma, IRF2BP2-NTRK1 fusions act as potent oncogenic drivers. It is also a candidate driver gene in triple-negative breast cancer, where copy number gains promote cell proliferation. In primary central nervous system lymphoma, somatic mutations in IRF2BP2 are found in 14% of cases, and chromosomal gains involving IRF2BP2 are linked to poor prognosis in multiple myeloma (Pastor2021The).

IRF2BP2 mutations are also associated with inflammatory conditions. A specific deletion variant, c.625_665del, leads to increased activation of STAT1 and STAT5 pathways, contributing to inflammatory conditions and lymphopenia. This mutation results in a truncated protein that cannot bind to IRF2, leading to hyperactivation of the IFN-JAK-STAT1 axis (Palmroth2021IRF2BP2).

In cardiovascular diseases, IRF2BP2 deficiency is linked to exacerbated atherosclerosis, with increased inflammatory responses in macrophages. A deletion variant in the 3′-UTR of IRF2BP2 is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (Zhang2015IRF2BP2:).

## Interactions
IRF2BP2 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in transcriptional regulation. It forms complexes with IRF-2, acting as a co-repressor by interacting with the C-terminal repression domain of IRF-2, which may prevent the recruitment or activity of histone acetylases like GCN5, PCAF, and p300 to promoters (Childs2003Identification). IRF2BP2 also interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and NF-κB, enhancing their transcriptional activities through its zinc finger and RING finger domains (Manjur2019IRF2BP2). 

In the context of cardiac hypertrophy, IRF2BP2 binds directly to NFAT1, a transcription factor, through its N-terminal zinc finger domain, acting as a corepressor to inhibit NFAT1-mediated transcription (Fang2017Control). It also competes with MEF2C for binding to NFAT1, disrupting their transcriptional synergism (Fang2017Control). 

IRF2BP2 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis by interacting with NRIF3 and forming a complex with IRF2BP1 and EAP1, which binds to DNA near the transcription region of the FASTKD2 gene, repressing proapoptotic gene transactivation (Pastor2021The). It also acts as a coactivator of VEGFA expression by forming a transcriptional complex with TEAD4/VGLL4 proteins (Pastor2021The).
