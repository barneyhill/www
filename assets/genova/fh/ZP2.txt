# ZP2

## Overview
ZP2 is a gene that encodes the zona pellucida glycoprotein 2, a crucial component of the zona pellucida (ZP), which is an extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte. This glycoprotein plays a significant role in oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryonic development. As a structural protein, ZP2 is involved in forming the ZP matrix and acts as a sperm receptor, facilitating sperm binding and penetration during fertilization (Avella2014A; Dai2019ZP2). The protein's structure includes a ZP domain with conserved cysteine residues that contribute to its stability and function (Gupta2012Mammalian). Post-fertilization, ZP2 undergoes cleavage to prevent polyspermy, ensuring that only one sperm fertilizes the egg (Avella2014A). Mutations in the ZP2 gene can lead to defects in ZP formation, resulting in infertility (Wassarman2021Zona).

## Structure
ZP2 is a glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of the zona pellucida surrounding the oocyte. The protein is composed of 745 amino acids and features a ZP domain, which is approximately 260-270 amino acids long and contains eight conserved cysteine residues that form four intramolecular disulfide bonds, contributing to its structural integrity (Gupta2012Mammalian; Litscher2020Zona). The ZP domain is bipartite, consisting of an N-terminal subdomain (ZP-N) and a C-terminal subdomain (ZP-C), separated by a protease-sensitive linker region (Litscher2020Zona).

ZP2 contains three additional ZP-N subdomains (N1-N3) at its N terminus, with specific cysteine linkages that are essential for the polymerization of the zona pellucida matrix (Litscher2020Zona). The ZP-N subdomain adopts an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold, which is crucial for the polymerization of ZP fibrils (Litscher2020Zona).

Post-translational modifications, such as N-linked and O-linked glycosylation, are prevalent in ZP2, accounting for a significant portion of its mass and influencing its function and stability (JimenezMovilla2011ZP2; Litscher2020Zona). These modifications are crucial for the protein's proper incorporation into the zona pellucida and its role in gamete recognition (JimenezMovilla2011ZP2).

## Function
The ZP2 gene encodes a glycoprotein that is a critical component of the zona pellucida (ZP), an extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte. In healthy human cells, ZP2 plays a vital role in the structural integrity and function of the ZP, which is essential for oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryonic development (Dai2019ZP2). ZP2, along with ZP3, serves as a building block of ZP filaments and acts as a sperm receptor during fertilization, facilitating sperm binding and penetration through the ZP (Avella2014A; Dai2019ZP2). The N-terminal domain of ZP2 is particularly important for species-specific gamete recognition, ensuring that sperm from the same species can bind effectively (Avella2014A).

ZP2 is also involved in preventing polyspermy, a process where multiple sperm fertilize an egg, by undergoing cleavage post-fertilization, which blocks additional sperm from penetrating the ZP (Avella2014A). The presence of ZP2 is required for the proper formation of the ZP, and mutations in ZP2 can lead to defects in ZP formation, resulting in female infertility (Wassarman2021Zona).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZP2 gene are associated with several infertility-related conditions due to their impact on the zona pellucida (ZP), a glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte. Pathogenic variants in ZP2 can lead to a structurally abnormal and dysfunctional ZP, resulting in fertilization failure and female infertility. These mutations often result in a thin ZP that is defective for sperm binding, which is crucial for successful fertilization (Dai2019ZP2). 

Specific mutations, such as homozygous splicing and frameshift variants, have been identified in consanguineous families and are linked to in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure. These variants lead to truncated ZP2 proteins that are not incorporated into the ZP, disrupting its formation and function (Dai2019ZP2). 

ZP2 mutations are also associated with conditions like genuine empty follicle syndrome (GEFS) and oocyte degeneration, where the ZP is either thin or absent, impairing sperm recognition and binding (Zhou2022Can; Yang2021The). Despite these challenges, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can sometimes overcome the fertilization issues caused by ZP2 mutations, leading to successful pregnancies (Dai2019ZP2).

## Interactions
ZP2 interacts with other zona pellucida proteins, particularly ZP3, to form a complex essential for the structural integrity and function of the zona pellucida. In the extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte, ZP2 and ZP3 form a structural repeat known as a ZP2-ZP3 dimer, which is fundamental to the assembly of the zona pellucida matrix (Wassarman2021Zona). These interactions are crucial for the polymerization process that forms the zona pellucida fibrils, which are necessary for sperm binding and fertilization (Litscher2020Zona).

The cytoplasmic tails of ZP2 and ZP3 play a critical role in preventing premature interactions within the cell, ensuring that these proteins traffic independently to the plasma membrane before interacting and being incorporated into the zona pellucida (JimenezMovilla2011ZP2). Once at the plasma membrane, a protease recognizes the cytoplasmic tails, releasing the ectodomains of ZP2 and ZP3, which then oligomerize to form the insoluble zona pellucida (JimenezMovilla2011ZP2).

ZP2 also undergoes postfertilization cleavage by the protease ovastacin, which inactivates its role as a sperm receptor, preventing polyspermy by altering the zona pellucida's structure and function (Avella2014A; Litscher2020Zona).
