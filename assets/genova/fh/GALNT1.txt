# GALNT1

## Overview
The GALNT1 gene encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is pivotal in the initiation of O-linked glycosylation, a post-translational modification process that involves the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine and threonine residues on proteins. This modification occurs primarily in the Golgi apparatus and is essential for the biosynthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides, influencing protein solubility, stability, and function (Saei2022Mapping). GALNT1's activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and extracellular matrix composition, and it plays a significant role in modulating cellular pathways such as the TCA cycle and DNA transcription (Saei2022Mapping). The enzyme's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal health.

## Function
The GALNT1 gene encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1, which plays a crucial role in the process of O-linked glycosylation. This enzyme initiates the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to the hydroxyl groups of serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) residues on proteins, a modification that occurs in the Golgi apparatus. This process is essential for the biosynthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides, impacting protein solubility, stability, and function (Saei2022Mapping).

GALNT1 is involved in modifying proteins across various cellular compartments, including the plasma membrane, cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomes, and the extracellular matrix. These modifications influence processes such as cell adhesion, secretion of basement membrane components, and extracellular matrix composition (Saei2022Mapping). The enzyme shows a preference for glycosylating Thr residues over Ser residues, often in the presence of proline residues near the glycosylation site (Saei2022Mapping).

The activity of GALNT1 is significant in regulating cellular processes and pathways, including those related to the TCA cycle and DNA transcription, highlighting its broad impact on cellular function and organismal health (Saei2022Mapping).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GALNT1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GALNT1 is often upregulated, which enhances cell migration and invasion by increasing O-glycan addition to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), affecting its phosphorylation and signaling. Downregulation of GALNT1 in HCC reduces malignant behavior by decreasing EGFR O-glycosylation (Hussain2016Nacetylgalactosaminyltransferases).

In breast cancer, particularly among adolescents and young adults (AYA), high GALNT1 expression is associated with worse overall survival and disease-specific survival. It is linked to larger tumors, lymph node metastasis, and decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration, indicating a suppressed immune response. GALNT1 serves as an independent prognostic biomarker for breast cancer in AYA patients (Oshi2023GALNT1).

In bladder cancer, GALNT1 is highly expressed in cancer stem cells, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. It is involved in the activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining the self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity of bladder cancer stem cells. Silencing GALNT1 significantly suppresses tumor growth and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2016GALNT1Mediated).

## Interactions
GALNT1, or polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role in O-glycosylation. The Protein Interaction Stability Assay (PISA) has identified numerous proteins that interact with GALNT1, revealing both strong and transient interactions. In HCT116 and MOLT4 cell lines, significant solubility changes were observed in proteins upon GALNT1 treatment, indicating interactions. Notably, proteins such as P4HA1, EGLN1, OGFOD2, and EIF4EBP2 were shared between these cell lines, suggesting common interaction partners (Saei2022Mapping).

GALNT1 is also implicated in the modification of proteins within various cellular complexes and pathways, including the cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosome, actin, histone, RNA polymerase II, spliceosome, TCA cycle, tubulin and NuRD complex, basement membrane, extracellular matrix, and cell adhesion (Saei2022Mapping). These interactions highlight GALNT1's role in regulating cellular processes by modifying proteins in different complexes.

The enzyme's activity is linked to the modulation of cell signaling pathways, such as integrin and FGF signaling, by influencing the secretion of basement membrane components like laminin and collagen IV. This modulation affects downstream pathways, including AKT and MAPK phosphorylation, which are crucial for cell proliferation and organogenesis (Tian2012Oglycosylation).
