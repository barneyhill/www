# HMGCL

## Overview
The HMGCL gene encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, which is a key player in the metabolic pathways of ketogenesis and leucine catabolism. This enzyme is classified as a lyase, a type of enzyme that catalyzes the breaking of various chemical bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation. The primary function of the HMGCL-encoded enzyme is to catalyze the cleavage of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA into acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA, which are crucial intermediates in the production of ketone bodies. These ketone bodies serve as alternative energy sources, especially during periods of low glucose availability, such as fasting or low-carbohydrate intake (Arnedo2019More; Luo2017Inactivation). The gene is predominantly expressed in the liver, with additional expression in the pancreas and kidney, but not in the brain's mitochondrial fraction (Arnedo2019More). Mutations in the HMGCL gene can lead to metabolic disorders, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria, and have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Alfadhel2022HMGCoA; Cui2022HMGCLinduced).

## Structure
The HMGCL protein, encoded by the HMGCL gene, plays a crucial role in ketogenesis and leucine catabolism. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure of HMGCL includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the stability and folding of the protein. The tertiary structure of HMGCL forms a functional enzyme with a catalytic site essential for its enzymatic activity. This structure is crucial for the enzyme's ability to cleave HMG-CoA into acetoacetic acid and acetyl-CoA, a key step in ketogenesis (Essa2016Recurrent).

HMGCL typically functions as a homodimer, representing its quaternary structure, which is important for its stability and function. The enzyme's active site includes critical residues such as Arg41, which is involved in stabilizing the enolized form of the acetyl-CoA product and forming a salt bridge with the C-carboxyl group of hydroxyglutaric acid (Essa2016Recurrent). Splice variants of the HMGCL gene, such as HMGCLD5,6 and HMGCLD5,6,7, result in structural deletions that may affect the protein's activity by altering important regions, including metal-binding ligands (Puisac2011Characterization). These variants are present at the mRNA level but are not detected as proteins, suggesting a regulatory mechanism (Puisac2011Characterization).

## Function
The HMGCL gene encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, which plays a crucial role in ketogenesis and leucine catabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA into acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA, essential for producing ketone bodies that serve as alternative energy sources, particularly during periods of low glucose availability (Arnedo2019More; Luo2017Inactivation). Ketone bodies, such as β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, are primarily synthesized in the liver's mitochondria and are vital for energy production in extrahepatic tissues, especially during fasting or low-carbohydrate intake (Arnedo2019More).

HMGCL is expressed predominantly in the liver but is also present in other tissues like the pancreas and kidney, although its activity is not detected in the brain's mitochondrial fraction (Arnedo2019More). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal metabolic processes, and its deficiency can lead to metabolic disorders such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria, characterized by the failure of ketone body production and the accumulation of toxic metabolites (Arnedo2019More). The regulation of HMGCL and its isoforms through alternative splicing may influence ketone body production and leucine catabolism in a tissue-specific manner (Puisac2011Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HMGCL gene lead to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase deficiency (HMGCLD), a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This condition impairs ketogenesis and leucine catabolism, resulting in symptoms such as hypoketotic hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and lethargy, which can progress to seizures, coma, and potentially death if untreated. The disorder often manifests in the neonatal period or early infancy, particularly during fasting or high glucose consumption, when ketone bodies are needed as an alternative energy source (Puisac2011HMG–CoA; Alfadhel2022HMGCoA).

Alterations in HMGCL expression are also implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HMGCL is significantly downregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. Overexpression of HMGCL in HCC cells has been shown to inhibit proliferation and metastasis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This effect is partly mediated through the regulation of ferroptosis, a form of cell death, by influencing the expression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) (Cui2022HMGCLinduced).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), HMGCL downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation and metastasis. Restoring HMGCL expression in NPC cells suppresses these processes by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Luo2017Inactivation).

## Interactions
HMGCL (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase) is involved in several interactions that influence its function in metabolic pathways. It plays a role in the synthesis of ketone bodies by converting HMG-CoA into acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA, a process crucial for energy production. HMGCL is known to interact with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), a protein that enhances ferroptosis susceptibility in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This interaction is facilitated by HMGCL-induced acetylation at histone H3K9, which promotes DPP4 transcription. DPP4, in turn, forms a complex with NOX1, regulating NOX activities and contributing to the ferroptosis process (Cui2022HMGCLinduced).

HMGCL's role in ketogenesis involves its interaction with HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS2), the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. Although specific protein interactions are not detailed, the regulation of ketone body synthesis is influenced by the expression and activity of HMGCS2, suggesting a coordinated interaction between these enzymes (Arnedo2019More). Additionally, HMGCL is part of a family of enzymes that share structural similarities, such as the TIM-barrel structure, which may facilitate interactions with other proteins involved in metabolic reactions (Arnedo2019More).
