# KDF1

## Overview
KDF1, or keratinocyte differentiation factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, playing a significant role in maintaining skin homeostasis. The KDF1 protein is characterized by a proline- and cysteine-rich region and contains a domain of unknown function, DUF4656, which is highly conserved across species. This protein is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and is enriched at cell borders within the basal and spinous layers of the epidermis. Functionally, KDF1 is involved in several key interactions, including with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7 and IKKα, which are essential for epidermal differentiation and structure. Additionally, KDF1 influences the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, impacting epithelial tissue formation and tooth development. Mutations in the KDF1 gene are linked to clinical conditions such as non-syndromic tooth agenesis and ectodermal dysplasia type 12, highlighting its importance in both dental and epidermal development (Lee2013Forward; Yu2022KDF1; Li2020Regulation).

## Structure
The KDF1 protein, encoded by the KDF1 gene, plays a crucial role in epidermal development and keratinocyte differentiation. The primary structure of KDF1 includes a sequence of amino acids that features a proline- and cysteine-rich region near the N-terminus (Lee2013Forward; Li2020Regulation). The protein contains a domain of unknown function, DUF4656, which is a hotspot for germline variations and is highly conserved across species (Yu2022KDF1).

The secondary structure of KDF1 is affected by specific mutations, such as the R307P variant, which alters the configuration from a helix-coil-strand to a coil-strand-coil between the 297th and 305th amino acids (Yu2022KDF1). The tertiary structure of the wild-type KDF1 protein was predicted using the AlphaFold algorithm, with an average model confidence score of 0.59, indicating moderate confidence in the predicted 3D structure (Yu2022KDF1).

KDF1 is known to interact with other proteins, such as IKKa, through its central domain, which is crucial for mediating these interactions (Li2020Regulation). The protein is expressed in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and is enriched at cell borders, particularly in the basal and spinous layers of the epidermis (Lee2013Forward).

## Function
KDF1 (keratinocyte differentiation factor 1) is a critical regulator of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, essential for maintaining skin homeostasis. In healthy human cells, KDF1 functions to balance cell division and differentiation, which is vital for tissue integrity and preventing hyperproliferative conditions like cancer (Zheng2021KDF1). KDF1 is expressed in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and plays a role in inhibiting the proliferation of epidermal progenitor cells while promoting their differentiation into mature epidermal cells (Lee2013Forward).

KDF1 interacts with several key proteins to regulate these processes. It associates with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7 to stabilize IKKα, a protein crucial for epidermal differentiation. This interaction prevents the degradation of IKKα, thereby maintaining proper skin differentiation and structure (Li2020Regulation). KDF1 also negatively regulates the protein p63, which is involved in keratinocyte proliferation, thus ensuring a controlled balance between cell growth and differentiation (Lee2013Forward).

The gene's role extends to influencing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is important for epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and tooth development, indicating its broader impact on epithelial tissue formation (Yu2022KDF1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KDF1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting dental and epidermal development. KDF1 has been identified as a novel candidate gene for non-syndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA), a condition characterized by the congenital absence of teeth. Specific mutations, such as c.G908C (p.R303P) and c.920G>C (p.R307P), have been linked to this condition. These mutations are predicted to be pathogenic and have been shown to co-segregate with the disease phenotype in affected families (Zeng2019KDF1; Yu2022KDF1). The R307P variant, in particular, is associated with unique dental anomalies, including shovel-shaped incisors and cornicione-shaped premolars and molars (Yu2022KDF1).

KDF1 mutations are also implicated in ectodermal dysplasia type 12 (ECTD12), a syndromic form of tooth agenesis that includes symptoms such as decreased sweating and changes in hair and nails (Zeng2019KDF1). In addition to dental defects, KDF1 plays a crucial role in epidermal development. Mutations can lead to severe epidermal defects, such as those observed in the shorthand (shd) mouse model, which exhibits a thickened epidermis and defective barrier formation (Lee2013Forward). These findings underscore the importance of KDF1 in both dental and skin development.

## Interactions
KDF1 (keratinocyte differentiation factor 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. In epidermal differentiation, KDF1 interacts with IKKα (IκB kinase α), a component of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for maintaining normal epidermal structure and differentiation, as KDF1 regulates the ubiquitination level of IKKα, impacting keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal stratification (Li2020Regulation). KDF1 also associates with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7, which regulates IKKα ubiquitination and stability, further influencing epidermal differentiation (Li2020Regulation).

In the context of cancer, KDF1 has been shown to interact with proteins involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In epithelial ovarian cancer, KDF1 interacts with E-cadherin, a protein crucial for maintaining epithelial cell adhesion and polarity. This interaction suggests that KDF1 may regulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which is linked to cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zhu2022KDF1). In lung adenocarcinoma, KDF1 overexpression is associated with increased levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and AKT, indicating its role in activating these signaling pathways, which contribute to tumor growth and metastasis (Guo2023KDF1).
