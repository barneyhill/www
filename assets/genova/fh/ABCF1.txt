# ABCF1

## Overview
ABCF1 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily F member 1 protein, which is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Unlike typical ABC transporters, the ABCF1 protein lacks transmembrane domains and is primarily involved in translation initiation and regulation within mammalian cells (Fostier2020ABC‐F; Wang2021ATP‐binding). The protein is characterized by two tandem ATP-binding domains and a unique P-site tRNA Interaction Motif (PtIM) domain, which facilitates its interaction with ribosomes (Fostier2020ABC‐F). ABCF1 plays a significant role in immune response regulation and is implicated in various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Arora2019The; Fan2023High).

## Structure
The ABCF1 protein is part of the ABC-F family, characterized by two tandem ATP-binding domains (NBDs) that form a dimer upon ATP binding (Fostier2020ABC‐F; Wang2021ATP‐binding). These domains include the Walker A and B motifs crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and the LSGGQ/E signature sequence in the ABCα subdomain (Fostier2020ABC‐F). The protein lacks transmembrane domains, distinguishing it from typical ABC transporters (Dean2022The; Wang2021ATP‐binding).

ABCF1 contains a unique P-site tRNA Interaction Motif (PtIM) domain, which forms an α-helical hairpin interacting with tRNA in the ribosome's P site (Fostier2020ABC‐F). The Arm motif, an α-helical hairpin in the ABC1 domain, interacts with the ribosome, specifically contacting the uL1 stalk of the 50S ribosomal subunit (Fostier2020ABC‐F). This motif is not present in all ABC-F paralogs and is absent in other ABC superfamily proteins (Fostier2020ABC‐F).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, with tyrosine-108 in the Arm motif identified as a phosphorylated residue, potentially modulating ribosomal interactions (Fostier2020ABC‐F). The protein's structure is dynamic, with flexibility in the ABC domains and motifs (Fostier2020ABC‐F).

## Function
ABCF1, also known as ABC50, is a protein that plays a crucial role in translation initiation in mammalian cells. It is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily but is unique in lacking transmembrane domains. ABCF1 interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and is involved in forming the eIF2-GTP and Met-tRNAi ternary complex, which is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis (wilcox2010function; Paytubi2009ABC50). ABCF1 binds to ribosomes in an ATP-dependent manner, associating with the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, but not with polysomes, indicating its role in translation regulation (Fostier2020ABC‐F; Tyzack2000ABC50).

The protein is active in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, but not in the nucleolus, suggesting it is not involved in early ribosomal biogenesis (Paytubi2009ABC50). ABCF1 is also implicated in translational quality control, ensuring accurate start codon recognition and potentially participating in m6A-mediated translation initiation (Fostier2020ABC‐F). Additionally, ABCF1 is involved in immune response regulation, as it is upregulated in response to cytokines like IFNγ and may play a role in inflammation and immunity (wilcox2010function).

## Clinical Significance
The ABCF1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases and conditions. Alterations in ABCF1 expression have been linked to autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune pancreatitis. In rheumatoid arthritis, ABCF1 is upregulated in TNF-α-stimulated synoviocytes, suggesting a role in the inflammatory processes associated with the disease (Wilcox2017The; Arora2019The). Genome-wide association studies have also identified ABCF1 as a risk factor for gout and Crohn's disease, highlighting its broader impact on autoimmune conditions (Arora2019The).

In the context of sepsis, ABCF1 plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses. It is essential for the transition from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to endotoxin tolerance (ET), and its deficiency can lead to excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production and increased mortality (Arora2019The). 

ABCF1 is also implicated in cancer, particularly bladder cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). High expression levels of ABCF1 in bladder cancer are associated with poor prognosis and are linked to various clinical parameters, making it a potential prognostic marker (Fan2023High). In HCC, ABCF1 contributes to chemoresistance and cancer progression, suggesting its role as a therapeutic target (Fung2019The).

## Interactions
ABCF1 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in transcriptional coactivation in embryonic stem cells, associating with transcription factors OCT4 and SOX2. The intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of ABCF1 is crucial for its function, facilitating interactions with co-dependent coactivators XPC and DKC1, as well as RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (Choi2020ATPbinding).

ABCF1 also interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), forming a stable complex that enhances the binding of Met-tRNA to eIF2, which is essential for translation initiation. This interaction is ATP-dependent and involves the 40S ribosomal subunit (Paytubi2007The; Tyzack2000ABC50). ABCF1's interaction with eIF2 is regulated by phosphorylation through CK2, although the phosphorylation sites are not necessary for binding (Paytubi2007The).

In the immune response, ABCF1 interacts with proteins in the SET complex, including HMGB2, and is involved in TLR4 signaling, aiding in the production of IFN-β. It also plays a role in FcγR IIA-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages, interacting with Src family kinases and targeting spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) for ubiquitination (Arora2023Phagocytosis; Fostier2020ABC‐F).
