# ATP6V1D

## Overview
ATP6V1D is a gene that encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit D, a component of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This protein is integral to the V1 domain of V-ATPase, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis, a process that provides the energy necessary for proton translocation across cellular membranes. The V-ATPase complex, including ATP6V1D, plays a crucial role in acidifying intracellular compartments, a function essential for various cellular processes such as protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and maintaining pH and ion homeostasis (Jefferies2008Function; Li2020Comprehensive). ATP6V1D is involved in several biological pathways, including insulin receptor signaling and macroautophagy regulation, and is active in organelles like lysosomes and endosomes (Li2020Comprehensive). Dysregulation or mutations in ATP6V1D can lead to significant clinical implications, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and osteopetrosis, underscoring its importance in cellular and systemic homeostasis (Da2010Proteomic).

## Structure
The ATP6V1D gene encodes a subunit of the V1 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), specifically subunit D, which is part of the central rotor mechanism. This subunit is crucial for the rotary mechanism that couples ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation across membranes (Arata2002Structure; Jefferies2008Function). Subunit D is highly helical and extends into the A3B3 hexamer of the V1 domain, similar to the γ subunit in F-ATPases, and forms a tight heterodimeric complex with subunit F, composing the rotor assembly of V1 (Jefferies2008Function). 

The quaternary structure of ATP6V1D involves its integration into the V1 domain, which is a 640-kDa complex composed of eight different subunits (A-H) (Jefferies2008Subunit). Subunit D, along with subunit F, forms part of the central stalk that bridges the V1 and V0 domains, facilitating the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation (Duan2018VATPases). Mutations in subunit D can lead to uncoupling of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis, highlighting its critical role in the rotary mechanism (Arata2002Structure). The specific details of post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for ATP6V1D are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ATP6V1D encodes a subunit of the V1 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), an enzyme complex responsible for acidifying intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. This acidification is crucial for maintaining cellular pH and ion homeostasis, which are essential for normal cellular function (Li2020Comprehensive). The V1 domain, where ATP6V1D is located, is responsible for ATP hydrolysis, providing the energy required for the transport of hydrogen ions (H+) across membranes (Li2020Comprehensive).

In healthy human cells, ATP6V1D is involved in various biological processes, including phagosome acidification, transferrin transport, and ATP hydrolysis coupled proton transport. It also plays a role in the insulin receptor signaling pathway and the regulation of macroautophagy (Li2020Comprehensive). The protein is active in organelles such as lysosomes and endosomes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and metabolism (Li2020Comprehensive).

The V-ATPase complex, including ATP6V1D, is crucial for processes like protein degradation and receptor-mediated endocytosis, which are vital for cellular function and organismal health (Da2010Proteomic). The proper functioning of ATP6V1D is essential for maintaining the acidic environment required for these cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the ATP6V1D gene can significantly impact cellular pH homeostasis, leading to various diseases. Altered acidification due to these changes is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, where the disruption of normal cellular processes can contribute to disease progression. In cancer, dysregulation of ATP6V1D may affect tumor growth and metastasis by altering the acidic environment that cancer cells often exploit for survival and proliferation. Additionally, mutations in ATP6V1D have been associated with osteopetrosis, a condition characterized by the abnormal density of bones. This occurs because the enzyme's role in acidifying intracellular compartments is crucial for bone resorption, and its impairment can lead to the excessive accumulation of bone mass. These conditions highlight the critical role of ATP6V1D in maintaining cellular and systemic homeostasis, and its dysregulation can have profound pathological consequences.

## Interactions
ATP6V1D, a subunit of the V1 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function. It interacts with other V-ATPase subunits, such as ATP6V0A1, ATP6V0B, ATP6V0D1, and ATP6V0C, forming a functional proton pump essential for acidifying intracellular compartments (Li2020Comprehensive). The central stalk, including ATP6V1D, bridges and stabilizes the interaction between the V1 and V0 domains, coupling the energy released from ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation in the V0 domain (Duan2018VATPases).

In the context of renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), ATP6V1D's mRNA expression is associated with immune infiltration levels and tumor purity, suggesting its involvement in the tumor microenvironment (Li2020Comprehensive). Although specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, ATP6V1D's role in the V-ATPase complex indicates its participation in processes like endocytosis and autophagy, which are critical for cellular homeostasis and response to environmental changes (Duan2018VATPases). These interactions highlight ATP6V1D's importance in both normal cellular function and disease contexts.
