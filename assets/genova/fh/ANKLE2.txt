# ANKLE2

## Overview
ANKLE2 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and LEM domain containing 2, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in neurodevelopment. The protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat and LEM domain, which facilitate its role as a scaffolding protein involved in maintaining the integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. ANKLE2 is crucial for the asymmetric cell division of neuroblasts, a process essential for proper brain development, and is involved in the regulation of cell polarity and spindle alignment during mitosis (Link2019Ankle2). The protein's interaction with VRK1, a kinase associated with microcephaly, underscores its significance in brain size regulation and neuroblast maintenance (Link2019Ankle2). Additionally, ANKLE2's interaction with the Zika virus NS4A protein highlights its clinical relevance, as this interaction can mimic microcephaly phenotypes by inhibiting ANKLE2 function (Fishburn2022Zika; Link2019Ankle2).

## Function
The ANKLE2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the asymmetric cell division of neuroblasts, which is essential for proper brain development. In human cells, ANKLE2 is involved in maintaining the integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the nuclear envelope. It localizes to these structures, particularly during mitosis, where it is recruited to the nuclear envelope and remains there until shortly after cytokinesis (Link2019Ankle2). ANKLE2 is necessary for the proper nuclear localization of VRK1, a kinase associated with microcephaly when mutated. In fibroblasts from microcephaly patients with ANKLE2 mutations, VRK1 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm, suggesting that ANKLE2 restricts VRK1 to the nucleus, preventing ectopic activity that could lead to abnormal phosphorylation of proteins (Link2019Ankle2).

ANKLE2 also interacts with proteins such as L(2)gl and aPKC, affecting the establishment of cell polarity and spindle alignment during cell division. This interaction is vital for the correct distribution of cell fate determinants (Link2019Ankle2). The protein is part of a pathway that includes VRK1 and is necessary for brain size regulation and neuroblast maintenance (Link2019Ankle2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANKLE2 gene are associated with congenital microcephaly, a condition characterized by a significantly reduced brain size at birth, leading to cognitive and neurological deficits, as well as intellectual and developmental disabilities (Link2019Ankle2; Shaheen2019Genomic). ANKLE2 mutations result in defects in neuroblast division, reduced cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis, contributing to the microcephaly phenotype (Link2019Ankle2; Yamamoto2014A). The gene is also implicated in a novel microcephaly pathway involving its interaction with the kinase VRK1, which is crucial for asymmetric cell division of neuroblasts (Link2019Ankle2).

ANKLE2 is a target of the Zika virus protein NS4A, which can inhibit its function and lead to microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental issues (Link2019Ankle2; Link2020Using). Variants in ANKLE2, such as p.Q782*, p.A109P, and p.G201W, fail to rescue the small brain phenotype in Drosophila models, indicating their role as loss-of-function alleles (Link2019Ankle2). In the context of cancer, ANKLE2 overexpression has been observed in breast cancer samples, correlating with poor patient survival, while its depletion in triple-negative breast cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation (Rose2024The).

## Interactions
ANKLE2 is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the kinase Ballchen/VRK1, playing a significant role in the asymmetric localization of neuroblast determinants and proper spindle alignment during neuroblast division (Link2019Ankle2). ANKLE2 also interacts with L(2)gl and affects aPKC, which are part of the apical complex involved in establishing cell polarity and spindle positioning during cell division (Link2019Ankle2). The phosphorylation of aPKC is decreased in Ankle2 mutants, but can be restored with the addition of Ankle2-GFPR or reduction of the Ball protein (Link2019Ankle2).

ANKLE2 is known to interact with the Zika virus NS4A protein, which can mimic the phenotypes seen in Ankle2 mutants, such as microcephaly, by inhibiting ANKLE2 function (Link2019Ankle2; Shah2018Comparative). This interaction is significant as it highlights a pathway that can be hijacked by viral proteins to induce neurological defects (Link2019Ankle2). The interaction between NS4A and ANKLE2 is mediated through ANKLE2's ANK and LEM domains, which facilitate protein scaffolding and interaction with the nuclear membrane (Fishburn2022Zika).
