# VIPR1

## Overview
The VIPR1 gene encodes the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1, a member of the class B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) family. This receptor is integral to various physiological processes, including immune modulation, smooth muscle relaxation, and vasodilation. VIPR1 is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices and an extracellular domain that facilitates the binding of its primary ligand, the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Upon ligand binding, VIPR1 activates intracellular signaling pathways, notably increasing cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which subsequently activate protein kinase A (PKA) (Delgado2004The; Laburthe2007Class). The receptor is expressed in multiple tissues, including immune cells and the central nervous system, where it plays a role in neurotransmission and cognitive functions (Delgado2004The). VIPR1's involvement in immune response regulation and its potential implications in diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma underscore its significance as a therapeutic target and a biomarker for disease prognosis (Lin2022lncRNAAC079061.1VIPR1; Lu2019Promoter).

## Structure
The vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1 (VIPR1) is a member of the class B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), characterized by a seven transmembrane helices bundle and an extracellular domain (Latek2019A). The primary structure of VIPR1 includes specific amino acids crucial for its function, such as proline residues in transmembrane helices 4, 5, and 6, which are important for receptor activation (Latek2019A). The secondary structure features a central alpha helix in the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) that interacts with the receptor (Laburthe2007Class).

The tertiary structure of VIPR1 involves a complex folding pattern that includes the extracellular domain (ECD) and transmembrane domain (TMD). The ECD is crucial for ligand binding, with key residues like Tyr118 playing a significant role in receptor antagonism (Latek2019A). The receptor's quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

VIPR1 contains domains such as the N-terminal ectodomain, which is essential for peptide agonist binding and includes a short consensus repeat or Sushi domain involved in ligand recognition (Laburthe2007Class). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, may affect the receptor's activity and stability, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. Splice variants of VIPR1 may exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functions.

## Function
The VIPR1 gene encodes the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, VIPR1 is primarily involved in immune modulation, smooth muscle relaxation, and vasodilation. It binds vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase and an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, which subsequently activates protein kinase A (PKA) (Delgado2004The; Ganea2002VasoactiveIntestinalPeptide(VIP)andPituitaryAdenylateCyclaseactivatingPolypeptide(PACAP)asModulators page 1 of 5).

VIPR1 is constitutively expressed in various immune cells, including T cells and monocytes, where it modulates immune responses by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-6, and IL-12, while promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 (Delgado2004The; Lara-Marquez2001Selective). This receptor is also involved in the regulation of T cell activation and proliferation, with its expression being down-regulated upon T cell activation, which may affect T cell responsiveness to VIP (Lara-Marquez2001Selective).

In the central nervous system, VIPR1 is abundant in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where it is involved in neurotransmission and potentially impacts cognitive functions (Delgado2004The). The receptor's activity in these regions underscores its role in modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as its involvement in maintaining homeostasis in various physiological systems.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VIPR1 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have shown that VIPR1 expression is consistently lower in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role. This downregulation is associated with poor histological differentiation and adverse patient outcomes, including reduced overall survival (Lin2022lncRNAAC079061.1VIPR1; Lu2019Promoter). The low expression of VIPR1 in HCC is partly attributed to epigenetic modifications, such as promoter methylation and histone deacetylation, which inhibit its transcription (Lu2019Promoter).

The lncRNA-AC079061.1/VIPR1 axis has also been identified as a significant factor in HCC progression. The axis is involved in regulating immune cell infiltration and is associated with the suppression of HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Alterations in this axis, including the upregulation of hsa-miR-765, contribute to the downregulation of VIPR1, further impacting HCC prognosis (Lin2022lncRNAAC079061.1VIPR1). These findings highlight the potential of VIPR1 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in HCC.

## Interactions
VIPR1, the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1, is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). These interactions occur at the receptor's extracellular domain, which serves as the principal binding site for these natural ligands (Latek2019A). VIPR1 is involved in various signaling pathways, including those mediated by G proteins and arrestin, which are facilitated through specific residue networks in the intracellular part of the transmembrane bundle (Latek2019A).

The receptor's interaction with VIP and PACAP is characterized by comparable affinity for both VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors, although PACAP is significantly more potent at the PAC1 receptor (Liao2021Molecular). The binding of VIP to VPAC1 involves electrostatic interactions between basic residues in VIP and acidic residues in the receptor, as well as hydrophobic interactions (Nicole2000Identification).

VIPR1 also interacts with small-molecule antagonists, which can form stable binding modes with the receptor's extracellular domain, potentially blocking the binding of VIP. These interactions involve stacking interactions and the role of polar and hydrophobic residues in the binding cavity (Latek2019A).
