# SLC9C1

## Overview
The SLC9C1 gene encodes the solute carrier family 9 member C1 protein, a sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger that plays a pivotal role in regulating intracellular pH and sodium levels, crucial for sperm motility and fertility. This protein is a member of the SLC9 family and is distinguished by its unique structural features, including a transport domain (TD), a voltage-sensing domain (VSD), and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD), which are not present in other SLC9 family members (Kalienkova2023Structures; Windler2018The). The SLC9C1 protein is primarily expressed in the testis and localized along the sperm flagellum, where it is involved in essential processes such as sperm capacitation and hyperactivated motility (Yeo2023Structure; Cavarocchi2021The). Its activity is modulated by membrane voltage and cyclic AMP, integrating signals that are vital for the pH-sAC-cAMP signaling pathway, which is necessary for successful fertilization (Yeo2023Structure; Pal2023Architecture). Mutations in the SLC9C1 gene have been linked to infertility due to impaired sperm motility, underscoring its significance in reproductive health (Pal2023Architecture).

## Structure
The SLC9C1 protein, also known as a sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger, is characterized by a unique tripartite domain composition, including a transport domain (TD), a voltage-sensing domain (VSD), and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) (Kalienkova2023Structures). The TD consists of 13 transmembrane helices, while the VSD comprises helices S1-S4, with the S4 helix being notably elongated and containing positively charged residues in a canonical (R/K-XX)n pattern (Kalienkova2023Structures; Yeo2023Structure). The CNBD is similar to that in hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels but includes an additional downstream helix and a β-roll domain (Yeo2023Structure).

The protein's tertiary structure reveals a dimeric organization, with the VSD positioned upstream of the pore domain, indirectly influencing the TD through allosteric effects (Kalienkova2023Structures). The quaternary structure is stabilized by interactions between the TD, VSD, and CNBD, facilitated by coupling helices that form a cytoplasmic dimer interface (Kalienkova2023Structures). The presence of phosphatidic acid lipids at the dimerization interface further stabilizes the homodimer structure in nanodiscs (Yeo2023Structure). The SLC9C1 protein is activated by membrane voltage and modulated by cyclic AMP, which disrupts the cytosolic dimer interface, facilitating the movement of the S4 helix in the VSD (Kalienkova2023Structures).

## Function
The SLC9C1 gene encodes a sperm-specific sodium/hydrogen exchanger that plays a critical role in sperm physiology by regulating intracellular pH and sodium levels, which are essential for sperm motility and fertility (Yeo2023Structure; Cavarocchi2021The). This protein is part of the SLC9 family and is characterized by a unique structure that includes a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD), which are not found in other members of the SLC9 family (Windler2018The). These domains allow SLC9C1 to integrate signals from membrane voltage and cyclic nucleotides, modulating its ion-exchange activity (Pal2023Architecture).

SLC9C1 is primarily expressed in the testis and is localized along the sperm flagellum, where it is involved in processes such as sperm capacitation and hyperactivated motility, both of which are necessary for successful fertilization (Yeo2023Structure; Cavarocchi2021The). The protein's activity is crucial for the pH-sAC-cAMP signaling pathway, which is required for sperm motility and fertilization (Yeo2023Structure). Mutations in SLC9C1 have been linked to reduced sperm motility and infertility, highlighting its importance in reproductive health (Pal2023Architecture).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC9C1 gene are associated with primary infertility due to severe asthenozoospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility. A specific homozygous variant, c.2748+2T>C, impairs a splice donor site, leading to defects in sperm motility. This mutation is linked to alterations in sperm structure, such as excess residual cytoplasm and disorganized midpieces, contributing to infertility (Cavarocchi2021The). The SLC9C1 gene is crucial for sperm motility regulation, as it affects the interaction with soluble Adenylate Cyclase (sAC), which is important for the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway (Cavarocchi2021The).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, variants in the SLC9C1 gene have been identified as modifiers of the age of onset in individuals with familial Alzheimer's disease caused by the PSEN1 E280A mutation. These variants can delay the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms by approximately 11 years, suggesting a potential neuroprotective role (Vélez2019Familial).

In cancer research, SLC9C1 is noted for having a high mutation incidence across various cancers, although these mutations are generally considered to have low functional impact, suggesting they are likely passenger mutations (White2023What).

## Interactions
The SLC9C1 protein, a sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger, is involved in several interactions crucial for its function in sperm motility and fertility. It forms a signaling complex with soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), which is essential for the regulation of intracellular pH and cAMP levels. This complex is critical for the stable expression of full-length sAC in spermatozoa and is involved in bicarbonate regulation, which is necessary for sAC activity and sperm motility (Wang2007A). 

SLC9C1 also interacts with cyclic AMP (cAMP), which modulates its activity by disrupting interactions between the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) and the S4 helix. This disruption allows for the movement of intracellular coupling helices, enabling ion exchange and facilitating the protein's activation (Yeo2023Structure). The interaction with cAMP is crucial for shifting the activation voltage of SLC9C1, maintaining alkaline intracellular pH, and priming CatSper channels for Ca2+ entry, which is vital for sperm navigation (Windler2018The). 

These interactions highlight the role of SLC9C1 in the pH-sAC-cAMP signaling pathway, which is essential for sperm motility and fertilization (Yeo2023Structure).
