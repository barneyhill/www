# RDM1

## Overview
The RDM1 gene encodes the RAD52 motif containing 1 protein, which is integral to cellular processes involving DNA repair and genomic stability. This protein is characterized by the presence of an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and an RD motif, which facilitate its roles in RNA processing and DNA double-strand break repair, respectively (Chen2019Loss). RDM1 is involved in the regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, enhancing its stability and influencing cell cycle control and apoptosis (Chen2019Loss). Additionally, RDM1 interacts with the Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway, underscoring its importance in cell growth and survival (Chen2019Loss). The gene's expression is modulated by methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), which affects its mRNA through N6-methyladenosine modification, linking RDM1 to RNA modification and epigenetic regulation (Chen2019Loss). RDM1's involvement in various cancers, including breast, lung, ovarian, and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlights its dual role as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, depending on the cellular context (Chen2019RDM1; Tong2018RDM1; Tong2020RDM1).

## Function
The RDM1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability through its involvement in DNA repair processes. The RDM1 protein contains two specific motifs: an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and an RD motif. The RRM is involved in RNA processing, while the RD motif is associated with DNA double-strand break repair and protein translation (Chen2019Loss). This suggests that RDM1 is active in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cell, contributing to various cellular functions.

In healthy human cells, RDM1 is implicated in the regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. It enhances the stability of p53, a critical protein in controlling cell cycle and apoptosis, by prolonging its half-life and suppressing its degradation (Chen2019Loss). RDM1 also interacts with the Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway, which is involved in cell growth and survival, indicating its role in regulating these processes to maintain cellular homeostasis (Chen2019Loss).

RDM1 expression is regulated by methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), which induces N6-methyladenosine modification of RDM1 mRNA, affecting its expression levels and highlighting its involvement in RNA modification and epigenetic regulation (Chen2019Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RDM1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, RDM1 is significantly overexpressed, promoting tumorigenesis by enhancing cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Knockdown of RDM1 in breast cancer cell lines results in decreased tumor growth and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Chen2019RDM1).

In lung adenocarcinoma, RDM1 is also overexpressed and associated with poor clinical outcomes. It negatively regulates the tumor suppressor p53 and interacts with DNA repair proteins RAD51 and RAD52, contributing to cancer progression by modulating the P53-RAD52-RAD51 signaling pathway (Tong2018RDM1).

RDM1 is upregulated in ovarian carcinoma, where it promotes tumor growth by inhibiting apoptosis and enhancing cell proliferation. Its overexpression is linked to resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tong2020RDM1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, RDM1 functions as a tumor suppressor. Its low expression is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced cancer progression through the Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway, particularly in the presence of wild-type p53 (Chen2019Loss).

## Interactions
RDM1 (RAD52 motif containing 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in DNA repair and cancer progression. In the context of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in plants, RDM1 interacts with key components such as RNA polymerase II, ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4), and the de novo DNA methyltransferase DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2 (DRM2). It is part of the DDR complex, which includes the chromatin remodeler DRD1 and the structural-maintenance-of-chromosomes protein DMS3, facilitating the synthesis of Pol V scaffold transcripts (Sasaki2014The).

In human cancer cells, RDM1 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing its stability and modulating its downstream targets. This interaction is significant in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, where RDM1 suppresses the phosphorylation of Raf and ERK in the presence of p53, affecting the Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway (Chen2019Loss). RDM1 also interacts with RAD51 and RAD52, proteins involved in DNA repair, and regulates the P53-RAD52-RAD51 pathway in lung adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting a role in DNA damage response and chemotherapeutic resistance (Chen2019RDM1; Tong2018RDM1).
