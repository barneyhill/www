The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PcG proteins. It has been shown to interact with, and suppress the activity of, transcription factor CP2 (TFCP2/CP2). Studies of the mouse counterpart suggested the involvement of this gene in the specification of anterior-posterior axis, as well as in cell proliferation in early development. This protein was also found to interact with huntingtin interacting protein 2 (HIP2), an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and possess ubiquitin ligase activity.
