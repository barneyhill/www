# CFAP210

## Overview
CFAP210 is a gene that encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 210, which is integral to the structural organization of microtubule doublets within cilia and flagella. The protein is characterized by its ability to form long helices with a specific 48 nm periodicity, contributing to the stability and mechanical integrity of the axonemal structure. This structural role is crucial for the proper motility of sperm cells, as it ensures the correct organization and function of the axoneme, the core component of cilia and flagella. CFAP210 interacts with other proteins, such as CFAP45 and CFAP52, to maintain the structural integrity of the B-tubule, highlighting its importance in cellular motility mechanisms (Tai2023Incell).

## Interactions
CFAP210 is involved in structural interactions within the sperm microtubule doublet, particularly in the B-tubule. It forms long helices with a 48 nm periodicity that attach to protofilaments B07-B09. CFAP210 interacts with CFAP45, which also exhibits a 48 nm periodicity and forms filaments on protofilaments B08 and B09. The N-terminal helix of CFAP210 has an elbow bend to accommodate the steric hindrance of CFAP52, while the rest of CFAP210 lies between protofilaments B06 and B07. These interactions suggest that CFAP210 plays a role in the stability and organization of the B-tubule structure by engaging in structural interactions with CFAP45 and CFAP52 (Tai2023Incell). 

The interactions of CFAP210 with other proteins are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the microtubule doublets, which are essential for the proper function of cilia and flagella. These interactions likely contribute to the mechanical stability and organization of the axonemal structure, which is vital for the motility of sperm cells. The specific arrangement and periodicity of CFAP210 and its associated proteins highlight its role in the complex architecture of the axoneme.
