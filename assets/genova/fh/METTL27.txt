# METTL27

## Overview
METTL27 is a gene that encodes the protein methyltransferase-like 27, which is part of the methyltransferase enzyme family. These enzymes are involved in the transfer of methyl groups to various substrates, a process critical for numerous biological functions, including gene expression regulation and protein function modulation. Methyltransferase-like 27 is implicated in several cellular processes, although its specific biological roles are not fully elucidated. The gene is located on chromosome 7q11.23 and has been associated with various diseases, including Williams-Beuren syndrome and certain cancers, due to its altered expression or mutations (Mariasina2022WilliamsBeuren; Campeanu2021Bioinformatic). The protein's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential significance in both normal physiology and disease pathogenesis.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
METTL27, also known as WBSCR27, is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or mutations. It is located in the chromosome region 7q11.23, and its heterozygous deletion is associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a neurodevelopmental and multisystemic disorder characterized by symptoms such as aortic stenosis, hypercalcemia, and mental deficiency (Mariasina2022WilliamsBeuren; Campeanu2021Bioinformatic). The gene's deletion in WBS suggests its significant role in the development of this syndrome (Mariasina2022WilliamsBeuren).

In cancer, METTL27 is overexpressed in several tumor types, including esophageal carcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, and may serve as a prognostic marker in colon cancer (Mariasina2022WilliamsBeuren). Its overexpression has been noted in at least three of 15 TCGA tumor types, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis (Campeanu2021Bioinformatic; Campeanu2021Multiomics).

Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs28673430 affects the expression of METTL27, with the G allele increasing its expression in control groups but decreasing it in disease groups, suggesting a potential role in epilepsy (Guelfi2019Transcriptomic). Despite these associations, the precise biological function of METTL27 remains largely unknown.
