# H2BC13

## Overview
H2BC13 is a gene that encodes the H2B clustered histone 13 protein, a member of the histone H2B family, which plays a crucial role in the structural organization of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Histones are essential for the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, thereby regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. The H2B clustered histone 13 protein is involved in the formation of nucleosome structures, which are fundamental for DNA compaction and accessibility. Alterations in the expression of H2BC13 have been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may influence tumor progression and therapeutic resistance (Jafari2022Screening; Ragusa2023Contribution; Espiritu2021Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The H2BC13 gene, encoding a histone protein, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In pancreatic cancer, H2BC13 is notably downregulated in gemcitabine-resistant cell lines, suggesting its potential role in therapeutic resistance. This downregulation may contribute to the cancer cells' ability to resist treatment, impacting prognosis and therapy response (Espiritu2021Molecular). Additionally, bioinformatics analyses have identified H2BC13 as one of the differentially expressed genes in pancreatic cancer, with a significant log2 fold change, indicating its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Jafari2022Screening).

In the context of genomic instability, H2BC13 is downregulated in giant cell tumor of bone stromal cells, which is associated with chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. This suggests that alterations in H2BC13 expression may play a role in genomic instability in certain cancers (Ragusa2023Contribution). The dynamic regulation of H2BC13 and its involvement in cancer progression highlight its clinical significance, particularly in understanding resistance mechanisms and developing targeted therapies.
