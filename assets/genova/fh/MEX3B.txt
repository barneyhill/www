# MEX3B

## Overview
MEX3B is a gene that encodes the protein mex-3 RNA binding family member B, which is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes. As a member of the RNA Binding Ubiquitin Ligases (RBUL) class, MEX3B is characterized by its two K homology (KH) domains that facilitate RNA binding and a RING finger domain that confers E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Yang2024Molecular). The protein plays a critical role in post-transcriptional regulation, influencing neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation by interacting with key molecules such as REST and HOTAIR (Garg2024The). MEX3B is also implicated in immune response modulation and cancer progression, particularly in non-small-cell lung cancer and melanoma, where it affects tumor cell recognition and resistance to immunotherapy (Huang2018The; Zhang2022Investigation). Its involvement in mRNA turnover and processing, as well as its regulatory role under stress conditions, underscores its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease (BuchetPoyau2007Identification; Umehara2020Body).

## Structure
The MEX3B protein is a member of the MEX-3 RNA-binding protein family and is characterized by its distinct structural domains. It contains two tandemly repeated K homology (KH) domains at the N-terminus, which are crucial for RNA binding. These domains are involved in recognizing specific RNA sequences, such as those found in HLA-A mRNA, and are essential for the protein's function in RNA processing and regulation (Yang2024Molecular). The KH domains include specific motifs, such as the GXXG and TRTR motifs, which are critical for RNA recognition and binding (Yang2024Molecular).

At the C-terminus, MEX3B features a RING finger domain, which is associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This domain plays a role in the degradation of target mRNAs, such as HLA-A, by recruiting the CCR4-NOT complex (Yang2024Molecular). The RING domain is also implicated in protein stability and localization (BuchetPoyau2007Identification).

MEX3B is a phosphoprotein, indicating that it undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may affect its interactions and functions (BuchetPoyau2007Identification). The protein also contains a nuclear export signal (NES) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), suggesting a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport (BuchetPoyau2007Identification).

## Function
MEX3B is a member of the RNA Binding Ubiquitin Ligases (RBUL) class of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which are involved in the proteasomal degradation cascade and have non-canonical functions in neuronal development (Garg2024The). In healthy human cells, MEX3B plays a crucial role in maintaining the proliferative state of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by promoting the transcription and post-transcriptional modification of pro-proliferative genes (Garg2024The). It interacts with the transcription activator REST and the long non-coding RNA HOTAIR, forming a complex that supports the proliferative state of NPCs (Garg2024The).

MEX3B influences the transcriptional expression of proliferative markers such as Ki67, Nestin, and REST, and its knockdown leads to a reduction in these markers, suggesting its role in promoting proliferation and preventing differentiation (Garg2024The). The protein is involved in the translation of neural proliferation and differentiation markers, negatively regulating neural differentiation by inhibiting processes like neurite outgrowth and dendritic complexity (Garg2024The). MEX3B's interaction with REST mRNA and HOTAIR suggests a complex regulatory network where it may stabilize REST mRNA, thereby influencing neural progenitor fate (Garg2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MEX3B gene have been implicated in various cancers and their progression. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MEX3B is overexpressed, particularly in large cell lung cancer (LCLC), and is associated with a worse prognosis for patients. This overexpression correlates with lower overall survival in NSCLC and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients, suggesting significant clinical implications in the prognosis and progression of these cancers (Zhang2022Investigation).

In melanoma, MEX3B plays a role in mediating resistance to cancer immunotherapy. Higher expression levels of MEX3B are linked to a poor response to anti-PD-1 therapy. This resistance is partly due to MEX3B's ability to downregulate HLA-A expression, which is crucial for antigen presentation and T-cell recognition. By binding to the 3' UTR of HLA-A mRNA, MEX3B destabilizes it, reducing its expression and impairing immune system recognition of tumor cells. This mechanism highlights MEX3B as a potential target for overcoming immunotherapy resistance in melanoma (Huang2018The).

In the context of hypothermic stress, MEX3B expression is regulated by rno-miR-374-5p, impacting apoptosis in skeletal muscle cells. This regulation suggests a role for MEX3B in cell viability during extreme conditions (Umehara2020Body).

## Interactions
MEX3B is an RNA-binding protein that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in post-transcriptional regulation. It interacts with Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in endosomes, facilitating the recruitment of the adaptor protein TRIF upon stimulation with poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This interaction is crucial for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including NF-κB and IRF3, and is dependent on the RNA-binding activity of MEX3B (Yang2016The).

MEX3B also interacts with the long non-coding RNA HOTAIR, which enhances the interaction between MEX3B and the protein Runx3, leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of Runx3. This process is facilitated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of MEX3B (Xue2018HOTAIR).

In addition, MEX3B is involved in RNA metabolism and transcription regulation. It associates with proteins such as DHX36 and TNRC6A, and interacts with subunits of RNA polymerases I, II, and III, as well as the transcriptional repressor ZGPAT. These interactions suggest a role in transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation pathways (Hildebrandt2017Interaction).

MEX3B is also found in processing bodies (P bodies), where it colocalizes with the human mRNA decapping enzyme hDcp1a, indicating its involvement in mRNA turnover and processing (BuchetPoyau2007Identification).
