# ZNF587B

## Overview
ZNF587B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 587B, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes. The zinc finger protein 587B, encoded by ZNF587B, is implicated in the regulation of gene expression, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have highlighted its potential clinical significance, particularly in the context of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), where alterations in its expression have been associated with disease prognosis and potential as a biomarker (Li2024Screening).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF587B has been identified as a potential biomarker for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), a subtype of ovarian cancer. Alterations in the expression levels of ZNF587B have been associated with this disease. Specifically, ZNF587B shows decreased expression in HGSC tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues, as confirmed by various methods including western blot, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry (Li2024Screening). This reduced expression is linked to poor prognosis in HGSC, with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicating a correlation between low ZNF587B levels and shorter overall survival times (Li2024Screening).

The study by Hu Li suggests that ZNF587B could serve as a diagnostic marker for liquid biopsy in exosomes, offering a non-invasive method for early detection of ovarian cancer (Li2024Screening). Despite its potential as a prognostic marker, no direct correlation has been found between ZNF587B expression and tumor grade (Li2024Screening). The research emphasizes the need for further studies to validate the clinical utility of ZNF587B in improving patient outcomes, highlighting its role in early detection and prognosis of HGSC (Li2024Screening).
