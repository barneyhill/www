# CXXC5

## Overview
CXXC5 is a gene located on chromosome 5q31.2 that encodes the CXXC finger protein 5, a zinc finger protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by a CXXC domain, which allows it to bind unmethylated CpG dinucleotides and interact with other proteins, functioning as a molecular scaffold. CXXC5 plays a critical role in regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, and is involved in the regulation of the interferon response in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Additionally, CXXC5 is implicated in myelopoiesis and has been associated with various cancers, including breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, where its expression levels can influence prognosis (Ayaz2021A; Kim2015CXXC5; Ma2017Epigenetic; Kühnl2015Downregulation).

## Structure
The CXXC5 protein is characterized by a zinc finger CXXC domain, which includes two conserved cysteine-rich motifs (CXXCXXC) that bind to two Zn++ ions, forming zinc-finger structures. This domain allows CXXC5 to recognize and bind to unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression (Ayaz2021A; Ayaz2020CXXC5). The CXXC domain is noted for its bi-functionality, capable of DNA and protein interactions (Ayaz2021A).

CXXC5 lacks intrinsic transcription regulatory function or enzymatic activity but acts as a scaffold by interacting with other proteins to establish chromatin states (Ayaz2021A). It interacts with various proteins, including MeCP2, through its carboxyl-terminal CXXC domain, independent of its DNA-binding ability (Ayaz2021A). The central region of CXXC5 (amino acids 101-150) may contribute to the stability or affinity of protein interactions (Ayaz2021A).

The protein is encoded on chromosome 5q31.2 and consists of 322 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 33 kDa (Ayaz2021A). Despite its known interactions and functional roles, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CXXC5 are not provided in the available literature. Information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms is also lacking (Ayaz2021A; Ayaz2020CXXC5).

## Function
CXXC5, also known as CXXC finger protein 5, is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It acts as a negative-feedback regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. CXXC5 interacts with Dishevelled (Dvl) to suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling, thereby regulating the expression of osteogenic genes and maintaining bone homeostasis (Kim2015CXXC5).

In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), CXXC5 is involved in the regulation of the interferon (IFN) response. It functions as an epigenetic 'reader' for unmethylated CpG islands, recruiting DNA demethylase TET2 to maintain hypomethylation of these regions, which is essential for the expression of IRF7, a transcription factor critical for IFN production (Ma2017Epigenetic).

CXXC5 is also implicated in myelopoiesis, where it is necessary for the differentiation of promyelocytic leukemia cells and cytokine-driven myelopoiesis of normal CD34+ progenitor cells. Its expression is regulated by cytokines during normal myelopoiesis, highlighting its role in the development of granulocytic lineage (Pendino2009Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXXC5 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In breast cancer, high CXXC5 expression is associated with poor prognosis, especially in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subtypes. It is linked to poor overall survival and is considered an unfavorable prognostic factor, suggesting its role in cancer progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Ayaz2020CXXC5; Knappskog2011RINF; Fang2018Overexpression).

In AML, CXXC5 expression levels have prognostic significance. High expression is associated with adverse outcomes, while downregulation of CXXC5 predicts better prognosis. This downregulation is often due to epigenetic silencing through promoter methylation, particularly in cases with IDH1/2 mutations. Lower CXXC5 expression correlates with better overall and event-free survival, suggesting a tumor suppressor role in AML (Kühnl2015Downregulation).

CXXC5 is also involved in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation. Its dysregulation can lead to altered signaling pathways, contributing to the pathogenesis of these malignancies (Kühnl2015Downregulation).

## Interactions
CXXC5 (CXXC finger protein 5) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It physically interacts with MeCP2, a member of the methyl-CpG binding protein family, through its carboxyl-terminal CXXC domain. This interaction is independent of CXXC5's DNA-binding ability and involves the carboxyl-terminus of MeCP2. These proteins are associated with promoter regions of genes such as HDAC11, IL12A, and NFKBIZ, affecting gene expression regulation (Ayaz2021A).

CXXC5 also interacts with the Dishevelled (Dvl) protein family, particularly Dvl2, in neural stem cells. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiments, indicating a close spatial proximity of less than 14 nm. CXXC5 and Dvl co-localize in the cytoplasm, suggesting a role in modulating Wnt signaling pathways (Andersson2009CXXC5).

In plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CXXC5 interacts with the DNA demethylase Tet2, recruiting it to regulate DNA methylation at CpG islands of genes like Irf7. This interaction is crucial for maintaining active chromatin structure and regulating gene expression (Ma2017Epigenetic). These interactions highlight CXXC5's role as a molecular scaffold in various signaling and regulatory pathways.
