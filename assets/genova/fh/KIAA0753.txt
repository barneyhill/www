# KIAA0753

## Overview
KIAA0753 is a gene that encodes a protein known as OFIP, which plays a pivotal role in ciliogenesis and centrosome function. The protein is characterized by a largely disordered structure with a conserved C-terminal region that is crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as FOR20 and OFD1, which are essential for the assembly of the cilium transition zone and basal body anchoring (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753). KIAA0753 is evolutionarily conserved across ciliated species, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular processes. The protein's ability to stabilize microtubules and its involvement in forming a ternary complex with OFD1 and FOPNL (FOR20) are critical for maintaining the structural integrity of the centriole distal end and membrane anchoring, impacting various signaling pathways during development (Bruel2017Fifteen; Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753). Mutations in KIAA0753 are associated with a spectrum of ciliopathies, including skeletal and neurological disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Hammarsjö2017Novel).

## Structure
The KIAA0753 gene encodes a protein known as OFIP, which is involved in ciliogenesis and centrosome function. The protein is evolutionarily conserved in ciliated species and is characterized by a largely disordered, non-globular structure with a conserved C-terminus predicted to form an alpha-helix (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753). This C-terminal region is crucial for interactions with other proteins, such as FOR20 and OFD1, which are essential for the assembly of the cilium transition zone and basal body anchoring (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753).

The molecular structure of KIAA0753 includes a C-terminal tail necessary for its interaction with FOR20, although specific structural details beyond this interaction are not extensively detailed in the available literature (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753). The central region of the protein, spanning residues 300-666, plays a role in stabilizing microtubules by increasing resistance to depolymerization (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753).

KIAA0753 does not contain known protein domains, but its interactions with other proteins, such as PCM1, OFD1, and FOR20, suggest its involvement in forming a complex at pericentriolar satellites and centrosomes, which is significant for proper cellular function and ciliogenesis (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753).

## Function
The KIAA0753 gene, also known as OFIP, encodes a protein that plays a critical role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation. This protein is involved in the formation of a ternary complex with OFD1 and FOPNL (FOR20), which is essential for the recruitment of these components to the centrosome and pericentriolar satellites, crucial for basal body anchoring and cilia formation (Bruel2017Fifteen; Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753). KIAA0753 is necessary for the stability and localization of these proteins within the cell, and its interaction with FOR20 and OFD1 is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the centriole distal end and membrane anchoring (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753).

In healthy human cells, KIAA0753 is expressed in the fetal growth plate, particularly affecting the proliferative and hypertrophic zones, where it is essential for the organization of the growth plate and chondrocyte proliferation (Hammarsjö2017Novel). The protein's microtubule-stabilizing activity is important for the structural integrity of the centriole distal end, which is crucial for the proper formation and maintenance of functional cilia, impacting various signaling pathways during development (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753). Defects in KIAA0753 can lead to ciliopathies, affecting skeletal and brain development (Hammarsjö2017Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIAA0753 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in cilia structure or function. These mutations can lead to skeletal ciliopathies, characterized by conditions such as Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, which presents with thoracic hypoplasia and short tubular bones (Faudi2020A). KIAA0753 mutations are also linked to Joubert syndrome, which is marked by developmental delays and neurological abnormalities, and orofaciodigital (OFD) syndrome, which involves facial dysmorphism, polydactyly, and brain abnormalities (Hammarsjö2017Novel; Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753).

The phenotypic spectrum of KIAA0753-related conditions ranges from lethal skeletal dysplasia to milder forms of metaphyseal skeletal dysplasia with short ribs and features of OFD syndrome (Hammarsjö2017Novel). The gene's role in ciliogenesis is crucial, as mutations can disrupt the formation and stability of protein complexes necessary for ciliary function, leading to defective ciliogenesis (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753). Zebrafish models with KIAA0753 mutations exhibit skeletal abnormalities, supporting the gene's role in skeletal development (Hammarsjö2017Novel). The genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of these conditions underscores the complexity of KIAA0753-related ciliopathies (Inskeep2021Genetic).

## Interactions
KIAA0753, also known as OFIP, is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for ciliogenesis and centrosome function. It forms a trimeric complex with OFD1 and FOPNL (also known as FOR20) at pericentriolar satellites and centrosomes. This complex is crucial for basal body anchoring and cilia formation, as well as for the recruitment of OFD1 and FOPNL to the centriole and pericentriolar satellites, stabilizing microtubule organization in the centrosome (Bruel2017Fifteen; Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753).

The interaction between KIAA0753 and OFD1 is enhanced by the presence of FOR20, indicating a cooperative mechanism in forming the ternary complex. This interaction is necessary for the proper localization of these proteins at pericentriolar satellites and centrosomes, which is vital for ciliogenesis (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753). The C-terminal region of KIAA0753 is particularly important for its interaction with OFD1 and FOPNL, and mutations in this region can disrupt these interactions, leading to ciliopathies (Inskeep2021Genetic).

KIAA0753 also interacts with the ubiquitin ligase mind bomb 1 (MIB1), which can ubiquitinate KIAA0753 without degrading it, suggesting a regulatory role in cellular processes beyond its established function in ciliogenesis (Dho2019Proximity).
