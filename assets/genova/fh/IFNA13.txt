# IFNA13

## Overview
IFNA13 is a gene that encodes the protein interferon alpha 13, a member of the type I interferon family, which is known for its critical role in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. The protein interferon alpha 13 is categorized as a cytokine, which is involved in the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are essential for inhibiting viral replication and modulating immune responses (Hoffmann2015Interferons). IFNA13 is primarily expressed by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and has been subject to strong purifying selection, indicating its essential role in immunity throughout human evolution (Manry2011Evolutionary). Despite its critical function, IFNA13 exhibits lower antiviral potency compared to other interferon subtypes, suggesting a diversity in the functional roles of type I interferons (Manry2011Evolutionary).

## Structure
The IFNA13 protein is a member of the type I interferon family, which includes several subtypes known for their antiviral properties. The mature IFNA13 protein is composed of 166 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 20 kD (Wittling2021Shared). The protein shares identical sequences with IFNA1, and both are collectively referred to as IFNA1 (Wittling2021Shared).

Structurally, type I interferons, including IFNA13, are characterized by a cylindrical shape formed by five parallel alpha-helices. These helices are connected by loops, and the structure is stabilized by conserved bonding, such as disulfide bridges. The protein also contains specific binding residues for the IFNAR2 and IFNAR1 receptor subunits, which are crucial for its signaling function (Wittling2021Shared). The three-dimensional structure of IFNA13 is similar to other type I interferons, despite only about 30% sequence identity across the family (Wittling2021Shared).

The canonical signaling pathway of IFNA13 involves the formation of a ternary complex with IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, leading to the activation of Jak1 and Tyk2 kinases, and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, forming the ISGF3 transcription factor complex (Wittling2021Shared).

## Function
IFNA13 encodes interferon alpha 13, a type I interferon that plays a significant role in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. The protein produced by IFNA13 is involved in activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which leads to the transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). These genes are crucial for inhibiting viral replication and modulating the immune response (Hoffmann2015Interferons). 

In healthy human cells, IFNA13 is primarily produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are capable of producing large amounts of type I interferons, including IFN-α subtypes. This production is essential for initiating and regulating immune responses against viral infections (Hoffmann2015Interferons). 

The evolutionary significance of IFNA13 is highlighted by its strong purifying selection, indicating its essential and nonredundant role in immunity. This evolutionary pressure suggests that IFNA13 has maintained its function across human evolution, underscoring its importance in host defense mechanisms (Manry2011Evolutionary). 

Despite its critical role in immune responses, IFNA13 has been noted to have low antiviral potency compared to other IFN subtypes, which may reflect a diversity in the functional roles of type I interferons (Manry2011Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
The IFNA13 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in immune response regulation. Genetic variations in IFNA13, such as the rs653778 T allele, have been associated with an increased susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) concomitant with uveitis in a Chinese population. This suggests that IFNA13 may contribute to the pathogenesis of uveitis in AS patients by affecting the function of interferon-alpha (IFN-α), which is crucial for immune regulation and fighting infections (Liu2020IFNA1).

Additionally, IFNA13 has been linked to colorectal cancer susceptibility, indicating its potential role in cancer pathogenesis. The gene's involvement in immune response processes, particularly T cell activation, highlights its significance in the pathogenesis of uveitis and possibly other immune-related conditions (Liu2020IFNA1).

Alterations in IFNA13 expression or mutations may lead to inappropriate immune activation or impaired pathogen defense, contributing to autoimmune diseases and viral infections. However, specific mechanisms or broader clinical implications of IFNA13 mutations or expression alterations are not detailed in the available studies (Liu2020IFNA1).
