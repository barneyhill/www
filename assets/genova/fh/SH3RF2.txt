# SH3RF2

## Overview
SH3RF2 is a gene that encodes the SH3 domain containing ring finger 2 protein, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain and multiple SH3 domains, which are essential for its role in tagging proteins for proteasomal degradation, thereby regulating protein stability and function (Gong2024SH3RF2). The SH3RF2 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and drug resistance, through its interactions with other proteins such as RBPMS and c-FOS (Gong2024SH3RF2). Alterations in SH3RF2 expression have been linked to cancer progression and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in these contexts (Chatterjee2024Identification; Falcone2022Identification).

## Structure
SH3RF2, also known as SH3 domain containing ring finger 2, is a protein encoded by the SH3RF2 gene in humans. The protein is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain and multiple SH3 domains, which are crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Gong2024SH3RF2). The RING domain, located between amino acids 12 and 52, is integral to its ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the tagging of proteins for proteasomal degradation (Gong2024SH3RF2). This domain structure supports the protein's role in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways.

The SH3 domains contribute to the protein's ability to interact with other proteins, such as RBPMS, influencing various cellular processes, including apoptosis and drug resistance (Gong2024SH3RF2). SH3RF2 is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, a post-translational modification that regulates protein stability and function (Gong2024SH3RF2).

While the context does not provide specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of SH3RF2, the presence of these domains suggests a complex structure that facilitates its role in cellular signaling and protein degradation pathways. The protein's structure and function may also be influenced by splice variants, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SH3RF2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In ovarian cancer, SH3RF2 is associated with cisplatin resistance. It promotes the degradation of the RNA-binding protein RBPMS, which is involved in inhibiting cisplatin resistance. This degradation leads to increased activator protein 1 (AP-1) transactivation, contributing to chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients (Gong2024SH3RF2). Targeting SH3RF2 could potentially enhance the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy by restoring drug sensitivity (Gong2024SH3RF2).

In bladder cancer, SH3RF2 has been identified as a significant prognostic gene. Its expression is linked to cancer progression, promoting cell motility and tumor development. SH3RF2 is part of a six-gene signature used to predict patient outcomes, with higher expression levels associated with a worse prognosis (Chatterjee2024Identification).

SH3RF2 also plays a role in neurological disorders. Studies in SH3RF2 knockout mice have shown that haploinsufficiency of the gene is related to unilateral disorders of hippocampal function and autistic behaviors, including social and communication interactions, repetitive behaviors, and seizures (Falcone2022Identification).

## Interactions
SH3RF2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with the RNA-binding protein mRNA processing factor (RBPMS), promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial in the context of cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells, as the degradation of RBPMS by SH3RF2 enhances cisplatin resistance by affecting the AP-1 signaling pathway (Gong2024SH3RF2).

SH3RF2 also interacts with c-FOS, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. The degradation of RBPMS by SH3RF2 leads to increased AP-1 activity, which is associated with the expression of genes like MYC and XIAP that contribute to therapy resistance (Gong2024SH3RF2).

In the context of exercise-induced apoptosis in Arabian horses, SH3RF2 is linked to the degradation of the pro-apoptotic protein SH3RF1, thereby exerting an anti-apoptotic effect. This interaction is part of the regulation of the JNK signaling pathway, which is involved in apoptosis and cellular stress responses (RopkaMolik2018Molecular).
