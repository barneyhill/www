# PEX13

## Overview
PEX13 is a gene that encodes the peroxisomal membrane protein known as peroxisomal biogenesis factor 13 (Pex13p). This protein is integral to the peroxisomal membrane and plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis and function of peroxisomes, which are essential organelles involved in lipid metabolism and detoxification processes. Pex13p is characterized as a transmembrane protein with a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which facilitates critical protein-protein interactions necessary for the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. These interactions are vital for the docking of peroxisomal targeting signal receptors, such as Pex5p and Pex7p, at the peroxisomal membrane, enabling the import of proteins into the peroxisome (Erdmann1996Identification; Gould1996Pex13p). Mutations in the PEX13 gene are linked to peroxisome biogenesis disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Borgia2022Genotype–phenotype).

## Structure
The PEX13 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the peroxisomal membrane and plays a crucial role in peroxisomal biogenesis. Pex13p consists of 386 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 42,705 Daltons (Erdmann1996Identification). The protein structure includes three distinct domains: an NH2-terminal hydrophilic domain (residues 1-150), a central hydrophobic domain (residues 151-286), and a COOH-terminal region (residues 287-386) containing a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain (Erdmann1996Identification). The SH3 domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with the PTS1 receptor, facilitating the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins (Gould1996Pex13p).

The central hydrophobic domain contains a predicted membrane-spanning alpha-helix (residues 264-280), which anchors the protein in the peroxisomal membrane (Erdmann1996Identification). The SH3 domain is exposed to the cytoplasm and is involved in binding interactions with Pex5p, the PTS1 recognition factor (Erdmann1996Identification). PEX13 also features an FxxxF motif in its C-terminal region, which mediates autoinhibitory interactions with the SH3 domain, modulating its activity (Gaussmann2022Intramolecular).

PEX13 can form homooligomers, a process essential for its function in peroxisomal protein import. This oligomerization is mediated by the N-terminal domain and is disrupted by mutations such as W313G in the SH3 domain (Krause2013Functional). The protein's structure and function are conserved across species, with similarities found in organisms like Caenorhabditis elegans and humans (Erdmann1996Identification).

## Function
PEX13 encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein, Pex13p, which plays a crucial role in peroxisome biogenesis and function. In healthy human cells, Pex13p is integral to the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, which contain peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1 and PTS2). It acts as a docking factor for the PTS1 receptor, Pex5p, facilitating its association with the peroxisome membrane and enabling the import of matrix proteins into the peroxisome lumen (Maxwell2003Pex13; Gould1996Pex13p). The SH3 domain of Pex13p is essential for its interaction with Pex5p, although it is not involved in targeting Pex13p to the peroxisome membrane (Gould1996Pex13p).

PEX13 is also involved in selective autophagy processes, such as mitophagy and virophagy, which are distinct from general autophagy. This function is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial health and cellular homeostasis, as defects in PEX13-mediated autophagy can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and are implicated in diseases like Zellweger Spectrum Syndrome (Lee2016Peroxisomal). PEX13's dual role in peroxisome biogenesis and selective autophagy underscores its importance in cellular metabolism and detoxification processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX13 gene are associated with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), including Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSD), which encompass Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum's disease. These conditions are characterized by defective peroxisomal protein import, leading to metabolic dysfunction and tissue pathology (Maxwell2003Pex13). The I326T mutation in PEX13, found in a patient with NALD, results in a partial defect in peroxisomal matrix protein import, correlating with a milder clinical phenotype compared to more severe forms like Zellweger syndrome (Liu1999PEX13).

PEX13 mutations can disrupt interactions with other peroxisomal proteins, such as PEX14 and PEX5, affecting the formation of protein complexes essential for peroxisome function. For instance, the p.Gly324Arg mutation leads to misfolding and impaired complex formation, while the p.Arg294Trp mutation affects dimerization, impacting the PEX13:PEX14:PEX5 assembly (Borgia2022Genotype–phenotype). These mutations result in altered peroxisome morphology and function, contributing to the clinical manifestations of ZSDs. PEX13 deficiency also affects brain development, leading to cerebellar defects and motor behavior deficiencies, as observed in mouse models of Zellweger syndrome (Müller2011PEX13).

## Interactions
PEX13 is a peroxisomal membrane protein that plays a crucial role in peroxisomal protein import by interacting with several other proteins. It contains an SH3 domain that facilitates interactions with the PTS1 receptor, Pex5p. This interaction is essential for the docking of Pex5p at the peroxisomal membrane, which is necessary for the import of PTS1-containing proteins into peroxisomes (Erdmann1996Identification; Elgersma1996The). The SH3 domain of PEX13 is not required for its localization but is crucial for binding Pex5p, which lacks a typical PxxP SH3-binding motif but contains a proline-rich sequence that may be involved in binding (Elgersma1996The).

PEX13 also interacts with the PTS2 receptor, Pex7p, and can suppress defects in Pex7p function. This interaction occurs independently of Pex5p and Pex14p, suggesting a direct association between PEX13 and Pex7p (Girzalsky1999Involvement). PEX13 is involved in the localization of Pex14p to the peroxisomal membrane, although the SH3 domain is not the sole binding site for Pex14p (Girzalsky1999Involvement). These interactions highlight PEX13's role in forming docking sites for peroxisomal import receptors and its involvement in both PTS1 and PTS2-dependent protein import pathways.
