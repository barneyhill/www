# CSPG5

## Overview
CSPG5, or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 5, is a gene that encodes the protein known as Neuroglycan C, a transmembrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. This protein is characterized by an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain and plays a crucial role in neural development and synaptic function. Neuroglycan C is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses, particularly around glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals, and contributes to processes such as neurite outgrowth, dendritic branching, and spine morphogenesis (Aono2006Expression; Pintér2020Chondroitin). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as pleiotrophin and the ErbB family of receptors, underscore its importance in neural guidance and synaptogenesis (Hayes2021Neural). CSPG5 has also been implicated in neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, highlighting its potential role in psychiatric conditions (So2009Identification).

## Structure
The CSPG5 gene encodes the protein known as Neuroglycan C, a transmembrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. This protein is characterized by an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain and is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system, including the human brain, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus and neocortex (Aono2006Expression). CSPG5 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with at least four identified variants: NGC-I, NGC-II, NGC-III, and NGC-IV. NGC-III features a peptide insertion in the cytoplasmic domain, while NGC-IV is noted for having the shortest cytoplasmic domain (Aono2006Expression).

The primary structure of CSPG5 includes a core protein with glycosaminoglycan attachment sites, and it undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. The protein is initially synthesized as a precursor and then processed into a truncated transmembrane form with an exposed EGF domain and a secreted form (Jüttner2013Impaired). CSPG5 interacts with other proteins, such as tenascin-C and tenascin-R, through its acidic stretch, and its cytoplasmic segment associates with PDZ proteins, specifically interacting with TC10 and phosphatase 2A (Jüttner2013Impaired).

## Function
CSPG5, also known as neuroglycan C, is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that plays a significant role in neural development and synaptic function. It is primarily expressed in the brain, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of synapses, particularly around glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals (Pintér2020Chondroitin). CSPG5 is involved in promoting neurite outgrowth, dendritic branching, and spine morphogenesis, which are crucial for synaptic function and neuronal circuit formation (Pintér2020Chondroitin). 

In the postnatal rat cortex, CSPG5 forms perisynaptic matrix assemblies, which are structures that surround synapses and are involved in synaptic stabilization and plasticity (Pintér2020Chondroitin). These assemblies are located outside but adjacent to perineuronal nets, indicating a role in modulating synaptic interactions (Pintér2020Chondroitin). CSPG5 interacts with pleiotrophin to promote neurite outgrowth, an activity mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C (Hayes2021Neural). 

CSPG5 is also implicated in the maturation of synapses, particularly affecting GABAergic synapses and the elimination of climbing fiber synapses during early development (Jüttner2013Impaired). Its expression is dynamically regulated during development, transitioning from a chondroitin sulfate-containing form to a non-chondroitin sulfate-containing form (Jüttner2013Impaired).

## Clinical Significance
CSPG5, also known as neuroglycan C, has been implicated in several neurological disorders, particularly schizophrenia. Studies have identified CSPG5 as a potential susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, with significant associations found between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene and the condition. A non-synonymous SNP in CSPG5, which results in an amino acid change, has been highlighted for its potential role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (So2009Identification). Alterations in CSPG5 expression have been linked to the effects of psychostimulant drugs like methamphetamine, which are known to induce psychotic symptoms, further suggesting its involvement in schizophrenia (So2009Identification).

CSPG5 is also involved in interactions with other genes in the neuregulin pathway, such as NRG1, ErbB3, and ErbB4, which are known to be associated with schizophrenia. These interactions may contribute to the disease's development by affecting neurodevelopmental processes and synaptic plasticity (So2009Identification). The gene's role in promoting neurite outgrowth and its expression in the brain underscore its significance in maintaining normal neural connectivity, with dysregulation potentially leading to neurological disorders (Hayes2021Neural).

## Interactions
CSPG5, also known as neuroglycan C, is involved in several interactions that influence neural development and synaptic organization. It is a brain-specific transmembrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that interacts with pleiotropin, promoting neurite outgrowth through pathways mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C (Hayes2021Neural). CSPG5 also interacts with the ErbB family of receptors, specifically inducing phosphorylation of Erb2 and Erb3, which leads to the proliferation of neocortical neurons (Hayes2021Neural). 

In the context of synaptic organization, CSPG5 forms perisynaptic matrix assemblies around both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, including VGLUT1+ and VGAT+ terminals, and is associated with synaptic proteins (Pintér2020Chondroitin). It is also involved in interactions with adhesion-regulating matrix molecules like tenascin-R and tenascin-C, which may contribute to its role in synaptic functioning and development (Pintér2020Chondroitin). These interactions highlight CSPG5's role in neural guidance and synaptogenesis, as well as its potential involvement in psychiatric conditions due to its altered expression in certain brain regions (Pintér2020Chondroitin).
