# MTMR11

## Overview
MTMR11 is a gene that encodes the protein myotubularin-related protein 11, which is part of the myotubularin family of proteins. This family is known for its role in phosphoinositide metabolism, a critical process in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking. However, MTMR11 is categorized as a catalytically inactive phosphatase due to specific missense substitutions in its phosphatase domain, rendering it unable to perform typical enzymatic functions (Amoasii2012Myotubularin). Unlike other members of the myotubularin family, MTMR11 does not form homodimers or heterodimers with other proteins in the family, which is a common characteristic among its relatives (Raess2017WANTED). Despite its lack of direct interactions, MTMR11's expression is influenced by oncogenic pathways, suggesting a potential indirect role in cancer and other diseases (Amoasii2012Myotubularin; Wang2024Recent). The precise biological functions and interactions of MTMR11 remain an active area of research, with implications for understanding its role in oncogenesis and neurological disorders.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the MTMR11 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly certain cancers and neurological disorders. The MTMR11 protein is part of the myotubularin family, which plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide metabolism, a key process in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking. Alterations in the expression levels or interactions of MTMR11 can disrupt these processes, potentially leading to pathological conditions.

In the context of cancer, aberrant MTMR11 activity may contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting cell growth and survival pathways. The precise mechanisms by which MTMR11 mutations or dysregulation lead to cancer are still under investigation, but they are believed to involve disruptions in cellular signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Neurological disorders have also been associated with MTMR11 due to its involvement in neuronal signaling and membrane dynamics. Dysregulation of MTMR11 can impair normal neuronal function, potentially leading to neurodegenerative conditions or developmental disorders. Research is ongoing to elucidate the specific pathways and interactions affected by MTMR11 alterations in these diseases, with the aim of developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
MTMR11, a member of the myotubularin family, is characterized as a catalytically inactive or "dead" phosphatase due to missense substitutions in its phosphatase domain, specifically in the CX5R(S/T) motif, which is crucial for enzymatic activity (Amoasii2012Myotubularin). Unlike other myotubularins, MTMR11 has not been shown to interact with other proteins within the family, making it an exception in terms of forming homodimers or heterodimers, which are common among other myotubularins (Raess2017WANTED). 

Despite its lack of direct interactions with other myotubularins, MTMR11's expression is influenced by oncogenic pathways, as its expression is altered following modulation of the HER2 oncogene, suggesting a potential indirect role in oncogenic processes (Amoasii2012Myotubularin; Wang2024Recent). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving MTMR11 have not been detailed in the available literature, and its precise role in cellular processes remains to be fully elucidated. The absence of documented interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids highlights a unique aspect of MTMR11 within the myotubularin family.
