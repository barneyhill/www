# OBI1

## Overview
OBI1 is a gene that encodes the protein ORC ubiquitin ligase 1, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the regulation of DNA replication initiation in human cells. ORC ubiquitin ligase 1 is characterized by its N-terminal RING domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a large C-terminal extension, which facilitate its interactions with the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) (Coulombe2019The). The protein specifically targets the ORC3 and ORC5 subunits for multi-mono-ubiquitylation, a post-translational modification crucial for the activation of replication origins during the S-phase of the cell cycle (Coulombe2019The). This ubiquitylation process is essential for the recruitment of replisome components necessary for DNA synthesis, underscoring the protein's pivotal role in cell proliferation and genome stability (Coulombe2019The).

## Structure
OBI1, also known as ORC ubiquitin ligase 1, is characterized by several distinct structural features. The protein includes an N-terminal RING domain, which is highly conserved across metazoans but absent in ecdysozoans such as arthropods and nematodes (Coulombe2019The). This RING domain is a hallmark of many ubiquitin ligases, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins. OBI1 also contains a coiled-coil domain and a large C-terminal extension that lacks any recognizable domain (Coulombe2019The). The coiled-coil domain and C-terminal region are essential for interaction with ORC1, a subunit of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), although the RING domain is not required for this interaction (Coulombe2019The).

OBI1's role in ubiquitylation involves the multi-mono-ubiquitylation of ORC3 and ORC5, which are part of the ORC complex, crucial for DNA replication origin firing (Coulombe2019The). This post-translational modification is cell cycle-regulated, peaking during the S-phase (Coulombe2019The). The protein's structure and domains are integral to its function in regulating DNA replication through ubiquitin signaling pathways (Coulombe2019The). The study does not provide specific details on the tertiary or quaternary structure of OBI1.

## Function
OBI1, also known as ORC ubiquitin ligase 1, plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation in human cells. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), specifically targeting the ORC3 and ORC5 subunits for multi-mono-ubiquitylation during the S-phase of the cell cycle. This ubiquitylation is essential for the activation of replication origins, as it facilitates the recruitment of replisome components necessary for origin firing, such as DNA polymerase α, RPA32, PSF1/GINS1, PCNA, and RFC2 (Coulombe2019The).

OBI1's activity is crucial for the proper selection and activation of DNA replication origins, contributing to efficient DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Its interaction with the ORC complex is mediated by its C-terminal region and coiled-coil domain, although its ubiquitin ligase activity is not required for ORC association (Coulombe2019The). The protein's expression remains constant throughout the cell cycle, but its chromatin association is regulated, being absent from mitotic chromosomes and present from the G1 phase, with partial release during mid S-phase (Coulombe2019The). OBI1's role in ubiquitylation is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental importance in DNA replication (Coulombe2019The).

## Interactions
OBI1, also known as ORC ubiquitin ligase 1, is involved in several critical interactions with components of the origin recognition complex (ORC), which is essential for DNA replication initiation. OBI1 interacts with multiple subunits of the ORC, including ORC1, ORC2, ORC3, ORC5, and ORCA/LRWD1, suggesting a comprehensive interaction with the entire complex (Coulombe2019The). This interaction is mediated through OBI1's C-terminal region and coiled-coil domain, and does not require its RING domain or ubiquitin ligase activity (Coulombe2019The).

OBI1 specifically catalyzes the multi-mono-ubiquitylation of ORC3 and ORC5, a modification crucial for the activation of replication origins during the S-phase of the cell cycle (Coulombe2019The). This ubiquitylation process is proposed to regulate the selection and timing of origin activation, potentially by facilitating the recruitment of firing factors with ubiquitin-binding capacity to the pre-replication complexes (Coulombe2019The). The interaction of OBI1 with the ORC complex is essential for efficient DNA replication origin activation, as evidenced by defects in DNA synthesis and replication fork progression when OBI1 is depleted (Coulombe2019The).
