# TUT4

## Overview
TUT4, or terminal uridylyl transferase 4, is a gene that encodes a multi-domain enzyme involved in RNA processing, specifically categorized as a nucleotidyltransferase. The TUT4 protein plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism by adding uridine residues to the 3' end of RNA molecules, a process known as uridylation. This modification influences RNA stability and degradation, thereby impacting gene expression and cellular responses. TUT4 is particularly significant in the regulation of microRNA (miRNA) maturation and mRNA decay, with a notable role in the biogenesis of the let-7 miRNA family. The protein's structure includes an N-terminal Lin28-interacting module and a C-terminal catalytic module, which are essential for its function in RNA processing. TUT4's interactions with proteins such as LIN28 are crucial for its regulatory activities, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer (Yamashita2019Crystal; Lim2014Uridylation; Yu2020A).

## Structure
The TUT4 protein, also known as terminal uridylyl transferase 4, is a multi-domain enzyme involved in RNA processing. It contains an N-terminal Lin28-interacting module (LIM) that includes a Cys2His2-type zinc finger (ZF) and a non-catalytic nucleotidyltransferase domain (NTD1). The ZF is crucial for binding to double-stranded RNA regions of pre-let-7, facilitating the formation of a ternary complex with Lin28 and pre-let-7, which is essential for Lin28-dependent oligo-uridylylation (Yamashita2019Crystal). 

The NTD1 domain is structurally similar to the catalytic palm of the DNA polymerase β family but is catalytically inactive due to substitutions of catalytic carboxylates with non-catalytic residues (Yamashita2019Crystal). TUT4 also contains a C-terminal catalytic module with an active nucleotidyltransferase domain (NTD2) and zinc knuckle domains (ZK), which are involved in stabilizing the oligo-uridylylated tail during the uridylylation process (Yamashita2019Crystal; Yashiro2018Function).

The protein's structure is further characterized by the presence of a C2H2 zinc finger motif and three predicted α-helices connected by loops, which are important for protein-protein interactions (Yu2020A). TUT4 may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its function and localization (Yu2020A).

## Function
TUT4, also known as terminal uridylyl transferase 4, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism in human cells. It is involved in the uridylation of RNA molecules, a process that adds uridine residues to the 3' end of RNA, influencing their stability and degradation. TUT4 is particularly important in the regulation of microRNA (miRNA) maturation and mRNA decay, impacting gene expression and cellular responses.

In the context of miRNA biogenesis, TUT4 is involved in the regulation of the let-7 miRNA family. In non-differentiated cells, TUT4, in conjunction with the LIN28a protein, promotes oligouridylation of pre-let-7 miRNA precursors, preventing their processing by DICER and leading to their degradation. In differentiated cells, where LIN28a is not expressed, TUT4 adds a single uridine to the 3' end of pre-let-7 RNAs, facilitating their maturation (Warkocki2018Terminal; Yashiro2018Function).

TUT4 also plays a significant role in mRNA decay. It marks mRNAs for degradation through uridylation, particularly targeting those with short poly(A) tails. This process is essential for mRNA turnover and is crucial for maintaining mRNA stability and regulating gene expression in healthy human cells (Lim2014Uridylation). TUT4 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it participates in various cellular processes, including miRNA biogenesis regulation and mRNA decay (Yashiro2018Function).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of TUT4 (terminal uridylyl transferase 4) have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. TUT4 is involved in the LIN28:let-7:TUTase pathway, which regulates the maturation of let-7 microRNAs. Dysregulation of this pathway is associated with several malignancies, including ovarian, colon, Wilms tumor, and liver cancers. The aberrant activation of the LIN28:let-7:TUTase pathway, in which TUT4 plays a critical role, contributes to oncogenesis by suppressing let-7 microRNAs, which are known to negatively regulate oncogenes such as MYC, KRAS, and HMGA2 (Wang2017LIN28; Yu2020A).

TUT4's role in miRNA decay and stability is also significant, as it participates in the oligouridylation and degradation of mature miRNAs, a process that can be dysregulated in cancer (Yang2020AGObound). Furthermore, TUT4, along with TUT7, restricts the retrotransposition of human LINE-1 elements, a process that, if uncontrolled, can lead to genomic instability and contribute to cancer progression (Warkocki2018Uridylation).

The development of specific inhibitors targeting TUT4, such as nanobodies, has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy to modulate its activity and restore normal let-7 levels, offering a promising approach for cancer treatment (Yu2020A).

## Interactions
TUT4, also known as terminal uridylyl transferase 4, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, particularly in the regulation of microRNA biogenesis. TUT4 interacts with the LIN28 protein to form a ternary complex with pre-let-7 miRNA, which is crucial for the oligouridylation of pre-let-7, a process that prevents its maturation by Dicer and leads to its degradation (Thornton2012Lin28-mediated; Yamashita2019Crystal). This interaction is facilitated by the N-terminal Lin28-interacting module (LIM) of TUT4, which includes a zinc finger domain essential for complex formation (Yamashita2019Crystal).

The LLI fragment of TUT4, containing a C2H2 zinc finger motif, is critical for its interaction with the LIN28:pre-let-7 complex and is also targeted by the nanobody Nb-S2A4, which inhibits the assembly of the ternary complex and the subsequent oligouridylation of pre-let-7 (Yu2020A). TUT4 also interacts with pre-let-7 independently of LIN28, facilitating monouridylation, which suggests a role in recognizing microRNA in the absence of LIN28 (Yu2020A). These interactions highlight TUT4's role in regulating let-7 microRNA expression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Yamashita2019Crystal).
