# PAK3

## Overview
PAK3 (p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 3) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which plays a pivotal role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. The protein product of PAK3 is involved in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, essential for maintaining cellular structure and function within the central nervous system. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in postmitotic neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where it contributes to processes such as neurite outgrowth, spine morphogenesis, and synapse formation. PAK3 is activated by small GTPases like RAC1 and CDC42, linking these molecules to actin cytoskeleton reorganization and nuclear signaling. The kinase's activity is crucial for synaptic efficacy and plasticity, with deficiencies leading to cognitive deficits and impaired synaptic structure (Civiero2018PAKs; Allen1998PAK3; Fuchsova2016Expression).

## Structure
PAK3 (p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 3) is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain containing a CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) motif. The kinase domain of PAK3 has been crystallized, revealing its structure in complex with ATP-γ-S, which includes a thiophosphorylated activation loop at threonine 436. This thiophosphorylation is significant as it represents the first example of a protein with a thiophosphorylated residue, indicating an active conformation through interactions with lysine 321 from the αC helix and arginines 401 and 434 of the activation loop (Sorrell2019Solution).

PAK3 is monomeric in solution, both before and after activation, contrasting with previous assumptions of dimeric forms. The protein undergoes autophosphorylation, which is part of its activation mechanism (Sorrell2019Solution). Structural analysis using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) suggests that full-length PAK3 has an elongated but compact shape, with limited flexibility, indicating a rigid connection between the kinase and regulatory segments (Sorrell2019Solution). Disease-linked mutations, such as p.A365E and p.W446S, have been identified, which disrupt the protein's fold and stability, affecting its function (Sorrell2019Solution).

## Function
PAK3 (p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 3) is a serine/threonine kinase predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a critical role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. It is involved in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, which is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function in the central nervous system (Civiero2018PAKs). PAK3 is activated by small GTPases such as RAC1 and CDC42, linking these molecules to actin cytoskeleton reorganization and nuclear signaling (Allen1998PAK3).

In healthy human cells, PAK3 is crucial for processes like neurite outgrowth, spine morphogenesis, and synapse formation, contributing to the maintenance of neuronal complexity and connectivity (Fuchsova2016Expression). It is specifically expressed in postmitotic neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, suggesting its involvement in neuronal signaling and cognitive functions (Allen1998PAK3). PAK3 phosphorylates various proteins, including the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, which regulates receptor trafficking in cortical neurons, thereby influencing synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions (Kumar2017Structure).

PAK3's activity is localized to areas with lamellipodia and membrane ruffling, indicating its role in dynamic cellular processes (Kreis2009PAK). Its function is vital for synaptic efficacy and plasticity, with deficiencies leading to cognitive deficits and impaired synaptic structure (Civiero2018PAKs).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PAK3 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). These mutations can lead to varying degrees of cognitive impairment, speech defects, and behavioral problems. Specific mutations, such as the missense mutation A365E, have been linked to mild mental retardation, while others like R419X result in more severe cognitive deficits due to the loss of kinase function (Gedeon2003X‐linked). 

PAK3 mutations have also been associated with structural brain abnormalities, such as callosal agenesis, and conditions like cerebral palsy and microcephaly (Duarte2020PAK3; Hertecant2017A). In some cases, macrocephaly has been observed, expanding the known phenotype associated with PAK3 mutations (Hertecant2017A). 

The gene's role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity is crucial, and disruptions in these processes due to PAK3 mutations can lead to psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and ADHD (Pascolini2021Clinical). Carrier females may also exhibit cognitive deficiencies, which are linked to skewed X-inactivation patterns (Peippo2007PAK3). These findings underscore the importance of PAK3 in brain development and function.

## Interactions
PAK3 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling. It preferentially binds to the Nck2 protein adaptor over Nck1, a unique feature not shared by PAK1. This interaction involves the second SH3 domain of Nck2 and the amino extremity of PAK3, and is independent of PAK3's kinase activity (Thévenot2011p21activated). Mutations in PAK3, such as P12A, can affect its interaction with Nck2 but not with Nck1, indicating distinct interaction mechanisms (Thévenot2011p21activated).

PAK3 also forms heterodimers with PAK1, which is significant for its regulatory functions. This interaction is more prevalent than PAK3 homodimerization and is maintained even in wild-type forms, suggesting phosphorylation does not disrupt it (Combeau2012The). The heterodimerization allows for trans-regulation, where PAK1 can inhibit PAK3a's activity, but not the PAK3b splice variant (Combeau2012The). These interactions are crucial for synaptic plasticity and brain development, with mutations in PAK3 affecting its interaction with PAK1, potentially leading to cognitive defects (Combeau2012The).
