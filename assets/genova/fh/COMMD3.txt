# COMMD3

## Overview
The COMMD3 gene encodes the protein COMM domain containing 3, which is a member of the COMMD protein family. This family is characterized by a conserved C-terminal COMM domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions, including oligomerization and binding with other proteins. COMMD3 is involved in various cellular processes, such as the regulation of NF-kB signaling, copper homeostasis, and sodium transport. It plays a significant role in modulating the activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and is implicated in endosomal trafficking and receptor recycling. COMMD3 is expressed in multiple human tissues, with notable expression in the thymus, and is found in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of certain cell types. Its interactions and regulatory functions are crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis, impacting immune responses and cellular stress responses (Liu2013Functional; Burstein2005COMMD; Umbreen2019COMMD3:BMI1).

## Structure
COMMD3 is a member of the COMMD protein family, characterized by the presence of a conserved C-terminal COMM domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions, including oligomerization and binding with other proteins such as Cul2 (Burstein2005COMMD; Maine2007COMMD). The COMM domain is leucine-rich, approximately 70 to 85 amino acids long, and predicted to form a β-sheet structure (Burstein2005COMMD). This domain facilitates the formation of homo- and heterodimeric complexes, allowing COMMD3 to interact with other COMMD proteins, such as COMMD1, and participate in larger multi-subunit assemblies (Burstein2005COMMD; Healy2018Structural).

The N-terminal region of COMMD3 is more variable and is rich in alpha-helices, which may confer unique functions to different COMMD family members (Maine2007COMMD). While detailed tertiary and quaternary structural information specific to COMMD3 is limited, the general architecture of COMMD proteins suggests a modular structure with an α-helical N-terminal domain and a dimeric C-terminal COMM domain (Healy2018Structural). COMMD3 is widely expressed across various human tissues, with the highest expression observed in the thymus (Burstein2005COMMD).

## Function
COMMD3 (COMM domain containing 3) is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including the regulation of NF-kB signaling, copper homeostasis, and sodium transport. It is a member of the COMMD family, which consists of ten proteins sharing a conserved C-terminal COMM domain that facilitates interactions with various proteins (Liu2013Functional). In healthy human cells, COMMD3 plays a role in modulating the activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is essential for maintaining sodium balance and fluid homeostasis. COMMD3, along with COMMD9, can reduce ENaC activity by decreasing its expression at the cell surface, thereby influencing sodium transport in epithelial cells (Liu2013Functional).

COMMD3 is expressed in the cytoplasm and occasionally in the nuclei of certain cell types, such as proximal convoluted tubule cells in the kidney (Liu2013Functional). It is also involved in endosomal trafficking and the recycling of growth receptors like EGFR, which is crucial for cellular signaling and homeostasis (Umbreen2019COMMD3:BMI1). Through these functions, COMMD3 contributes to maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis, impacting processes such as immune responses and cellular stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the COMMD3 gene have been implicated in the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer. High COMMD3 expression is associated with aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer models, such as LuCaP-145.1 and MDA-PCa2b, and correlates with poor survival probability in patients with high Gleason scores (Umbreen2019COMMD3:BMI1). The COMMD3:BMI1 fusion gene, resulting from readthrough transcription between the COMMD3 and BMI1 genes, is more highly expressed in metastatic prostate cancer compared to primary prostate cancer. This fusion is suggested as a novel therapeutic target for metastatic prostate cancer due to its role in regulating C-MYC transcription, which is crucial for cell proliferation and cancer progression (Umbreen2019COMMD3:BMI1).

In breast cancer, COMMD3 acts as a tumor suppressor. Loss of COMMD3 expression is linked to poorer survival outcomes in ER+ HER2-negative breast cancer, particularly in luminal A-like cases. COMMD3 depletion leads to increased invasive growth and tumor expansion, suggesting its role in suppressing breast cancer progression (Hancock2023COMMD3). The loss of COMMD3 is also associated with alterations in copper homeostasis, which may contribute to the aggressive phenotype of breast cancer (Hancock2023COMMD3).

## Interactions
COMMD3 (COMM domain containing 3) is involved in several physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a complex with COMMD8, which is crucial for the stability and function of both proteins. This complex interacts with chemoattractant receptors such as CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR7, and EBI2, playing a role in GPCR signaling pathways. The COMMD3/8 complex specifically recruits GRK6 to these receptors, influencing β-arrestin-mediated signaling (Nakai2019The).

COMMD3 also interacts with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), where it acts as an endogenous regulator. It reduces the amiloride-sensitive current in cells expressing ENaC, indicating a decrease in ENaC surface expression. This interaction is independent of COMMD1, suggesting a direct regulatory role of COMMD3 on ENaC (Liu2013Functional).

In the context of prostate cancer, COMMD3 regulates C-MYC transcription by binding to the promoter region of the C-MYC gene. This interaction affects the expression of C-MYC target genes and is crucial for sustaining C-MYC activity in certain cancer cells (Umbreen2019COMMD3:BMI1).
