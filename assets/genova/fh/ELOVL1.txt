# ELOVL1

## Overview
ELOVL1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ELOVL fatty acid elongase 1, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in human cells. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of saturated acyl-CoAs, particularly those ranging from C18:0 to C26:0, and is essential for the production of C24 sphingolipids, which are vital components of cell membranes and are involved in cell signaling and structural integrity (Ohno2010ELOVL1). ELOVL1 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, underscoring its fundamental role in maintaining normal cellular functions, including skin barrier formation and neural development (Ohno2010ELOVL1; Deák2019Novel). The enzyme operates within the endoplasmic reticulum as part of a VLCFA elongase complex, interacting with other enzymes to facilitate the elongation cycle (Ohno2010ELOVL1). Alterations in the ELOVL1 gene have been linked to several diseases, including ichthyotic keratoderma, spasticity, and hypomyelination, highlighting its clinical significance (Zwara2021Alterations).

## Function
ELOVL1 (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in human cells. It is primarily involved in the production of saturated C18:0-C26:0 acyl-CoAs, with a particular efficiency in elongating C22:0-CoA to produce C24:0 and C26:0-CoAs (Ohno2010ELOVL1). ELOVL1 is essential for the synthesis of C24 sphingolipids, which are crucial components of cell membranes and are involved in cell signaling and structural integrity (Ohno2010ELOVL1).

The enzyme is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it forms part of a VLCFA elongase complex, interacting with other enzymes involved in the elongation cycle (Ohno2010ELOVL1). ELOVL1's activity is regulated in conjunction with ceramide synthase CERS2, ensuring coordinated production and utilization of C24-CoA in sphingolipid synthesis (Ohno2010ELOVL1). This regulation is vital for maintaining membrane microdomain functions, such as the activation of the Src kinase LYN, which is associated with these domains (Ohno2010ELOVL1).

ELOVL1 is expressed ubiquitously across various human tissues, indicating its fundamental role in maintaining normal cellular functions, including skin barrier formation and neural development (Ohno2010ELOVL1; Deák2019Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ELOVL1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Mutations in ELOVL1 have been linked to ichthyotic keratoderma, spasticity, hypomyelination, and dysmorphic facial features (IKSHD) disease. A specific mutation, p.Ser165Phe, has been identified in two unrelated patients of Polish origin (Zwara2021Alterations). ELOVL1 mutations also result in a syndrome characterized by ichthyosis, hypomyelination, spastic paraplegia, partial deafness, and optic atrophy, sharing symptoms with neuro-ichthyotic syndrome caused by mutations in ELOVL4 (Deák2019Novel).

Alterations in ELOVL1 expression are implicated in skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, where its levels are decreased. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is responsible for its downregulation in atopic dermatitis, while tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and type 2 cytokines also negatively impact ELOVL1 expression (Zwara2021Alterations). In hepatocellular carcinoma, ELOVL1 influences immune cell infiltration and the expression of immune checkpoint markers like PD-1 and CTLA-4 (Wang2023A). ELOVL1 is also associated with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a disorder characterized by the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids in tissues, leading to neurological symptoms and adrenal insufficiency (Wang2023A).

## Interactions
ELOVL1, a key enzyme in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function. ELOVL1 interacts with ceramide synthase 2 (CERS2), specifically precipitating the unglycosylated form of CERS2, which suggests that glycosylation may regulate this interaction (Ohno2010ELOVL1). This interaction is important for the synthesis of C24 sphingolipids, as ELOVL1 provides the necessary C24-CoA substrate for CERS2 (Ohno2010ELOVL1).

ELOVL1 is also part of a VLCFA elongase complex in mammals, interacting with several enzymes involved in the elongation cycle. It coimmunoprecipitates with HACD proteins, which are involved in the third reaction of the VLCFA elongation cycle, as well as with 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase (KAR) and trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase (TER), which catalyze the second and fourth reactions, respectively (Ohno2010ELOVL1). These interactions suggest that ELOVL1 functions within a multiprotein complex to efficiently elongate fatty acids.

CERS2 also interacts with KAR, TER, and all seven ELOVL proteins, indicating that CERS2 may interact with ELOVL1 indirectly through common factors in the elongase complex (Ohno2010ELOVL1). These interactions highlight the integrated role of ELOVL1 in lipid metabolism and its importance in maintaining cellular functions.
