# CYYR1

## Overview
CYYR1 is a gene that encodes the cysteine and tyrosine rich 1 protein, which is characterized by a central domain rich in cysteine and tyrosine residues. This protein is notable for its potential role in cell signaling and stress response pathways, although its precise functions in human physiology remain to be fully elucidated. The CYYR1 protein is predicted to contain a transmembrane domain and a signal peptide, suggesting its localization in cellular membranes, which aligns with its proposed involvement in modulating transport activity at the plasma membrane (Vitale2007Sequence; Vitale2002Cysteine). Despite its broad expression across various tissues, including the diffuse neuroendocrine system, the specific molecular activities of CYYR1 are not well-defined, although it may influence glutathione uptake and the stability or activity of membrane transport components (Shi2010Identification).

## Structure
The CYYR1 protein is a 154-amino acid polypeptide characterized by a high content of cysteine and tyrosine residues, with a molecular weight of 16.6 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 8.28 (Vitale2002Cysteine). The primary structure includes a central cysteine-and tyrosine-rich domain, which is highly conserved across vertebrates and extends from C39 to K89. This domain contains 11 tyrosines and 11 cysteines, making up 7.1% each of the amino acids in the protein (Vitale2002Cysteine).

The secondary structure of CYYR1 is predicted to include two alpha-helix structures within the cysteine-and tyrosine-rich domain, with an additional helix at the amino-terminus and a possible beta-sheet region at the carboxy-terminal region. The transmembrane region, spanning from I63 to C85, corresponds to the largest central helix (Vitale2002Cysteine).

CYYR1 features a signal peptide-like sequence at the amino terminus and a low complexity, proline-rich region at the carboxy-terminus, which includes three repeated PPPY motifs (Vitale2007Sequence). The protein does not show similarity to any known proteins or domains, suggesting it may belong to a new family of vertebrate-specific genes (Vitale2002Cysteine). Two mRNA isoforms of CYYR1 arise from alternative splicing, differing by the presence or absence of a CAG codon, which affects the presence of an alanine residue at the exon 3/exon 4 junction (Vitale2007Sequence).

## Function
The CYYR1 gene encodes a protein characterized by a central cysteine-and tyrosine-rich domain, which is highly conserved among vertebrates. This protein is suggested to have a role in cell signaling pathways and may be involved in cellular stress responses, although its exact function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Vitale2002Cysteine). The CYYR1 protein is predicted to contain a transmembrane domain and a signal peptide, indicating its potential localization in cell or cell compartment membranes (Vitale2007Sequence). 

The protein is broadly expressed across various human tissues, with notable expression in the diffuse neuroendocrine system, suggesting a possible role in neuroendocrine functions (Vitale2007Sequence). Despite its widespread expression, the specific molecular activities of CYYR1 in cellular processes are not well-defined. It has been implicated in modulating transport activity at the plasma membrane, potentially influencing glutathione uptake, although it does not appear to encode a prototypical glutathione transporter (Shi2010Identification). The presence of PY motifs in the protein suggests a regulatory role in protein cell surface expression, possibly affecting the stability or activity of membrane transport components (Shi2010Identification).
