# PTPRN2

## Overview
PTPRN2, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type N2, is a gene that encodes a receptor protein belonging to the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. This family is characterized by its role in regulating cellular processes through dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on target proteins. However, PTPRN2 is unique in that it functions as a pseudo-phosphatase, lacking typical enzymatic activity but still playing a crucial role in intracellular signaling pathways. The protein is predominantly expressed in neuroendocrine cells, including insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells, where it is involved in granule cargo storage, exocytosis, and cell proliferation. PTPRN2 is also recognized as a type 1 diabetes autoantigen and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and cancer progression (El2024Analysis; Sokanovic2023Common; Pulido2013PTPs).

## Structure
PTPRN2, a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor family, is characterized by a distinct molecular structure. It features a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a single intracellular pseudo-phosphatase domain. The extracellular domain is related to the SEA (sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, agrin) domain of mucins, which is initially oriented towards the lumen of the granule and then towards the extracellular space following granule secretion (El2024Analysis). 

PTPRN2 is primarily expressed in neuroendocrine cells, including insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells, where it plays roles in granule cargo storage, exocytosis, and cell proliferation. It is also significant as a type 1 diabetes autoantigen (El2024Analysis). The protein undergoes proteolytic processing by furin-like convertases, which cleaves off a large N-terminal fragment, resulting in a transmembrane protein of approximately 60 kDa (El2024Analysis).

PTPRN2 lacks the typical enzymatic activity associated with protein tyrosine phosphatases but is involved in intracellular signaling pathways and is a marker protein of neuroendocrine cells (Sokanovic2023Common). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation and has multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and localization.

## Function
PTPRN2, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type N2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PTPRN2 is primarily associated with the regulation of insulin secretion and neurotransmitter release. It functions as part of the secretory granule membrane, playing a significant role in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis, which are essential for maintaining normal glucose homeostasis and neural communication (Pulido2013PTPs).

The protein encoded by PTPRN2 is a classical receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) expressed in nervous and endocrine cells. Unlike typical phosphatases that target phosphotyrosine residues, PTPRN2's catalytic activity is directed towards phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a phospholipid involved in various signaling pathways. This activity is crucial for the proper subcellular localization and function of the protein, influencing processes such as secretory vesicle release (Pulido2013PTPs).

PTPRN2 is also implicated in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, which are linked to male fertility through its impact on glucose metabolism in the testes (Amor2023The). The gene's expression levels can influence developmental processes critical for eye and ear functionality by modulating phospholipid levels (Pulido2013PTPs).

## Clinical Significance
The PTPRN2 gene is associated with a variety of diseases and conditions due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, and changes in its normal interactions. Genetic variants in PTPRN2, such as rs10081191, have been linked to noise-induced hearing loss, highlighting its role in auditory function (Wu2024Interactions). Altered methylation of PTPRN2 is implicated in metabolic disorders, including childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes, with specific CpG sites showing significant correlations with obesity-related traits (Vasilyev2023Abnormal; Lee2019The). In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, PTPRN2 expression levels and genetic variants have been associated with conditions such as autism and ADHD (Hendriks2023Hereditable).

PTPRN2 is also involved in the progression of colon cancer, where it is upregulated by the HOXD13 gene, contributing to cancer cell migration and invasion (Yin2021HOXD13). In Parkinson's disease, differential methylation of PTPRN2 has been observed, with sex-specific patterns potentially influencing disease progression (Kochmanski2022Parkinson’s). These findings suggest that PTPRN2 plays a significant role in various diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
PTPRN2, also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type N2, is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cell communication. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, PTPRN2 interacts with the protein twist1, which is crucial for regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer progression, as it influences the expression of mesenchymal markers and enhances the migration, invasion, and proliferation abilities of cancer cells (Chen2023Aberrant).

PTPRN2 also interacts with TRAF2, a key adaptor molecule in the MAPK signaling pathway. This interaction promotes K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF2, facilitating downstream signaling cascades that are essential for cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Chen2023Aberrant). Additionally, PTPRN2 is involved in the STAT3/cyclin D1 signaling pathway, where its knockdown results in decreased levels of cyclin D1 and phosphorylated STAT3, affecting cell cycle progression (Chen2023Aberrant).

In the context of insulin secretory granules, PTPRN2 has been identified as an ISG-related protein, suggesting its potential involvement in multiprotein complexes during ISG maturation (Li2018Proteomic). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of PTPRN2 in both cancer progression and endocrine functions.
