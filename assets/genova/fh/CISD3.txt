# CISD3

## Overview
CISD3, also known as CDGSH iron sulfur domain 3, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in the regulation of iron-sulfur cluster transfer and mitochondrial function. The protein, also referred to as Miner2, is characterized by its monomeric structure and the presence of two CDGSH motifs, which are essential for binding [2Fe-2S] clusters. These clusters play a critical role in electron transfer reactions within the mitochondrial respiratory chain, particularly in skeletal muscles (Cheng2017Binding; Karmi2018The). Unlike its paralogs, which are typically homodimeric, CISD3 is unique in its monomeric form, contributing to its distinct functional properties within the mitochondria (Karmi2018The). The protein's involvement in iron-sulfur cluster relay mechanisms is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and supporting metabolic pathways, impacting processes such as oxidative stress response and iron homeostasis (Marjault2023CISD3). Additionally, CISD3 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and mitochondrial-related diseases, highlighting its significance in cellular metabolism and potential as a therapeutic target (Li2021CISD3; Marjault2023CISD3).

## Structure
CISD3, also known as Miner2, is a human mitochondrial protein that contains two CDGSH motifs, which are crucial for binding [2Fe-2S] clusters. These motifs are characterized by an unusual ligand arrangement of three cysteine and one histidine residues, contributing to the unique structural features of the protein (Cheng2017Binding; Karmi2018The). The protein is monomeric and exhibits distinct asymmetry in its molecular surfaces surrounding the clusters, unlike its paralogs, which are homodimeric (Karmi2018The).

The tertiary structure of CISD3 is stabilized by the presence of [2Fe-2S] clusters, which are coordinated by the CDGSH motifs. The NEET fold, a structural feature shared among NEET proteins, includes a β-cap domain and a cluster-binding domain. The β-cap domain consists of two β-sheets formed by antiparallel β-strands, linked by loops, while the cluster-binding domain features the CDGSH motif (Karmi2018The).

CISD3's quaternary structure is monomeric, distinguishing it from other NEET proteins that form homodimers. This structural uniqueness is significant for its function within the mitochondria (Karmi2018The). The protein's structure and function are influenced by the lability of its [2Fe-2S] clusters, which are sensitive to redox changes and interactions with small molecules like nitric oxide (Cheng2017Binding).

## Function
CISD3, also known as CDGSH iron sulfur domain 3, is a crucial protein for maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly in skeletal muscles. It is a soluble monomeric protein located within the mitochondrial matrix and plays a significant role in the transfer of iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential for electron transfer reactions in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Marjault2023CISD3; Sengupta2018Phylogenetic). CISD3 specifically supports the biogenesis and function of Complex I by interacting with the subunit NDUFV2, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Marjault2023CISD3).

The protein is involved in an iron-sulfur cluster relay mechanism, transferring [2Fe-2S] clusters to other proteins within the mitochondria, which is crucial for mitochondrial respiration and metabolic pathways (Marjault2023CISD3). This function is essential for energy production and cellular metabolism, impacting processes such as lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative stress response, and iron homeostasis (Marjault2023CISD3). CISD3's role in preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and labile iron is also highlighted, as its levels are elevated in cancer cells to prevent ferroptosis and apoptosis (Marjault2023CISD3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CISD3 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In cancer, higher expression levels of CISD3 are associated with poorer prognosis in several types, including breast cancer (BRCA), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC), liver cancer (LIHC), prostate cancer (PRAD), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), and thymoma (THYM). Elevated CISD3 expression correlates with reduced overall survival and disease-free survival in these cancers, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Li2021CISD3).

CISD3 is also implicated in mitochondrial-related diseases. Deficiency in CISD3 can lead to reduced mitochondrial respiration, increased glycolysis, and structural damage to mitochondria, which are linked to conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, encephalopathy, and Leigh syndrome. These conditions are associated with NDUFV2 deficiency, a protein that interacts with CISD3 in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Marjault2023CISD3).

In the context of ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, CISD3 knockdown results in increased free iron and lipid peroxides, making cells more susceptible to ferroptotic cell death. This suggests that CISD3 plays a regulatory role in iron metabolism and ferroptosis, which could be targeted for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Li2021CISD3).

## Interactions
CISD3, also known as CDGSH iron sulfur domain 3, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for mitochondrial function. It interacts with NDUFV2, a component of Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This interaction has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation assays and mass spectrometry analysis, indicating a physical and functional relationship between the two proteins (Marjault2023CISD3). CISD3 is capable of transferring its [2Fe-2S] clusters to NDUFV2, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, particularly in skeletal muscle (Marjault2023CISD3).

In addition to NDUFV2, CISD3 interacts with other subunits of Complex I, such as NDUFS2, NDUFV1, NDUFA11, and NDUFS1, as well as Complex II components SDHA and SDHB, in skeletal muscles of mice. These interactions suggest a broader role for CISD3 in supporting the electron transport chain by donating [2Fe-2S] clusters to these proteins (Marjault2023CISD3). The interaction with NDUFV2 involves disulfide bridges, as it is disrupted by β-mercaptoethanol, highlighting the importance of this interaction in mitochondrial respiration and metabolic pathways (Marjault2023CISD3).
