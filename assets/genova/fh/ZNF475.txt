# ZNF475

## Overview
ZNF475 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 475, a KRAB-type zinc-finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation. This protein plays a critical role in modulating the activity of p53, a key protein in cellular metabolism and stress responses. By interacting with p53, zinc finger protein 475 suppresses the transcription of TIGAR, a p53 target gene that influences glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, thereby impacting cellular energy homeostasis (Wang2018KRAB-type). The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential function in cellular processes. ZNF475's regulatory effects are mediated through its KRAB domain and zinc fingers, which are necessary for its inhibitory action on p53 (Wang2018KRAB-type). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in cancer metabolism, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it is associated with tumor growth and metastasis (Wang2018KRAB-type).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF475, also known as PITA, is a KRAB-type zinc-finger protein that functions as a transcriptional regulator in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in modulating p53 activity, a crucial protein in cellular metabolism and stress responses. ZNF475 interacts with p53 to suppress the transcription of TIGAR, a p53 target gene that regulates glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. This interaction is significant in controlling the glycolytic rate and energy homeostasis within cells (Wang2018KRAB-type).

ZNF475 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it exerts its regulatory functions. It is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in cellular processes. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that ZNF475 is highly expressed in the adult brain and moderately in other tissues such as the tongue, ileum, lung, and skeletal muscle (Wang2018KRAB-type).

The protein's regulatory effect on p53 is dependent on the presence of both the KRAB domain and zinc fingers, which are necessary for its inhibitory action on p53 activity. This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and metabolic pathways (Wang2018KRAB-type).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF475, also known as PITA, is implicated in the regulation of p53-dependent metabolic pathways, which are crucial in cancer metabolism. Alterations in the expression of ZNF475 have been associated with colorectal cancer development. Specifically, ZNF475 acts as a negative regulator of p53-mediated metabolic pathways by inhibiting p53 binding to the TIGAR gene, which is involved in glycolysis regulation. This inhibition promotes cell growth and tumor metastasis, particularly in colorectal cancer, by enhancing glucose uptake and glycolytic ATP generation, thereby supporting tumor growth and altering the tumor microenvironment (Wang2018KRAB-type).

In colorectal cancer, ZNF475 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues, suggesting its role in cancer progression. Overexpression of ZNF475 in colonic epithelial cells leads to increased cell growth and transformation, while its depletion reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells (Wang2018KRAB-type). Despite its significant role in colorectal cancer, there is limited information on the specific mutations of ZNF475 and their clinical significance in other diseases (Czerwinska2021Low).

## Interactions
ZNF475, also known as PITA, is a KRAB-type zinc-finger protein that interacts directly with the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of p53-mediated cellular metabolism, particularly in glycolysis. ZNF475 suppresses the transcription of the glycolysis regulator TIGAR by inhibiting p53's ability to bind to the TIGAR gene. This interaction was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, indicating a direct interaction between ZNF475 and p53. The zinc fingers of ZNF475 are necessary for this inhibitory effect on p53 activity, while the KRAB domain is required for efficient repression of p53 (Wang2018KRAB-type).

In response to glucose starvation, ZNF475 dissociates from p53, leading to the activation of p53 and induction of TIGAR, which inhibits aerobic glycolysis. This dynamic regulation is dependent on ATM kinase-mediated phosphorylation of ZNF475 (Wang2018KRAB-type). The study highlights the specific regulatory role of ZNF475 in modulating p53 activity through interactions with nucleic acids and proteins, suggesting its significant role in metabolic control and potential implications in cancer progression (Wang2018KRAB-type).
