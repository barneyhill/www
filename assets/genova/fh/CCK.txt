# CCK

## Overview
The CCK gene encodes the peptide hormone cholecystokinin, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of digestive processes and satiety. Cholecystokinin is primarily produced in the small intestine and the central nervous system, where it functions as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter. The CCK gene is structured with three exons and undergoes post-translational modifications to produce active forms of the hormone, such as CCK-8, which is the most potent variant. Cholecystokinin exerts its effects by binding to G protein-coupled receptors, specifically CCK1 and CCK2, which are involved in various physiological processes, including the stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion, gallbladder contraction, and modulation of satiety signals in the brain (Rehfeld2017Cholecystokinin—From; Liddle1997CHOLECYSTOKININ). The gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest due to their involvement in gastrointestinal function, appetite regulation, and potential implications in diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders (Zeng2020Gastrin; Wang2003Cholecystokinin).

## Structure
The cholecystokinin (CCK) protein is encoded by a gene that spans approximately 7 kilobases and consists of three exons (Yoosuke1986Structure). The mature CCK mRNA is about 750 bases long and is expressed in both the brain and intestine (Liddle1997CHOLECYSTOKININ). CCK is synthesized as a precursor that includes a signal peptide, a spacer peptide, CCK-58, and a carboxyl-terminal extension (Liddle1997CHOLECYSTOKININ). The active CCK peptide requires a specific sequence, Trp-Asp-Met-Phe-NH2, and must be extended to seven amino acids for receptor binding (Liddle1997CHOLECYSTOKININ). 

Post-translational modifications are crucial for CCK's activity, particularly the sulfation of the tyrosine residue at position 7, which is essential for its biological function (Liddle1997CHOLECYSTOKININ; Ding2022Structural). CCK exists in various molecular forms, including CCK-8, CCK-33, and CCK-58, with CCK-8 being the most biologically potent form (Liddle1997CHOLECYSTOKININ). The CCK-A receptor has a high affinity for sulfated CCK, while the CCK-B receptor binds both CCK and gastrin with similar affinities (Liddle1997CHOLECYSTOKININ). The structural studies of CCK receptors have provided insights into ligand selectivity and receptor activation, which are important for understanding CCK's role in the brain-gut axis (Ding2022Structural).

## Function
Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone that plays a significant role in digestion and satiety. It is primarily produced by endocrine I-cells in the small intestine and neurons in the central nervous system. CCK is secreted into the bloodstream in response to food ingestion, particularly fats and proteins, and functions by binding to specific G protein-coupled receptors, CCK1 and CCK2 (Rehfeld2017Cholecystokinin—From; Liddle1997CHOLECYSTOKININ).

In the gastrointestinal tract, CCK stimulates the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the gallbladder, facilitating the digestion of fats and proteins. It also regulates gastric emptying and induces satiety by acting on CCK1 receptors, which relay signals to the hypothalamus (Rehfeld2017Cholecystokinin—From; IWANAGA2023Anatomical). CCK inhibits gastric acid secretion through the release of somatostatin (Wank1995Cholecystokinin).

In the central nervous system, CCK acts as a neurotransmitter and is involved in regulating satiety and anxiety. It is abundant in neocortical neurons and is colocalized with dopamine in certain neurons, suggesting a role in modulating neurotransmitter systems (Rehfeld2017Cholecystokinin—From; Liddle1997CHOLECYSTOKININ). CCK also influences insulin and glucagon release, with species-specific differences in receptor expression (Rehfeld2017Cholecystokinin—From).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the cholecystokinin (CCK) gene and its receptors have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In Parkinson's disease, polymorphisms in the CCK gene, particularly the CCK 245C>T genotype, have been associated with a significantly increased risk of visual hallucinations. This risk is further elevated when combined with certain genotypes of the CCK-A receptor, suggesting a genetic interaction that may contribute to the development of these symptoms in Parkinson's patients (Wang2003Cholecystokinin).

In the context of cancer, CCK receptors, especially CCK2R, are overexpressed in several adenocarcinomas, including those of the stomach, pancreas, and colon. This overexpression is linked to tumor growth and progression, making CCK receptors potential targets for cancer therapy (Zeng2020Gastrin). Specifically, a splice variant of CCK2R, CCK2Ri4sv, has been identified in colorectal cancer, leading to constitutive receptor activation and enhanced cell proliferation (Zeng2020Gastrin).

Alterations in CCK receptor expression are also observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, where CCK-A receptors are selectively expressed, potentially serving as biomarkers for these tumors (Weinberg1997Cholecystokinin). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCK and its receptors in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Cholecystokinin (CCK) interacts with its receptors, primarily the cholecystokinin A receptor (CCK A R) and cholecystokinin type 1 receptor (CCK1R), to mediate various physiological functions. CCK A R has a higher affinity for sulfated CCK peptides, such as CCK-8, and can couple with multiple G-protein subtypes, including G q, G s, and G i, which is unusual for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Liu2021Ligand). The binding of CCK-8 to CCK A R involves specific interactions with transmembrane domains and extracellular loops, forming a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts that are crucial for ligand recognition and receptor activation (Liu2021Ligand).

CCK1R also interacts with G proteins, specifically Gq/11 and Gs, and its signaling is influenced by the cellular environment, such as cholesterol levels. The receptor's interaction with G proteins involves conformational changes in both the receptor and the G protein, which are critical for the promiscuous coupling of GPCRs (Mobbs2021Structures). The structural interactions of CCK1R with G proteins are characterized by specific motifs and residues that facilitate G protein binding and activation (Mobbs2021Structures). These interactions are essential for understanding the mechanisms of G protein selectivity and the modulation of CCK1R signaling.
