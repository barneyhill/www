# DPEP2NB

## Overview
DPEP2NB is a gene that encodes the DPEP2 neighbor protein, which is a member of the dipeptidase family. This protein is involved in the hydrolysis of dipeptides and plays a role in various biological processes, including the metabolism of glutathione and leukotriene. The DPEP2 neighbor protein is characterized by its enzymatic activity, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses. Although the specific pathways and interactions of DPEP2NB are not fully elucidated, its expression and function suggest potential implications in disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets (Qiu2020aarFDC).
