# EPHA8

## Overview
EPHA8 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor A8, a member of the Eph receptor family, which is the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EPH receptor A8 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain, among other structural features. This receptor is primarily involved in cell signaling processes that regulate cell positioning, migration, and apoptosis, particularly in the nervous system. It plays a crucial role in neural development by mediating cell-cell communication and influencing axon guidance and tissue patterning. The receptor's interactions with ephrins, its ligands, result in bidirectional signaling that affects both the receptor-expressing and ligand-expressing cells, impacting various downstream pathways such as Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR (Shin2007Identification; Wang2021EphA8).

## Structure
The EPHA8 protein is a member of the Eph receptor family, characterized by several distinct domains. It contains an extracellular region with a ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich motif, and two fibronectin type III repeat domains. The transmembrane domain (TMD) is typically a helical structure, and the intracellular region includes a juxtamembrane (JM) domain, a kinase domain, a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, and an ankyrin repeat domain (Shin2007Identification; Sahoo2021Structural).

The juxtamembrane domain of EPHA8 is crucial for interactions with phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain-containing proteins, such as AIDA-1b and Odin. This interaction is independent of the receptor's kinase activity and involves specific motifs like the sequence KKRHCGY (Shin2007Identification). The SAM domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, which are important for modulating receptor degradation (Kim2010The).

EPHA8 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is common among receptor tyrosine kinases. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of EPHA8, as well as information on splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context (Shin2007Identification; Sahoo2021Structural).

## Function
The EPHA8 gene encodes a receptor that is part of the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, known as erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptors (Ephs). These receptors interact with ligands called ephrins, producing bidirectional signals that affect both Eph- and ligand-expressing cells. Eph/ephrin signaling is involved in various downstream pathways, including Ras/MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and others, which are crucial for cell positioning, migration, and other cellular processes (Wang2021EphA8).

In healthy cells, particularly during early brain development, EphA8 modulates apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner in ephrin-A-expressing neuroepithelial cells. It also induces a sustained increase in MAPK activity, promoting neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells. These functions suggest that EphA8 plays a role in cell adhesion, migration, and apoptosis regulation, which are essential for normal cellular development and function (Wang2021EphA8). The receptor is primarily active in the nervous system, where it mediates cell-cell communication and influences cell positioning and tissue patterning, contributing to axon guidance and neural development (Wang2021EphA8).

## Clinical Significance
EPHA8 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, EPHA8 expression is upregulated and correlates with larger tumor size and advanced TNM stage, making it a poor prognostic marker. Knockdown of EPHA8 in breast cancer cells increases apoptosis and reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell survival. This knockdown also affects the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, leading to decreased AKT phosphorylation and altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as Bcl-2, p53, Caspase-3, and Bax. These findings indicate that EPHA8 could be a potential target for adjuvant chemotherapy, enhancing the efficacy of treatments like paclitaxel (Wang2021EphA8).

In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), mutations in EPHA8 have been identified, although their clinical significance is not well-defined. The mutation p.Arg474Trp in EPHA8 was found to be neutral and located in the extracellular domain, with no direct association with disease outcomes reported (Mäki‐Nevala2013Mutated). The role of EPHA8 in cellular signaling, particularly through interactions with proteins like Odin and AIDA-1b, suggests its involvement in processes such as cell migration and neurite retraction, which may have implications in cancer and neurological disorders (Shin2007Identification).

## Interactions
EPHA8 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cell signaling and migration. One key interaction is with the p110γ PI-3 kinase, which is crucial for ephrin A5-stimulated cell migration on fibronectin. This interaction is enhanced by ephrin A5, which stabilizes the association and increases the lipid kinase activity of p110γ. Notably, this process does not require the tyrosine kinase activity of EPHA8 (Gu2003The).

EPHA8 also interacts with the Fyn kinase through its SH2 domain, a process dependent on the phosphorylation of Tyr-615 in the juxtamembrane domain of EPHA8. This interaction is crucial for modulating cell adhesion, as it attenuates cell attachment responses (Choi1999Phosphorylation).

In the context of neurite retraction, EPHA8 interacts with Odin, a protein required for ephrinA5-induced neurite retraction in Neuro2a cells. The interaction between EPHA8 and Odin is essential for this process, as demonstrated by reduced neurite retraction upon Odin knockdown (Shin2007Identification).

EPHA8 also binds to AIDA-1b through its phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, specifically interacting with the juxtamembrane domain of EPHA8. This interaction is unique to EPHA8 and does not occur with other Eph receptors (Shin2007Identification).
