# CHST2

## Overview
CHST2, or carbohydrate sulfotransferase 2, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein involved in the sulfation of carbohydrates. The protein, known as GlcNAc6ST-2, is a member of the carbohydrate 6-O-sulfotransferase family and plays a crucial role in the transfer of sulfate groups to the C-6 position of N-acetylglucosamine residues in glycoproteins. This enzymatic activity is essential for the biosynthesis of the 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X epitope, which is important for lymphocyte homing and immune cell trafficking (Zhang2023CHST2mediated; Chen2011Gene). CHST2 is predominantly expressed in the endothelial cells of lymph nodes, pancreas, and liver, where it contributes to normal immune function. Additionally, it is involved in the synthesis of keratan sulfate, influencing processes such as glial scar formation and early brain development (Zhang2023CHST2mediated). The gene's expression and activity have significant implications in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2023CHST2mediated).

## Structure
CHST2, also known as carbohydrate sulfotransferase 2, is a sulfotransferase enzyme consisting of 530 amino acid residues. It features a C-terminal domain that shares significant identity with human and chick C6ST, indicating a conserved structure among species (Grunwell2002Carbohydrate). The enzyme is a type II single-span transmembrane protein, characterized by a short N-terminal cytosolic tail and a C-terminal catalytic domain located within the Golgi lumen (Grunwell2002Carbohydrate). 

CHST2 is involved in the sulfation of the 6-position of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues, a modification critical for the formation of L-selectin ligands (Grunwell2002Characterization). The enzyme requires the activated sulfate donor 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) for its activity, with specific regions of homology, such as the 5′-phosphosulfate binding site (5′-PSB) and the 3′-phosphate binding site (3′-PB), playing crucial roles in its function (Grunwell2002Carbohydrate).

The human cDNA for CHST2 encodes two isoforms, which differ in the length of their cytosolic tails due to alternative start sites. These isoforms may localize differently within the cell, with the short form potentially residing in the Golgi and the long form possibly expressed at the cell surface (Grunwell2002Carbohydrate). The enzyme's structure and function are essential for its role in cellular signaling and immune responses.

## Function
The CHST2 gene encodes the enzyme GlcNAc6ST-2, a member of the carbohydrate 6-O-sulfotransferase family, which is involved in the transfer of sulfate groups to the C-6 position of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in glycoproteins (Chen2011Gene). This sulfation process is crucial for the biosynthesis of the 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X epitope, a key component in the function of L-selectin ligands, which are important for lymphocyte homing and immune cell trafficking (Zhang2023CHST2mediated). In healthy human cells, CHST2 expression is primarily found in the endothelial cells of lymph nodes, pancreas, and liver, where it plays a role in maintaining normal immune function by facilitating lymphocyte homing (Chen2011Gene).

CHST2 is also involved in the synthesis of keratan sulfate, which contributes to glial scar formation after brain injury and early postnatal brain development (Zhang2023CHST2mediated). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies proteoglycans, influencing cell communication and tissue repair processes. Through these activities, CHST2 plays a significant role in cell signaling, cell adhesion, and maintaining the structural integrity of tissues (Zhang2023CHST2mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CHST2 gene have significant implications in breast cancer progression, particularly in cell migration and metastasis. CHST2 is upregulated by the transcription factor Snail, which is known to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process in cancer metastasis. This upregulation enhances the sulfation of MECA79 antigens, facilitating cancer cell migration and metastasis (Zhang2023CHST2mediated). Overexpression of CHST2 has been shown to increase breast cancer cell migration and lung metastasis, while its knockdown impairs these processes (Zhang2023CHST2mediated).

The enzymatic activity of CHST2, which is crucial for its role in cancer progression, depends on the high-energy sulfate donor PAPS. Inhibition of PAPS synthesis can reduce cell migration in CHST2-overexpressing cells, highlighting a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2023CHST2mediated). Additionally, the N-linked glycosylation site at Asn 475 is critical for CHST2's enzymatic function, and mutations at this site can affect its ability to sulfate substrates, impacting cell migration (Zhang2023CHST2mediated).

These findings suggest that CHST2 is a potential marker and therapeutic target for breast cancer metastasis, with its expression and activity being pivotal in the disease's progression (Zhang2023CHST2mediated).
