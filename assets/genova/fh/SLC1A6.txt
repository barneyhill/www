# SLC1A6

## Overview
The SLC1A6 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 1 member 6, also known as the excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4). This protein is a transmembrane transporter primarily expressed in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it plays a critical role in the re-uptake of glutamate, a key neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. EAAT4 functions as a high-affinity glutamate transporter and a glutamate-gated chloride channel, although the chloride conductance is not coupled to glutamate transport. This dual functionality is essential for maintaining synaptic activity and preventing excitotoxicity, thereby contributing to the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (OlivaresBañuelos2019Glutamate; Kanai2004The). The protein's structure, characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and a trimeric architecture, is shared among members of the SLC1 family, facilitating its role in neurotransmitter regulation (Pochini2014Membrane).

## Structure
The SLC1A6 gene encodes the neuronal high-affinity glutamate transporter EAAT4, which is predominantly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. The protein is characterized by a thermodynamically uncoupled chloride conductance associated with substrate transport (Kanai2004The). Structurally, members of the SLC1 family, including SLC1A6, share common features such as eight predicted alpha-helical transmembrane domains and a large extracellular glycosylated loop. These transporters also have a reentrant loop between transmembrane domains 7 and 8, which is crucial for their function (Kanai2004The). 

The tridimensional structure of an archeal homolog of the SLC1 family, Gltph, has been solved, revealing a trimeric architecture with each protomer acting as an independent transport unit. This structure serves as a template for homology models of other SLC1 family members, suggesting a similar translocation mechanism (Pochini2014Membrane). Although specific details about the molecular structure of SLC1A6 are not fully resolved, these insights into the SLC1 family provide a basis for understanding its structural characteristics. The presence of conserved cysteine residues and putative glycosylation sites is also noted in homology models, which may be relevant to SLC1A6 (Pochini2014Membrane).

## Function
The SLC1A6 gene encodes the EAAT4 glutamate transporter, which is primarily expressed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons and postsynaptic dendrites of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (OlivaresBañuelos2019Glutamate; RodríguezCampuzano2021Glutamate). EAAT4 functions as a high-affinity glutamate transporter with slow kinetics, playing a crucial role in limiting the diffusion of synaptically released glutamate to neighboring synapses (RodríguezCampuzano2021Glutamate). This transporter also acts as a glutamate-gated chloride channel, although chloride fluxes are not coupled to glutamate translocation (OlivaresBañuelos2019Glutamate).

EAAT4 is involved in the re-uptake of glutamate, which is essential for maintaining synaptic activity and preventing excitotoxicity (Gesemann2010Phylogenetic). It is also found in astrocytes of the spinal cord and brain, with its subcellular distribution mainly restricted to the membrane of cell bodies and dendrites, particularly near excitatory synapses (RodríguezCampuzano2021Glutamate). The transporter forms complexes of higher molecular weight, favoring dimerization over trimerization, and can heterotrimerize with other transporters like EAAT3/EAAC1, allowing for tight regulation of glutamate uptake and modulation of neuronal excitability (RodríguezCampuzano2021Glutamate).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC1A6 gene, encoding the EAAT4 glutamate transporter, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in glutamate transport and neurotransmitter regulation. Alterations in SLC1A6 expression have been associated with radioresistance and decreased cisplatin sensitivity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. Upregulation of SLC1A6 in radioresistant NPC cells leads to increased glutamate levels and expression of drug resistance genes, contributing to reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation, and correlating with poor prognosis in NPC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients (Hao2021Radioresistant).

In the context of neurological disorders, SLC1A6 has been linked to schizophrenia. Polymorphisms in the SLC1A6 gene have shown significant associations with schizophrenia, suggesting a potential role in the disease's genetic predisposition. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLC1A6 have been associated with increased risk, highlighting its potential clinical significance in neuropsychiatric disorders (Deng2007Association).

Additionally, reduced expression of EAAT4, the protein product of SLC1A6, has been observed in mood disorders such as bipolar and major depressive disorders, indicating a role in the pathophysiology of these conditions (OlivaresBañuelos2019Glutamate; RodríguezCampuzano2021Glutamate).
