# KIF3B

## Overview
KIF3B is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 3B protein, a crucial component of the kinesin-2 motor protein complex. This protein is categorized as a motor protein and plays a significant role in intracellular transport along microtubules. KIF3B is essential for the anterograde transport of organelles and protein complexes, particularly in neurons, where it contributes to cilia and flagella morphogenesis (Hirokawa2000Stirring; Hirokawa2008Intracellular). The protein forms a heterodimer with KIF3A and interacts with accessory proteins such as KAP3, facilitating its function in cellular transport mechanisms (Adams2024Characterization; Lin2021Molecular). Mutations in KIF3B have been linked to various diseases, including ciliopathies and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and physiological homeostasis (Adams2024Characterization; Wang2021Silencing).

## Structure
KIF3B is a motor protein that is part of the kinesin superfamily, primarily involved in intracellular transport. The protein is composed of several distinct domains, including an N-terminal motor domain, a coiled-coil stalk domain, and a C-terminal tail domain. The motor domain is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and movement along microtubules, a function that is highly conserved across species (Lin2021Molecular). The coiled-coil stalk domain facilitates dimerization with KIF3A, forming a heterodimeric complex that is essential for its function (chana2005stability; Lin2021Molecular).

The KIF3B protein also interacts with the accessory protein KAP3, which binds to the coiled-coil and/or tail domains, playing a role in motor regulation and cargo binding (Adams2024Characterization). The neck region of KIF3B contains charged regions that are crucial for specifying heterodimer formation with KIF3A, contributing to the stability of the heterodimeric coiled-coil (chana2005stability).

Mutations in KIF3B, such as E250Q, A334T, and L523P, have been studied for their impact on protein function, affecting aspects like motor motility and ciliogenesis (Adams2024Characterization). These mutations highlight the importance of specific regions in KIF3B for its structural integrity and functional interactions.

## Function
KIF3B is a subunit of the kinesin-2 motor protein complex, which plays a critical role in intracellular transport along microtubules. This protein is essential for the anterograde transport of membrane-bound organelles, particularly in neurons, where it facilitates the movement of protein complexes necessary for cilia and flagella morphogenesis (Hirokawa2000Stirring). KIF3B is involved in the transport of N-cadherin and β-catenin in developing neurons, which is crucial for maintaining cell-cell adhesion and preventing excessive cell proliferation (Hirokawa2008Intracellular).

In the context of ciliary function, KIF3B is vital for ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, by transporting structural components to the tips of cilia through intraflagellar transport (IFT) (Hirokawa2015Kinesin). It is also involved in left-right determination during development, as its absence leads to severe developmental abnormalities, including defects in neural tube closure and randomization of left-right asymmetry (Hirokawa2000Stirring).

KIF3B interacts with CLC-5, a chloride/proton antiporter, facilitating its plasma membrane expression and endocytosis, which is crucial for renal physiology and maintaining extracellular fluid homeostasis (Reed2010CLC5). This interaction highlights KIF3B's role in receptor-mediated endocytosis and microtubular transport, particularly in kidney cells (Reed2010CLC5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KIF3B gene have been implicated in various diseases. In breast cancer, KIF3B is over-expressed, correlating with tumor recurrence and lymph node metastasis. Silencing KIF3B suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2021Silencing). In seminoma, a type of testicular cancer, KIF3B is highly expressed in cancer tissues, and its knockdown leads to reduced cell proliferation and migration, indicating its role in cancer cell mitosis and spindle formation (Shen2017A).

KIF3B mutations are also associated with ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by defects in cilia. Specific mutations, such as E250Q and L523P, impair ciliogenesis by affecting the motor function of KIF3B, leading to diseases like retinitis pigmentosa and other multi-systemic symptoms (Adams2024Characterization). In pancreatic β cells, KIF3B is a target of miR-127, which regulates cell proliferation. Altered KIF3B expression is linked to reduced β cell proliferation, impacting conditions like type 2 diabetes (Shen2019MicroRNA127). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KIF3B in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
KIF3B, a subunit of the kinesin-II motor complex, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It forms a heterotrimeric complex with KIF3A and KAP3, essential for anterograde transport along microtubules. This complex is involved in ciliogenesis, where KIF3B interacts with the IFT-B-connecting tetramer (IFT38-IFT52-IFT57-IFT88), a critical interaction for intraflagellar transport and ciliary assembly (Funabashi2018Interaction).

KIF3B also interacts with RNF33, forming a heterotrimeric complex with KIF3A, although RNF33 does not associate with KAP3 (Huang2011Association). In the context of renal physiology, KIF3B interacts with CLC-5, facilitating its plasma membrane expression, endocytosis, and microtubular transport. This interaction is significant for receptor-mediated endocytosis and is implicated in the pathophysiology of Dent's disease (Reed2010CLC5).

The armadillo protein p0071 regulates the interaction between KIF3B and KAP3, stabilizing the kinesin-II complex and influencing vesicle transport. This interaction is crucial for the directional transport of cargos, such as CgA-positive vesicles, highlighting the importance of KIF3B in cellular transport mechanisms (Becher2017The).
