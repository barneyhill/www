# EEF2KMT

## Overview
The EEF2KMT gene encodes the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 lysine methyltransferase, a protein that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). This protein is categorized as a methyltransferase, which is responsible for the methylation of lysine residues on eEF2, a process essential for the regulation of protein synthesis. Methylation by EEF2KMT is critical for maintaining the proper function of eEF2, which is involved in the translocation step during protein elongation in translation. The activity of EEF2KMT has been implicated in various cellular processes and may have potential clinical significance in the context of diseases where protein synthesis is dysregulated (Qiu2020aarFDC).
