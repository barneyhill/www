# RFX8

## Overview
RFX8 is a gene that encodes the protein regulatory factor X8, a member of the RFX transcription factor family. This family is known for its role in regulating gene expression by binding to X-box DNA motifs. The RFX8 protein is characterized by its potential to exist in different variants, some of which may lack a DNA-binding domain (DBD), suggesting a possible function as a tissue-specific co-repressor. This characteristic is similar to that of small heterodimer partner (SHP) proteins. The gene is expressed at low levels across various tissues, with notable expression in Schwannoma cells, indicating a possible involvement in Schwann cell proliferation. Although the precise function of RFX8 in normal human physiology is not fully understood, it is hypothesized to play a role in developmental processes such as cell type specification and differentiation. The study of RFX8 is important for elucidating the complex regulatory mechanisms and tissue-specific functions of RFX transcription factors in human development and disease (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization).

## Function
RFX8, a member of the human RFX transcription factor family, is involved in regulating gene expression through its interaction with X-box DNA motifs. This transcription factor is characterized by its low expression levels across various tissues, with notable expression in Schwannoma cells, suggesting a potential role in Schwann cell proliferation (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization). RFX8 may encode protein variants with and without a DNA-binding domain (DBD), and the variant lacking a DBD might function as a tissue-specific co-repressor, similar to SHP proteins (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization).

The RFX8 gene is expressed at low levels in tissues such as the thymus and medial frontal gyrus, and its transcripts are categorized into two groups based on domain composition: those lacking the activating domain (AD) and those lacking the DBD (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization). The specific function of RFX8 in healthy human cells remains unclear, but it is suggested to play a role in developmental processes, including cell type specification and differentiation (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization). The study of RFX8 contributes to understanding the regulatory complexity and potential tissue-specific functions of RFX transcription factors in human development and disease (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization).
