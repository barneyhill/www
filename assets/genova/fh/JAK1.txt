# JAK1

## Overview
JAK1 (Janus kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which plays a pivotal role in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for transmitting signals from cytokine receptors to the cell nucleus, thereby regulating gene expression related to immune response, cell growth, and differentiation. The protein product of JAK1, Janus kinase 1, is involved in the signaling of various cytokine receptors, including those for interleukins and interferons, and is essential for normal hematopoiesis and immune function. JAK1's structure includes several domains, such as the FERM, SH2, and kinase domains, which facilitate its interaction with cytokine receptors and other signaling molecules. Mutations in the JAK1 gene have been linked to a range of diseases, including immunodeficiencies, autoimmune disorders, and certain cancers, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune regulation (Raivola2019Characterization; Ott2023JAKs).

## Structure
JAK1 (Janus kinase 1) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cytokine receptor signaling. Its molecular structure is characterized by several distinct domains. The primary structure of JAK1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of protein kinases (Williams2009Dissecting).

The tertiary structure of JAK1 reveals a complex three-dimensional conformation, with the protein containing a FERM domain, an SH2 domain, and a kinase domain. The FERM domain is composed of three subdomains: an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (F1), an acyl-coenzyme A binding-like domain (F2), and a pleckstrin-homology-like domain (F3) (Zhang2016Crystal; Ferrao2017The). The SH2 domain is similar to canonical SH2 domains, featuring a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices and a hydrophobic groove for binding specificity (Ferrao2017The).

In terms of quaternary structure, JAK1 interacts with cytokine receptors through its FERM and SH2 domains, forming a receptor-binding module (Ferrao2017The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a crucial role in JAK1 activation and function (Williams2009Dissecting). The pseudokinase domain (JH2) of JAK1, despite lacking key catalytic residues, can bind nucleotides and is involved in the regulation of the kinase domain (Babon2014The).

## Function
JAK1 (Janus kinase 1) is a critical component of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is essential for mediating the effects of cytokines and growth factors in healthy human cells. JAK1 is involved in the signaling of type I and type II cytokine receptors, including those for interleukins and interferons, playing a pivotal role in immune response regulation and hematopoiesis (Raivola2019Characterization; Zouein2011JAKs). 

In the cytoplasm, JAK1 is activated upon cytokine receptor engagement, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of STAT transcription factors. These activated STATs translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate gene expression related to cellular stress, proliferation, and differentiation (Zouein2011JAKs). JAK1 is indispensable for the activation of STAT proteins, particularly STAT1 and STAT2, which are crucial for transmitting signals from cytokine receptors to the cell nucleus (Raivola2019Characterization).

JAK1 also plays a significant role in hematopoietic stem cell function and stress hematopoiesis, integrating cytokine signals to regulate self-renewal and lineage commitment. It is essential for normal cytokine production and the maintenance of blood homeostasis, especially under stress conditions (Kleppe2017Jak1). The absence of JAK1 results in impaired signaling and biological responses, highlighting its non-redundant and obligatory roles in cytokine-induced biological processes (Rodig1998Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the JAK1 gene are associated with a variety of diseases and conditions. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in JAK1 can lead to primary immunodeficiency, characterized by recurrent mycobacterial infections and developmental delays. These mutations result in reduced phosphorylation of STAT proteins and impaired immune signaling, contributing to the immunodeficient phenotype (Eletto2016Biallelic). Gain-of-function mutations in JAK1 are linked to complex diseases involving autoinflammation, autoimmunity, and allergy, as well as conditions like hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and atopic dermatitis (Ott2023JAKs; Luo2021JAKSTAT).

JAK1 mutations are also implicated in various malignancies. Activating somatic mutations can lead to unregulated cell proliferation, resulting in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and cutaneous T cell leukemia (Ott2023JAKs; Luo2021JAKSTAT). Inactivating mutations are observed in solid organ malignancies and may facilitate tumor immune evasion (Luo2021JAKSTAT). Additionally, JAK1 mutations often occur alongside other genetic alterations, such as in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), where they are found with mutations in genes like NOTCH1, contributing to leukemic cell proliferation and survival (Ott2023JAKs; Springuel2015JAK).

## Interactions
JAK1 interacts with various proteins as part of its role in signal transduction pathways. It is involved in the IFN-γ-induced expression of ICAM-1 in lung epithelial cells, where it interacts with JAK2, PLCγ2, PKC, c-Src, and STAT1. JAK1 enhances ICAM-1 promoter activity, which is inhibited by a dominant-negative STAT1 mutant, indicating the involvement of the JAK1/STAT1 pathway. The interaction between c-Src and STAT1, crucial for STAT1 activation, is confirmed through immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Chang2004Differential).

JAK1 also interacts with phosphorylated insulin and IGF-1 receptors, requiring receptor phosphorylation for binding. The JH6-JH7 and JH1 domains of JAK1 are involved in this interaction, and JAK1 can phosphorylate IRS-1, suggesting a role in downstream signaling pathways (Gual1998Interaction).

In the context of cytokine signaling, JAK1 interacts with class II cytokine receptors, including IFNGR1, IFNAR2, and IFNLR1. The FERM and SH2 domains of JAK1 are essential for binding to these receptors, and mutations in the box1 and box2 motifs can disrupt JAK binding and signaling (Ferrao2016The).

JAK1 is also associated with the IFN-γ receptor (IFN-yR) prior to ligand binding, and it interacts with Jak2 post-ligand binding, playing a critical role in the initial stages of IFN-γ signal transduction (Igarashi1994Interferongamma).
