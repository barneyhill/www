# MED11

## Overview
MED11 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 11, which is a critical component of the Mediator complex, a multiprotein complex that functions as a transcriptional coactivator in all eukaryotes. The MED11 protein is specifically part of the head module of the Mediator complex, where it forms a heterodimer with Med22. This heterodimer is essential for the stabilization of the transcription initiation complex, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression. The structural integrity and function of the MED11 protein are crucial for normal cellular growth and transcriptional regulation, as it interacts with other components of the transcription machinery, including the C-terminal domain of Med17 and the Rad3 subunit of TFIIH (Seizl2011Mediator).

## Structure
The MED11 protein is a component of the Mediator complex, specifically forming a heterodimer with Med22. This heterodimer is part of the head module of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription initiation. The Med11/22 heterodimer forms an antiparallel four-helix bundle, a common structural motif that is essential for its function in stabilizing the transcription initiation complex (Seizl2011Mediator). The primary structure of Med11 was revised after discovering that the correct initiator methionine is at residue 17, making the protein smaller than previously thought (Seizl2011Mediator).

The tertiary structure of the Med11/22 complex was determined through crystallization, revealing a sphere-like arrangement of 12 heterodimers in the asymmetric unit (Seizl2011Mediator). The C-terminal extensions of Med11 and Med22, although not present in the crystallized structure, are predicted to contain additional helices connected through flexible linkers, which are crucial for normal cell growth (Seizl2011Mediator). The quaternary structure involves the interaction of the Med11/22 heterodimer with the Med17 C-terminal domain, forming a trimeric Med17/11/22 subcomplex that is essential for cellular growth and transcription regulation (Seizl2011Mediator).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MED11 is a component of the Mediator complex, specifically part of the head module, where it forms a stable heterodimer with Med22. This Med11/22 subcomplex is crucial for the stabilization of the transcription initiation complex. The Med11/22 complex interacts with the C-terminal domain of Med17, another subunit of the Mediator head module, which is essential for anchoring the Med11/22 bundle and maintaining the structural integrity of the complex (Seizl2011Mediator).

Mutations in Med11, such as med11-E17K/L24K, impair its interactions with Med22 and Med17, leading to defects in transcription initiation and gene expression changes. These mutations affect the interaction of Med11 with components of the pre-initiation complex, including TFIIK and RNA polymerase II, resulting in decreased promoter occupancy and transcriptional activity (Seizl2011Mediator).

The Med11 subunit also interacts with the Rad3 subunit of TFIIH, influencing promoter occupancy and CTD Ser5 phosphorylation, which are critical for transcription regulation (Seizl2011Mediator). These interactions highlight the role of MED11 in facilitating transcription through its participation in the Mediator complex and its interactions with other transcriptional machinery components.
