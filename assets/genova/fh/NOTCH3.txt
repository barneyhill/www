# NOTCH3

## Overview
The NOTCH3 gene encodes the notch receptor 3, a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for cell-cell communication and influences various cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. This receptor is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity and function. The NOTCH3 protein is characterized by its modular structure, including 34 epidermal growth factor-like repeats in its extracellular domain, which are vital for its stability and function. Mutations in the NOTCH3 gene are primarily associated with CADASIL, a hereditary vascular disorder, and have been implicated in various cancers and pulmonary hypertension, underscoring its clinical significance (Dichgans2000Small; Mosca2011NOTCH3; HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3).

## Structure
The NOTCH3 protein is a transmembrane receptor characterized by a modular structure that includes 34 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats in its extracellular domain (ECD) (Dichgans2000Small; HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3). These EGF repeats are crucial for the protein's function, forming beta-sheet-rich domains stabilized by conserved cysteine residues that create disulfide bonds (HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3). The EGF-like domains are essential for the protein's stability and function, and mutations in these regions are linked to CADASIL, a hereditary condition (Dichgans2000Small).

The primary structure of NOTCH3 includes a signal peptide, EGF repeats, a heterodimer region, and a PEST domain (HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a compact extracellular region, which is critical for ligand interactions and receptor activation (HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3). The quaternary structure is characterized by interactions with ligands of the Delta/Serrate/Lag2 (DSL) domain, which are necessary for its activation (HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3).

Post-translational modifications of NOTCH3 include glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage at specific sites (S1, S2, and S3), which are crucial for its activation and function (HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3). These modifications facilitate the release of the Notch intracellular domain (ICD), which translocates to the nucleus to activate gene transcription (HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3).

## Function
The NOTCH3 gene encodes a receptor protein that is integral to the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell-cell communication and influences various cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, NOTCH3 is predominantly active in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and plays a significant role in maintaining vascular integrity and function (Wang2008An).

NOTCH3 is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle differentiation and angiogenesis. It is expressed in mural cells, including smooth muscle cells and pericytes, and its expression is induced by the Notch ligand JAGGED1, which is expressed by endothelial cells. This interaction is part of an autoregulatory loop where NOTCH3 promotes its own expression and that of JAGGED1, maintaining vascular support cells in a differentiated phenotype essential for blood vessel stability and function (Liu2009NOTCH3).

In the context of vascular development, NOTCH3 is crucial for the differentiation and maturation of VSMCs, promoting their proliferation and protecting against apoptosis. It also influences arterial differentiation and the maturation of VSMCs, contributing to the structural and functional integrity of arterial vessels (HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3; Domenga2004Notch3). NOTCH3's role extends to the regulation of vascular tone and adaptation to mechanical stress, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal vascular function (HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NOTCH3 gene are primarily associated with CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), a hereditary vascular disorder characterized by recurrent strokes and dementia. CADASIL is caused by mutations that typically alter cysteine residues in the epidermal growth factor-like repeats of the NOTCH3 receptor, leading to an uneven number of cysteine residues and resulting in the accumulation of granular osmiophilic material and degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (Rutten2014Interpretation; Mosca2011NOTCH3; Joutel2000The). These mutations impair the clearance of the NOTCH3 ectodomain from the cell surface, contributing to cerebrovascular dysfunction (Joutel2000The).

In addition to CADASIL, alterations in NOTCH3 expression levels are implicated in various cancers, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. In these conditions, NOTCH3 is often overexpressed, leading to increased tumor growth and survival (HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3). Furthermore, NOTCH3 mutations have been linked to pulmonary hypertension, where increased expression in vascular smooth muscle cells drives cell proliferation and contributes to disease pathology (HosseiniAlghaderi2020Notch3). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of NOTCH3 mutations and expression alterations.

## Interactions
NOTCH3 interacts with various proteins that influence its signaling and function. In ovarian cancer, NOTCH3 interacts with WWP2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which acts as a negative regulator by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of NOTCH3. This interaction primarily occurs in the cytoplasm and is crucial for modulating NOTCH3 signaling, affecting cell proliferation and tumor growth (Jung2014Notch3). 

In T-cell development and lymphomagenesis, NOTCH3 interacts with the hematopoietic nuclear factor IK and the RNA-binding protein HuD. This interaction modulates the splicing and stability of IK mRNAs, influencing T-cell differentiation and tumorigenesis (Bellavia2007Notch3). 

NOTCH3 is also regulated by microRNAs such as miR-206 and miR-1, which down-regulate its expression, promoting myogenic differentiation and acting as tumor suppressors in cancer (Bellavia2018The). 

Additionally, NOTCH3 interacts with ligands like Jagged1, which can enhance NOTCH3 signaling through its intracellular domain, contributing to oncogenic processes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Bellavia2018The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network surrounding NOTCH3, with significant implications for cancer therapy.
