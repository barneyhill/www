# ANAPC10

## Overview
ANAPC10 is a gene that encodes the anaphase-promoting complex subunit 10, a crucial component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C is a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thereby facilitating the transition from metaphase to anaphase during cell division. ANAPC10 is integral to the catalytic core of the APC/C, contributing to substrate binding and recruitment, and is regulated by co-activators such as Cdc20 and Cdh1, which determine substrate specificity (Ray2012Experimental; Zhou2016Insights). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, supporting cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its function is essential for proper mitosis and meiosis, impacting processes such as cell division, differentiation, and genomic stability (Ray2012Experimental; Zhou2016Insights).

## Function
ANAPC10 is a critical component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a vital role in cell cycle regulation. The APC/C complex is responsible for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of key regulatory proteins, facilitating the transition from metaphase to anaphase during cell division. This process ensures proper chromosome segregation and mitotic exit, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability (Ray2012Experimental; Zhou2016Insights).

ANAPC10 is part of the catalytic core of the APC/C complex, which includes other subunits such as APC2 and APC11. It is involved in substrate binding and recruitment, contributing to the ubiquitination of target proteins (Zhou2016Insights). The activity of the APC/C complex, and thus ANAPC10, is regulated by co-activators like Cdc20 and Cdh1, which help select specific substrates for degradation (Manchado2010The).

In healthy human cells, ANAPC10 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it supports cell cycle progression and helps maintain cellular homeostasis. Its function is crucial for the proper execution of mitosis and meiosis, impacting processes such as cell division, differentiation, and genomic stability (Ray2012Experimental; Zhou2016Insights).

## Clinical Significance
ANAPC10, a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation. Alterations in ANAPC10 expression or function have been implicated in cancer progression. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), disruption of the APC/C, including components like ANAPC10, has been associated with resistance to TTK inhibitors. This resistance is linked to the APC/C's role in mitotic progression, suggesting that changes in ANAPC10 may contribute to therapeutic resistance in TNBC (Thu2018Disruption).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ANAPC10 is involved in alternative splicing events regulated by the splicing factor PHF5A. Knockdown of PHF5A, which affects ANAPC10 splicing, leads to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating that ANAPC10's splicing and expression levels may influence cancer cell behavior and progression (Mao2019PHD).

Additionally, genetic studies have identified ANAPC10 in a genomic region with rare genetic variations, suggesting potential positive selection. However, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with ANAPC10 mutations or expression changes are not detailed, indicating a need for further research to clarify its clinical significance (Crawford2009An).

## Interactions
ANAPC10 is a core component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation by targeting specific proteins for degradation. ANAPC10 interacts with co-activators such as CDC20 and CDH1/FZR1, which are essential for the activation and substrate specificity of the APC/C complex. These interactions facilitate the recognition and ubiquitination of substrates containing D-box motifs, leading to their subsequent degradation (Saito2020Sox21; Ray2012Experimental).

ANAPC10 also forms a substrate recognition module with FZR1 or CDC20, which is crucial for the degradation of mitotic regulators like cyclin B and securin, thereby regulating the exit from mitosis (Saito2020Sox21). In the context of dental epithelium, ANAPC10 interacts with Smad3 to trigger the ubiquitination of NEDD9/HEF1, a positive regulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting a role in preventing EMT through its regulatory interactions (Saito2020Sox21).

Additionally, ANAPC10 directly binds to Sox2 with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2C, regulating Sox2 stability, which further underscores its role in maintaining cellular differentiation and preventing EMT in dental tissues (Saito2020Sox21).
