# NDUFB6

## Overview
NDUFB6 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B6, an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is a single transmembrane helix subunit that plays a critical role in the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, contributing to ATP production and cellular energy metabolism. NDUFB6 is involved in the assembly and structural integrity of complex I, interacting with various subunits to facilitate the biogenesis and function of the complex. The gene's expression is regulated by DNA methylation and is subject to alterations in conditions such as aging and type 2 diabetes mellitus, where it impacts mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity (Padavannil2022The; Dieteren2011Defective; Pesta2021NDUFB6).

## Structure
NDUFB6 is a single transmembrane helix (TMH) subunit of mitochondrial complex I, characterized by a structurally conserved architecture across eukaryotes despite low sequence conservation. It features an N-terminal matrix domain with an α-helix (α1 B6) that contributes to the matrix P D-bulge, a highly tilted TMH that is partially disordered in mammals, indicating a degree of flexibility. The C-terminal region extends into the intermembrane space (IMS) as a coil (Padavannil2022The).

In the context of complex I assembly, NDUFB6 initially associates with the P D-a′ subassembly and subsequently integrates into the P D-a subassembly. In the mature complex, it interacts with subunits such as NDUFAB1-β, NDUFB9, and NDUFB5, forming part of the matrix P D-bulge. The matrix side of the NDUFB6 TMH is notably disordered in mammals, with only the IMS half displaying clearly defined density, suggesting unique flexibility not observed in other TMHs (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFB6 does not directly interact with ND4 but facilitates interactions through the P D-bulge and P D-a′ subassembly subunits. Its expression is regulated by DNA methylation, which is altered in elderly patients and decreased in muscle cells of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (Padavannil2022The).

## Function
NDUFB6 is an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. In healthy human cells, NDUFB6 is integral to the assembly and function of complex I. It is involved in the subunit-by-subunit assembly of the membrane arm of the holo complex, joining with mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits at a relatively late stage to form the mature membrane arm (Dieteren2011Defective). NDUFB6 is part of the P D-a subassembly and interacts with subunits in the P D-b subassembly, acting as a bridge during complex I biogenesis (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFB6 is a single transmembrane helix subunit, with its matrix side being disordered, indicating flexibility. This flexibility is unique among the subunits and is essential for the proper assembly and function of complex I (Padavannil2022The). The protein is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to the structural integrity and assembly of complex I, ensuring efficient electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, which is vital for ATP production and cellular energy metabolism (Dieteren2011Defective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the NDUFB6 gene, which encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, have been implicated in various metabolic and mitochondrial disorders. In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in NDUFB6, specifically rs540467, has been associated with variations in insulin sensitivity and metabolic responses to physical activity. Individuals with the G/G genotype of this SNP tend to exhibit improved insulin sensitivity and muscle ATP synthase flux in response to exercise, while carriers of the A allele may not experience these benefits, indicating a potential genetic influence on exercise responsiveness (Pesta2021NDUFB6).

Reduced expression of NDUFB6 in myotubes has been shown to decrease mitochondrial respiration, particularly complex I-linked respiration, and impair insulin signaling. This reduction in expression can lead to decreased mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity, contributing to the metabolic changes observed in T2D (Pesta2021NDUFB6). The study also suggests that a higher dose of physical activity might be necessary to overcome non-response in individuals with certain NDUFB6 genotypes, highlighting the gene's role in modulating exercise effects on metabolic endpoints (Pesta2021NDUFB6).

## Interactions
NDUFB6 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and plays a crucial role in its assembly and function. It interacts with several other subunits within complex I, including NDUFAB1-β, NDUFB9, and NDUFB5, as part of the matrix P D -bulge, which is important for the stability and assembly of the complex (Padavannil2022The). NDUFB6 also interacts with ND5, NDUFB10, and NDUFB7, forming a boundary of a lipid-filled cavity at the interface between ND4 and ND5, which is essential for the full assembly and activity of complex I (Padavannil2022The).

In the context of mitochondrial dysfunction related to rheumatoid arthritis, NDUFB6 is identified as a hub protein within a protein-protein interaction network, connected to 33 other proteins. This highlights its significant role in maintaining network stability and function (Panga2019Mitochondrial). Additionally, NDUFB6 is involved in bridging the P D -a and P D -b subassemblies during complex I biogenesis, although it does not directly interact with ND4 (Padavannil2022The). These interactions underscore the importance of NDUFB6 in the structural integrity and functional dynamics of mitochondrial complex I.
