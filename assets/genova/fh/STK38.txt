# STK38

## Overview
STK38 is a gene that encodes the serine/threonine kinase 38, a member of the NDR kinase family, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by STK38 is involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and autophagy, functioning both in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fukasawa2023The; Martin2020The). As a kinase, it phosphorylates target proteins, influencing their activity and stability, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating inflammatory responses (Qin2020STK38; Wen2015Stk38). STK38's interactions with other proteins, such as E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 and MEKK2, further underscore its role in modulating signaling pathways related to inflammation and cellular stress responses (Wen2015Stk38). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various cancers and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Liu2022Prognostic; Wen2015Stk38).

## Structure


## Function
STK38, also known as serine/threonine kinase 38, is a crucial component in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly by influencing the levels of proteins such as c-myc and p21/Cip1, and interacting with Cyclin D1 to enhance its kinase activity, which is essential for the G1/S transition (Martin2020The). STK38 is also involved in the DNA damage response, where it phosphorylates CDC25A, leading to its degradation and activation of the G2/M checkpoint (Fukasawa2023The). 

In the context of DNA repair, STK38 interacts with the nucleotide excision repair factor XPA and is involved in homologous recombination-dependent DNA repair, maintaining genomic stability (Fukasawa2023The). It also acts as a reader of ufmylated histone H4, promoting ATM activation, which is crucial for the DNA damage signaling cascade (Qin2020STK38).

STK38 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it regulates autophagy by supporting the interaction of Exo84 with Beclin1 and RalB, necessary for autophagosome formation (Fukasawa2023The). It also plays a role in inhibiting TLR9-mediated inflammatory responses by promoting the ubiquitination of MEKK2, thus acting as a negative regulator of inflammation (Wen2015Stk38).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the STK38 gene have been implicated in various cancers. STK38 is involved in both tumor suppression and oncogenic processes, with its expression levels varying across different cancer types. High expression of STK38 is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as brain lower grade glioma, gastric cancer, and liver cancer, while low expression correlates with poorer outcomes in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and rectum adenocarcinoma (Liu2022Prognostic). 

STK38 also plays a role in the immune response and tumor microenvironment, influencing immune cell infiltration and cancer-associated fibroblasts, which can affect tumor progression and metastasis (Liu2022Prognostic). In colorectal cancer, STK38 interacts with NLRP12 to regulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, impacting tumorigenesis (Khan2023NLRP12). 

In addition to cancer, STK38 is involved in inflammatory responses. It acts as a negative regulator of TLR9-mediated inflammation, and its deficiency can lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to conditions like sepsis (Wen2015Stk38). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
STK38, also known as NDR1, is a serine/threonine kinase that participates in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, enhancing Smurf1's activity to ubiquitinate MEKK2, thereby negatively regulating TLR9-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages (Wen2015Stk38). STK38 also directly interacts with MEKK2, inhibiting its signaling pathway, which is crucial for TLR9-mediated ERK1/2 activation and proinflammatory cytokine production (Wen2015Stk38).

STK38 is involved in the DNA damage response by recognizing ufmylated histone H4, facilitating the recruitment of SUV39H1 to DNA double-strand breaks, and promoting ATM activation (Qin2020STK38). It interacts with proteins such as hMOB1, which regulates its kinase activity, and GSK3β, potentially inhibiting its kinase activity to affect β-catenin degradation (Khan2023NLRP12; Martin2020The).

STK38 also interacts with the nuclear export protein XPO1, phosphorylating it at serine 1055, which is crucial for the nuclear export of cargo proteins involved in autophagy and cell density responses (Martin2020The). These interactions highlight STK38's role in regulating various cellular signaling pathways and processes.
