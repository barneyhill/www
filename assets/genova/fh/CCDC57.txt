# CCDC57

## Overview
CCDC57 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 57, which is characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil domain. This structural motif is known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. The CCDC57 protein is primarily involved in the centrosome, an organelle essential for cell division and organization, where it acts as a scaffold to recruit other proteins, such as kinases and phosphatases, forming a signaling hub necessary for multicellular development (Kuhn2014CoiledCoil). Additionally, CCDC57 contributes to the organization of the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton, forming structural networks that are vital for maintaining cell integrity and function (Rose2004Scaffolds). While the precise molecular functions of CCDC57 are still being elucidated, its role in cellular architecture underscores its importance in cellular mechanics and regulation (Burkhard2001Coiled).

## Function
CCDC57 is a protein characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions and is involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CCDC57 plays a significant role in the centrosome, an organelle crucial for cell division and organization. Coiled-coil proteins like CCDC57 act as scaffolds within the centrosome, recruiting other proteins such as kinases and phosphatases, thereby forming a signaling hub essential for multicellular development (Kuhn2014CoiledCoil). This recruitment is vital for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the centrosome, particularly in the context of the pericentriolar material (PCM), which is a more recent evolutionary development compared to the basal body (Kuhn2014CoiledCoil).

CCDC57 is also implicated in the organization of the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton, forming structures such as cables and networks that are crucial for maintaining cell structure (Rose2004Scaffolds). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular mechanics and regulation, contributing to the stability and function of cells. The specific molecular functions and cellular roles of CCDC57 are still under investigation, but it is thought to contribute significantly to maintaining cellular architecture and function (Burkhard2001Coiled).
