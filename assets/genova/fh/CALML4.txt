# CALML4

## Overview
CALML4, or calmodulin-like 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the calmodulin superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of EF-hand motifs. These motifs are helix-loop-helix structures that typically bind calcium ions, although some EF-hands in CALML4 may be nonfunctional in this regard (Choi2020The). The protein encoded by CALML4 functions as a myosin light chain and is integral to the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) in enterocytes, playing a crucial role in the assembly and function of the brush border, a structure that enhances nutrient absorption in the intestinal tract (Choi2020The). CALML4 interacts with myosin motor proteins, particularly Myo7b and Myo7a, stabilizing their α-helical neck regions and facilitating their function as rigid lever arms during force production (Choi2020The). The gene is also implicated in sensory functions, with potential involvement in Usher Syndrome Type I, a condition characterized by deaf-blindness, due to its expression in hair cell epithelia and association with Myo7a (Choi2020The).

## Structure
The CALML4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the calmodulin superfamily, characterized by the presence of EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures capable of coordinating calcium ions. However, some EF-hands in CALML4 may be nonfunctional and do not bind calcium (Choi2020The). The longest isoform of CALML4, known as transcript variant 1, is 196 amino acids in length and shares approximately 45% sequence identity with conventional calmodulin. This isoform features an extended N-terminus followed by two globular EF hand-based lobes, the N-lobe and C-lobe, typical of calmodulin-like proteins (Choi2020The).

CALML4 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing. The 'long' isoform (CALML4-L) includes the N-terminal extension, while the 'short' isoform (CALML4-S) lacks this extension and is the dominant form in the human intestinal tract (Choi2020The). Structurally, CALML4 functions as a myosin light chain, associating with the neck region of Myo7b, which suggests a role in stabilizing the α-helical myosin neck region, allowing it to act as a rigid lever arm during force production (Choi2020The). The protein's role in the intermicrovillar adhesion complex and potential involvement in Usher Syndrome Type I are also noted (Choi2020The).

## Function
CALML4 (calmodulin-like 4) is a small EF-hand protein that functions as a critical myosin light chain within the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) in enterocytes, which are cells lining the intestinal tract. It plays a vital role in the assembly and function of the brush border (BB), a structure composed of microvilli that increases the surface area for nutrient absorption. CALML4 is enriched at the distal tips of microvilli, where it interacts with Myo7b, a myosin motor protein, stabilizing its α-helical neck region and allowing it to function as a rigid lever arm during force production (Choi2020The).

The presence of CALML4 is essential for the proper targeting and clustering of microvilli, as its absence leads to defects in BB assembly and mistargeting of other IMAC components such as CDHR2, USH1C, Myo7b, and ANKS4B (Choi2020The). CALML4 is also implicated in neurosensory functions, as it is highly expressed in hair cell epithelia, particularly in stereocilia, and is associated with Myo7a, suggesting a role in the inner ear (Choi2020The). The gene is a candidate for USH1H, a variant of Usher Syndrome, characterized by deaf-blindness, indicating its potential involvement in sensory functions (Choi2020The).

## Clinical Significance
The CALML4 gene has been implicated in Usher Syndrome Type I (USH1), a condition characterized by deaf-blindness. It is considered a candidate gene for the USH1H variant due to its high expression in hair cell epithelia and its association with Myo7a, a protein linked to USH1. Mutations in CALML4 could lead to neurosensory deficits and possibly gut problems, as observed in some USH1 patients (Choi2020The). The study suggests that CALML4 might be the second component shared between the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) and the Usher complex, which could explain some symptoms observed in USH1 patients (Choi2020The).

While the clinical significance of CALML4 gene mutations is not directly addressed in the study, its role in the IMAC and its interaction with myosin proteins, specifically Myo7b and Myo7a, suggest potential implications in both gut and inner ear biology (Choi2020The). The absence of CALML4 leads to disrupted microvillar clustering, similar to the effects seen with the loss of other IMAC components, indicating its importance in cellular structures critical for intestinal function (Choi2020The). Further research is needed to confirm the clinical significance of CALML4 mutations.

## Interactions
CALML4, a member of the calmodulin superfamily, is involved in several protein interactions within the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC). It functions as a critical myosin light chain, particularly interacting with the myosin motor proteins Myo7b and Myo7a. CALML4 binds robustly to the neck region of Myo7b, independent of calcium presence, suggesting it acts as a light chain for this myosin, stabilizing its α-helical structure and potentially regulating its activity (Choi2020The). This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of CALML4 to the brush border of enterocytes, as CALML4 fails to accumulate in the brush border in Myo7b knockdown or knockout models (Choi2020The).

CALML4 also interacts with Myo7a, indicating a potential role as a light chain in stereocilia, which may link it to sensory functions in the inner ear (Choi2020The). CALML4's presence in the IMAC is essential for the proper targeting of other components, such as CDHR2, USH1C, and ANKS4B, to the tips of brush border microvilli, highlighting its role in microvillar clustering and brush border assembly (Choi2020The).
