# DNAAF6

## Overview
DNAAF6, or dynein axonemal assembly factor 6, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the assembly of dynein arms, which are essential components of motile cilia and flagella in human cells. The protein, also known as PIH1D3, is characterized by the presence of a PIH1 domain and a CS domain, which facilitate its interaction with molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90. These interactions are vital for the pre-assembly of axonemal dyneins in the cytoplasm, a process necessary for the proper function of cilia and flagella (Smith2022The; Fabczak2019Role). DNAAF6 plays a significant role in maintaining ciliary motility, and mutations in this gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder that results in impaired ciliary function and associated clinical symptoms (Graziani2024Genetic; Legendre2021Motile). The gene's function is conserved across species, underscoring its importance in cellular motility and related physiological processes (Lennon2022Strongly).

## Structure
The DNAAF6 protein, also known as PIH1D3, is characterized by the presence of a PIH1 domain in its N-terminal fragment and a CS domain at its C-terminus (Fabczak2019Role). These domains suggest that DNAAF6 can form complexes with other proteins, potentially interacting with molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 (Smith2022The; Fabczak2019Role). The PIH domains are involved in recruiting client proteins, which is crucial for the assembly of outer dynein arms (ODAs) and a subset of inner dynein arms (IDAs) (Lennon2022Strongly).

In terms of quaternary structure, DNAAF6 is proposed to form a co-chaperone complex with DNAAF4, which may be involved in the folding or interaction of dynein chains (Smith2022The). This complex is part of an R2TP-like co-chaperone system that plays a role in the pre-assembly of dynein motors in the cytoplasm (Lennon2022Strongly). The interaction with Hsp70 and Hsp90 is crucial for the stabilization and assembly of dynein arms, although specific details on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of DNAAF6 are not provided in the available literature (Smith2022The).

## Function
DNAAF6, also known as PIH1D3, is a crucial component in the assembly of dynein arms, which are essential for the motility of cilia and flagella in human cells. This gene is involved in the cytoplasmic preassembly of axonemal dyneins, which are motor protein complexes that are pre-assembled in the cytoplasm before being transported to the growing axonemes by the intraflagellar transport machinery (Aprea2021Defects). DNAAF6 contains a PIH1 domain at its N-terminal fragment and a CS domain at its C-terminus, and it can form complexes with chaperone proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90, which assist in the folding and stabilization of dynein chains (Smith2022The; Fabczak2019Role).

In healthy human cells, DNAAF6 plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of motile cilia by ensuring the proper assembly of dynein arm complexes. This process is vital for various physiological functions, including respiratory function and sperm motility (Aprea2021Defects). Mutations in DNAAF6 can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia, characterized by defects in both outer and inner dynein arms, resulting in impaired ciliary function (Fabczak2019Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAAF6 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function. PCD is an autosomal recessive condition that results in immotile cilia, leading to respiratory issues, chronic infections, and infertility due to defective dynein arm assembly (Graziani2024Genetic; Legendre2021Motile). DNAAF6 is involved in the pre-assembly of dynein motors in the cytoplasm, which are essential for proper ciliary movement. Mutations in DNAAF6 can disrupt this process, impairing the structure and function of the axoneme, the core of cilia, and leading to PCD (Legendre2021Motile; Lennon2022Strongly).

In Drosophila models, knockdown of Dnaaf6 results in immotile sperm and impaired sensory neuron function, indicating its crucial role in fertility and sensory perception (Lennon2022Strongly). These findings suggest that DNAAF6 mutations can lead to a loss of dynein-driven motility in ciliated cells, contributing to the clinical manifestations of PCD (Lennon2022Strongly). The gene's role in dynein assembly is conserved across species, highlighting its importance in maintaining ciliary function (Lennon2022Strongly).

## Interactions
DNAAF6, also known as dynein axonemal assembly factor 6, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for the assembly of dynein arms, which are essential for ciliary motility. DNAAF6 interacts with proteins such as DNAI2, HSP70, and HSP90, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Mutations in the CS domain of DNAAF6 can disrupt its interaction with DNAI2, highlighting the importance of this interaction in its function (Smith2022The).

DNAAF6 is proposed to form a co-chaperone complex with DNAAF4 (DYX1C1), HSP70, and HSP90, which is involved in the folding or interaction of dynein chains. This complex is thought to stabilize the dynein intermediate chain (DIC) complex and assist in the folding of dynein heavy chains (DHCs) (Smith2022The). In Drosophila, DNAAF6 forms an R2TP-like complex with DNAAF4, Pontin, and Reptin, although it does not interact with HSP90 due to the absence of a TPR domain in Drosophila DNAAF4 (Lennon2022Strongly).

These interactions suggest that DNAAF6 plays a significant role in the assembly and stabilization of dynein arms, with its interactions varying across different species (Smith2022The; Lennon2022Strongly).
