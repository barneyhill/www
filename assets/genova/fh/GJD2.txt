# GJD2

## Overview
The GJD2 gene encodes the gap junction protein delta 2, commonly known as connexin 36 (Cx36), which is a transmembrane protein integral to the formation of gap junction channels in neurons and pancreatic β-cells. These channels facilitate direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules, playing a critical role in neuronal synchronization and insulin secretion. Cx36 is predominantly expressed in the brain and retina, where it contributes to electrical synapses essential for cognitive functions and visual processing. In pancreatic β-cells, Cx36 is crucial for glucose-stimulated insulin release, with its expression regulated by transcription factors such as Beta2/NeuroD1. Mutations in the GJD2 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including myopia, type 2 diabetes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, underscoring its significance in both ocular and neurological health (Shilkina2019Association; Lee2023CryoEM; Cigliola2016A).

## Structure
The GJD2 gene encodes the gap junction protein delta 2, also known as connexin 36 (Cx36), which is integral to forming neuronal gap junction channels. The primary structure of Cx36 includes four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, one intracellular loop, and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini (Lee2023CryoEM). The secondary structure features an α-to-π helix transition in the TM1 region, which is significant for the conformational changes between the open and closed states of the channel (Lee2023CryoEM).

The tertiary structure of Cx36 reveals unique features, such as a longer NTH-TM1 loop due to an Ala14 insertion, which affects the NTH conformation and creates a hydrophobic pocket filled by acyl chains (Lee2023CryoEM). The quaternary structure of Cx36 is dodecameric, similar to other connexins like Cx26 and Cx46/50, with hemichannel docking through extracellular loops (Lee2023CryoEM).

Cx36 exhibits strong cation selectivity due to its acidic pore surface, with specific acidic residues contributing to this property (Lee2023CryoEM). The protein's conformational flexibility is influenced by lipids, which may dynamically move into and out of the channel, affecting its open or closed state (Lee2023CryoEM). The N-terminal domain plays a crucial role in channel gating and voltage sensitivity, with specific amino acid positions being critical for these properties (Jagielnicki2024Connexin).

## Function
The GJD2 gene encodes connexin 36 (Cx36), a protein that forms gap junction channels crucial for intercellular communication in neurons and pancreatic β-cells. In neurons, Cx36 is predominantly expressed in the brain and retina, where it facilitates electrical synapses by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. This function is essential for neuronal synchronization and visual processing, contributing to cognitive functions such as memory consolidation and playing a role in conditions like epileptogenesis (Lee2023CryoEM).

In pancreatic β-cells, Cx36 is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion. It forms gap junctions that enable the coupling of β-cells, which is vital for glucose-stimulated insulin release and maintaining blood glucose levels. The absence or alteration of Cx36 can impair insulin release, leading to glucose intolerance, a condition observed in type 2 diabetes (Cigliola2016A). The expression of Cx36 in β-cells is regulated by transcription factors such as Beta2/NeuroD1, which bind to the promoter region of the GJD2 gene, ensuring its expression during critical stages of pancreas development (Nlend2012Cx36). This regulation is crucial for the differentiation and function of insulin-producing β-cells (Nlend2012Cx36).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GJD2 gene, which encodes the protein connexin 36, have been implicated in several clinical conditions. One notable condition associated with GJD2 is myopia, a common refractive error. Studies using zebrafish models have shown that depletion of gjd2a and gjd2b, orthologs of the human GJD2 gene, leads to changes in eye biometry and refractive status, suggesting a role in ocular growth and refractive error development (Quint2021Loss). 

In addition to ocular conditions, GJD2 has been linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D). A specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the GJD2 gene, rs3743123, has been associated with altered function of insulin-producing β-cells, potentially contributing to T2D pathogenesis (Cigliola2016A). This SNP affects the formation of gap junction plaques and cell coupling, leading to reduced β-cell survival and hyperglycemia (Cigliola2016A).

GJD2 is also associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). The rs3743123 polymorphism in the GJD2 gene has been linked to an increased risk of developing JME, particularly in individuals of European descent (Shilkina2019Association). This association highlights the gene's role in neurological disorders, likely due to its involvement in neuronal gap junctions and electrical synapse regulation.

## Interactions
GJD2, also known as connexin36 (Cx36), participates in several interactions that are crucial for its function in neuronal gap junctions. Calmodulin binds to Cx36, influencing its role in electrical synapses. This interaction is calcium-dependent and can lead to the uncoupling of gap junctions at high intracellular calcium levels. However, Cx36 has specialized calmodulin binding sites that make it less sensitive to calcium fluctuations, allowing it to maintain synaptic function under varying conditions (Aseervatham2020Calmodulin).

Cx36 is also regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which phosphorylates Cx36 and modulates its functional plasticity. The binding sites for calmodulin and CaMKII overlap, suggesting a regulatory mechanism where calmodulin might influence CaMKII interactions. However, experiments indicate that the absence of calmodulin binding does not affect CaMKII-induced potentiation of coupling (Aseervatham2020Calmodulin).

Additionally, tubulin interacts with Cx36 at a site overlapping with the calmodulin binding site. This interaction is significant for the regulation of gap junction plaque size, as mutations in this region can alter the size of the gap junctions (Aseervatham2020Calmodulin). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing Cx36 function in neuronal communication.
