# TRPV2

## Overview
TRPV2 is a gene that encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2, a non-selective cation channel protein. This protein is part of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family, specifically the vanilloid subfamily, and is characterized by its six transmembrane domains and ankyrin repeat domains (McCleverty2006Crystal; Huynh2016Structure). TRPV2 plays a crucial role in mediating calcium influx across cellular membranes, influencing various physiological processes such as mechanoelectric coupling in cardiac cells, immune responses, and endothelial cell function in the brain (Luo2019Cannabidiol; EntinMeer2020Potential). The protein's activity is modulated by factors like phosphorylation and interactions with lipids and small molecules, including cannabinoids (Kärki2021TRPV; Protopopova2020TRPV2). Clinically, TRPV2 is implicated in conditions such as muscular dystrophy, cardiac hypertrophy, and various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2022PanCancer; Iwata2008Dominantnegative).

## Structure
The TRPV2 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family, specifically the vanilloid subfamily. It is characterized by six transmembrane helices, with a pore region located between the fifth and sixth domains (Huynh2016Structure). The protein forms homotetrameric structures, contributing to its quaternary structure (McCleverty2006Crystal).

The N-terminal region of TRPV2 contains ankyrin repeat domains (ARDs), which are involved in protein-protein interactions and regulatory functions. These ARDs are composed of six repeats, each defined by two antiparallel helices followed by a loop region linking to a beta-hairpin structure. The ARDs exhibit unique structural features, including larger insertions in the ankyrin repeats, resulting in a kinked structure that disrupts regular repeat stacking (McCleverty2006Crystal).

TRPV2's structure also includes intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in the N- and C-terminal regions, which are flexible and play a role in mediating protein-protein interactions (Sanganna2023Intrinsically). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common and can affect the channel's activity (Huynh2016Structure). The protein's structure is further modulated by interactions with lipids and small molecules, which can influence its gating and activation states (Protopopova2020TRPV2).

## Function
TRPV2 is a non-selective cation channel that plays a significant role in various cellular processes by mediating calcium influx. It is primarily localized in intracellular membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, and is also found at intercalated discs in cardiac cells, where it is crucial for mechanoelectric coupling and maintaining cardiac structure (Katanosaka2014TRPV2; EntinMeer2020Potential). In cardiomyocytes, TRPV2 responds to mechanical stretching, facilitating calcium influx necessary for synchronized contractility and structural integrity (Kärki2021TRPV; EntinMeer2020Potential).

TRPV2 is also involved in the immune response, being expressed in various immune cells, including macrophages and T lymphocytes. It plays a role in phagocytosis, cytokine release, and inflammation, contributing to innate immunity (EntinMeer2020Potential). In the brain, TRPV2 is highly expressed in endothelial cells, where it regulates intracellular calcium levels, influencing cell proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis, particularly in response to cannabidiol (Luo2019Cannabidiol).

The channel's activity is modulated by factors such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphorylation, and it can be activated by cannabinoids and probenecid (Kärki2021TRPV; EntinMeer2020Potential). TRPV2's mechanosensitive properties are essential for its function in tissues under mechanical stress, such as cardiac and skeletal muscle (Kärki2021TRPV).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TRPV2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In muscular dystrophy, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), TRPV2 is overexpressed and mislocalized in cardiac cells, contributing to abnormal calcium signaling and muscle damage. Inhibition of TRPV2 has been shown to ameliorate muscle degeneration in animal models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lorin2015Dystrophic; Iwata2008Dominantnegative).

In the context of cardiac conditions, TRPV2 is involved in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Its increased expression is linked to muscle degeneration and heart failure, with elevated levels observed in patients with these conditions. TRPV2's role in calcium influx and its association with reactive oxygen species production contribute to cardiac dysfunction (Iwata2020TRPV2; Koch2017Transient).

TRPV2 is also associated with various cancers. It is overexpressed in metastatic stages of prostate cancer, liver cancer, and bladder cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic marker. In glioma, TRPV2 expression negatively controls cell survival and proliferation, indicating its complex role in cancer progression (Wang2022PanCancer; Lehen’kyi2012TRPV2).

## Interactions
TRPV2 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of TRPV2 are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions. These IDRs extend from the N- and C-termini of the protein and are characterized by high disorder propensity and hydrophilicity. They are not embedded in the membrane but extend into the bulk, potentially interacting with other proteins, contributing to the formation of multiprotein complexes by extending the protein's interaction surface (Sanganna2023Intrinsically).

TRPV2 forms a physiological complex with the RGA protein, which promotes its cell surface expression. This interaction occurs intracellularly, with RGA associating with an unglycosylated form of TRPV2 during its biosynthesis and trafficking. RGA does not reach the cell surface but enhances the surface localization of TRPV2, suggesting a role in its trafficking pathway (Stokes2004Formation).

Flotillin-1, a lipid raft-associated protein, also interacts with TRPV2, enhancing its surface expression and whole-cell current density. The SPFH domain of flotillin-1 interacts with the N-terminus and transmembrane domains 1-4 of TRPV2, forming a functional complex on the cell membrane (Hu2021Flotillin1).
