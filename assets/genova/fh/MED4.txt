# MED4

## Overview
MED4 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 4, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The MED4 protein is categorized as a structural subunit within the Middle module of the Mediator complex, where it forms a heterodimer with MED9, contributing to the structural integrity and functional dynamics of the complex (Larivière2013Model). This protein is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotic species, indicating its fundamental role in transcriptional regulation (Tsai2014Subunit). MED4's interactions with other subunits, such as Med7 and Med21, are essential for maintaining the Mediator's architecture and facilitating its role in gene expression (Robinson2024Molecular). The gene's dysregulation or mutation can have significant implications for cellular processes, potentially leading to diseases such as cancer, underscoring the importance of MED4 in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Robinson2024Molecular).

## Structure
The MED4 protein is a component of the Middle module of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. Structurally, MED4 forms a heterodimer with MED9, characterized by a four-helix bundle fold, similar to other heterodimers in the Middle module such as Med7C/Med21 (Larivière2013Model). This structural motif is essential for the integrity and function of the Middle module, providing a scaffold for interactions with other subunits (Robinson2024Molecular).

In terms of secondary structure, MED4 shares significant homology across different species, including yeast, humans, and Arabidopsis, particularly in regions that interact with Med7 and Med21 (Mathur2011The). The tertiary structure of MED4 is modeled as part of a rigid body within the Mediator complex, constrained by available crystallographic structures and comparative models (Robinson2024Molecular).

The quaternary structure of MED4 involves its integration into the Med7-Med21-Med4-Med9 tetramer, which forms the core of the Middle module, highlighting its role in maintaining the structural framework of the Mediator complex (Robinson2024Molecular). The protein's interactions and structural organization are conserved across eukaryotes, underscoring its evolutionary significance (Tsai2014Subunit).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the MED4 gene can significantly impact gene expression, potentially leading to various diseases, including cancer. MED4 is a component of the mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. Alterations in MED4 may disrupt normal cellular processes, contributing to tumorigenesis and other pathological conditions. Changes in the expression level of MED4 or mutations within the gene can lead to aberrant transcriptional regulation, which may result in the development and progression of cancer. The disruption of MED4's normal interactions within the mediator complex can also affect the transcriptional machinery, leading to improper gene expression and cellular dysfunction. These alterations can have widespread effects on cellular homeostasis and may be implicated in the onset of various diseases beyond cancer, although specific conditions are not detailed in the provided context. Understanding the clinical significance of MED4 mutations and dysregulation is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving disease outcomes.

## Interactions
MED4, a subunit of the Mediator complex, participates in various protein interactions essential for transcription regulation. Within the yeast Mediator complex, MED4 interacts with several subunits, including Med1, Med7, Med9, Med10, and Med21 (Srb7), but not with Med5 (Nut1) (Guglielmi2004A). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the complex, as demonstrated by truncation experiments that identified specific amino acids necessary for these interactions (Guglielmi2004A).

The interaction between MED4 and Med9 is particularly significant, as it involves intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that contain molecular recognition features (MoRFs) for post-translational modifications (Malik2017Emerging). MED4 also forms a heterodimer with Med9, stabilized by hydrophobic residues, and is part of a tetramer model with Med7C/Med21, indicating a complex network of interactions within the middle module of the Mediator (Larivière2013Model).

In humans, MED4 interacts with MED26 and MED7, with MED21 enhancing these interactions, suggesting a conserved subunit organization between yeast and human Mediator complexes (Tsai2014Subunit). These interactions highlight MED4's role in facilitating transcriptional regulation across species.
