# WLS

## Overview
The WLS gene encodes the Wnt ligand secretion mediator protein, a critical component in the Wnt signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for various biological processes, including embryonic development, cell proliferation, and tissue homeostasis. The Wnt ligand secretion mediator is an integral membrane protein characterized by eight transmembrane helices and a luminal domain, which facilitates the binding and transport of Wnt proteins, such as Wnt3a and WNT8A, from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (Zhong2021CryoEM; Nygaard2021Structural). The protein's structure, featuring a GPCR-like fold and a central hydrophobic cavity, is crucial for its function in Wnt protein secretion (Nygaard2021Structural). WLS is involved in several protein interactions, including with the retromer complex and TMEM132A, which are vital for its role in Wnt signaling (Li2020TMEM132A; Belenkaya2008The). Alterations in WLS expression have been linked to various cancers and bone development disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Mullin2016Genomewide; Yang2012WLS).

## Structure
The WLS (Wnt ligand secretion mediator) protein is an integral membrane protein characterized by eight transmembrane (TM) helices and a luminal domain. The transmembrane domain of WLS exhibits a GPCR-like fold, particularly in helices 2-8, with a central hydrophobic cavity that accommodates the palmitoleic acid moiety of Wnt proteins, such as Wnt3a and WNT8A (Zhong2021CryoEM; Nygaard2021Structural). This cavity is crucial for the binding and transport of Wnt proteins, facilitating their secretion (Nygaard2021Structural).

The luminal domain of WLS is arranged into a β-sandwich fold, stabilized by two disulfide bonds, and shares structural similarity with the lipid-binding protein Seipin (Zhong2021CryoEM; Nygaard2021Structural). This domain is essential for Wnt binding and is composed of eight antiparallel beta sheets (Nygaard2021Structural).

WLS undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at specific sites, which are important for its interaction with Wnt proteins and may play a role in sorting during secretion (Nygaard2021Structural). The protein's structure and interaction with Wnt proteins make it a potential drug target for Wnt-driven cancers (Zhong2021CryoEM).

## Function
The WLS gene encodes the Wntless (WLS) protein, which is essential for the secretion and signaling of Wnt proteins in human cells. WLS is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but is also found in the Golgi apparatus, vesicular structures, and the plasma membrane. It plays a critical role in transporting palmitoylated Wnt proteins, such as Wnt3a, from the ER to the plasma membrane, facilitating their secretion (Coombs2010WLSdependent).

The interaction between WLS and Wnt proteins requires the acylation of Wnt proteins at specific serine residues, a modification mediated by the enzyme PORCN. This lipid modification is crucial for the binding of Wnt proteins to WLS, enabling their transport and secretion (Coombs2010WLSdependent; Herr2012Porcupinemediated). The release of Wnt proteins from WLS is dependent on vacuolar acidification, which is necessary for transferring Wnt proteins to soluble lipoprotein carriers (Coombs2010WLSdependent).

WLS is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is vital for embryonic development and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in adults. This pathway regulates various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (Li2020TMEM132A). The proper functioning of WLS is crucial for maintaining these cellular and organismal processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WLS gene, also known as Wntless, have been implicated in various cancers. In melanoma, reduced WLS expression is associated with increased tumor size and metastasis, suggesting that WLS may inhibit melanoma cell proliferation and metastasis through the β-catenin signaling pathway (Yang2012WLS). In contrast, WLS is overexpressed in certain other cancers, such as gastric, ovarian, and breast cancers, where it is linked to poorer clinical outcomes. In these cancers, WLS expression is often associated with HER2 overexpression, which may contribute to resistance to treatments like trastuzumab (Stewart2015Analysis).

In gliomas, WLS, also known as Evi, is overexpressed and promotes tumorigenesis by enhancing Wnt signaling, which is crucial for tumor cell survival and proliferation (Augustin2011The). Beyond cancer, WLS is also involved in bone development, with variants in the gene associated with bone mineral density and fracture rates, highlighting its role in skeletal health (Mullin2016Genomewide). These findings underscore the clinical significance of WLS in both oncological and non-oncological contexts.

## Interactions
WLS (Wnt ligand secretion mediator) is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, facilitating the secretion and transport of Wnt proteins. WLS forms a complex with Wnt proteins such as Wnt3a and WNT8A, where it interacts at multiple interfaces. For instance, Wnt3a interacts with WLS through a lipid moiety that traverses a hydrophobic tunnel in the WLS transmembrane domain, and a β-hairpin of Wnt3a interacts extensively with WLS, which is crucial for Wnt secretion (Zhong2021CryoEM). Similarly, WNT8A interacts with WLS through its hairpin loops, with specific residues on WLS coordinating the palmitoleic acid modification on WNT8A, essential for Wnt transport and secretion (Nygaard2021Structural).

WLS also interacts with the retromer complex component Vps35, which is crucial for the recycling of WLS from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, thereby regulating Wnt secretion (Belenkaya2008The). Additionally, WLS interacts with TMEM132A, a protein that enhances the interaction between WLS and Wnt ligands, stabilizing Wnt ligands and facilitating their transport (Li2020TMEM132A). These interactions highlight the central role of WLS in the Wnt signaling pathway.
