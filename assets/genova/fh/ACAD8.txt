# ACAD8

## Overview
The ACAD8 gene encodes the enzyme isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACD) family, which is involved in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, particularly valine. This mitochondrial enzyme plays a critical role in the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, facilitating the conversion of isobutyryl-CoA to methacrylyl-CoA, a key step in energy metabolism (Yoo2007IsobutyrylCoA; AdevaAndany2017Enzymes). The ACAD8 gene is located on chromosome 11q25 and comprises 11 exons that encode a protein of 415 amino acids (Zhuang2022Identification; Yoo2007IsobutyrylCoA). Mutations in ACAD8 can lead to isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBDD), a rare metabolic disorder that can result in developmental delays and other clinical manifestations (Wang2019Expanded; Eleftheriadou2021Isobutyryl‐CoA). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as muscle and liver.

## Structure
The ACAD8 gene encodes the isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme, which is involved in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acid valine. The protein consists of 415 amino acids and is similar in sequence and structure to other members of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACD) family (Zhuang2022Identification; Telford1999Isolation). The primary structure of ACAD8 includes conserved sequences that are crucial for catalysis and substrate binding, typical of the ACD family (Telford1999Isolation).

The secondary structure of ACAD8 features an NH2 terminal alpha-helix domain, an inner beta-chain domain, and a C-terminal alpha-helix domain (Zhuang2022Identification). The tertiary structure is likely globular, as is common among ACD family members, and the protein may form a homotetramer as part of its quaternary structure (Zhuang2022Identification).

ACAD8 is nuclear-encoded, synthesized in the cytosol, and imported into the mitochondria, where it functions in the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway (Telford1999Isolation). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation may occur, and alternative splicing has been linked to mitochondrial defects and liver steatosis (Zhuang2022Identification).

## Function
The ACAD8 gene encodes the enzyme isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD), which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acid valine. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of isobutyryl-CoA to methacrylyl-CoA, marking a key step in the valine catabolic pathway (Yoo2007IsobutyrylCoA; AdevaAndany2017Enzymes). IBD is part of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) family, which are mitochondrial flavoenzymes involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and the metabolism of amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, valine, and lysine (Yoo2007IsobutyrylCoA).

In healthy human cells, IBD is synthesized in the cytosol and imported into the mitochondrial matrix, where it functions to maintain CoA levels and support gluconeogenesis, particularly during exercise or fasting (Sabbagha2011Alternative). The enzyme is highly specific for its substrate, isobutyryl-CoA, and does not exhibit activity with other similar substrates (AdevaAndany2017Enzymes). The ACAD8 gene is located on chromosome 11q25 and consists of 11 exons encoding a protein of 415 amino acids (Zhuang2022Identification; Yoo2007IsobutyrylCoA). The enzyme's activity is crucial for energy homeostasis, particularly in tissues with high energy demands like muscle and liver.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACAD8 gene are associated with isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBDD), a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This condition disrupts the breakdown of the branched-chain amino acid valine, leading to an accumulation of C4-acylcarnitine in plasma and urine (Yoo2007IsobutyrylCoA; Eleftheriadou2021Isobutyryl‐CoA). IBDD is often asymptomatic but can present with symptoms such as developmental delay, hypotonia, dilated cardiomyopathy, and anemia (Zhuang2022Identification; Wang2019Expanded). 

The disorder is typically identified through newborn screening, which detects elevated C4-acylcarnitine levels, although these are not specific to IBDD and can also indicate other conditions like short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (Oglesbee2007Development). Genetic testing for ACAD8 mutations is required for a definitive diagnosis (Eleftheriadou2021Isobutyryl‐CoA). 

Several mutations in the ACAD8 gene have been identified, including missense, nonsense, and splicing mutations, with some being more prevalent in specific populations (Feng2021Phenotype; Yun2014A). The clinical spectrum of IBDD is not fully defined, and the condition is considered relatively benign, though long-term follow-up data are limited (Oglesbee2007Development; Yoo2007IsobutyrylCoA).
