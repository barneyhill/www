# RASL11B

## Overview
RASL11B is a gene that encodes the protein RAS like family 11 member B, which is part of the small GTPase family. This protein is characterized by a RAS GTPase domain and is involved in various intracellular signaling pathways. Unlike many other RAS proteins, RASL11B lacks a prenylation signal, indicating that it is cytoplasmic rather than membrane-bound. The protein plays a significant role in cellular differentiation, particularly in processes mediated by TGF-β1, and is involved in the chondrogenic differentiation of human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells. RASL11B has been implicated in cancer biology, acting as a putative tumor suppressor in certain contexts, and is associated with improved survival outcomes in some cancers due to its ability to inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis (Luo2020RASL11B; Stolle2007Cloning; Lyu2021Genomic).

## Structure
The RASL11B gene encodes a protein that is a member of the small GTPase family, characterized by a RAS GTPase domain. This domain consists of a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices, which is typical of the RAS protein family (Stolle2007Cloning). The wild-type RASL11B protein is composed of 248 amino acids, with its open reading frame beginning at nucleic acid position 192 in exon 1 and ending at position 936 in exon 4 (Stolle2007Cloning). 

A notable feature of the RASL11B protein is the absence of a prenylation signal, such as a CAAX box, which is common in other RAS proteins for membrane anchoring. This absence suggests that RASL11B is cytoplasmic rather than membrane-bound (Pézeron2008Rasl11b). The protein also has a splice variant that results in a shorter isoform of 191 amino acids, which retains the GTPase domain but lacks 57 amino acids at the C-terminus. These missing amino acids are highly conserved within the RASL11 protein family (Stolle2007Cloning). The RASL11B protein shares significant similarity with RASL11A, particularly within the conserved RAS domain, with 54% identity and 74% similarity at the protein level (Stolle2007Cloning).

## Function
The RASL11B gene encodes a protein that is part of the RAS-like family of small GTPases, which are involved in intracellular signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices and is predicted to be cytoplasmic, lacking a prenylation signal, which suggests it is not membrane-anchored (Stolle2007Cloning). RASL11B is expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression observed in the placenta and primary macrophages (Stolle2007Cloning). It plays a significant role in cellular differentiation processes, particularly in the maturation of THP-1 monocytic cells into macrophage-like cells and in coronary artery smooth muscle cells after TGF-β1 treatment, indicating its involvement in TGF-β1-mediated developmental processes (Stolle2007Cloning).

In the context of chondrogenic differentiation, RASL11B enhances the expression of chondrocyte-specific markers such as Col2a1, Acan, and Sox9, which are crucial for cartilage formation. This is achieved through the activation of the Sox9/ERK/Smad signaling pathways, suggesting that RASL11B is crucial for the regulation of chondrogenic differentiation in human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (Luo2020RASL11B). The protein's role in these signaling pathways highlights its importance in cellular processes related to tissue-specific functions and cellular differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
RASL11B has been implicated in various cancers due to its role as a putative tumor suppressor gene. In bladder cancer, RASL11B expression is associated with the PD-L1-low-exhausted group, where its upregulation is linked to improved patient survival outcomes. It inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and promotes apoptosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lyu2021Genomic).

In neuroblastoma, RASL11B is upregulated and may contribute to tumor development. It is identified as a hub gene with high connectivity in protein-protein interaction networks, indicating its significant role in the pathogenesis of this pediatric cancer (Liu2019Upregulation).

RASL11B is also involved in the chondrogenic differentiation of human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells, where its expression promotes the activation of key signaling pathways. This suggests a potential role in cartilage repair therapies, although its direct link to specific diseases remains to be fully elucidated (Luo2020RASL11B).
