# SLC35A3

## Overview
SLC35A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member A3, a crucial component of the nucleotide sugar transporter family. This protein is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the transport of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) across the Golgi membrane. As a type-III transmembrane protein, SLC35A3 plays a significant role in the glycosylation process, which is essential for the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans and the branching of N-glycans. These processes are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and for various cellular functions, including protein folding and cell signaling (MaszczakSeneczko2015UDPgalactose; Saito2023Mice). Mutations in the SLC35A3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder and skeletal malformations, underscoring its importance in normal cellular and developmental processes (Thomsen2005A; Edvardson2013Mutations).

## Structure
The SLC35A3 protein is a Golgi-associated transporter involved in the transport of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) across the Golgi membrane. It is a type-III membrane protein with 10 transmembrane domains (TMDs), and both its C- and N-termini are exposed to the cytosol (Edvardson2013Mutations). The protein's structure is characterized by a dimeric organization, which is common among nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) (Szulc2020Biosynthesis). 

The primary structure of SLC35A3 includes specific conserved residues, such as Glu-47 and Lys-50, which are part of the EXXK motif in transmembrane helix 2 (TMH2). These residues are critical for the protein's antiport activity and are involved in maintaining charge balance and facilitating ligand recognition (Toscanini2019Conserved). 

The tertiary structure of SLC35A3 involves a central cavity formed by transmembrane helices, which is essential for its transport function. This cavity is suggested to be involved in protein-ligand interactions and conformational transitions necessary for transport (Toscanini2019Conserved). 

Mutations in SLC35A3 can lead to significant functional impairments, as seen in various studies, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper function (Toscanini2019Conserved).

## Function
The SLC35A3 gene encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter responsible for the transport of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) into the Golgi apparatus, a critical step in the glycosylation process. This transporter is essential for the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparan sulfate and keratan sulfate, which are vital for maintaining the quality of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Saito2023Mice). SLC35A3 is also involved in the branching of N-glycans, a process crucial for various cellular functions, including protein folding and cell signaling (MaszczakSeneczko2015UDPgalactose).

In healthy human cells, SLC35A3 forms complexes with other nucleotide sugar transporters and glycosyltransferases, influencing specific steps in glycosylation (Wiktor2021Identification). It is functionally coupled with SLC35A2, which transports UDP-galactose and UDP-GalNAc, and this interaction is important for the biosynthesis of complex N-glycans (Saito2023Mice). The activity of SLC35A3 is crucial for the proper localization and function of mannoside acetylglucosaminyltransferases (MGATs) in the Golgi apparatus, which are involved in N-glycan branching (MaszczakSeneczko2015UDPgalactose). Disruption in this pathway can lead to congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation, which include neurological symptoms (Saito2023Mice).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC35A3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, and arthrogryposis. These mutations lead to a loss of function in the UDP-GlcNAc transporter, resulting in a shortage of UDP-GlcNAc in the Golgi apparatus. This shortage affects the synthesis of highly branched N-glycans, which is crucial for normal cellular functions, potentially leading to growth arrest and differentiation issues (Edvardson2013Mutations). 

In cattle, a missense mutation in SLC35A3 causes Complex Vertebral Malformation (CVM), characterized by growth retardation and skeletal malformations. This condition is linked to disrupted glycosylation processes and impaired Notch signaling, which are essential for vertebral column formation (Thomsen2005A). 

In mice, the absence of SLC35A3 results in lethal chondrodysplasia with vertebral anomalies and impaired glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. This condition mirrors the vertebral anomalies seen in CVM and highlights the gene's role in glycosylation and skeletal development (Saito2023Mice). 

The carrier rate for a deleterious splice site mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is 1:205, suggesting that the condition may be underdiagnosed (Edvardson2013Mutations).

## Interactions
SLC35A3, a nucleotide sugar transporter, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for glycosylation processes. It forms heterologous complexes with the UDP-galactose transporter SLC35A2, suggesting a coupled role in glycosylation through complex formation (MaszczakSeneczko2012UDP‐N‐acetylglucosamine). SLC35A3 also interacts with mannoside acetylglucosaminyltransferases (Mgats), such as Mgat1, Mgat2, Mgat4B, and Mgat5, indicating its involvement in N-glycan biosynthesis (MaszczakSeneczko2015UDPgalactose).

The study by Wiktor et al. identified several potential interaction partners for SLC35A3 using a NanoBiT protein-protein interaction assay. Significant interactions were observed with ATP2A2, GPR89B, and BSG, while ATP2C1 and TMCO1 did not show significant interactions (Wiktor2021Identification). These interactions suggest that SLC35A3 may transiently interact with proteins like basigin during its passage through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for its glycosylation and function (Wiktor2021Identification).

SLC35A3's interactions are essential for its role in glycosylation, impacting processes such as protein stability and cell recognition. These interactions highlight the importance of SLC35A3 in forming multiprotein complexes that facilitate glycosylation (MaszczakSeneczko2015UDPgalactose).
