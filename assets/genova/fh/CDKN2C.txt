# CDKN2C

## Overview
The CDKN2C gene encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C, commonly referred to as p18INK4C, which is a member of the INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. This protein plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, thereby preventing the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. Through its inhibitory action, p18INK4C functions as a tumor suppressor, maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Li2022Clinical; Sun2019Arac). The gene's expression and regulation are critical in various physiological and pathological contexts, including its involvement in cancer, where alterations in CDKN2C can lead to dysregulated cell cycle progression and contribute to tumorigenesis (Leone2008Deletions; Li2022Clinical).

## Function
The CDKN2C gene encodes a protein known as p18, which is a member of the INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. In healthy human cells, CDKN2C plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibition prevents the formation of the CDK4/cyclin D1 complex, which is essential for the progression from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle (Li2022Clinical; Sun2019Arac). By blocking this progression, CDKN2C effectively induces cell cycle arrest, thereby controlling cell proliferation and maintaining normal cell cycle progression (Li2022Clinical).

The protein functions by directly binding to CDK4, distorting its ATP-binding site and altering the catalytic subunit, which inhibits kinase activity. This action prevents the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), a key step required for cell cycle progression (Sun2019Arac). CDKN2C is primarily active in the nucleus, where it exerts its regulatory effects on the cell cycle (Niu2019CyclinDependent). This regulatory mechanism is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell growth, contributing to its role as a tumor suppressor (Sun2019Arac).

## Clinical Significance
The CDKN2C gene, encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p18INK4C, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in cell cycle regulation. Alterations in CDKN2C expression or mutations can lead to dysregulation of the cell cycle, contributing to cancer progression. In small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), CDKN2C expression is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, with transcription factor FOXA1 identified as a regulator of its expression (Li2022Clinical). Conversely, in multiple myeloma, deletions of CDKN2C are linked to increased proliferation and worse overall survival, indicating its role in myeloma pathogenesis (Leone2008Deletions).

CDKN2C expression patterns vary across different cancers. It is upregulated in cancers such as cholangiocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and glioblastoma, while downregulated in breast cancer and colon adenocarcinoma (Li2022Clinical). In leiomyosarcoma, CDKN2C-null tumors form a distinct subgroup, lacking typical TP53 and RB1 mutations but showing frequent genomic alterations, suggesting potential for targeted therapies (Williams2020CDKN2CNull).

In sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma, CDKN2C loss is associated with more aggressive disease phenotypes and worse overall survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Maxwell2020Novel).

## Interactions
CDKN2C, also known as p18INK4C, is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that primarily interacts with CDK4 and CDK6. This interaction inhibits the activity of these kinases, preventing their association with D-type cyclins and blocking cell cycle progression from the G1 to the S phase (Li2022Clinical; Eller2020A). CDKN2C's role in cell cycle regulation is crucial, as it leads to the inactivation of CDK kinase activity, blocking Rb phosphorylation and initiating cell cycle arrest (Li2022Clinical).

In the context of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, CDKN2C expression is repressed by the Gata3/Ruvbl2 complex. Gata3, a transcription factor, interacts with Ruvbl2 to form a complex that binds to the CDKN2C locus, facilitating Th2 cell proliferation by repressing CDKN2C expression (Hosokawa2013Gata3/Ruvbl2).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), CDKN2C expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA LINC00673, which recruits EZH2, a component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), to the CDKN2C promoter. This recruitment leads to H3K27 trimethylation, resulting in transcriptional repression of CDKN2C (Zhou2020LINC00673).
