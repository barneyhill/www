# ADORA2B

## Overview
The ADORA2B gene encodes the adenosine A2b receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a pivotal role in various physiological and pathological processes. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains and is primarily involved in mediating cellular responses to extracellular adenosine, particularly under hypoxic conditions. The adenosine A2b receptor is implicated in cardioprotection, immune regulation, and metabolic adaptation, making it a significant focus of research in cardiovascular, inflammatory, and cancer biology. Its activation leads to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase and subsequent intracellular signaling pathways, which are crucial for tissue adaptation and protection (Fredholm2000Structure; Eltzschig2013Attenuating). The receptor's interactions with various proteins and signaling pathways underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (Kasama2015Adenosine; Strickland2023The).

## Structure
The ADORA2B gene encodes the adenosine A2B receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) composed of 328 amino acids. This receptor follows the typical GPCR architecture, featuring seven transmembrane (TM) domains connected by three extracellular loops (EL) and three intracellular loops (IL), with an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus (Merighi2018Adenosine). The binding site of the A2B receptor involves TM regions 3, 5, 6, and 7, which are crucial for recognizing both agonists and antagonists. The extracellular loop 2 (EL2) is the longest among adenosine receptor subtypes and contains four cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, essential for ligand binding and receptor function (Merighi2018Adenosine).

The A2B receptor is known to activate the Gs family of G proteins, leading to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent signaling pathways (Fredholm2000Structure). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are important for receptor desensitization and internalization (Merighi2018Adenosine). The receptor can also form dimers, as indicated by its interaction with α-actinin-1, which enhances A2B expression on the cell surface (Merighi2018Adenosine).

## Function
The ADORA2B gene encodes the adenosine A2B receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, this receptor plays a crucial role in mediating responses to hypoxic conditions by activating signaling pathways that enhance tissue adaptation and protection. The ADORA2B receptor is activated under conditions of elevated extracellular adenosine, which typically occur during hypoxia. This activation is linked to the protein Gs, which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels. This signaling pathway is associated with cardioprotection, as it helps adapt metabolism towards more oxygen-efficient utilization of carbohydrates, thereby reducing myocardial infarction (Eltzschig2013Attenuating).

In erythrocytes, the ADORA2B receptor mediates hypoxic metabolic reprogramming by activating the AMPK-BPG mutase signaling pathway, which is crucial for the production of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). This process facilitates oxygen release from erythrocytes, counteracting tissue hypoxia and maintaining cognitive and auditory functions in young individuals (Qiang2021Erythrocyte). Additionally, the receptor plays a role in immune regulation by enhancing the abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) during inflammation, thereby limiting excessive inflammatory responses (Ehrentraut2012Adora2b).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ADORA2B gene, which encodes the adenosine A2b receptor, have been implicated in various diseases. In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ADORA2B signaling is crucial for mediating protective effects, such as reducing inflammation and enhancing fluid clearance. Mutations or changes in expression levels of ADORA2B can impact the progression and severity of these conditions (Yuan2022Alternative).

In the context of cancer, ADORA2B expression is associated with different prognostic outcomes depending on the cancer type. High levels of ADORA2B are linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where it is associated with enhanced tumor progression and immune suppression (Strickland2023The). Conversely, in ovarian cancer, high ADORA2B levels correlate with a better prognosis due to reduced cell migration (Strickland2023The).

ADORA2B also plays a role in hypoxia-mediated adenosine signaling, particularly in PDAC, where it contributes to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Targeting ADORA2B in this context may enhance antitumor immunity and improve patient outcomes (Strickland2023The).

## Interactions
The ADORA2B protein, also known as the adenosine A2b receptor, participates in several significant interactions with other proteins, influencing various physiological processes. One notable interaction is with the Apaf-1-interacting protein (APIP), which is crucial for cardioprotection. This interaction is enhanced under hypoxic conditions and is mediated by specific amino acid residues in ADORA2B, such as Arg293 and Asp296. Mutations at these sites, like R293W and D296G, disrupt the binding to APIP, impairing the ADORA2B-mediated signaling pathway that protects cardiac cells from hypoxic damage (Lim2019Cardioprotective).

ADORA2B also interacts with the CREB-HIF1α signaling pathway, which is essential for its cardioprotective effects. The interaction with APIP is necessary for the activation of this pathway, as APIP knockdown impairs the accumulation of HIF1α and the suppression of hypoxic cell death (Lim2019Cardioprotective).

In the context of cancer, ADORA2B is involved in the regulation of tumor progression through its interactions with proteins like HIF-1α, ERK1/2, and Akt, particularly under hypoxic conditions. These interactions contribute to the upregulation of HIF-1α and are associated with increased tumor aggressiveness (Kasama2015Adenosine).
