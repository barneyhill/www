# IRAK1BP1

## Overview
IRAK1BP1, or interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. The protein, categorized as a signaling molecule, interacts with IRAK1, a kinase integral to the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity of the NF-κB signaling pathway. By influencing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits, IRAK1BP1 contributes to the regulation of cytokine production, promoting anti-inflammatory responses through the enhancement of IL-10 production and the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines. This regulatory function is crucial in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammatory responses, which can lead to pathological conditions. The gene's expression patterns and its involvement in various diseases, including certain cancers, underscore its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and as a target for therapeutic interventions (Guo2023Identification; Conner2010IRAK1BP1).

## Structure
IRAK1BP1, or interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 binding protein 1, is a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses. The protein is known to interact with IRAK1, a kinase that plays a crucial role in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Structurally, IRAK1BP1 may contain specific domains such as the FHA (Forkhead-associated) domain, which is significant for phospho-dependent protein-protein interactions. This domain is essential for the protein's function in signaling pathways, as it facilitates interactions with phosphorylated proteins.

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are known to influence the function of IRAK1BP1. These modifications can affect the protein's activity and interactions, thereby modulating immune responses. Information regarding the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of IRAK1BP1, as well as its splice variant isoforms, may be available in protein databases or scientific literature, although specific details are not provided in the current context. Understanding these structural aspects is crucial for comprehending how IRAK1BP1 functions at a molecular level and its role in immune signaling pathways.

## Function
IRAK1BP1 (interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 binding protein 1) plays a crucial role in modulating inflammation in healthy human cells. It acts as an inhibitory component in pathways mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLR), IL-1 receptors (IL-1R), and TNF receptors (TNFR). IRAK1BP1 influences the nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits, specifically increasing the ratio of p50/p50 homodimers relative to p50/p65 heterodimers. This shift is associated with down-regulating the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancing the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which helps resolve inflammation and prevent excessive tissue damage (Conner2010IRAK1BP1).

IRAK1BP1 is involved in the formation of p50/p50 homodimers, leading to increased IL-10 production and inhibition of proinflammatory gene transcription. This function is particularly important in the context of LPS tolerance, where it helps prevent unchecked cytokine release (Conner2010IRAK1BP1). The gene is not typically expressed in quiescent primary macrophages but is highly induced in certain mouse strains prone to early cytokine transcription. It is also constitutively expressed in immune-privileged organs like the brain and testis, suggesting a role in modulating inflammatory mediators such as IL-1 and TNF in specific tissues (Conner2010IRAK1BP1).

## Clinical Significance
IRAK1BP1 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in regulating inflammation and immune responses. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), IRAK1BP1 is downregulated, and its lower expression is associated with poorer survival outcomes. This suggests that IRAK1BP1 could serve as a prognostic biomarker for LUAD, potentially aiding in predicting disease progression and patient prognosis (Guo2023Identification). The gene's expression is also reduced in other cancers, such as breast cancer, kidney cancers, and prostate adenocarcinoma, where it is generally lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues (Guo2023Identification).

IRAK1BP1 is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses, particularly through its interaction with the NF-κB signaling pathway. It inhibits inflammation by promoting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p50/p50 homodimers, which leads to increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6. This regulatory function is crucial in preventing excessive inflammatory responses, which can lead to conditions such as autoimmune diseases and sepsis (Conner2008Forward; Conner2010IRAK1BP1). The gene's role in modulating inflammatory pathways highlights its potential relevance in inflammatory conditions and immune-mediated diseases (Conner2008Forward).

## Interactions
IRAK1BP1 interacts with several proteins involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in modulating inflammatory responses. It binds to the NF-κB family protein p105, which is a precursor to the p50 subunit. This interaction occurs specifically at the PEST domain of p105, which is essential for optimal association, while the death domain of p105 is not required for binding. The deletion of the death domain enhances the association with IRAK1BP1 (Conner2010IRAK1BP1). Overexpression of IRAK1BP1 stabilizes p105, preventing its degradation and influencing the nuclear balance of NF-κB subunits, thereby affecting cytokine production (Conner2010IRAK1BP1).

IRAK1BP1 promotes the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p50/p50 homodimers, which are involved in anti-inflammatory responses. This process involves IRAK1BP1 binding to p105, which acts as a scaffold, allowing IRAK1BP1 to access p50 molecules (Conner2010IRAK1BP1). The interaction between IRAK1BP1 and p105 is crucial for its anti-inflammatory effects, as demonstrated by experiments using IRAK1BP1 knockdown and NF-κB1 knockout cells (Conner2010IRAK1BP1). These interactions highlight IRAK1BP1's role in modulating NF-κB activity and inflammatory responses (Conner2010IRAK1BP1).
