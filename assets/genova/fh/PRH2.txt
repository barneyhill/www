# PRH2

## Overview
The PRH2 gene encodes the proline-rich protein HaeIII subfamily 2, a member of the acidic proline-rich proteins (aPRPs) family, which are predominantly found in human saliva. These proteins are characterized by their high proline content and play a crucial role in oral health by contributing to the formation of the enamel pellicle on teeth surfaces. The PRH2 protein is involved in binding to hydroxyapatite, a component of tooth enamel, which helps maintain calcium homeostasis and inhibits the precipitation of calcium phosphate in the oral cavity (Manconi2016The; Azen1998A). Additionally, the protein facilitates bacterial adherence to tooth surfaces, which can influence plaque formation and oral microbial ecology (Manconi2016The). The PRH2 gene is located on chromosome 12p13.2 and is part of a cluster of genes encoding salivary proline-rich proteins, highlighting its significance in the complex network of salivary proteins that maintain oral health (Kim1993The; Azen1998A).

## Structure
The PRH2 gene encodes a salivary proline-rich protein that is characterized by a high content of proline, glycine, and glutamine, which make up 70-88% of its amino acid composition (Manconi2016The; Bennick1987Structural). The primary structure of the PRH2 protein includes a secretory signal sequence, an N-terminal region, a region with variable repeats rich in proline, glutamine, and glycine, and a C-terminal sequence (Bennick1987Structural). The protein is 150 amino acids long, with the acidic portion concentrated in the first 30 residues due to the presence of aspartic and glutamic acids (Manconi2016The).

The PRH2 protein undergoes partial proteolytic cleavage, resulting in a 106 amino acid product and a smaller 44 amino acid product (Azen1998A). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is crucial for its biological activity (Bennick1987Structural). The phosphorylation of PRH2 is mediated by the Fam20C kinase, highlighting the hierarchical nature of phosphorylation at specific serine residues (Manconi2016The). The PRH2 protein's structure and modifications play a significant role in its function, particularly in binding to teeth surfaces and promoting bacterial adherence (Azen1998A).

## Function
The PRH2 gene encodes acidic proline-rich proteins (aPRPs) that play a significant role in oral health by contributing to the formation of the enamel pellicle on teeth surfaces. These proteins are involved in binding to hydroxyapatite, a model for teeth surfaces, which helps maintain a supersaturated concentration of salivary calcium and inhibits the precipitation of calcium phosphate, thus promoting calcium homeostasis in the oral cavity (Manconi2016The; Azen1998A). The acidic N-terminal domain of aPRPs binds to hydroxyapatite, while the proline-rich C-terminal domain is exposed to oral bacteria, facilitating bacterial colonization and adherence to tooth surfaces, which can precede plaque formation (Manconi2016The).

The PRH2 gene is located on chromosome 12p13.2 and is part of a family of six closely linked genes responsible for coding salivary PRPs (Kim1993The; Azen1998A). These proteins are secreted by both parotid and submandibular/sublingual glands and are found in both intact and truncated forms (Manconi2016The). The PRH2 gene's products are crucial for oral health, influencing the adherence of potentially pathogenic oral bacteria and contributing to the protective functions of saliva (Azen1998A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRH2 gene, which encodes acidic proline-rich proteins (PRPs), have been associated with variations in oral health, particularly in relation to dental caries and bacterial adherence to teeth. A notable mutation, C->A(2957), results in a Q147K amino acid change in the PR1' protein variant. This mutation is prevalent in the Afro-American population, with an allele frequency of 0.16, and is located near the carboxy-terminal dipeptide, a region crucial for bacterial adherence to teeth surfaces. This proximity suggests that the mutation may influence bacterial adherence, potentially impacting plaque formation and dental diseases (Azen1998A).

The PRH2 gene's role in oral health is further highlighted by its involvement in maintaining salivary calcium concentration and binding to teeth surfaces, which are essential for preventing dental caries. Variations in the PRH2 gene, including its alleles, have been linked to differences in susceptibility to dental caries among different populations. For instance, certain alleles of acidic PRPs, which include those encoded by PRH2, are associated with protection against dental caries in specific demographic groups (Levine2011Susceptibility). These genetic variations may influence the interaction of PRPs with oral bacteria, affecting the formation of dental plaque and the development of caries.

## Interactions
PRH2, a gene encoding acidic proline-rich proteins, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for oral health. The STRING database identifies PRH1/PRH2 as a first shell interactor of histatin 1, suggesting a potential interaction between these proteins. Histatin 1 is known to form heterotypic complexes with other salivary proteins, and PRH1/PRH2 is among the 43 proteins confirmed as partners in these complexes through classical protein-protein interaction methods and mass spectrometry (Crosara2018Merging).

The proteins encoded by PRH2, such as PRP-1 and PRP-3, are involved in forming films on solid surfaces, which is essential for the acquired enamel pellicle's formation. This pellicle plays a role in lubrication, mineral homeostasis, and microbial modulation. The adsorption behavior of these proteins varies with surface type and ionic conditions, indicating their dynamic interaction capabilities (Lindh2002On).

PRH2 also plays a role in bacterial adherence to teeth, which can lead to plaque formation. A specific mutation in the PRH2 gene affects the bacterial binding domain, highlighting its significance in modulating bacterial colonization (Azen1998A). These interactions underscore the importance of PRH2 in maintaining oral health through its involvement in complex protein networks.
