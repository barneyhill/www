# ACY3

## Overview
ACY3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme aminoacylase 3, which is involved in the hydrolysis of N-acylated amino acids. This enzyme plays a significant role in amino acid metabolism and detoxification processes, contributing to cellular homeostasis. Aminoacylase 3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is categorized as a hydrolase enzyme. It is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in the kidney, liver, heart, and brain, as observed in mouse models. The enzyme's function includes deacetylating mercapturic acids and N-acetylated aromatic amino acids, which is crucial for metabolic processes and may impact conditions such as cardiovascular risk and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Variations in the ACY3 gene have been linked to differential responses to antihypertensive drugs, highlighting its potential as a pharmacogenomic marker. Additionally, ACY3 expression has been studied in the context of neuroblastoma, where it may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Rimpelä2017Replicated; Long2011Differential).

## Function
ACY3 (aminoacylase 3) is an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of N-acylated amino acids, playing a crucial role in amino acid metabolism. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is important for detoxifying xenobiotic compounds, contributing to maintaining cellular homeostasis. In humans, ACY3 is expressed in various tissues, including neurons and the adrenal medulla, with high expression levels noted in the kidney, liver, heart, and brain in mouse models (Rimpelä2017Replicated).

The enzyme's primary function involves deacetylating mercapturic acids and N-acetylated aromatic amino acids, such as N-acetylphenylalanine and N-acetyltyrosine, converting them into phenylalanine and tyrosine, respectively (Rimpelä2017Replicated). This activity suggests a potential role in catecholamine synthesis, which is relevant to blood pressure regulation. Variations in the ACY3 gene have been associated with blood pressure responses to antihypertensive drugs, indicating its influence on cardiovascular health (Rimpelä2017Replicated).

The enzyme's activity in deacetylating aromatic amino acids links it to broader metabolic processes, potentially impacting conditions such as cardiovascular risk, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and pre-eclampsia, as elevated serum phenylalanine levels have been associated with these conditions (Rimpelä2017Replicated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ACY3 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of hypertension treatment, genetic variations in ACY3, particularly the SNP rs2514036, have been associated with differential responses to beta-blocker drugs such as bisoprolol and atenolol. This SNP is linked to changes in blood pressure responses, suggesting that ACY3 may serve as a pharmacogenomic marker for predicting individual responses to antihypertensive therapies (Rimpelä2017Replicated).

In cancer research, ACY3 expression has been studied in neuroblastoma, a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system. The enzyme is more highly expressed in TrkB-positive, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines, and high ACY3 expression correlates with poor prognosis in neuroblastoma patients. This suggests a potential role for ACY3 as a biomarker or therapeutic target in this type of cancer (Long2011Differential).

While the studies highlight the significance of ACY3 in drug response and cancer prognosis, they do not directly associate ACY3 mutations with specific diseases beyond these contexts. The enzyme's role in deacetylating N-acetylated aromatic amino acids may influence its involvement in these conditions (Rimpelä2017Replicated; Long2011Differential).
