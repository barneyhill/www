# GRID1

## Overview
The GRID1 gene encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor delta type subunit 1 (GluD1), a member of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, which is distinct in its inability to bind glutamate. Instead, GluD1 functions as a receptor that interacts with other synaptic proteins to facilitate synapse formation and plasticity, particularly in the nervous system. Structurally, GluD1 is characterized by a unique non-swapped architecture and a Y-shaped tetrameric assembly, comprising amino-terminal, ligand-binding, and transmembrane domains (Burada2020CryoEM). Functionally, GluD1 is involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity through its interactions with cerebellin and D-serine, forming trans-synaptic bridges essential for excitatory synapse formation (Ung2024GRID1GluD1). The receptor's role in synaptic development and function is further underscored by its interactions with various intracellular and extracellular proteins, contributing to the regulation of synaptic signaling pathways (Fossati2019TransSynaptic; Suryavanshi2016Glutamate). Mutations and alterations in GRID1 expression have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal neural circuitry (Ung2024GRID1GluD1; Guo2007A).

## Structure
The GRID1 gene encodes the GluD1 receptor, a member of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family. The GluD1 receptor is characterized by a non-swapped architecture, distinct from other ionotropic glutamate receptors, which typically exhibit domain swapping at the amino-terminal domain (ATD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD) interface (Burada2020CryoEM). The receptor's structure includes a Y-shaped tetrameric assembly with a three-layered arrangement consisting of the ATD, LBD, and transmembrane (TM) domains (Burada2020CryoEM). The ATD has a clamshell-like structure with R1 and R2 lobes, forming dimers and tetramers in a 'compact' conformation (Burada2020CryoEM).

The LBD of GluD1 forms dimer pairs with a buried surface area similar to AMPA and kainate receptors, contributing to its structural integrity (Burada2020CryoEM). The transmembrane domain exhibits a 4-fold rotational symmetry, with the M4 segment packed against M1 and M3 in a counter-clockwise rotation, resulting in a more splayed arrangement compared to other receptors (Burada2020CryoEM). The receptor's C-terminal domain contains a PDZ-binding motif, which interacts weakly with PSD95 and other proteins like Shank and PICK1, playing a role in synaptic trafficking (Andrews2021An). The GluD1 receptor does not undergo known alternative splicing or RNA editing (Schmid2008To).

## Function
The GRID1 gene encodes the ionotropic glutamate delta receptor GluD1, which plays a crucial role in synapse formation, function, and plasticity in the nervous system. Unlike other glutamate receptors, GluD1 does not bind glutamate but interacts with cerebellin and D-serine to form trans-synaptic bridges and trigger transmembrane signaling. These interactions are essential for the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity, particularly at excitatory postsynaptic sites (Ung2024GRID1GluD1).

GluD1 is involved in the modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu1/5) signaling, which is critical for proper synaptic function. It participates in excitatory synapse formation and stabilization through its attachment with presynaptic neurexin, contributing to the regulation of neurite outgrowth, architecture, and synaptic density. This function is vital for sensory, cognitive, and motor functions in the human nervous system (Ung2024GRID1GluD1).

In healthy cells, GluD1 promotes the formation of dendritic spines and excitatory synapses, leading to a higher density of excitatory synapses compared to control neurons. This indicates its significant role in synaptogenesis and the overall maintenance of synaptic networks (Ung2024GRID1GluD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRID1 gene have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Homozygous missense variants in GRID1, specifically p.Arg161His and p.Thr752Met, have been associated with intellectual disability and spastic paraplegia. These mutations impair mGlu1/5 receptor signaling and excitatory synapse function, leading to clinical features such as global developmental delay, intellectual disability, spastic paraplegia, and ophthalmological issues like glaucoma (Ung2024GRID1GluD1).

Alterations in GRID1 expression have also been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. The gene has been associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Studies have identified significant associations between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the GRID1 gene and schizophrenia, suggesting that genetic variants in this region may contribute to the disorder's etiology (Guo2007A). Additionally, GRID1 has been linked to autism spectrum disorder through copy number variation studies (Yadav2012Deletion). These findings underscore the gene's role in the development of normal neural circuitry and its potential contribution to the pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
The GRID1 gene encodes the GluD1 protein, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for synaptic function. GluD1 interacts trans-synaptically with the extracellular scaffolding protein cerebellin (Cbln) and presynaptic neurexin, forming a complex essential for inhibitory synapse formation in cortical pyramidal neurons (Fossati2019TransSynaptic). The N-terminal domain of GluD1 binds to Cbln, and mutations in this domain can disrupt this interaction, leading to a decrease in inhibitory synapses (Fossati2019TransSynaptic).

GluD1 also interacts with several intracellular proteins, including ARHGEF12 and PPP1R12A, which are involved in the regulation of GTPase activity and protein phosphorylation, respectively. These interactions are important for the formation and function of inhibitory synapses (Fossati2019TransSynaptic). Additionally, GluD1 interacts with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) in the hippocampus, forming a signaling complex that affects mTOR signaling pathways and synaptic plasticity (Suryavanshi2016Glutamate).

In the context of excitatory synapses, GluD1 is involved in interactions with mGlu5 and scaffold proteins like Homer, which are crucial for the regulation of synaptic signaling and plasticity (Suryavanshi2016Glutamate). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of GluD1 in synaptic development and function.
