# FIGN

## Overview
FIGN is a gene that encodes the protein fidgetin, a microtubule-severing factor that is integral to the regulation of mitosis in human cells. Fidgetin belongs to the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA) protein superfamily and functions primarily as a minus-end depolymerase. This protein is involved in severing and depolymerizing microtubules, particularly at their minus-ends, which is crucial for maintaining the architecture and dynamics of the mitotic spindle. The activity of fidgetin is essential for proper spindle positioning and cytokinesis, and its dysfunction can lead to chromosomal instability, such as aneuploidy or polyploidy, which may contribute to tumorigenesis (Mukherjee2012Human).

## Function
Fidgetin (FIGN) is a microtubule-severing enzyme that plays a critical role in regulating mitosis in human cells. It is part of the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA) protein superfamily and functions as a minus-end depolymerase. FIGN is involved in severing and depolymerizing microtubules, particularly at their minus-ends, which is essential for maintaining mitotic spindle architecture and dynamics (Mukherjee2012Human). In vitro studies have demonstrated that FIGN can sever taxol-stabilized microtubules along their length and promote depolymerization, primarily from their minus-ends (Mukherjee2012Human).

In cells, FIGN targets centrosomes, and its depletion leads to reduced velocity of poleward tubulin flux and anaphase A chromatid-to-pole motion. This suggests that FIGN actively suppresses microtubule growth from and attachment to centrosomes, playing a critical role in the regulation of mitosis and maintenance of centrosome morphology (Mukherjee2012Human). FIGN's activity is crucial for proper spindle positioning and cytokinesis during cell division, and defects in its function can lead to aneuploidy or polyploidy, potentially initiating tumorigenesis (Mukherjee2012Human). FIGN also affects astral microtubules in metaphase spindles, with its depletion leading to an increase in the density of astral microtubules (Mukherjee2012Human).
