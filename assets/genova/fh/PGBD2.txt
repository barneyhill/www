# PGBD2

## Overview
PGBD2 is a gene that encodes the protein piggyBac transposable element derived 2, which is part of the piggyBac transposable element-derived family. This protein is categorized as a transposase, which is an enzyme that facilitates the movement of transposable elements within the genome. The piggyBac transposable element derived 2 protein is involved in genomic rearrangements and has been implicated in various biological processes, including gene regulation and genome stability. Its activity is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of genetic diversity and evolution, as well as its potential roles in human diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
