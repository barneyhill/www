# FCHO2

## Overview
FCHO2 (FCH and mu domain containing endocytic adaptor 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a fundamental cellular process for internalizing various molecules. The FCHO2 protein is categorized as an endocytic adaptor protein and is characterized by its F-BAR domain, which plays a crucial role in membrane curvature and deformation, facilitating the formation of clathrin-coated pits. This protein interacts with phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), and serves as a scaffold for recruiting other endocytic proteins, such as Eps15 and intersectin 1, through its μ-homology domain (μ-HD) (Umasankar2012Distinct; El2022Structural). FCHO2 is also implicated in maintaining Golgi architecture and has been associated with pathological conditions, including melanoma, through its circular RNA form, circFCHO2, which influences cancer progression via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Yang2024Circular).

## Structure
The FCHO2 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It contains an N-terminal F-BAR domain, which is involved in membrane curvature sensing and generation. This domain facilitates the protein's association with membranes through dimerization, interacting with acidic phospholipids and selectively recognizing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (Alaoui2021Structure; El2022Structural). The F-BAR domain also promotes the formation of ring-like structures on membranes, which are crucial for the protein's role in endocytosis (El2022Structural).

Following the F-BAR domain, FCHO2 has a polybasic motif that enhances its interaction with PI(4,5)P2, aiding in the clustering of this lipid and the recruitment of other endocytic proteins (El2022Structural). The C-terminal region of FCHO2 contains a μ-homology domain (μ-HD), which serves as an interaction hub for early endocytic proteins such as Eps15 and intersectin 1 (Umasankar2012Distinct; El2022Structural).

FCHO2 is known to self-assemble into ring-like molecular complexes on membranes, a process that is independent of local protein density and is facilitated by its interaction with PI(4,5)P2 (Alaoui2021Structure; El2022Structural). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in the early stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

## Function
FCHO2 (FCH and mu domain containing endocytic adaptor 2) is a protein that plays a critical role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a process essential for the internalization of receptors, channels, and transporters in cells. It is involved in the early stages of endocytosis, where it localizes to clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane and interacts with phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (Uezu2011Characterization; El2022Structural). FCHO2's EFC/F-BAR domain facilitates membrane deformation, allowing the plasma membrane to form narrow tubes, which is crucial for the formation of clathrin-coated structures (Uezu2011Characterization; Henne2007Structure).

FCHO2 interacts with adaptor proteins such as Eps15 and AP2, which are key components in CME, promoting the clustering of PI(4,5)P2 and enhancing clathrin assembly (Uezu2011Characterization; El2022Structural). This interaction is vital for the recruitment of other endocytic proteins and efficient cargo loading (El2022Structural). FCHO2 is also involved in maintaining Golgi architecture, particularly in the formation of Golgi ribbons during the reassembly process after mitosis, highlighting its role in cellular organization and membrane dynamics (Bagley2023Mon1a).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FCHO2 gene, particularly through its circular RNA form circFCHO2, have been implicated in the progression of melanoma. The circular RNA circFCHO2 is significantly upregulated in melanoma tissues compared to benign nevus tissues, suggesting its specific association with melanoma. This upregulation is linked to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo (Yang2024Circular). The mechanism involves circFCHO2 interacting with the dead end protein homolog 1 (DND1), which affects the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, a critical pathway in cancer progression (Yang2024Circular). High expression levels of circFCHO2 are associated with poorer prognosis in melanoma patients, indicating its potential as an independent risk factor for predicting melanoma outcomes (Yang2024Circular).

In addition to its role in melanoma, the FCHO2 gene has been identified in a genome-wide association study as being located on chromosome 5q13.2, a region associated with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). However, the study does not specifically discuss diseases or conditions associated with mutations or alterations in the FCHO2 gene beyond its mention in the context of HSCR (Bae2016A).

## Interactions
FCHO2 is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and participates in several protein interactions essential for this process. It forms a complex with Eps15 and adaptor protein 2 (AP2), which is crucial for efficient cargo loading at endocytic sites (El2022Structural). The C-terminal μ-homology domain (μ-HD) of FCHO2 directly binds early endocytic proteins such as Eps15, intersectin 1, and CALM, facilitating their recruitment to membranes (El2022Structural). FCHO2 also interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), promoting its clustering on PI(4,5)P2-enriched domains (El2022Structural).

The F-BAR domain of FCHO2 is responsible for membrane-bending activity and interacts with negatively charged lipids, including phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which is crucial for the formation of clathrin-coated structures (El2022Structural). The AP2 Activator motif (APA) within FCHO2's linker domain is essential for activating the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex by destabilizing its closed conformation and promoting an active state (Hollopeter2014The). This interaction is supported by mass spectrometry analysis, which identified AP2 as a major interacting partner (Hollopeter2014The).
