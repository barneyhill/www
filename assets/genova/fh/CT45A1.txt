# CT45A1

## Overview
The CT45A1 gene encodes the cancer/testis antigen family 45 member A1 protein, which is predominantly expressed in various cancer types and is categorized as a cancer/testis antigen. This protein is involved in multiple oncogenic pathways, contributing to tumorigenesis and cancer progression through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. CT45A1 plays a crucial role in modulating transcriptional activity and cellular signaling pathways, such as the SRC-ERK-CREB and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, which are pivotal in cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis (Wen2021CT45A1; Meng2023Cancertestis45A1). Due to its restricted expression in normal tissues and significant presence in tumors, CT45A1 is considered a promising target for cancer immunotherapy and other therapeutic interventions (Coscia2018Multilevel).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The CT45A1 gene is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is associated with tumorigenesis, metastasis, and poor prognosis. In cervical cancer, CT45A1 is overexpressed, particularly in advanced stages, and correlates with reduced survival times. It enhances tumor growth, neovascularization, and resistance to chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, by activating oncogenic pathways like SRC and ERK (Meng2023Cancertestis45A1). In breast cancer, CT45A1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), increasing cell migration and invasion, and is linked to larger tumor formation and metastasis in vivo (Shang2014CT45A1). 

In osteosarcoma, CT45A1 overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and metastasis, particularly to the lungs, through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Wen2021CT45A1). Similarly, in lung cancer, CT45A1 enhances cell proliferation and invasion by modulating the ERK/CREB signaling pathway (Tang2017CT45A1). 

CT45A1 is also a potential target for immunotherapy in ovarian cancer, where it is recognized as a tumor antigen by cytotoxic T cells. Its expression can be upregulated by demethylating agents, enhancing chemosensitivity and immune response (Coscia2018Multilevel). These findings highlight CT45A1's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The CT45A1 protein is involved in several interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cancer progression. In cervical cancer cells, CT45A1 binds to the FN1 gene promoter at a specific sequence, enhancing FN1 gene transcription by promoting promoter activity and interacting with the transcription factor CREB (Meng2023Cancertestis45A1). CT45A1 also interacts with the SRC protein, altering its localization and increasing its kinase activity, which is ATP-dependent. This interaction is part of the CT45A1-FN1-SRC-ERK-CREB and CT45A1-SRC-YAP/TAZ pathways, contributing to tumorigenesis (Meng2023Cancertestis45A1).

In breast cancer cells, CT45A1 binds to a GC-rich motif in the SULF2 gene promoter and interacts with the transcription factor SP1, promoting SULF2 overexpression and enhancing tumorigenesis and invasion (Yang2023The). CT45A1 also interacts with the PP4 complex in ovarian cancer, specifically with regulatory subunits like PP4R3a and PP4R3b, reducing phosphatase activity and influencing DNA damage response signaling (Coscia2018Multilevel). These interactions highlight CT45A1's role in regulating oncogenic pathways and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
