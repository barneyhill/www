# ARTN

## Overview
The ARTN gene encodes the protein artemin, a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family, which is part of the larger transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. Artemin is a neurotrophic factor that plays a crucial role in the development, differentiation, and survival of neurons. It primarily functions through the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and the GFRα3 co-receptor, although it can also interact with other molecules such as the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and syndecan-3, influencing various signaling pathways (Ilieva2019Artemin; Bespalov2011Heparan). The protein is characterized by a cysteine-knot motif and forms a disulfide-linked homodimer, which is essential for its biological activity (Zhu2020The). Artemin's involvement in neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth underscores its significance in neural development and maintenance, while its dysregulation is implicated in conditions such as atopic dermatitis and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Edamitsu2019Aryl; Liu2023Machine).

## Structure
Artemin (ARTN) is a dimeric protein that belongs to the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family, characterized by a cysteine-knot motif typical of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. The protein is initially expressed as a preproprotein with an amino-terminal signal sequence and undergoes cleavage at a dibasic motif (RXXR) by furin to produce a mature form consisting of 113 amino acids. This mature form is a disulfide-linked homodimer with a molecular weight of 28 kDa (Zhu2020The).

The ARTN monomer is composed of two β-sheet fingers, a cystine-knot core motif, and an α-helical heel region. Finger 1 consists of two long continuous antiparallel β strands, while finger 2 has interruptions, resulting in five relatively short β-strands. In the dimer form, the helix in the heel region of one ARTN monomer contacts the finger region of another monomer, with its helical axis nearly perpendicular to the β-strands (Ilieva2019Artemin).

ARTN shares structural similarities with other GDNF family members, such as GDNF and neurturin (NRTN), but differs in the hinge angle between the fingers and the heel, which affects the structure of the homodimer and its signaling properties (Parkash2009Comparison). The protein also contains a putative glycosylation site, which may play a role in its stability and function (Zhu2020The).

## Function
Artemin (ARTN) is a neurotrophic factor that plays a significant role in the development, differentiation, and survival of neurons. It is part of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family and primarily signals through a receptor system involving the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and the GFRα3 co-receptor. ARTN can also interact with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), suggesting alternative signaling pathways (Ilieva2019Artemin; Zhu2020The).

In healthy human cells, ARTN is involved in promoting neurite outgrowth, a critical process for neuronal survival and differentiation. This effect is largely mediated through the RET receptor, although NCAM also plays a crucial role in ARTN-induced neuritogenesis (Ilieva2019Artemin). ARTN activates several intracellular signaling cascades, including the Akt, MAPK-Erk, JNK, and Src pathways, which are essential for regulating cell survival, differentiation, and neurite outgrowth (Ilieva2019Artemin).

ARTN is active in the nervous system, where it supports the survival of sensory and sympathetic neurons and contributes to peripheral nerve homeostasis. It is also involved in the survival of dopaminergic neurons in the brain, highlighting its importance in neural development and maintenance (Zhu2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ARTN gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of atopic dermatitis (AD), ARTN is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and contributes to hypersensitivity to itch, known as alloknesis, by promoting nerve elongation into the epidermis. This overexpression of ARTN is linked to the pathogenesis of AD-like dermatitis, and controlling its expression could be a therapeutic target for AD-associated itch, especially when corticosteroids are ineffective (Edamitsu2019Aryl; Hidaka2016The).

In cancer, high ARTN expression is associated with poor survival outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and estrogen receptor-negative mammary carcinoma (ER-MC). In NSCLC, ARTN is linked to increased tumor growth, metastasis, and maintenance of cancer stem cell characteristics (Liu2023Machine). In ER-MC, ARTN promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing metastatic potential and invasiveness. ARTN's interaction with the transcription factor TWIST1 further exacerbates these oncogenic effects, suggesting its role in cancer progression and as a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Banerjee2011ARTEMIN).

## Interactions
Artemin (ARTN) is a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family and interacts with several proteins to mediate its biological effects. ARTN primarily signals through the GFRα3-RET receptor complex, where it binds to the GFRα3 receptor, which is anchored to the cell membrane, and subsequently activates the RET tyrosine kinase receptor by phosphorylating its intracellular tyrosine residues (Baloh1998Artemin; Zhu2020The). This interaction is crucial for neuronal survival, differentiation, and neurite outgrowth (Ilieva2019Artemin).

ARTN also interacts with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), which serves as an alternative receptor. This interaction is essential for ARTN-induced neuritogenesis and involves the activation of associated signaling partners (Ilieva2019Artemin). ARTN's binding to NCAM is characterized by a low micromolar affinity (Ilieva2019Artemin).

In addition to these interactions, ARTN binds to syndecan-3, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, through its heparan sulfate chains. This binding mediates cell spreading and neurite outgrowth by activating Src kinase pathways (Bespalov2011Heparan). These interactions highlight ARTN's role in various signaling pathways that influence both neuronal and cancer cell behaviors.
