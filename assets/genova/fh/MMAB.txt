# MMAB

## Overview
The MMAB gene encodes the enzyme ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase, which plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) by facilitating the conversion of cob(I)alamin to adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). This enzyme is categorized as a transferase and is essential for the proper functioning of the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM), which is involved in critical metabolic pathways, including the catabolism of certain amino acids and fatty acids. The MMAB protein is a homotrimer, with its active sites located at the interfaces between subunits, where ATP and cobalamin binding occur. Mutations in the MMAB gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as methylmalonic aciduria, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Zhang2009Ligandbinding; Schubert2006Structure; Forny2021Spectrum).

## Structure
The MMAB gene encodes the ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase enzyme, which is crucial for vitamin B12 metabolism. The MMAB protein is a homotrimer, with each subunit composed of a five-helix bundle. The active sites are located at the interfaces between subunits, where ATP and cobalamin binding occur (Schubert2006Structure; Forny2021Spectrum). The primary structure of MMAB includes several invariant residues essential for its function, such as Arg190, Glu193, and Arg194, which are involved in ATP binding (Schubert2006Structure).

The secondary structure of MMAB features a helical ferritin-like architecture, characterized by a bundle of four antiparallel helices (α1, α2, α4, and α5), with an additional helix (α3) in the loop connecting α2 to α4 (Schubert2006Structure). The tertiary structure involves the formation of a trimer, with the active site cleft formed by specific helices and loops from neighboring monomers (Schubert2006Structure).

The quaternary structure of MMAB is a homotrimer, with the trimer interface formed by the supercoil of helices α1 and α4. This structure is stabilized by alternating Glu/Arg residues, which connect to the ATP binding site via hydrogen bonds (Schubert2006Structure).

## Function
The MMAB gene encodes the enzyme ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase, which is crucial for the metabolism of vitamin B12 in human cells. This enzyme facilitates the conversion of cob(I)alamin to adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), an active cofactor required by the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) (Zhang2009Ligandbinding; MorenoGarcia2012The). MCM is involved in the rearrangement of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, a critical step in the catabolism of certain amino acids and fatty acids (Forny2021Spectrum). The MMAB enzyme operates in the mitochondria, where it plays a vital role in energy production and metabolic pathways by ensuring the proper function of MCM (MorenoGarcia2012The).

The enzyme's activity involves the adenosylation of cob(I)alamin using ATP, a process that is essential for the generation of AdoCbl (Zhang2009Ligandbinding). Specific residues, such as Arg190 and Arg186, are critical for the enzyme's function, particularly in the transfer of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group from ATP to cob(I)alamin (Zhang2009Ligandbinding). Mutations in the MMAB gene can impair this process, leading to metabolic disorders such as methylmalonic aciduria (Forny2021Spectrum).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MMAB gene are associated with cblB-type methylmalonic aciduria, an autosomal recessive disorder affecting vitamin B12 metabolism. This condition results from the impaired synthesis of adenosylcobalamin, a cofactor necessary for the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) to function properly. The deficiency in MCM activity leads to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid in the blood and urine, causing symptoms such as lethargy, failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, dehydration, respiratory distress, and hypotonia, often presenting within the first year of life (LernerEllis2006Mutation; Forny2021Spectrum).

The disorder can manifest in two forms: an early-onset severe form, which may present within the first month of life with severe metabolic ketoacidosis and potential coma, and a later-onset form with milder symptoms but possible long-term neurological and renal complications (Forny2021Spectrum). Common mutations in the MMAB gene include missense variants such as p.(Arg186Trp) and p.(Arg191Trp), and truncating variants like c.700C > T (p.(Arg234*)) (Zhang2006Impact; Forny2021Spectrum). Some patients may respond to hydroxocobalamin treatment, which can improve symptoms by enhancing propionate incorporation activity in fibroblasts (Illson2013High; Forny2021Spectrum).

## Interactions
The MMAB protein, encoded by the MMAB gene, plays a crucial role in the metabolism of cobalamin (vitamin B12) by facilitating the conversion of cob(II)alamin to adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). MMAB interacts with several proteins, including methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT) and the G-protein MMAA, forming part of a complex system essential for B12 delivery and repair. MMAB transfers AdoCbl to MMUT, a process that is enhanced by the presence of MMAA, which stabilizes the interaction and facilitates the transfer (Mascarenhas2023Architecture; Forny2021Spectrum).

The interaction between MMAB and MMUT is characterized by the release of AdoCbl from MMAB upon ATP binding, which is favored in the presence of MMUT, suggesting a direct transfer mechanism (Forny2021Spectrum). MMAB also binds ATP at its active sites, and this binding is influenced by MMUT, which reduces the binding affinity of ATP to MMAB (Forny2021Spectrum). These interactions are critical for understanding the pathomechanisms of MMAB deficiency and its role in methylmalonic aciduria (Forny2021Spectrum). The structural and functional interactions of MMAB with these proteins highlight its importance in maintaining cellular metabolic processes (Mascarenhas2023Architecture).
