# DHRS12

## Overview
The DHRS12 gene encodes the protein dehydrogenase/reductase 12, which is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This family of proteins is involved in various metabolic processes, including the oxidation and reduction of a wide range of substrates. Dehydrogenase/reductase 12 is implicated in several biological pathways and has been associated with immune system development and disease pathogenesis. The gene's expression and methylation patterns have been linked to conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, suggesting its role in inflammatory processes and epigenetic regulation (Li2021Insights). Additionally, DHRS12 is involved in predicting treatment responses in acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Croucher2023Spliceosome).

## Clinical Significance
The DHRS12 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and methylation patterns. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patients exhibit altered DNA methylation patterns in immune cells, including a differentiated methylation signature in the DHRS12 gene. This suggests a potential role for DHRS12 in inflammatory and matrix-related pathways contributing to RA pathogenesis (Li2021Insights). Similarly, in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), DHRS12 is noted for its methylation signature, indicating its involvement in the disease's epigenetic landscape (Li2021Insights).

In the context of neonatal calves, the DHRS12 gene is associated with immune system development. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within an intron of DHRS12 is linked to albumin levels, and its expression is reduced in certain breeds post-birth, suggesting a role in early immune function (Johnston2020Genome).

Additionally, DHRS12 is part of a gene expression signature that predicts response to a combination treatment in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), indicating its potential involvement in treatment sensitivity (Croucher2023Spliceosome). These findings highlight the gene's diverse roles in disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses.
