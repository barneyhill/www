# TMEM94

## Overview
TMEM94 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 94, a putatively nuclear protein characterized by predicted multi-pass membrane domains. This protein is involved in critical cellular processes, including cell-cycle progression, particularly during the G2/M phase, and is believed to interact with key proteins such as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and acidic fibroblast growth factor intracellular-binding protein (FIBP) (Stephen2018Biallelic). The evolutionary conservation of its C-terminal region underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating cellular communication and transport (Stephen2018Biallelic). TMEM94 is expressed in various tissues and plays a vital role in normal embryonic development, with its dysfunction linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and congenital heart defects (Stephen2018Biallelic). The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in both normal physiology and disease states.

## Function
TMEM94, or transmembrane protein 94, is a gene that encodes a putatively nuclear protein with predicted multi-pass membrane domains and several serine residues for phosphorylation or glycosylation (Stephen2018Biallelic). The C-terminal region of TMEM94 is evolutionarily conserved, indicating its importance in cellular processes (Stephen2018Biallelic). TMEM94 is implicated in cell-cycle progression, particularly in the G2/M phase, and is known to possibly interact with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and acidic fibroblast growth factor intracellular-binding protein (FIBP), both essential for cell division (Stephen2018Biallelic).

In healthy cells, TMEM94 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and is believed to play a role in cellular communication and transport, although its precise molecular functions are still under investigation. The gene is expressed in various tissues and is essential for normal embryonic development, as evidenced by studies in mouse models where loss of TMEM94 leads to embryonic lethality and abnormalities in multiple tissues, including the nervous and cardiovascular systems (Stephen2018Biallelic). TMEM94's involvement in these critical developmental processes underscores its significance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM94 gene, particularly bi-allelic truncating variants, are associated with a syndrome characterized by neurodevelopmental delay, congenital heart defects, and distinct facial dysmorphism. This condition has been observed in multiple individuals from unrelated families, with common clinical features including triangular face, widely spaced eyes, thick eyebrows, and cardiac abnormalities such as atrial septal defect and Tetralogy of Fallot (Stephen2018Biallelic). The TMEM94 gene is located on chromosome 17q25.1 and encodes a protein with predicted multi-pass membrane domains. The C-terminal region of TMEM94 is evolutionarily conserved and is disrupted in affected individuals, suggesting its importance in normal development (Stephen2018Biallelic).

Research has shown that TMEM94 is crucial for neural and cardiovascular development. Knockout studies in mice indicate that loss of Tmem94 leads to embryonic lethality and abnormalities in the nervous and cardiovascular systems (Stephen2018Biallelic). In humans, affected individuals exhibit a range of symptoms, including learning disabilities, speech delay, and specific facial features such as synophrys and a flat nasal bridge (Stephen2018Biallelic). The gene's role in cell-cycle progression and its induction under hypoxic conditions in breast cancer cell lines further highlight its involvement in cell division and development (Stephen2018Biallelic).

## Interactions
TMEM94 is suggested to interact with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and acidic fibroblast growth factor intracellular-binding protein (FIBP), both of which are essential for cell division. However, expression profiling studies did not show significant dysregulation of CDK5 and FIBP, indicating that while TMEM94 may interact with these proteins, the interactions might not significantly alter their expression levels (Stephen2018Biallelic). The phenotypic similarities between TMEM94 and FIBP variants suggest possible functional overlap, which could imply a shared pathway or interaction network (Stephen2018Biallelic).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TMEM94 has been associated with Parkinson's disease, suggesting its involvement in broader protein interaction networks related to neurodegeneration. This association highlights the potential for TMEM94 to participate in interactions that influence neurodegenerative processes, although specific interaction partners in this context are not detailed (Oviya2024ComorbidityGuided).

Overall, while TMEM94 is implicated in interactions with CDK5 and FIBP, the precise nature and impact of these interactions require further investigation to fully understand their biological significance.
