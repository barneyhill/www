# SMIM10L2A

## Overview
SMIM10L2A is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 10 like 2A, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is implicated in the regulation of cell signaling pathways, particularly those associated with cancer progression and response to chemotherapy. Research has shown that SMIM10L2A plays a role in the prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer, where its expression levels are correlated with patient outcomes (LI2016Integrated; Li2019Integrated). Additionally, SMIM10L2A is involved in the cellular response to 5-fluorouracil treatment, linking it to the p53 signaling pathway, which is essential for cell cycle control and apoptosis (Rodrigues2021New). These findings suggest that SMIM10L2A may serve as a valuable biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment efficacy.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
SMIM10L2A has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric cancer (GC). In ESCC, SMIM10L2A is negatively associated with patient prognosis, with its downregulation in tumor tissues linked to advanced TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. This suggests that SMIM10L2A may serve as a potential biomarker for ESCC prognosis (Li2019Integrated). In gastric cancer, SMIM10L2A is part of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and is positively correlated with overall survival, indicating its potential role as a prognostic biomarker (LI2016Integrated).

In the context of chemotherapy, SMIM10L2A expression is affected by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment in human intestinal organoids. It is associated with the p53 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The downregulation of SMIM10L2A following 5-FU exposure suggests its involvement in the cellular response to this chemotherapeutic agent, particularly in the small intestine (Rodrigues2021New). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of SMIM10L2A in cancer progression and treatment response.
