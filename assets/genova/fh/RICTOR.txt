# RICTOR

## Overview
RICTOR (Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR) is a gene that encodes a protein component of the mTORC2 (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2), which is a critical regulator of cell growth, survival, and metabolism. The RICTOR protein is not a kinase itself but plays a pivotal role in the mTORC2 complex, which is involved in the phosphorylation of key signaling proteins such as Akt and protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), thereby influencing various cellular processes including cytoskeletal organization and insulin signaling (Ikenoue2008Essential; Guertin2006Ablation). The mTORC2 complex, with RICTOR as a core component, is essential for the full activation of Akt, a kinase that is crucial for cell survival and metabolism (Yang2007Expanding). Alterations in RICTOR expression or function have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers, where it contributes to tumor growth and progression by modulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Yu2022Attacking). As such, RICTOR and the mTORC2 complex are considered significant targets for therapeutic intervention in oncology (Saxton2017mTOR).

## Structure
The RICTOR protein is a key component of the mTORC2 complex, characterized by a complex molecular structure. It is composed of three interacting stacks of α-helical repeats: the ARM domain (AD), the HEAT-like domain (HD), and the C-terminal domain (CD). The N-terminal AD forms a superhelical arrangement of nine ARM repeats, which structurally separates the HD and CD. The HD consists of 10 HEAT-like repeats, while the CD includes a four-helix bundle and a zinc finger with bound Zn2+ (Scaiola2020The).

The phosphorylation site region (PR) is an extended stretch of residues between the HD and CD, predicted to be disordered and containing most of RICTOR's phosphorylation sites. This region is anchored by a two-stranded β-sheet at the top of the HD (Scaiola2020The). RICTOR's structure also includes a nucleotide binding site forming a zinc finger, which is suggested to play a role in folding or ternary interactions (Scaiola2020The).

In terms of quaternary structure, RICTOR interacts with other proteins in the mTORC2 complex, forming a symmetric dimer of heterotetramer (mTOR-Rictor-mLST8-mSin1) (Yang2018The). The protein's structure is crucial for the rapamycin insensitivity of mTORC2, as the CD of RICTOR blocks the binding space of FKBP12-rapamycin (Scaiola2020The).

## Function
RICTOR is a critical component of the mTORC2 complex, which plays a significant role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, survival, and metabolism. In healthy human cells, RICTOR is essential for the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif (HM) and turn motif (TM) in protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) and Akt, which are crucial for their maturation, stability, and signaling functions (Ikenoue2008Essential; Guertin2006Ablation). The mTORC2 complex, with RICTOR as a key subunit, is involved in the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, a modification necessary for Akt's full activation and its role in cell survival and metabolism (Yang2007Expanding).

RICTOR also influences cytoskeletal organization, impacting cell shape and movement by modulating the phosphorylation of PKCα and the actin cytoskeleton (Dos2004Rictor). It is active in the cytoplasm and affects insulin signaling pathways, contributing to metabolic homeostasis and organismal development (Oh2011mTOR). The regulation of RICTOR's interaction with mTOR is crucial for the stability and activity of the mTORC2 complex, which is modulated by USP9X-mediated deubiquitination, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular signaling pathways (Wrobel2020mTORC2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RICTOR gene, a key component of the mTORC2 complex, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In ovarian cancer, RICTOR is expressed in circulating tumor cells, suggesting a role in disease progression (Rogers‑Broadway2018Differential). Increased expression of RICTOR has been observed in multiple human cancers, including brain, lung, breast, gastric, liver, and colon cancers, where it contributes to tumor growth by modulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Yu2022Attacking). RICTOR gene amplification has been reported in breast, gastric, and lung cancers, and in lung cancer, this amplification may guide the selection of patients for mTOR inhibitor treatments (Yu2022Attacking).

In prostate cancer, RICTOR is essential for tumor growth in models driven by PTEN loss, highlighting its role in cancers involving the PI3K/Akt pathway (Saxton2017mTOR). The RICTOR-mTOR complex is crucial for the phosphorylation and activation of Akt, a kinase involved in cell survival and growth, and its deregulation is linked to cancer pathogenesis (Sarbassov2005Phosphorylation). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RICTOR in cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RICTOR is a key component of the mTORC2 complex, where it interacts with mTOR, SIN1, and mLST8. This complex is crucial for the phosphorylation of Akt at the S473 site, which is essential for Akt activation and subsequent cellular processes (Sarbassov2005Phosphorylation; Gkountakos2018Unmasking). RICTOR also forms a complex with Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK), which is important for TGF beta-1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Akt S473 phosphorylation (Gkountakos2018Unmasking).

In cancer cells, RICTOR interacts with FBXW7 to form an E3 ligase complex that targets oncogenes like c-Myc and cyclin E for degradation (Gkountakos2018Unmasking). It also associates with Culin-1 to form a complex with E3 ubiquitination ligase activity targeting SGK1 (Gkountakos2018Unmasking). In glioblastoma, the interaction between RICTOR and mTOR is crucial for mTORC2 activity, and inhibitors like CID613034 can specifically block this interaction, reducing mTORC2 activity without affecting mTORC1 (BenavidesSerrato2017Specific).

RICTOR also interacts with POTEE in tumor-associated macrophages, contributing to mTORC2 activation and influencing cell invasion and motility (Vekariya2019Identification). These interactions highlight RICTOR's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
