# H3C13

## Overview
The H3C13 gene encodes the H3 clustered histone 13 protein, which is a member of the histone protein family. Histones are essential components of chromatin, the complex of DNA and protein found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, and play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating or hindering the access of transcriptional machinery to DNA. The H3 clustered histone 13 protein is specifically involved in the formation of nucleosomes, the basic structural unit of chromatin, by wrapping DNA around histone octamers. This process is crucial for DNA packaging and the maintenance of genomic stability. The H3C13 gene, like other histone genes, is highly conserved across species, reflecting its fundamental role in cellular processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
