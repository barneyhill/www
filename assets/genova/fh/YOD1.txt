# YOD1

## Overview
YOD1 is a gene that encodes the YOD1 deubiquitinase, a crucial enzyme involved in the regulation of protein homeostasis within cells. As a deubiquitinating enzyme, YOD1 plays a significant role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it aids in the dislocation and degradation of misfolded proteins, thus maintaining cellular protein quality control (Ernst2009The). The YOD1 protein is characterized by its UBX and Zinc finger domains, which facilitate its interaction with the p97 complex and other substrates, underscoring its importance in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway (Kim2017Deubiquitinase). Beyond its fundamental cellular functions, YOD1 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Pei2023miR221222; Farkas2023The).

## Structure


## Function
YOD1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis in healthy human cells. It is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it facilitates the dislocation and degradation of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol. This process is essential for the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which targets these proteins for degradation (Ernst2009The). YOD1 associates with the p97 complex, interacting with components such as Derlin-1 and UBXD8, to process ubiquitinated dislocation substrates, thereby aiding in their translocation and degradation (Ernst2009The).

YOD1's deubiquitinating activity is crucial for removing ubiquitin chains from substrates, allowing their proper processing and degradation. This activity is dependent on its UBX and Zinc finger domains, which are important for its interaction with p97 and substrates (Ernst2009The). In addition to its role in ERAD, YOD1 is involved in regulating the Hippo signaling pathway by stabilizing ITCH, an E3 ligase, which enhances YAP/TAZ activities, influencing cell proliferation and organ size (Kim2017Deubiquitinase). YOD1 is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, responding to cellular stress and maintaining protein quality control (Tanji2018YOD1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the YOD1 gene have been implicated in several cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), YOD1 is downregulated due to the overexpression of miR-221/222, which targets YOD1 and leads to decreased stability of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This destabilization of p53 contributes to the pathogenesis of AML by promoting its degradation, thereby affecting cell survival and apoptosis (Pei2023miR221222).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), YOD1 is significantly overexpressed and is associated with poor prognosis. High YOD1 expression correlates with reduced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and increased cancer stem cell characteristics, suggesting a role in tumor progression and immune escape (Zhang2022YOD1).

YOD1 is also upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it stabilizes CDK1, a protein involved in cell cycle progression. This upregulation is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor growth and metastasis, indicating that YOD1 promotes TNBC tumorigenesis (Han2023Deubiquitylase).

In Huntington's disease models, YOD1 overexpression ameliorates neurodegeneration and improves motor performance, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in modulating pathology induced by mutant Huntingtin (Farkas2023The).

## Interactions
YOD1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It associates with the p97 complex, interacting specifically with p97, NPL4, and UFD1. This interaction is crucial for the dislocation of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Ernst2009The). The interaction between YOD1 and p97 is dependent on the UBX domain of YOD1, while the C-terminal Zinc finger domain is not necessary for this association (Ernst2009The).

YOD1 also interacts with the signaling adaptor MAVS, where it cleaves K63-linked ubiquitin chains, thereby inhibiting virus-induced type I IFN responses. This interaction involves the UBX and Znf domains of YOD1 and the proline-rich domain of MAVS (Liu2019The).

In the context of NF-kB signaling, YOD1 interacts with TRAF6 and p62. It acts as a negative regulator by competing with p62 for TRAF6 binding, preventing the formation of p62/TRAF6 aggregates, and inhibiting IL-1-induced NF-kB activation (Schimmack2017YOD1TRAF6). These interactions highlight YOD1's role in modulating key signaling pathways through its deubiquitinating activity.
