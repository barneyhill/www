# SRFBP1

## Overview
SRFBP1, or serum response factor binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a transcription cofactor known as p49/STRAP. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression related to cytoskeletal and muscle-specific functions by interacting with the serum response factor (SRF). Characterized by its SRF-binding domain and BUD22 domain, SRFBP1 is involved in ribosome biogenesis and cellular morphogenesis. The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus but also associates with the cytoplasm and actin, suggesting its involvement in maintaining cellular structure and function. SRFBP1 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cardiac morphology, cancer, and viral infections, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease states (Zhang2014Overexpression; Gerold2019Hepatitis; Zhao2021Intrinsic).

## Structure
The SRFBP1 protein, also known as p49/STRAP, is characterized by its specific domains and structural features. It contains an SRF-binding domain at the N-terminus and a BUD22 domain at the C-terminus. The SRF-binding domain is highly conserved across mammalian species, xenopus, and zebrafish, while the BUD22 domain is conserved among mammalian p49/STRAP proteins and yeast cellular morphogenesis proteins (Zhang2014Overexpression; Zhao2021Intrinsic). The BUD22 domain is involved in ribosome biogenesis and cellular morphogenesis (Zhang2014Overexpression).

SRFBP1 is a 429-residue-long protein with a high intrinsic disorder status, having a disorder content of 0.60. This intrinsic disorder is associated with numerous post-translational modification (PTM) sites, which are localized in intrinsically disordered regions, suggesting a role in PTM-driven regulation of its functionality (Zhao2021Intrinsic). The protein also contains four nuclear localization signal sequences (NLSs) (Zhang2014Overexpression).

SRFBP1 interacts with the serum response factor (SRF) and is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal and muscle-specific genes. It is also identified as a host factor for all seven genotypes of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry (Gerold2019Hepatitis; Zhao2021Intrinsic).

## Function
SRFBP1, also known as p49/STRAP, is a transcription cofactor that interacts with the serum response factor (SRF) to regulate gene expression related to the cytoskeleton and muscle-specific functions. It contains two conserved domains: an SRF-binding domain at the N-terminus and a BUD22 domain at the C-terminus. The SRF-binding domain is crucial for its role in modulating SRF's transcriptional activity, impacting genes involved in cytoskeletal organization and muscle differentiation (Zhang2014Overexpression).

SRFBP1 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it acts as a cofactor for SRF, but it is also found in the cytoplasm and associated with actin. This localization suggests its involvement in maintaining cellular structure and function through interactions with the cytoskeleton (Zhang2014Overexpression). Overexpression of SRFBP1 has been shown to reduce actin content, alter cell morphology, and decrease cell size, indicating its role in regulating cell size and morphology (Zhang2014Overexpression).

SRFBP1 also interacts with NDUFAB1, a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase, influencing intracellular NAD levels and the NAD/NADH ratio, which are critical for cellular metabolism and gene expression (Zhang2008Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRFBP1 gene, also known as p49/STRAP, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Overexpression of SRFBP1 in cells and transgenic mice has been shown to reduce actin content and cell size, leading to anatomical malformations, particularly in cardiac tissues. This suggests a role in cardiac morphology and function, potentially contributing to cardiomyopathy and other cardiac abnormalities (Zhang2014Overexpression). 

In the context of cancer, SRFBP1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene with frameshift mutations in colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI). These mutations may retain partial biological activity, contributing to cancer-related functions (Bokhari2018Targeting). 

Additionally, SRFBP1 is involved in lipid metabolism and resistance mechanisms in cancer. In breast cancer, its expression is linked to the unfolded protein response and resistance to anti-estrogen therapies. Reducing SRFBP1 levels in resistant cells can lead to decreased fatty acid synthesis and increased sensitivity to treatment, indicating its role in maintaining cancer cell survival (Direito2018Contribution). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of SRFBP1 in both cardiovascular and cancer-related pathologies.
