# TMED5

## Overview
TMED5 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 5, a member of the transmembrane emp24 domain (TMED) family. This protein is categorized as a type I single-pass transmembrane protein and plays a pivotal role in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. It is involved in the transport and sorting of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein processing (Aber2019Transmembrane). The protein is characterized by a luminal Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) domain, a luminal coiled-coil domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytosolic tail, which are crucial for its function in vesicle-mediated protein transport and cellular signaling pathways (Roberts2023The; Mota2022Structural). TMED5 is implicated in various cellular processes, including vesicle budding and cargo selection, and has been associated with the regulation of signaling pathways in cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yang2018GRSF1mediatedMIRG1promotes; Cheng2022Silencing).

## Structure
TMED5 is a type I single-pass transmembrane protein that is part of the TMED family, which is involved in protein transport within the secretory pathway. The protein is characterized by a common structural organization that includes a luminal Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) domain, a luminal coiled-coil domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytosolic tail (Aber2019Transmembrane). The GOLD domain is involved in dimerization and substrate recognition, and it shares structural similarities with other TMED proteins, such as TMED1, TMED2, and TMED10, featuring a β-sandwich fold (Roberts2023The; Mota2022Structural). 

The transmembrane domain of TMED5 interacts with lipids, aiding in vesicle budding, while the cytoplasmic tail contains motifs crucial for binding to coatomer (COP) proteins, which are essential for cargo selection and vesicle formation (Aber2019Transmembrane). TMED5 is also noted for its role in regulating the transport of various cargo proteins, including glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and secreted proteins like Notch and G-protein-coupled receptors (Aber2019Transmembrane). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may influence the function and stability of TMED5, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in vesicular trafficking and cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
TMED5, a member of the transmembrane emp24 domain (TMED) family, plays a crucial role in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. It is involved in the transport and sorting of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein processing (Aber2019Transmembrane). TMED5 is a type I single-pass transmembrane protein that participates in both anterograde and retrograde transport, interacting with coatomer (COP) protein complexes to facilitate cargo selection and vesicle formation (Aber2019Transmembrane).

Structurally, TMED5 contains a luminal Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) domain, a luminal coiled-coil domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytosolic tail. The GOLD domain is involved in dimerization, which is crucial for its function in vesicle budding and protein transport (Aber2019Transmembrane). TMED5 is active in the ER, Golgi intermediate compartment, and the cis-Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to vesicle-mediated protein transport (Cheng2022Silencing).

While specific functions of TMED5 in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed, its role in protein transport and vesicular trafficking suggests it is vital for cellular processes such as secretion and signaling (Aber2019Transmembrane).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMED5 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cervical cancer. In HCC, TMED5 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor overall survival in early-stage patients. Silencing TMED5 in HCC cells inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion while enhancing apoptosis, suggesting its role in promoting malignant behavior (Cheng2022Silencing).

In cervical cancer, TMED5 overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis. It interacts with the WNT7B protein, activating the WNT-CTNNB1/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with enhanced malignancy. TMED5 expression is significantly correlated with the clinical stage of cervical cancer, indicating its potential as a molecular marker for the disease (Yang2018GRSF1mediatedMIRG1promotes).

The circ_0018289/miR-183-5p/TMED5 regulatory network also plays a role in cervical cancer development. TMED5 is directly targeted and inhibited by miR-183-5p, and its expression is modulated by circ_0018289, contributing to tumor growth and angiogenesis (Zou2021Identification). These findings highlight TMED5's significance in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TMED5, a member of the p24 family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. In cervical cancer cells, TMED5 interacts with WNT7B, which is essential for activating the WNT-CTNNB1/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction promotes malignant behaviors such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and drug resistance (Yang2018GRSF1mediatedMIRG1promotes). TMED5 is also upregulated by MIR-G-1 in a GRSF1-dependent manner, which enhances its expression and contributes to the malignant phenotype in cervical cancer (Yang2018GRSF1mediatedMIRG1promotes).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, TMED5 is involved in key signaling pathways, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathways. Silencing TMED5 leads to decreased expression of several genes associated with these pathways, indicating its role in cell cycle regulation and cancer progression (Cheng2022Silencing). TMED5's interactions with these pathways suggest its involvement in the proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis of HCC cells (Cheng2022Silencing).
