# CDCP1

## Overview
CDCP1, or CUB domain containing protein 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. The protein product of CDCP1 is characterized by a single transmembrane domain, three extracellular CUB domains, and a large intracellular domain with multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. These structural features facilitate its role in transmembrane signaling and interaction with other proteins, such as Src family kinases and protein kinase C delta, which are crucial for its function in cellular dynamics and cancer progression (Alvares2008The; Iwata2014CDCP1). CDCP1 is expressed in normal epithelial cells and has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance (Khan2021The).

## Structure
The CDCP1 protein is a type I single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein composed of 836 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 135-140 kDa, including 30-40 kDa of N-linked glycans (He2010Proteolysisinduced). The primary structure includes a 29-residue N-terminal signal peptide, which is cleaved post-translationally (He2010Proteolysisinduced). The protein features a transmembrane domain located between amino acid residues 666-691 and a signal peptide at residues 1-29 (ScherlMostageer2001Identification).

CDCP1 contains three CUB domains in its extracellular region, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are structurally related to immunoglobulin domains (ScherlMostageer2001Identification). The secondary structure is characterized by interweaving β sheets forming a stable β sheet bundle, as revealed by structural analyses (Lim2022Targeting). The tertiary structure includes a large ectodomain, heavily glycosylated, and predicted to contain three CUB-like domains (Lim2022Targeting).

Post-translational modifications of CDCP1 include phosphorylation, which is crucial for its function in cell signaling. The intracellular domain contains five tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which are involved in downstream signaling pathways (Lim2022Targeting). Proteolytic cleavage of CDCP1 results in a cleaved form (c-CDCP1) and a full-length form (fl-CDCP1), with minimal conformational change between them (Lim2022Targeting). The cleaved form is associated with tumor-promoting functions, such as phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues (Lim2022Targeting).

## Function
CDCP1 (CUB domain containing protein 1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. It is characterized by a single transmembrane domain, three extracellular CUB domains, and a large intracellular domain with five tyrosine residues (Iwata2014CDCP1). In healthy human cells, CDCP1 is expressed in normal epithelial cells and plays a role in regulating Src Family Kinases (SFKs) and Protein Kinase C delta (PKC-d), which are essential for cell adhesion responses (Alvares2008The). 

CDCP1 is involved in transmembrane signaling, particularly in response to changes in cell adhesion. It is phosphorylated by SFKs at tyrosine residue Y734, which is necessary for its function in cell adhesion and signaling (Alvares2008The). This phosphorylation is associated with the formation of detergent-resistant membrane clusters, which are important for its signaling function (Alvares2008The). 

In the context of bone marrow stromal cells, CDCP1 is identified as a marker for a distinct subset of fibroblasts involved in cytokine production, supporting myeloid differentiation and expansion (Iwata2014CDCP1). CDCP1's role in these processes highlights its importance in cellular dynamics and tissue remodeling.

## Clinical Significance
CDCP1 (CUB domain containing protein 1) is significantly implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. In colorectal cancer, CDCP1 is overexpressed and contributes to metastasis, particularly to the lung, through mechanisms involving the WNT signaling pathway and interactions with E-cadherin and β-catenin (ScherlMostageer2001Identification; Khan2021The). In breast cancer, CDCP1 interacts with HER2 and EGFR, promoting SRC activation and contributing to poor prognosis, especially in triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes (Khan2021The). 

In lung adenocarcinoma, high CDCP1 expression is linked to lymph node metastasis and tumor relapse, correlating with lower survival rates (Wortmann2009The). CDCP1 also plays a role in treatment resistance across various cancers, including resistance to chemotherapies like doxorubicin in HeLa cells and carboplatin in ovarian carcinoma, often through pathways involving AKT signaling (Khan2021The). 

In prostate cancer, CDCP1 overexpression is associated with resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy, particularly in PTEN-deficient cells (Khan2021The). Despite its oncogenic roles, CDCP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts, such as in specific breast cancer models (Khan2021The).

## Interactions
CDCP1 (CUB domain containing protein 1) is known to engage in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes and cancer progression. CDCP1 interacts with Src family kinases (SFKs), including Src, Yes, and Fyn, which phosphorylate CDCP1 at specific tyrosine residues such as Y734. This phosphorylation facilitates the formation of a multiprotein complex with protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), playing a role in cellular resistance to anoikis and cancer metastasis (Wortmann2009The; Liu2011CUBdomain–containing).

CDCP1 also interacts with the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, particularly at the Y734 and Y743 residues. This interaction is significant in cancer cells and is modulated by cell confluence and antibody-mediated triggering of CDCP1 (Gandji2015The).

In the context of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, CDCP1 acts as a co-receptor, binding directly to TGF-β ligands and enhancing TGF-β1 signaling through increased phosphorylation of Smad2. This interaction is independent of Src activation, highlighting a distinct pathway through which CDCP1 modulates TGF-β signaling (Predes2019CUB).
