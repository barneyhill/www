# CIMAP1C

## Overview
CIMAP1C is a gene that encodes the protein ciliary microtubule associated protein 1C, which plays a crucial role in the structural and functional integrity of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that are involved in movement and sensory functions. The protein encoded by CIMAP1C is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, which is essential for the stabilization and organization of microtubules within cilia. These microtubules are critical for the proper functioning of cilia, influencing processes such as cell signaling and motility. The precise mechanisms by which CIMAP1C influences ciliary function are still under investigation, but its role is considered vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.
