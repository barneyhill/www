# FGD3

## Overview
FGD3 is a gene that encodes the protein FYVE, RhoGEF, and PH domain containing 3, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). This protein plays a critical role in cellular signaling pathways by activating the Rho GTPase CDC42, thereby influencing cytoskeletal organization, cell shape, and movement. The protein is characterized by the presence of FYVE, RhoGEF, and PH domains, which are essential for its function in activating Rho GTPases. FGD3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it regulates processes such as cell migration and differentiation. Its activity is particularly significant in inhibiting cell migration, which is crucial for maintaining cellular organization and preventing metastasis in cancerous tissues (Renda2019Expression; Susini2021Immunohistochemical). The gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including skeletal dysplasia in cattle and as a prognostic biomarker in human cancers, underscoring its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Takasuga2015Nonsynonymous; Ou2014Breast).

## Function
The FGD3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor targeting the cell division control protein 42 (CDC42), a member of the Rho GTPase family. This protein is involved in cellular signaling pathways that regulate cytoskeletal organization, cell shape, and movement. FGD3 contains FYVE, RhoGEF, and PH domains, which are crucial for its role in activating Rho GTPases, particularly CDC42 (Renda2019Expression; Susini2021Immunohistochemical).

In healthy human cells, FGD3 is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences processes such as cell migration and differentiation. By activating CDC42, FGD3 induces changes in cell morphology through the formation of lamellipodia, which are cellular protrusions that play a key role in cell movement and adhesion (Renda2019Expression; Susini2021Immunohistochemical). The protein's activity is associated with inhibiting cell migration, which is significant in both normal and neoplastic cells. This inhibitory role is particularly important in maintaining cellular organization and preventing uncontrolled cell movement, which can lead to metastasis in cancerous tissues (Renda2019Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FGD3 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In Japanese Black cattle, a non-synonymous variant of FGD3 is associated with skeletal dysplasia and disproportional tall stature, which affects carcass weight and leads to economic losses in farming. This variant results in reduced guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, causing disorganization of chondrocytes and contributing to skeletal abnormalities (Takasuga2015Nonsynonymous).

In humans, the FGD3 gene has been studied in the context of cancer. The FGD3-SUSD3 metagene is a significant prognostic biomarker in breast cancer, with high expression levels associated with a favorable prognosis. This metagene has been shown to outperform traditional breast cancer subtype classifications and receptor status in predicting outcomes (Ou2014Breast). Additionally, FGD3 is part of a five-gene signature related to resistance against epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in lung adenocarcinoma. This signature serves as an independent prognostic factor, aiding in patient stratification and potentially guiding therapeutic strategies (Zhou2022Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FGD3 in both skeletal disorders and cancer prognosis.
