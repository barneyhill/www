# RTL8C

## Overview
RTL8C is a human gene that encodes the retrotransposon Gag-like 8C protein, a member of the retrotransposon Gag-like family. This protein is characterized by a unique leucine zipper motif, which distinguishes it from its paralogs, RTL8A and RTL8B. The RTL8C protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is involved in modulating virus-like particle (VLP) production through its interaction with the PEG10 protein. Although RTL8C cannot independently form VLPs, it can incorporate into PEG10-derived VLPs, albeit inefficiently, suggesting a regulatory role in PEG10-mediated processes. The gene has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, including Angelman Syndrome and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Campodonico2023The; Fujioka2024Targeting; KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived).

## Structure
The RTL8C protein in mice is composed of 112 amino acids and features a unique leucine zipper motif, which is a distinguishing structural element located between amino acids 76-97. This motif is not present in the closely related RTL8A and RTL8B proteins, which encode identical proteins with 113 amino acids (Fujioka2024Targeting). The leucine zipper motif is a common structural feature that facilitates protein-protein interactions, often involved in dimerization or oligomerization processes.

The RTL8C protein is localized in the cytoplasm, contrasting with RTL8A, which is found in the nuclei (Fujioka2024Targeting). While the primary sequence and specific secondary structures such as alpha helices or beta sheets are not detailed in the available context, the presence of the leucine zipper suggests a role in forming higher-order structures, potentially influencing its function in cellular processes.

The interaction of RTL8C with the PEG10 capsid domain, specifically the N-terminal lobe, indicates a functional role in modulating virus-like particle (VLP) production, although the exact quaternary structure or assembly details remain unspecified (Campodonico2023The). The protein's structural features may contribute to its regulatory role in PEG10-mediated processes.

## Clinical Significance
The RTL8C gene, part of the retrotransposon Gag-like family, has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Alterations in the expression of RTL8C, along with its paralogs RTL8A and RTL8B, have been associated with conditions such as Angelman Syndrome (AS) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In AS, RTL8C proteins accumulate in neurons, suggesting they are targets of the UBE3A gene, which is known to be involved in the disorder (KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived). Conversely, in ALS, RTL8C levels decrease, indicating a potential protective role against proteasome-dependent degradation (Fujioka2024Targeting).

Research on double knockout mice for RTL8A and RTL8B, which are closely related to RTL8C, shows reduced social interaction and increased apathy, symptoms that parallel those observed in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) patients. This suggests that RTL8C may also be involved in PWS, although direct evidence is still under investigation (Fujioka2024Targeting). The gene's interaction with the GABRB2 receptor, which is linked to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, further underscores its potential clinical significance (Fujioka2024Targeting). These findings highlight the importance of RTL8C in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex conditions.

## Interactions
RTL8C, a human gene encoding a retrotransposon Gag-like protein, is involved in interactions with the PEG10 protein, particularly in the context of virus-like particle (VLP) formation. RTL8C cannot independently form VLPs but can incorporate into PEG10-derived VLPs when co-expressed with PEG10. This incorporation is inefficient, as the abundance of RTL8C in the VLP fraction is significantly lower than that of PEG10. The presence of RTL8C reduces the extracellular abundance of PEG10 VLPs, suggesting that RTL8C may inhibit VLP formation or release by acting as a competitive inhibitor of PEG10 capsid assembly. This inhibition is thought to occur through RTL8C mimicking the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the PEG10 capsid, thereby restricting VLP abundance (Campodonico2023The).

RTL8C interacts specifically with the NTD of the PEG10 capsid, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is facilitated by the NTD of PEG10, which is necessary and sufficient for binding with RTL8C. Structural modeling suggests that this interaction resembles the homotypic capsid NTD:NTD interactions typical of retroelement capsid assembly (Campodonico2023The). These interactions highlight RTL8C's role in modulating PEG10 VLP formation and release, potentially impacting PEG10's biological functions in human cells.
