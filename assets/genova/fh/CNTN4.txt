# CNTN4

## Overview
CNTN4, or contactin 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, specifically functioning as a cell adhesion molecule. The protein contactin 4 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes six immunoglobulin-like domains and four fibronectin type III domains, and is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. This structural configuration facilitates its role in neural development, particularly in processes such as axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and neuritogenesis. Contactin 4 is expressed in various regions of the brain, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus, with its expression peaking during early developmental stages. The gene's involvement in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, underscores its clinical significance. Mutations and alterations in CNTN4 have been linked to a range of conditions, highlighting its critical role in neuronal connectivity and brain function (OguroAndo2021Cntn4; OguroAndo2017A; Mercati2013Contactin).

## Structure
CNTN4 (contactin 4) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes six immunoglobulin-like domains and four fibronectin type III domains. These domains contribute to its role in cell adhesion, a critical function in neural development and connectivity. The protein is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which facilitates its interactions with other cell surface molecules.

Post-translational modifications of CNTN4 may include glycosylation, which can influence its stability, localization, and interaction with other proteins. Glycosylation is a common modification for proteins involved in cell adhesion, as it can affect the protein's binding properties and cellular signaling pathways.

CNTN4 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functional roles or localization patterns within the cell. These isoforms allow for a diversity of functions and regulatory mechanisms, which can be crucial for the protein's involvement in various cellular processes. The specific structural features and modifications of CNTN4 underscore its importance in the nervous system and its potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Function
Contactin 4 (CNTN4) is a member of the immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecule superfamily, playing a critical role in neural development. It is involved in processes such as axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and neuritogenesis, which are essential for the establishment and maintenance of neuronal networks (OguroAndo2017A; Mercati2013Contactin). CNTN4 is expressed in various brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus, with its expression peaking in the early stages of development (OguroAndo2021Cntn4; OguroAndo2017A).

At the molecular level, CNTN4 interacts with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (Ptpra) and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G (PTPRG), which are involved in intracellular transport and neurite outgrowth (OguroAndo2017A; Mercati2013Contactin). These interactions are crucial for the protein's role in promoting neurite elongation and branching, contributing to the formation of complex neural circuits (Mercati2013Contactin). CNTN4's involvement in synaptic plasticity is particularly significant in the hippocampus, where it affects the morphology and function of neurons, influencing learning and memory processes (OguroAndo2021Cntn4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CNTN4 gene are associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Deletions and duplications of CNTN4 have been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), cognitive delay, growth restriction, motor delay, and febrile seizures/epilepsy (Zhang2020Intragenic). The gene is also implicated in 3p deletion syndrome, a condition characterized by developmental delay and dysmorphic features, due to its location in the deleted region of chromosome 3p25-p26 (Fernandez2004Disruption; OguroAndo2017A). 

CNTN4 is considered a candidate risk gene for schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and alcohol use disorder (OguroAndo2021Cntn4; Zhang2020Intragenic). In particular, CNTN4 has been identified as a significant risk factor for regular alcohol use in a methylome-wide association study (OguroAndo2017A). 

In the context of ASD, CNTN4 deletions have been observed in individuals with the disorder, although these deletions are sometimes inherited from unaffected parents, suggesting incomplete penetrance (Cottrell2011Contactin). The gene's involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders is further supported by studies on Cntn4 knockout mice, which show altered sensory and cognitive responses (OguroAndo2017A).

## Interactions
Contactin 4 (CNTN4) is involved in several significant protein interactions that play crucial roles in neurodevelopment. CNTN4 interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor gamma (PTPRG), a relationship that is important for signaling events through tyrosine-specific phosphatase activity. This interaction occurs at the CA domain of PTPRG and involves the second and third immunoglobulin domains of CNTN4 (Mercati2013Contactin). The binding sites for PTPRG are conserved across CNTN4, CNTN5, and CNTN6, suggesting a shared mechanism of interaction (Mercati2013Contactin).

CNTN4 also interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is crucial for neurite outgrowth and axonal arborization in retinal ganglion cells. This interaction suggests that APP may act as a co-receptor with CNTN4 (OguroAndo2017A). Additionally, CNTN4 is known to interact with Notch receptors and other immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecules (Ig-CAMs), which are important for modulating neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity (Mercati2013Contactin).

These interactions highlight CNTN4's role in forming active signaling complexes and influencing neuronal connectivity, which are essential for proper brain development and function (Cottrell2011Contactin).
