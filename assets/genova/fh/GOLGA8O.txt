# GOLGA8O

## Overview
GOLGA8O is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A8 family member O, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their coiled-coil structure and are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. Golgin A8 family member O is implicated in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and facilitating vesicular transport processes. The precise biological functions and interactions of golgin A8 family member O remain an active area of research, with potential implications for understanding various cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
