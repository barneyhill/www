# IGF2BP2

## Overview
The IGF2BP2 gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2, a member of the IGF2 mRNA-binding protein family. This protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA, influencing mRNA stability, localization, and translation. IGF2BP2 plays a critical role in various biological processes, including embryonic development, neuronal differentiation, and cellular metabolism. It is particularly significant in the context of energy metabolism and mitochondrial function, as well as in the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and migration (Cao2018The). The protein's interaction with mRNAs and other RNA-binding proteins underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in disease pathogenesis, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Wang2021The; Bell2012Insulin-like).

## Structure
IGF2BP2 is a protein encoded by the IGF2BP2 gene, located on chromosome 3 at locus 3q27.2. The protein has a molecular mass of 66 kDa and is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and four C-terminal K homology (KH) domains (Wang2021The; Cao2018The). These domains are crucial for the protein's RNA-binding affinity and specificity, with the RRMs having a high affinity for RNA and playing a central role in stabilizing IGF2BP2-RNA complexes, while the KH domains primarily bind to RNA, particularly the polypyrimidine region (Cao2018The).

IGF2BP2 can produce a splice variant known as p62, which results from the skipping of exon 10 and lacks 43 amino acids between the KH2 and KH3 domains, leading to a protein of 62 kDa (Cao2018The). The protein's structure is further characterized by flexible linker regions between the RNA-binding domains, which contribute to its functional diversity. Phosphorylation of residues in these linker regions is important for post-transcriptional control of target mRNAs, such as the phosphorylation by mTOR that promotes binding to IGF2 mRNA (Cao2018The). IGF2BP2 can form both homologous and heterologous dimers in the presence of target mRNA, enhancing the stability and complexity of protein-RNA complexes (Cao2018The).

## Function
The insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) is a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of mRNA stability, localization, and translation in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including embryonic development, neuronal differentiation, and metabolism. IGF2BP2 is highly expressed in neocortical neural precursor cells (NPCs) during early developmental stages, where it enhances neurogenic potential and diverts cells from astrocyte differentiation (Cao2018The). 

In terms of cellular metabolism, IGF2BP2 is linked to mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. It regulates the assembly and activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, influencing energy consumption and glucose tolerance (Cao2018The). The protein is also involved in the mTOR signaling pathway, which is part of the PI3K/Akt pathway, promoting cell proliferation and migration (Cao2018The).

IGF2BP2 is active in the cytoplasm and is characterized by six RNA-binding domains that facilitate its interaction with target mRNAs, such as IGF2 and LAMB2, protecting them from degradation and promoting their translation (Cao2018The). This activity is crucial for maintaining normal physiological functions and cellular homeostasis (Cao2018The).

## Clinical Significance
IGF2BP2 is implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and metabolic disorders, due to its role in RNA stabilization and gene expression regulation. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), IGF2BP2 is involved in cancer progression and metastasis, stabilizing lncRNA MALAT1 and enhancing ATG2 expression, which promotes tumor proliferation. It also stabilizes TGFBR1, accelerating cancer stemness, and the IGF2BP2/LATS1 axis promotes lung adenocarcinoma growth (Gong2024Systematic). In colorectal cancer (CRC), IGF2BP2 is highly expressed and crucial for cell proliferation and survival. It regulates RAF1 expression by binding to its mRNA, preventing miR-195-mediated degradation, which is significant for CRC cell growth (Ye2016IGF2BP2).

IGF2BP2 is also associated with chemoresistance in CRC, where its overexpression stabilizes target transcripts linked to cell cycle processes and mitochondrial respiration (Kendzia2023A). In metabolic diseases, IGF2BP2 polymorphisms, such as rs4402960, are linked to type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes mellitus, affecting insulin resistance and β-cell function (Wang2021The). The gene's dysregulation is also associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (Wang2021The).

## Interactions
IGF2BP2 is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in mRNA stabilization, localization, and translation. It primarily localizes in the cytoplasm and forms ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, which are involved in mRNA localization and stability (Bell2012Insulin-like). IGF2BP2 binds RNA through its KH domains, which are crucial for its RNA-binding ability and subcellular localization (Wächter2013Subcellular). These domains facilitate interactions with other RNA-binding proteins such as ELAVL1 (HuR), DHX9 (RHA), and HNRNPU, although these interactions are significantly reduced when the KH domains are inactivated (Wächter2013Subcellular).

IGF2BP2 also interacts with various mRNAs, including those of MYC and ACTB, preventing their premature decay and controlling their translation and transport (Bell2012Insulin-like). In cancer cells, IGF2BP2 stabilizes GLUT1 mRNA, promoting aerobic glycolysis and proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (Wang2021The). It also interacts with miRNAs, lncRNAs, and m6A-related genes, modulating cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis (Wang2021The). In bladder cancer, IGF2BP2 interacts with circHIPK3, affecting the expression of STAT3 and potentially influencing cancer progression (Okholm2023circHIPK3).
