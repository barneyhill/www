# IQCF2

## Overview
IQCF2, or IQ motif containing F2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the IQ motif-containing family. This family is characterized by the presence of IQ motifs, which are short sequences that typically mediate interactions with calmodulin and other EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. The IQCF2 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. It is thought to play a role in calcium signaling pathways, given its structural motifs, which are known to be involved in calcium-dependent regulatory processes. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in cellular physiology and potential implications in human health and disease.
