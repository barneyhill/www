# C5orf46

## Overview
C5orf46 is a gene located on chromosome 5q32 that encodes the AP-64 protein, an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) with a unique structure and function. The AP-64 protein is characterized by its anionic nature and amphiphilic properties, featuring a hydrophobic region flanked by hydrophilic terminals. It is longer than most human AMPs, consisting of 64 amino acids, and lacks cysteine residues, which is uncommon among AMPs (Zhong2021AP64). The protein's secondary structure includes an α-helix, contributing to its antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Zhong2021AP64). Beyond its antimicrobial role, AP-64 has demonstrated cytotoxicity against certain human lymphoma cell lines and is expressed in various tissues, suggesting additional physiological roles (Zhong2021AP64). The gene's expression is implicated in cancer prognosis and asthma exacerbations, highlighting its clinical significance (Ma2023Exosomal; HerreraLuis2022Admixture).

## Structure
The C5orf46 gene encodes the AP-64 protein, a short acidic peptide with a molecular weight of 7.2 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.54. The primary structure of AP-64 consists of 64 amino acid residues, which is longer than most human antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that typically have fewer than 45 residues. Notably, AP-64 lacks cysteine residues, which is uncommon among AMPs (Zhong2021AP64).

The secondary structure of AP-64 includes an α-helix located in its hydrophobic region, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) spectrum analysis (Zhong2021AP64). The peptide is amphiphilic, featuring a hydrophobic middle region and hydrophilic terminals, which is consistent with its role as an antimicrobial peptide (Zhong2021AP64).

There is no detailed information available on the tertiary or quaternary structures of AP-64. The protein's amphiphilic nature and net negative charge, similar to other AMPs like dermcidin, suggest potential functional roles in antimicrobial activity, but specific structural details remain unexplored (Zhong2021AP64). The protein has been expressed and purified for analysis, but further structural characterization is needed (Zhong2021AP64).

## Function
The C5orf46 gene encodes the AP-64 protein, an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) with notable activity against Gram-negative bacteria. AP-64 is characterized by its anionic nature, with a pI of 4.54, and a sequence length of 64 amino acids, which is longer than typical human AMPs. It lacks cysteine residues and is amphiphilic, featuring a hydrophobic region flanked by hydrophilic terminals. The protein's secondary structure includes an α-helix located in the hydrophobic region, which is conserved among several mammals, including gorillas, cynomolgus monkeys, bovines, and mice (Zhong2021AP64).

AP-64 exhibits its antibacterial effects by potentially interfering with the bacterial cell envelope, leading to cell damage and death. It has demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against various Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and has shown efficacy in combating Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections in a mouse model (Zhong2021AP64).

In addition to its antimicrobial properties, AP-64 has shown cytotoxicity against certain human lymphoma cell lines, such as Jurkat and Raji cells. The protein is expressed at the RNA level in the skin, salivary glands, major blood vessels, and the heart, and has been identified as a plasma protein, suggesting a potential role in lipid homeostasis (Zhong2021AP64).

## Clinical Significance
The C5orf46 gene, located on chromosome 5q32, has been implicated in various cancers and other conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, C5orf46 is generally up-regulated across multiple types, except for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), where its expression is lower compared to normal tissues. However, in PAAD, higher expression levels are associated with poorer survival outcomes, with a hazard ratio of 2.1, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Ma2023Exosomal; Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene's expression correlates with advanced cancer stages and grades, and it is linked to worse overall survival and shorter recurrence-free survival in many cancers (Ma2023Exosomal).

C5orf46 is also involved in tumor microenvironment remodeling, promoting angiogenesis and extracellular matrix degradation, which are critical for cancer metastasis (Ma2023Exosomal). Its expression affects drug sensitivity, with higher levels observed in non-responders to certain chemotherapy treatments (Ma2023Exosomal). In addition to cancer, C5orf46 has been associated with severe asthma exacerbations in Hispanic/Latino populations, particularly in Mexican Americans, where specific SNPs in the gene are linked to altered odds of exacerbations (HerreraLuis2022Admixture).
