# SFTPD

## Overview
The SFTPD gene encodes surfactant protein D (SP-D), a member of the collectin family of proteins, which are characterized by their collagen-like regions and carbohydrate recognition domains. SP-D is primarily expressed in the lungs, where it plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system by binding to a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, thereby facilitating their clearance. This protein is a collagen-containing C-type lectin that interacts with several immune receptors to modulate immune responses and maintain homeostasis. Beyond its immunological functions, SP-D is involved in the regulation of inflammation and surfactant metabolism, contributing to respiratory health. Alterations in the SFTPD gene and SP-D levels have been associated with various respiratory and systemic diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Nayak2012An; Sorensen2018Surfactant).

## Structure


## Function
Surfactant protein D (SP-D), encoded by the SFTPD gene, is a crucial component of the innate immune system, primarily active in the lungs but also present in various extrapulmonary tissues. SP-D is a collagen-containing C-type lectin that plays a significant role in host defense by binding to pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, facilitating their clearance through opsonization and agglutination (Nayak2012An; Sorensen2018Surfactant). It interacts with several receptors, such as CD14/TLR, SIRP-α, and LAIR-1, to modulate immune responses, including the suppression of macrophage and dendritic cell activation, and the reduction of reactive oxygen species signaling (Sorensen2018Surfactant).

SP-D also plays a role in maintaining immune homeostasis by inhibiting excessive inflammation. It suppresses the phagocytic function of alveolar macrophages, which is crucial for preventing chronic inflammation and maintaining lung health (Janssen2008Surfactant). Additionally, SP-D is involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells, enhancing their uptake by phagocytes, which is vital for resolving inflammation and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Nayak2012An). SP-D's ability to modulate immune responses and maintain surfactant homeostasis underscores its importance in respiratory health and immune regulation (Sorensen2018Surfactant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SFTPD gene, which encodes surfactant protein D (SP-D), are associated with a variety of diseases and conditions. Genetic variations, such as the SFTPD Met11Thr polymorphism, affect SP-D multimerization and are linked to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders (Sorensen2018Surfactant). The Met11 variant is associated with type II diabetes and diverse respiratory outcomes, while the Thr11 variant is linked to conditions like cystic fibrosis, interstitial pneumonia, and lung cancer (Sorensen2018Surfactant).

Alterations in SP-D expression levels are implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with increased serum SP-D levels associated with a decreased risk of COPD and slower lung function decline (Obeidat2017Surfactant). SP-D deficiency can lead to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, contributing to conditions like emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis (Wert2000Increased). In smokers and COPD patients, SP-D levels are disturbed, with increased serum levels and decreased bronchoalveolar lavage levels, which are linked to increased COPD mortality (Pilecki2018Surfactant).

SP-D is also involved in systemic metabolism, with its deficiency leading to increased body mass and insulin resistance, suggesting a role in obesity and metabolic syndrome (Sorensen2018Surfactant).

## Interactions
Surfactant protein D (SP-D), encoded by the SFTPD gene, is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in immune regulation and homeostasis. SP-D interacts with the transmembrane receptor SIRPα, which may facilitate interaction with CD47, negatively controlling phagocytosis by immune cells (Cañadas2020Lipid–Protein). It also binds to glycosylated CD14 in a calcium-dependent manner, inhibiting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding and modulating macrophage and dendritic cell activation through the CD14/TLR signaling pathway (Sorensen2018Surfactant). SP-D's interaction with TLR4/MD-2 attenuates LPS-induced inflammation (Sorensen2018Surfactant).

SP-D binds to high mannose-type N-glycans in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), blocking the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and suppressing EGF signaling, which inhibits the proliferation and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cells (Sorensen2018Surfactant). It also interacts with various secreted host molecules, including decorin, alpha(2)-macroglobulin, and defensins, enhancing bacterial agglutination and protecting SP-D from degradation (Sorensen2018Surfactant).

SP-D can bind to DNA and myeloperoxidase, aiding in the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages (Cañadas2020Lipid–Protein). It also interacts with interleukin 8, which can exacerbate cell damage in acute lung injury (Cañadas2020Lipid–Protein).
