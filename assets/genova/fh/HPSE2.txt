# HPSE2

## Overview
Heparanase 2 (HPSE2) is a gene that encodes the protein heparanase 2, which is structurally similar to the enzyme heparanase 1 (HPSE1) but is catalytically inactive. Unlike HPSE1, which degrades heparan sulfate chains, heparanase 2 functions primarily as a regulatory protein, maintaining the integrity of the extracellular matrix and modulating inflammatory responses. It achieves this by binding to heparan sulfate on endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting the enzymatic activity of HPSE1 and reducing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling (Kiyan2019Heparanase2; Shu2019Heparanase). HPSE2 is implicated in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and tissue homeostasis, and plays a protective role in endothelial cell function (García2017Upregulated). Clinically, mutations in the HPSE2 gene are associated with urofacial syndrome, a rare genetic disorder affecting urinary and facial functions, highlighting its significance in neural development and disease (Roberts2014Heparanase; Daly2010Mutations).

## Structure
HPSE2 encodes a protein that is structurally similar to heparanase but lacks enzymatic activity. The protein features a TIM-barrel fold, a common structural motif in enzymes, which suggests a potential for catalytic activity despite its inactivity. This fold is integral to the protein's tertiary structure, providing a stable framework for potential interactions with other molecules. 

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its stability, localization, and interactions. These modifications are crucial for the protein's function and may affect its structural conformation. 

HPSE2 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which can lead to variations in its structure and function. These isoforms may result in differences in the protein's domain composition or overall conformation, potentially altering its biological role. The presence of these isoforms highlights the complexity of HPSE2's structural and functional landscape. 

Overall, while HPSE2 shares structural similarities with active heparanase, its unique features, such as the TIM-barrel fold and potential post-translational modifications, contribute to its distinct role in human biology.

## Function
Heparanase 2 (HPSE2) is a protein that, despite its structural similarity to heparanase 1 (HPSE1), lacks enzymatic activity. In healthy human cells, HPSE2 functions primarily as a negative regulator of HPSE1, which is the only enzyme capable of degrading heparan sulfate chains in mammals (Shu2019Heparanase). HPSE2 binds to heparan sulfate on the endothelial cell surface, preventing its cleavage by HPSE1, thereby maintaining the integrity of the glycocalyx and inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling (Kiyan2019Heparanase2). This interaction helps protect endothelial cells from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated injury by reducing inflammatory responses (Kiyan2019Heparanase2).

HPSE2 is involved in modulating cell signaling and extracellular matrix interactions, playing a role in maintaining tissue homeostasis. It influences processes such as cell adhesion and migration through its interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (García2017Upregulated). In the context of inflammation, HPSE2 overexpression in endothelial cells has been shown to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, preserving cell-cell contacts and reducing activation of inflammatory pathways like NFκB (Kiyan2019Heparanase2). These functions suggest that HPSE2 plays a crucial role in maintaining endothelial cell function and integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HPSE2 gene are primarily associated with urofacial syndrome (UFS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by dysfunctional urinary voiding and abnormal facial expressions, such as grimacing when attempting to smile. This condition can lead to severe kidney damage and renal failure due to incomplete bladder emptying and urinary tract infections (Beaman2022Expanding; Daly2010Mutations). UFS is linked to biallelic mutations in HPSE2, which encodes heparanase 2, a protein involved in peripheral neural development. Loss of heparanase 2 function affects motor neuron development and is thought to contribute to congenital peripheral neuropathy, a key feature of UFS (Roberts2014Heparanase).

The genetic basis of UFS is complex, with some cases also involving mutations in the LRIG2 gene, indicating genetic heterogeneity and overlapping functions in development (Roberts2014Heparanase). In addition to UFS, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HPSE2 have been associated with the risk of developing extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma patients, suggesting a broader role for HPSE2 in disease susceptibility (Ostrovsky2023Effect). These findings underscore the clinical significance of HPSE2 mutations and their impact on urinary and neural function.

## Interactions
Heparanase-2 (HPSE2) is known to interact with heparan sulfate, a key component of the extracellular matrix. This interaction is crucial for its role in inhibiting the enzymatic activity of heparanase-1 (HPSE1), thereby preventing the degradation of heparan sulfate chains. HPSE2 competes with HPSE1 for binding to heparan sulfate, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the endothelial glycocalyx and regulating inflammatory responses (Kiyan2019Heparanase2; Beaman2022Expanding).

HPSE2 also plays a role in modulating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. It inhibits the transfer of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from CD14 to the TLR4/MD2 complex, thereby reducing TLR4 activation and subsequent inflammatory responses. This suggests a regulatory interaction between HPSE2 and components of the TLR4 signaling pathway, although the exact molecular details of these interactions are not fully elucidated (Kiyan2019Heparanase2).

In the context of urofacial syndrome, HPSE2 variants have been studied for their potential interactions with heparanase-1, which may affect downstream intracellular signaling pathways. However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond heparan sulfate binding are not detailed in the available literature (Beaman2022Expanding).
