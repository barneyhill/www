# SCYGR7

## Overview
SCYGR7 is a gene that encodes the protein small cysteine and glycine repeat containing 7, which is characterized by its unique sequence of cysteine and glycine repeats. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, suggesting its involvement in cellular signaling or transport processes across the cell membrane. The specific biological functions and interactions of SCYGR7 remain under investigation, but its structural features imply a potential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis or mediating signal transduction pathways. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which SCYGR7 influences cellular processes and its implications in health and disease.
