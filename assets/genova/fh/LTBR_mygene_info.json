necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The major ligands of this receptor include lymphotoxin alpha/beta and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14. The encoded protein plays a role in signalling during the development of lymphoid and other organs, lipid metabolism, immune response, and programmed cell death. Activity of this receptor has also been linked to carcinogenesis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed.
