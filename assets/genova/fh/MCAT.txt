# MCAT

## Overview
The MCAT gene encodes the enzyme malonyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase, a key component in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS). This enzyme is classified as a transacylase and is integral to the transfer of malonyl groups to acyl carrier proteins, facilitating the elongation of fatty acid chains necessary for the production of octanoate, a precursor for lipoate. Lipoate is crucial for the lipoylation of proteins involved in energy metabolism, including several dehydrogenase complexes and the glycine cleavage system. The MCAT protein's structure, featuring critical active-site residues, is essential for its enzymatic function and stability. Mutations in the MCAT gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, affecting the electron transport chain and energy metabolism, and are associated with clinical conditions such as combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency and optic neuropathies (Webb2023Recessive; Gerber2021MCAT).

## Structure
The human MCAT protein is composed of two domains: a large domain and a smaller one. The active-site residues, Ser153, His270, and Arg178, are located in a gorge between these subdomains. His270 enhances the nucleophilicity of Ser153, while Arg178 aids in positioning the malonate 3-carboxyl of the malonyl-CoA substrate (Gerber2021MCAT). The protein's structure is sensitive to mutations, such as NM_173467.4:c.1039G>A, p.Glu347Lys, which disrupts electrostatic interactions and may destabilize the protein by altering a helix at the domain interface (Gerber2021MCAT).

The MCAT gene is transcribed into two isoforms through alternative splicing of exon 3. These isoforms are composed of exons 1 to 4 and exons 1, 2, and 4, encoding proteins with 391 and 181 amino acids, respectively. The isoform lacking exon 3 is likely inactive due to the absence of most of the smaller domain and Arg178. Another isoform, missing residues 142 to 243, lacks the smaller domain and critical active-site residues, likely rendering it inactive (Gerber2021MCAT). These structural features and variations highlight the importance of specific residues and domains in maintaining MCAT protein function.

## Function
The MCAT gene encodes the enzyme malonyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase, which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) by catalyzing the transfer of malonyl groups to acyl carrier proteins. This process is essential for the elongation of fatty acid chains, particularly in the generation of octanoate, a precursor for lipoate. Lipoate is necessary for the lipoylation of proteins involved in energy metabolism, including several dehydrogenase complexes and the glycine cleavage system (Webb2023Recessive).

In healthy human cells, MCAT is vital for the assembly and stability of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, particularly complexes I, II, III, and IV. This function is critical for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, as it supports the proper functioning of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Webb2023Recessive). The enzyme's activity is facilitated by its structure, which includes active-site residues that are crucial for its enzymatic function (Gerber2021MCAT).

Disruption in MCAT function can lead to decreased lipoylation and affect the citric acid cycle and energy metabolism, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular respiration and energy homeostasis (Webb2023Recessive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MCAT gene, which encodes the enzyme malonyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase, are associated with several clinical conditions. Recessive pathogenic variants in MCAT can lead to combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency, a mitochondrial disorder characterized by impaired mitochondrial function and decreased activity of electron transport chain complexes I, II, and IV. This condition manifests with symptoms such as hypotonia, failure to thrive, and neurological abnormalities (Webb2023Recessive).

Specific mutations, such as c.812T>C; p.T271I, affect the stability and catalytic activity of the MCAT enzyme, leading to defects in mitochondrial complexes and partially rescuing mitochondrial respiration when re-expressed (Webb2023Recessive). Other mutations, like p.L81R and p.R212W, have been linked to isolated, progressive autosomal recessive optic neuropathy, primarily affecting retinal ganglion cell axon maintenance (Webb2023Recessive).

MCAT mutations have also been implicated in optic neuropathies resembling Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). These mutations can cause sudden visual loss and optic nerve atrophy, expanding the phenotypic presentation of MCAT-related disorders (Gerber2021MCAT). The diverse phenotypic outcomes of MCAT mutations underscore the gene's critical role in mitochondrial function and ocular health.
