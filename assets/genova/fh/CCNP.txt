# CCNP

## Overview
Cyclin P, encoded by the CCNP gene, is an atypical member of the cyclin family, which is primarily known for its role in regulating the cell cycle. Unlike canonical cyclins, Cyclin P does not appear to interact with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the traditional manner, suggesting a unique mechanism of action (Quandt2020Atypical). Despite its atypical nature, Cyclin P is implicated in significant cellular processes, including the activation of the WNT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation (SánchezBotet2021Atypical). The gene's expression is notably altered in various cancers, where it contributes to cancer cell stemness and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (SánchezBotet2021Atypical).

## Clinical Significance
The CCNP gene, also known as cyclin P, plays a significant role in cancer development and progression. Alterations in CCNP expression are associated with various cancers, including lung, colorectal, and breast cancers. High levels of CCNP expression are linked to poor clinical prognosis and decreased overall survival in these cancers (Quandt2020Atypical; SánchezBotet2021Atypical). CCNP is implicated in cancer cell stemness and drug resistance, contributing to tumor growth and chemoresistance through the activation of the WNT signaling pathway (SánchezBotet2021Atypical). 

CCNP overexpression enhances the expression of stem cell markers and pluripotency factors, such as CD44, OCT4, and SOX2, and promotes resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs by increasing the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux transporters (SánchezBotet2021Atypical). This gene's upregulation is also associated with increased sphere formation in cancer cell cultures, indicating its role in maintaining cancer stemness (SánchezBotet2021Atypical). 

Given its overexpression in tumors and absence in normal tissues, CCNP is considered a potential target for cancer therapies, with ongoing research needed to fully understand its mechanisms and therapeutic potential (SánchezBotet2021Atypical).

## Interactions
The interactions of Cyclin P (CCNP) with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unclear. Despite its classification as an atypical cyclin, CCNP does not appear to interact with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the same manner as canonical cyclins. A yeast two-hybrid screen failed to identify any specific protein interactors for CCNP, suggesting that its mechanism of action might differ from typical cyclin-CDK interactions (SánchezBotet2021Atypical). This lack of identified interactors indicates that CCNP may not form the traditional cyclin-CDK complexes that are characteristic of other cyclins (Quandt2020Atypical).

CCNP is implicated in the activation of the WNT signaling pathway, as its overexpression increases activated β-catenin levels, a key component of this pathway. This suggests that CCNP might interact with components of the WNT pathway, although specific interactions have not been detailed (SánchezBotet2021Atypical). The study of CCNP's role in cancer cell stemness and drug resistance further supports its involvement in complex cellular processes, potentially through indirect interactions with signaling pathways rather than direct protein-protein interactions (SánchezBotet2021Atypical).
