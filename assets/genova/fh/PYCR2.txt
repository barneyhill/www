# PYCR2

## Overview
The PYCR2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 2, which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of L-proline. This enzyme is categorized as a reductase and is involved in the conversion of pyrroline-5-carboxylate to proline, utilizing NADH as a cofactor. The PYCR2 protein is essential for maintaining cellular redox balance and mitochondrial integrity, contributing to various metabolic pathways and cellular processes, including ATP production and immunomodulation. Mutations in the PYCR2 gene are associated with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy type 10, a severe neurodegenerative disorder, and have implications in cancer prognosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Hu2021Isozymes; Patel2021Disease; Zaki2016PYCR2).

## Structure
The PYCR2 protein is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of L-proline. Its molecular structure includes a Rossmann fold, which is common in nucleotide-binding proteins (Patel2021Disease). The crystal structure of PYCR2 has been resolved, revealing a 3.4-angstrom subatomic structure of the apo-enzyme. This structure is similar to that of the PYCR1 isoenzyme, where five dimers assemble into a decamer (EscandeBeillard2020Loss). The quaternary structure is characterized by a hollow cylindrical core formed by C-terminal domains, while the N-terminal domains line the periphery, creating a yoyo-like structure (EscandeBeillard2020Loss).

The protein's secondary structure includes α-helices and β-strands, with specific variants like R251C displaying less α-helical and more β-strand character compared to the wild-type (Patel2021Disease). The residue Gly249 is located at the dimer interface, making important contacts with neighboring residues, and mutations at this site can disrupt PYCR2 stability and function (EscandeBeillard2020Loss). PYCR2 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. Variants can arise from alternative splicing, potentially affecting its function and localization (Patel2021Disease).

## Function
PYCR2 (pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 2) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of L-proline, catalyzing the conversion of pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) to proline using NADH as a cofactor (Hu2021Isozymes; Patel2021Disease). This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance, as it helps shuttle redox potential across mitochondrial and cellular membranes, contributing to ATP production and immunomodulation (Hu2021Isozymes). PYCR2 plays a significant role in cell metabolism by channeling NADH/NAD+ to core metabolic pathways like glycolysis, which is essential for cell proliferation (Kuo2016PYCR1).

In healthy human cells, PYCR2 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and structure, preventing mitochondrial fragmentation, and protecting cells from oxidative stress (Kuo2016PYCR1). It interacts with PYCR1 and RRM2B to suppress oxidative stress and promote cell survival (Kuo2016PYCR1). PYCR2 also contributes to the regulation of glycine levels in the central nervous system by controlling the levels of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2), preventing neurodegeneration associated with elevated glycine levels (EscandeBeillard2020Loss). The enzyme's activity is essential for normal mitochondrial function and cellular differentiation, particularly in oligodendroglial cells, which are responsible for forming myelin sheaths in the central nervous system (Torii2022Hypomyelinating).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PYCR2 gene are linked to hypomyelinating leukodystrophy type 10 (HLD10), a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by microcephaly, developmental delay, and failure to thrive. Patients with HLD10 often exhibit progressive brain atrophy, hypomyelination, and reduced white matter volume, as observed in MRI scans. Clinical features include profound psychomotor disability, seizures, and characteristic craniofacial dysmorphisms. The condition is typically fatal within the first decade of life (de2017Amino; Akbari2023Novel; Zaki2016PYCR2).

PYCR2 mutations result in a loss of function of the enzyme, disrupting proline biosynthesis and mitochondrial function. This leads to increased cerebral glycine levels, contributing to neurodegeneration (Hu2021Isozymes; EscandeBeillard2020Loss). Specific mutations, such as the p.Gly249Val and c.135dup variants, have been identified in affected individuals, further illustrating the gene's role in disease pathology (Akbari2023Novel; EscandeBeillard2020Loss).

In addition to its role in neurological disorders, PYCR2 is implicated in cancer. Elevated expression of PYCR2 is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal and renal cancers, where it supports tumor growth and progression (Patel2021Disease; Wang2021The).

## Interactions
PYCR2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with the African swine fever virus (ASFV) protein E199L. This interaction leads to the down-regulation of PYCR2 expression, which in turn promotes autophagy in host cells. The interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and confocal immunofluorescence, demonstrating co-localization of PYCR2 and E199L in the cytoplasm (Chen2021African).

PYCR2 also interacts with RRM2B, a protein involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress. This interaction is crucial for cellular resistance to oxidative stress, as PYCR2, along with PYCR1, collaborates with RRM2B to maintain mitochondrial integrity and suppress reactive oxygen species (Kuo2016PYCR1). The interaction between PYCR2 and RRM2B was validated using immunoprecipitation and Western blotting techniques, although only a small fraction of PYCR2 binds to RRM2B (Kuo2016PYCR1).

Additionally, PYCR2 is subject to ubiquitination and degradation mediated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase E4B. This process involves the formation of polyubiquitin chains, which signal for protein degradation, and was demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo experiments (Lu2022Differential).
