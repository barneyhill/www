# INTS15

## Overview
INTS15 is a gene that encodes the integrator complex subunit 15, a protein integral to the function of the Integrator complex, which is involved in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription termination and mRNA splicing. The protein is categorized as a structural component of the Integrator complex, playing a pivotal role in the 3′ end processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and influencing mRNA splicing. INTS15 is predominantly expressed in the brain and eyes during development, where it is essential for the normal development of retinal ganglion cells and brain-like tissues. Mutations or alterations in the expression of INTS15 have been linked to developmental disorders, particularly affecting ocular and neural development, underscoring its clinical significance (Azuma2022Integrator).

## Structure
The INTS15 protein is a component of the Integrator complex, which plays a role in RNA polymerase II termination and mRNA splicing. Structurally, INTS15 is described as a helical protein that interacts with other subunits of the Integrator complex. It specifically binds to the N-terminal region of the core subunit INTS5 through its N-terminal helices α4 and α6, and a loop between α8 and α9, which align with the N-terminal helices α1-α5 of INTS5. This interaction helps orient the C-terminal helices α17, α20, and α22 of INTS15 to bind to the first two helices of INTS10, influencing the trajectory of the tail module around the cleavage module (Fianu2024Structural).

The structure of the Integrator complex's Arm module, which includes INTS15, is elongated and hook-shaped. INTS15 interacts with INTS10 in a head-to-tail arrangement, suggesting potential conformational dynamics (Razew2024Structural). The INTS15 protein is crucial for the assembly of the Integrator complex, as mutations in INTS15 can severely hamper complex formation (Razew2024Structural). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of INTS15 alone are not provided in the available context.

## Function
INTS15, also known as integrator complex subunit 15, is a crucial component of the Integrator complex, which is involved in the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and mRNA splicing. This gene plays a significant role in the 3′ end processing of snRNAs, a critical step in the maturation of RNA molecules necessary for splicing, thereby ensuring proper gene expression (Azuma2022Integrator). INTS15 is predominantly expressed in the brain and eyes during development and is essential for the normal development of retinal ganglion cells and brain-like tissues (Azuma2022Integrator).

In healthy human cells, INTS15 interacts with the Integrator complex to support snRNA 3′ end processing, and its knockdown results in missplicing of a large number of genes, particularly those associated with alternative splicing (Azuma2022Integrator). This missplicing is linked to defects in snRNA processing, highlighting the gene's importance in maintaining proper mRNA splicing and gene expression (Azuma2022Integrator). INTS15 is also implicated in the regulation of genes critical for brain and eye development, such as PAX6, and its knockdown leads to downregulation of these genes (Azuma2022Integrator).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the INTS15 gene have been linked to significant developmental and clinical conditions, particularly affecting the eyes and brain. INTS15 has been identified as a causative gene for a hereditary eye disease known as multiple ocular malformation sequence (MOMS), which is characterized by various eye malformations such as corneal opacity, microcornea, iris anomaly, cataract, persistent fetal vasculature, and optic nerve anomalies (Azuma2022Integrator). The gene's haploinsufficiency is suggested to have a broad impact on eye development, with knockout mice exhibiting phenotypes similar to human MOMS (Azuma2022Integrator).

INTS15 is also crucial for normal neural development, particularly in the brain and eyes. Its knockdown in vitro leads to abnormal development of brain-like and retinal tissues, with decreased expression of neural markers (Azuma2022Integrator). The gene's role in mRNA splicing and its interaction with the Integrator complex are essential for the proper development of these tissues, and defects in these processes may contribute to conditions like MOMS (Azuma2022Integrator). These findings highlight the clinical significance of INTS15 mutations or expression alterations in developmental disorders.

## Interactions
INTS15, a component of the Integrator complex, participates in several protein-protein interactions. It interacts with the N-terminal region of the Integrator core subunit INTS5, specifically binding through its N-terminal helices α4 and α6 and a loop between α8 and α9 to the N-terminal helices α1-α5 of INTS5. This interaction helps orient the C-terminal helices of INTS15 to bind to the first two helices of INTS10, forming a critical interface with the INTS10-INTS13-INTS14 module (Fianu2024Structural). INTS15 is also part of a tetrameric subcomplex within the Integrator complex, interacting with subunits INTS10, INTS13, and INTS14 (Fianu2024Structural).

INTS15 is involved in mRNA splicing and snRNA processing, with its knockdown leading to missplicing events and increased levels of unprocessed snRNAs, suggesting interactions with components of the splicing machinery or related nucleic acids (Azuma2022Integrator). Additionally, INTS15 is part of the INTAC auxiliary module, which interacts with the RACK7-KDM5C complex, influencing chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation (Fan2024Catalyticindependent). These interactions highlight INTS15's role in transcription regulation and RNA processing.
