# DPH6

## Overview
DPH6 is a gene that encodes the protein diphthamine biosynthesis 6, which functions as an amidase involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide. Diphthamide is a unique post-translational modification of a histidine residue on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), essential for accurate protein synthesis. The DPH6 protein catalyzes the final step of diphthamide biosynthesis, converting diphthine to diphthamide in an ATP-dependent manner, using ammonia as the amide group source (Uthman2013The; Schaffrath2014The). This enzymatic activity is facilitated by an adenine nucleotide hydrolase domain, which is critical for its function (Uthman2013The). The conservation of DPH6's function across species, as evidenced by the ability of the human ortholog to restore diphthamide biosynthesis in yeast, underscores its fundamental role in maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Uthman2013The).

## Function
DPH6 is involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a unique post-translational modification of a histidine residue on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). This modification is crucial for the function of eEF2, which plays a key role in protein synthesis by facilitating the translocation step during mRNA translation. Diphthamide is essential for maintaining the accuracy of protein synthesis and preventing reading frame errors during translation (Hawer2020Diphthamide-deficiency; Uthman2013The).

The DPH6 gene encodes a protein that functions as an amidase, catalyzing the final step of diphthamide biosynthesis. This step involves the ATP-dependent conversion of diphthine to diphthamide, using ammonia as the source of the amide group (Uthman2013The; Schaffrath2014The). The DPH6 protein contains an adenine nucleotide hydrolase domain, which is critical for its enzymatic activity (Uthman2013The).

In humans, the DPH6 ortholog can restore diphthamide biosynthesis in yeast, indicating that its core function is conserved across species (Uthman2013The). This suggests that DPH6 plays a similar role in human cells, contributing to the fidelity of protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis.

## Interactions
DPH6 is involved in the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway in yeast, specifically in the terminal amidation step that converts diphthine to diphthamide. Although DPH6 does not physically interact with DPH7, DPH2, or DPH5, it does interact with a fraction of His-tagged eEF2, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. This interaction is independent of DPH7, indicating that DPH7 does not mediate the interaction between DPH6 and eEF2 (Uthman2013The).

DPH6 contains an essential adenine nucleotide hydrolase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic function. This domain is part of the adenine nucleotide alpha hydrolase superfamily and is predicted to bind ATP, suggesting a direct, ATP-dependent role for DPH6 in diphthine amidation (Uthman2013The; Abdel-Fattah2013Insights). The C-terminal portion of DPH6 contains two domains related to the YjgF-YER057c-UK114 protein family, which may promote homotrimerisation and formation of an inter-subunit cleft for binding small molecule ligands (Uthman2013The).

The human ortholog of DPH6, ATPBD4, can restore diphthamide biosynthesis in yeast, indicating a conserved core function in the Alpha_ANH_like_IV domain, despite lacking the YjgF-YER057c-UK114 domains (Schaffrath2014The).
