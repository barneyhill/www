# SYNE4

## Overview
The SYNE4 gene encodes the protein nesprin-4, a transmembrane protein that is a critical component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. This complex plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope and ensuring proper nuclear positioning within cells. Nesprin-4 is predominantly expressed in the outer nuclear membrane and interacts with kinesin-1, a microtubule motor protein, to facilitate the correct localization of the nucleus, particularly in cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) of the inner ear. This interaction is essential for the electromotility and sound amplification capabilities of OHCs. Mutations in the SYNE4 gene can lead to the disruption of these processes, resulting in progressive hearing loss due to the degeneration of OHCs (Taiber2022A; Horn2013The).

## Structure


## Function
The SYNE4 gene encodes the protein nesprin-4, which is a crucial component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. This complex is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope and facilitating the proper positioning of the nucleus within cells. Nesprin-4 is specifically expressed in the outer nuclear membrane and interacts with kinesin-1, a microtubule motor protein, to mediate nuclear positioning. This interaction is vital for the function of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) in the inner ear, where nesprin-4 ensures the correct localization of the nucleus, which is necessary for the cells' electromotility and sound amplification capabilities (Taiber2022A; Horn2013The).

In healthy human cells, nesprin-4's role in nuclear positioning is critical for the viability and function of OHCs, as it prevents the mislocalization of nuclei that can lead to cell degeneration and hearing loss. The protein's function is conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular homeostasis and the maintenance of nuclear-cytoskeletal coupling (Taiber2022A; Horn2013The). Mutations in SYNE4 can disrupt these processes, leading to progressive hearing loss due to the degeneration of OHCs (Horn2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYNE4 gene, which encodes the protein nesprin-4, are associated with autosomal recessive progressive high-frequency hearing loss, specifically classified as DFNB76. This condition is characterized by the degeneration of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) due to the mislocalization of their nuclei, which is crucial for their function and survival (Horn2013The; Brotto2024Autosomal). A specific frameshift mutation, c.228delAT, has been identified in individuals of Iraqi Jewish ancestry, leading to a truncated form of nesprin-4 that fails to localize to the outer nuclear membrane, resulting in hearing impairment (Janin2017Nuclear; Horn2013The).

The loss of nesprin-4 disrupts the LINC complex, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope and proper nuclear positioning within OHCs. This disruption leads to the degeneration of these cells and subsequent hearing loss (Horn2013The; Worman2013Nucleocytoplasmic). Mouse models lacking SYNE4 exhibit similar phenotypes, supporting the gene's role in auditory function (Horn2013The). Gene therapy approaches using AAV vectors have shown promise in rescuing hearing loss by restoring SYNE4 function in affected cells (Brotto2024Autosomal).

## Interactions
The SYNE4 gene encodes the protein Nesprin-4, which is a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. Nesprin-4 interacts with kinesin-1, a microtubule motor protein, through a conserved 4-amino-acid motif, LEWD. This interaction is crucial for the positioning of the nucleus within cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) and is essential for hearing function. Mutations in this motif, such as changing LEWD to LEAA, disrupt the binding of Nesprin-4 to kinesin-1, leading to nuclear mislocalization and hearing loss (Taiber2022A).

Nesprin-4 is retained in the outer nuclear membrane due to its transmembrane segment and forms part of the LINC complex by interacting with SUN domain proteins through its C-terminal KASH domain. This interaction creates a protein bridge across the nuclear membranes, facilitating the mechanical coupling of the nucleus to the cytoskeleton (Horn2013The; Worman2013Nucleocytoplasmic). The interaction between Nesprin-4 and kinesin-1 supports a microtubule cargo model for nuclear positioning, which is conserved across species, as seen in the functional homolog UNC-83 in C. elegans (Taiber2022A).
