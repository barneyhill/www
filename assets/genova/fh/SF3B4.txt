# SF3B4

## Overview
SF3B4 is a gene that encodes the protein splicing factor 3b subunit 4, a crucial component of the spliceosomal complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor and plays a significant role in the assembly and function of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which is essential for the accurate excision of introns and ligation of exons during mRNA processing. The SF3B4 protein contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal proline-rich domain, which facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins within the spliceosome (Cretu2024Molecular; Choi2023The). Mutations in the SF3B4 gene are linked to developmental disorders such as Nager syndrome, characterized by craniofacial and limb abnormalities, and have also been implicated in various cancers, where they may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Bernier2012Haploinsufficiency; Liu2018SF3B4).

## Structure
SF3B4, also known as splicing factor 3b subunit 4, is a critical component of the SF3B complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing. The protein structure of SF3B4 includes two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal proline-rich (PR) domain. These RRMs are likely involved in RNA binding, a common function of such motifs, while the PR domain may facilitate protein-protein interactions (Choi2023The). 

In terms of quaternary structure, SF3B4 forms a stable complex with the SF3B2 subunit. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal RRM domain of SF3B4 and the proline-rich C-terminal domain of SF3B2, a relationship captured in a crystal structure (Cretu2024Molecular). SF3B4 is also known to crosslink to the U2 stem-loop I and stem-loop IIb in the purified 17S U2 snRNP, suggesting its role in tethering the SF3B complex to the U2 snRNA in spliceosomes (Cretu2024Molecular).

SF3B4 is implicated in various cancers, where it enhances proliferation and invasion by modulating the splicing of specific genes. Mutations in SF3B4 can lead to developmental disorders due to abnormal splicing of genes involved in skeletal development (Choi2023The).

## Function
The SF3B4 gene encodes a subunit of the splicing factor 3b complex, which is a crucial component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) involved in pre-mRNA splicing. SF3B4 plays a vital role in the splicing process by binding to pre-mRNA just upstream of the branch point sequence, thereby tethering the U2 snRNP to the branch site. This function is essential for the proper excision of introns and ligation of exons during mRNA processing (Yamada2020Heterozygous; Bernier2012Haploinsufficiency).

In addition to its role in splicing, SF3B4 is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, which is important for controlling gene-expression pathways and increasing protein diversity (Bernier2012Haploinsufficiency). SF3B4 also plays a role in translational control on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it acts as a cofactor for the p180 protein. This interaction is crucial for the efficient translation of secretory proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin, by facilitating the assembly of polyribosomes on the ER (Ueno2019Component).

SF3B4's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in normal cellular function and development, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis in healthy human cells (Bernier2012Haploinsufficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SF3B4 gene are primarily associated with Nager syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial and limb abnormalities. Nager syndrome is part of a group of disorders known as acrofacial dysostoses (AFDs) and is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants in SF3B4, which encodes a component of the spliceosomal complex crucial for pre-mRNA splicing (Cassina2016A; Bernier2012Haploinsufficiency). Approximately 60% of Nager syndrome cases are attributed to SF3B4 mutations, which include frameshift, nonsense, splicing, and missense mutations (Yamada2020Heterozygous; Bernier2012Haploinsufficiency). These mutations lead to haploinsufficiency, resulting in truncated or altered polypeptides that contribute to the syndrome's clinical features (Bernier2012Haploinsufficiency).

SF3B4 mutations have also been implicated in Rodriguez syndrome, a severe form of Nager syndrome, and are linked to defects in neural crest cells, which are crucial for craniofacial development (Yamada2020Heterozygous; Kumar2024Etiology). In addition to congenital disorders, alterations in SF3B4 expression have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where increased SF3B4 expression correlates with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival (Liu2018SF3B4). This suggests that SF3B4 may function as an oncogene in certain cancers, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis (Liu2018SF3B4).

## Interactions
SF3B4 is a component of the SF3b complex, which is integral to the spliceosome involved in pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with other proteins within the SF3b complex, including SF3B2, forming stable subcomplexes. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain of SF3B4 and the proline-rich C-terminal domain of SF3B2 (Cretu2024Molecular; Yazhini2022Sequence). SF3B4 also interacts with nucleic acids, specifically crosslinking to U2 snRNA stem-loop structures and intron regions upstream of the branch site in spliceosomes, suggesting a role in tethering the SF3b complex to U2 snRNA (Cretu2024Molecular).

In addition to its role in splicing, SF3B4 is involved in translational control on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It acts as a cofactor for p180, an ER membrane protein, facilitating the assembly of polyribosomes and enhancing translation, particularly for secretory proteins. This interaction forms a p180-SF3B4-mRNA complex that is crucial for efficient protein synthesis (Ueno2019Component). SF3B4's interactions with p180 and its role in mRNA association are essential for collagen biosynthesis, as demonstrated by its involvement in the selective association of mRNAs with polyribosomes (Ueno2019Component).
