# LMAN2L

## Overview
The LMAN2L gene encodes the protein lectin, mannose-binding 2-like, which is categorized as an L-type lectin. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a significant role in the early secretory pathway. It is involved in the quality control of glycoprotein folding by binding to deglucosylated high-mannose-type N-glycans, which are indicative of mature glycoproteins that have undergone proper folding. LMAN2L functions as an intermediate cargo receptor, facilitating the transport of these glycoproteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, although it is not believed to cycle to the Golgi itself (Hunter2024HCMV). The gene has clinical significance, with mutations linked to neurological disorders such as intellectual disability and bipolar disorder, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions (Rafiullah2015Homozygous; Levchenko2023Genomic).

## Function
The LMAN2L gene encodes a protein that functions as an L-type lectin primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It plays a crucial role in the early secretory pathway by binding to deglucosylated high-mannose-type N-glycans, which are characteristic of mature glycoproteins that have undergone correct protein folding. This interaction suggests that LMAN2L assists in the receptor-mediated transport of mature glycoproteins out of the ER in COPII-coated vesicles, facilitating their trafficking to the Golgi apparatus (Hunter2024HCMV).

LMAN2L is involved in the quality control of glycoprotein folding, acting as an intermediate cargo receptor. It binds mature deglucosylated glycoproteins as they exit the calnexin/calreticulin/UGGT1 folding cycle, ensuring proper folding before they are transported to the plasma membrane. Although LMAN2L is an ER-resident protein and unlikely to cycle to the Golgi, it may cooperate with a cycling cargo receptor to facilitate the anterograde transport of certain substrates (Hunter2024HCMV).

In healthy cells, LMAN2L may function as a quality control sensor for protein folding rather than a key trafficking factor, temporarily retaining substrates in the ER to ensure proper folding (Hunter2024HCMV).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LMAN2L gene have been linked to several neurological disorders. A homozygous missense mutation, c.158 G>A; p.R53Q, in the LMAN2L gene has been associated with severe autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID) and mild infantile epileptic seizures in a large consanguineous Pakistani family. This mutation co-segregates with the intellectual disability phenotype, being homozygous in affected individuals and heterozygous in unaffected family members. The mutation is predicted to be pathogenic, affecting protein-protein interactions crucial for glycoprotein trafficking in the endoplasmic reticulum (Rafiullah2015Homozygous).

Alterations in LMAN2L expression have also been implicated in bipolar disorder (BD). Studies have identified LMAN2L as a gene whose expression is regulated by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) associated with BD. Decreased levels of LMAN2L in plasma have been identified as a risk factor for BD, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for the disorder (Jia2024Uncovering; Levchenko2023Genomic). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions, underscoring the importance of LMAN2L in maintaining normal cognitive function.

## Interactions
LMAN2L is involved in several interactions within the cell, particularly in the context of glycoprotein trafficking and quality control. It is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that selectively binds to deglucosylated high-mannose-type N-glycans, which are characteristic of mature glycoproteins. This interaction suggests that LMAN2L may function as an intermediate cargo receptor, facilitating the transport of glycoproteins to the Golgi apparatus (Hunter2024HCMV).

In the context of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, LMAN2L is targeted by the viral protein pUS2. pUS2 hijacks the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, utilizing the cellular E3 ligase TRC8 to ubiquitinate and degrade LMAN2L via the proteasome. This interaction is part of a mechanism by which HCMV alters the surface expression of certain proteins, such as integrin alpha-6 (ITGA6), by degrading LMAN2L (Hunter2024HCMV).

Additionally, LMAN2L has been implicated in protein-protein interactions that may affect its function. A homozygous missense mutation in LMAN2L, associated with intellectual disability, is predicted to impair protein-protein interactions by altering the interface between LMAN2L and other proteins (Rafiullah2015Homozygous).
