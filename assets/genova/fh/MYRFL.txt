# MYRFL

## Overview
The MYRFL gene encodes the myelin regulatory factor-like protein, a membrane-bound transcription factor involved in the regulation of myelin formation and maintenance. This protein plays a critical role in the maturation of oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for myelination in the central nervous system. MYRFL is initially synthesized as a type-II membrane protein and undergoes autocatalytic self-cleavage, a process essential for its function as a transcription factor (Wu2021Crystal; Li2013A). The protein's structure includes a β-helical stalk and an intramolecular chaperone autocleavage (ICA) domain, which are vital for its trimerization and transcriptional activity (Wu2021Crystal; Li2013A). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, further influence its cellular processing and localization, underscoring its complex regulatory role in cellular processes (Li2013A).

## Structure
The MYRFL protein is a membrane-bound transcription factor with a complex molecular structure that includes several important domains. It is initially synthesized as a type-II membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and undergoes autocatalytic self-cleavage, which is crucial for its function (Wu2021Crystal; Li2013A). The protein features a β-helical stalk that forms a triangular prism structure with three β-sheets, each composed of 4-6 parallel β-strands from three different subunits (Wu2021Crystal). This β-helical stalk is crucial for trimerization and stabilization of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) (Wu2021Crystal).

The MYRFL protein also contains an intramolecular chaperone autocleavage (ICA) domain, which facilitates trimerization and proteolysis. This domain is essential for the protein's transcriptional activity and its role in oligodendrocyte maturation (Li2013A). The trimerization is driven by a triple α-helical coiled-coil structure formed by the C-terminal α4 helices, with additional stabilization from collar structures formed by α1 and α3 helices (Wu2021Crystal).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are observed in MYRFL, influencing its cellular processing and localization (Li2013A). The protein undergoes proteolytic processing into N-terminal and C-terminal portions, with the N-terminus translocating to the nucleus to regulate transcription (Li2013A).
