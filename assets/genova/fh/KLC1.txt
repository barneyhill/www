# KLC1

## Overview
KLC1, or kinesin light chain 1, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the kinesin-1 motor protein complex, which is integral to intracellular transport processes. The protein kinesin light chain 1 is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate the binding of various cargoes, thereby playing a pivotal role in the transport of organelles and proteins along microtubules. As a regulatory subunit, KLC1 modulates the activity of the kinesin-1 complex through interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its binding affinity and transport efficiency (Zhu2012Crystal; Vagnoni2011Phosphorylation). The gene and its protein product are implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including neuronal transport and diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer, underscoring their significance in cellular function and human health (Morihara2014Transcriptome; Moamer2019A).

## Structure
Kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) is a component of the kinesin-1 motor protein complex, which plays a crucial role in intracellular transport. The molecular structure of KLC1 is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are essential for cargo binding. The TPR domain of KLC1 consists of six tandem repeats, each forming a helix-turn-helix structure, and the overall domain adopts a superhelical conformation (Nguyen2017Structural; Zhu2012Crystal). 

The primary structure of KLC1 includes specific residues such as N343, which forms a 'carboxylate clamp' with neighboring asparagines to interact with JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) (Zhu2012Crystal). The secondary structure is composed of 13 alpha-helices, with a non-TPR helix between TPR5 and TPR6 (Zhu2012Crystal). 

In terms of tertiary structure, the TPR domain exhibits structural plasticity, particularly in the N-terminal capping helix, which can adopt two distinct orientations, 'IN' and 'OUT', affecting the protein's interaction capabilities (Nguyen2017Structural). The quaternary structure involves interactions with kinesin heavy chains, facilitating the transport function of the kinesin-1 complex. 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate KLC1's function, with S460 identified as a potential phosphorylation site influencing binding affinity (Zhu2012Crystal).

## Function
Kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) is a crucial component of the kinesin-1 motor protein complex, which is responsible for the anterograde transport of various cargoes along microtubules in cells. KLC1 contains a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain that interacts with cargo proteins, facilitating the activation of kinesin-1 and its association with vesicles for transport (Kawano2012A). The interaction with specific motifs, such as the WD motif found in proteins like Alcadeinα, is sufficient to initiate kinesin-1 activation, highlighting the role of KLC1 in cargo recognition and transport (Kawano2012A).

KLC1 is involved in the regulation of kinesin-1 activity through its interactions with various binding partners, such as JIP1 and FEZ1, which are necessary for relieving autoinhibition and enabling microtubule-based motility (Blasius2007Two). The light chains, including KLC1, play a significant role in modulating the conformational state of kinesin-1, influencing its ATPase activity and transport efficiency (Yip2016The). KLC1's function is critical for processes like axonal transport in neurons, contributing to cellular organization and function (DeBoer2008Conventional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the KLC1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and breast cancer. In Alzheimer's disease, the KLC1 variant E is associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, a hallmark of AD pathology. Studies have shown that overexpression of KLC1 variant E increases Aβ secretion, while its knockdown reduces Aβ levels, suggesting a causative role in AD. Higher expression levels of this variant have been observed in the hippocampus of AD patients, indicating its involvement in the disease's progression (Morihara2014Transcriptome).

In breast cancer, KLC1 is involved in maintaining a non-invasive epithelial phenotype. Suppression of KLC1 expression in breast cancer cells leads to an invasive phenotype, characterized by increased expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and decreased epithelial markers. This change is associated with increased metastasis, highlighting KLC1's role in suppressing cancer progression (Moamer2019A).

Additionally, KLC1 variants have been linked to age-related cataract (ARC) and psoriasis. A specific haplotype in the KLC1 gene is associated with ARC, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the condition (Zhang2013Association). In psoriasis, a KLC1 variant appears to play a protective role, as it is found at a lower frequency in patients compared to normal individuals (Xing2021Variants).

## Interactions
Kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular transport. KLC1 interacts with calsyntenin-1, a type-1 membrane-spanning protein, and this interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation of KLC1 at serine 460. Phosphorylation by extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) reduces the binding of KLC1 to calsyntenin-1, while inhibition of ERK or mutation of serine 460 to alanine increases this binding, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for cargo transport (Vagnoni2011Phosphorylation).

KLC1 also interacts with JIP1 (JNK-interacting protein 1), a scaffold protein for the MAP kinase JNK. This interaction is specific to KLC1 and involves the TPR domain of KLC1 and the extreme C-terminus of JIP1. The interaction is crucial for the transport of certain cargoes, such as APP, and is modulated by phosphorylation at Thr466, which reduces the association of JIP1 with KLC1 (Nguyen2018Characterization).

Additionally, KLC1 interacts with torsinA, a protein associated with early onset dystonia. This interaction involves the TPR domain of KLC1 and the C-terminal region of torsinA, and is important for the proper intracellular transport of torsinA (Kamm2004The).
