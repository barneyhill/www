# MPDU1

## Overview
The MPDU1 gene encodes the protein mannose-P-dolichol utilization defect 1, which is integral to the process of N-linked glycosylation in mammalian cells. This protein is categorized as a membrane-associated protein that facilitates the utilization of dolichylphosphomannose (Dol-P-Man) and dolichylphosphoglucose (Dol-P-Glc) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). By enabling the proper flipping and spatial localization of these dolichol-P-sugars across the ER membrane, MPDU1 ensures the synthesis of complete lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs), which are essential for the glycosylation of nascent proteins. This process is crucial for the proper folding, stability, and function of glycoproteins. Mutations in the MPDU1 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, underscoring its vital role in cellular and organismal health (van2019A; Bennett2018MPDU1; Schenk2001MPDU1).

## Function
The MPDU1 gene encodes a protein essential for the proper utilization of dolichylphosphomannose (Dol-P-Man) and dolichylphosphoglucose (Dol-P-Glc) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mammalian cells. This protein plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs), which are crucial for N-linked glycosylation, a process necessary for the folding, stability, and trafficking of glycoproteins (Bennett2018MPDU1; Schenk2001MPDU1). MPDU1 facilitates the flipping of Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc across the ER membrane, ensuring their availability for glycosylation reactions (van2019A).

In healthy cells, MPDU1 is involved in the correct spatial localization of dolichol-P-sugars, which are essential for the mannosylation and glucosylation processes that synthesize complete precursor oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides are then transferred to nascent polypeptide chains by the enzyme complex oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase) (Kranz2001A; Schenk2003MPDU1). Proper function of MPDU1 is vital for maintaining normal glycosylation, which impacts various cellular processes and overall organismal health (Kranz2001A). Defects in MPDU1 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal function (Schenk2001MPDU1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MPDU1 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation, specifically CDG type If. This condition is characterized by a range of clinical symptoms, including severe psychomotor retardation, seizures, failure to thrive, dry skin with scaling and erythroderma, and impaired vision (Kranz2001A). Patients with MPDU1 mutations often exhibit hypoglycosylation of serum glycoproteins and the synthesis of truncated lipid-linked oligosaccharides, leading to incomplete glycosylation processes (Kranz2001A; Schenk2003MPDU1).

The disorder results from defects in the utilization of dolichylphosphomannose (Dol-P-Man) and dolichylphosphoglucose (Dol-P-Glc), which are crucial for the assembly of the dolichylpyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharide core in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Schenk2003MPDU1). Mutations in MPDU1 lead to the accumulation of specific lipid-linked oligosaccharide intermediates, such as dolichol-PP-GlcNAc2Man5 and dolichol-PP-GlcNAc2Man9, indicating a defect in oligosaccharide core assembly or its transfer to proteins (Schenk2003MPDU1; Haeuptle2009Congenital).

Clinical outcomes can vary, with some patients experiencing mild to moderately severe symptoms, while others may suffer from life-threatening conditions, such as seizure-induced apnea (Haeuptle2009Congenital).
