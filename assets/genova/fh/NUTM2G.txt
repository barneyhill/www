# NUTM2G

## Overview
NUTM2G is a gene that encodes the protein NUT family member 2G, which is implicated in various chromosomal rearrangements and fusion events associated with oncogenic processes. The protein encoded by NUTM2G is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of certain cancers through its involvement in gene fusions. Notably, NUTM2G is a variant partner in BCOR fusions, such as BCOR-NUTM2G, which are linked to uterine sarcomas and characterized by spindle cell morphology and genomic alterations like CDK4 amplification and CDKN2A loss (Lin2020Genomic). Additionally, NUTM2G is associated with high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HG-ESS) through gene fusions like YWHAE-NUTM2A/B, although its specific role in these fusions is not extensively detailed (Micci2020Molecular). The clinical implications of NUTM2G in these contexts are still under investigation, highlighting its potential role in tumor progression and oncogenesis.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
NUTM2G is involved in chromosomal rearrangements and fusion events that can lead to oncogenic transformations. In the context of uterine sarcomas, NUTM2G has been identified as a variant partner in BCOR fusions, specifically in BCOR-NUTM2G fusions. These fusions are associated with spindle cell morphology and are often accompanied by genomic alterations such as CDK4 amplification and CDKN2A loss, which are common in BCOR-rearranged uterine sarcomas (Lin2020Genomic). The clinical significance of NUTM2G mutations in these contexts is not fully understood, but the presence of such fusions suggests a role in the pathogenesis of these tumors (Micci2020Molecular).

NUTM2G is also mentioned in the context of high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HG-ESS), where it is involved in gene fusions like YWHAE-NUTM2A/B, although specific details about NUTM2G's role in these fusions are not extensively covered (Micci2020Molecular). The clinical implications of NUTM2G in these sarcomas remain to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in gene fusions indicates a potential role in tumor progression and oncogenesis.
