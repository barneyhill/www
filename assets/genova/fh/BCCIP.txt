# BCCIP

## Overview
BCCIP (BRCA2 and CDKN1A interacting protein) is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA repair and ribosome biogenesis. The BCCIP protein, which exists in two isoforms, BCCIPα and BCCIPβ, is characterized by its structural similarity to GCN5-related N-acetyltransferases (GNATs) and plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability. It interacts with tumor suppressors BRCA2 and p21, facilitating homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of DNA double-strand breaks, and is essential for the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit. BCCIP's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cell proliferation and viability. Alterations in the BCCIP gene have been linked to various cancers, including breast cancer and glioblastomas, highlighting its potential as a marker for cancer prognosis (Ye2020BCCIP; DrozRosario2017Roles; Choi2021Structure; Lu2005The).

## Structure
BCCIP is a nuclear protein that interacts with tumor suppressors BRCA2 and p21. It exists in two isoforms, BCCIPα and BCCIPβ, with BCCIPβ being conserved across eukaryotes. The protein structure of BCCIPβ has been elucidated through crystallography, revealing a single domain of α/β fold. This structure includes a mixed seven-stranded β sheet surrounded by α helices, divided into two halves. The N-terminal half (residues 61-185) forms two βααβ hairpins, while the C-terminal half (residues 186-314) forms a three-stranded antiparallel β sheet with α helices. These halves are connected by helix αE, creating a contiguous β sheet with a V shape (Choi2021Structure).

BCCIP shares structural similarities with GCN5-related N-acetyltransferases (GNATs), particularly in its N-terminal half, but differs in having additional helices that close the binding groove for protein substrates. It also contains a positively charged pocket that may bind small molecules. The acetyl-CoA binding region is conserved but features distinct sequence motifs. The C-terminal half is oriented differently, with insertions that alter the acetyl-CoA binding site (Choi2021Structure). The N-terminal 60 residues of BCCIPβ are predicted to be highly disordered, which may have affected crystallization attempts (Choi2021Structure).

## Function
The BCCIP protein plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability through its involvement in DNA repair and ribosome biogenesis. In healthy human cells, BCCIP interacts with BRCA2 and RAD51, facilitating homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of DNA double-strand breaks. This interaction is essential for the formation of nuclear foci necessary for DNA repair, as BCCIP colocalizes with BRCA2 and RAD51 in these foci (Lu2005The). BCCIP's role in HRR is critical for maintaining genomic integrity, as its downregulation significantly reduces HRR efficiency and leads to chromosomal instability (Meng2007Roles; Lu2005The).

BCCIP is also involved in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit. It is essential for the nucleolar recruitment of eIF6 and the production of 12S pre-rRNA, a precursor to the 5.8S rRNA component of the 60S subunit. Although BCCIP is not a component of mature ribosomes, its role in pre-rRNA processing is crucial for ribosome maturation (Ye2020BCCIP). BCCIP's functions in both DNA repair and ribosome biogenesis highlight its importance in cell proliferation and viability.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the BCCIP gene, which interacts with BRCA2 and CDKN1A, have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), BCCIP downregulation is observed in 49% of cases. This downregulation is often mutually exclusive with p53 mutations but concurrent with 53BP1 loss, suggesting a specific pathway of tumor development (DrozRosario2017Roles). BCCIP deficiency in a mouse model leads to benign mammary nodules, with a small percentage progressing to malignancy, indicating its role in tumor initiation but not progression (DrozRosario2017Roles).

In brain tumors, particularly glioblastomas, BCCIP alterations are common, with about 75% of cases showing gene loss. This loss is associated with higher tumor grades and poor prognosis (Liu2009Alterations). BCCIP deficiency also contributes to liver cancer and B-cell lymphoma in mice, with partial loss leading to spontaneous tumor development and associated with chronic inflammation and protein misfolding (Lu2020Spontaneous). These findings highlight BCCIP's role in maintaining genomic stability and its potential as a marker for cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
BCCIP interacts with several proteins involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. It forms a complex with BRCA2, a key protein in homologous recombinational repair (HRR), through a shared domain present in both BCCIPα and BCCIPβ isoforms. This interaction is crucial for the formation of BRCA2 and RAD51 foci, which are essential for HRR (Lu2005The). BCCIP also interacts with RAD51, another protein involved in HRR, and colocalizes with BRCA2 and RAD51 in nuclear foci, indicating a functional role in DNA repair processes (Lu2005The).

BCCIP is involved in ribosome biogenesis, interacting with eIF6 and RPL23. Its nucleolar localization is crucial for eIF6 recruitment, necessary for 60S ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation (Ye2020BCCIP). BCCIP also interacts with the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPμ, with this interaction being dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation and stabilized by Src kinase activity (Phillips‐Mason2008BCCIP).

BCCIP is suggested to play a role in p53 regulation by promoting the formation of p53 tetramers, which are necessary for its transcriptional activity, although BCCIP does not directly bind to p53's target DNA sequences (Meng2007Abrogation).
