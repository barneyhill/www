# ANKRD18A

## Overview
ANKRD18A is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 18A protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that ankyrin repeat domain 18A may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the specific biological functions of the ANKRD18A gene and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, its involvement in epigenetic regulation has been noted, particularly in the context of lung cancer. The gene's promoter region is frequently hypermethylated in lung cancer tissues, leading to reduced expression, which highlights its potential role in tumorigenesis and as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis (Liu2012ANKRD18A). Additionally, ANKRD18A has been identified in genome-wide association studies as a locus of interest in pulmonary function, specifically in relation to the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Sakornsakolpat2019GenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance
The ANKRD18A gene has been implicated in lung cancer through its epigenetic regulation. Research indicates that the promoter region of ANKRD18A is frequently hypermethylated in lung cancer tissues, occurring in 68.4% of cases, while no methylation is observed in normal lung tissues. This hypermethylation correlates with reduced mRNA expression of ANKRD18A in cancerous tissues and cell lines, suggesting that it plays a role in the downregulation of the gene in lung cancer. Treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-dC, has been shown to restore ANKRD18A expression in methylated lung cancer cell lines, indicating that hypermethylation is a key mechanism of its downregulation. These findings suggest that ANKRD18A hypermethylation could serve as a biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis or prognosis and may be a target for therapeutic intervention (Liu2012ANKRD18A).

In addition, ANKRD18A has been identified as a suggestive locus in a genome-wide association study related to the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), a pulmonary function test used in assessing COPD. However, the specific clinical significance of ANKRD18A in relation to DLCO or COPD was not detailed (Sakornsakolpat2019GenomeWide).
