# QSER1

## Overview
QSER1, or glutamine and serine-rich protein 1, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of DNA methylation and chromatin dynamics. The protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells by preventing excessive DNA methylation, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular differentiation. QSER1 functions as part of a protective mechanism that collaborates with TET1 to counteract the chromatin binding of DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, preserving large unmethylated regions crucial for developmental regulation (Gu2021The). Additionally, QSER1 is implicated in epigenetic regulation through potential interactions with OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation processes, which are essential for DNA demethylation (Wang2021PROSER1). The protein's involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation underscores its significance in developmental processes and disease states, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Sanadgol2023Presenilin1Derived; Muscò2024Shedding).

## Structure


## Function
QSER1 (glutamine and serine-rich protein 1) plays a crucial role in regulating DNA methylation and maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells by preventing excessive methylation. It functions in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cellular differentiation. QSER1 is involved in a 'push' protection mechanism that restricts DNA methylation, working in conjunction with TET1 to antagonize the chromatin binding of DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B. This interaction helps preserve the developmental potential of stem cells by maintaining large unmethylated regions associated with developmental regulators (Gu2021The).

QSER1 is also suggested to be a potential substrate for OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation, which is crucial for DNA demethylation processes. It may work together with PROSER1 in a protein network to regulate DNA demethylation via OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of the TET protein family, although the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear (Wang2021PROSER1). In mammals, QSER1 is involved in maintaining a poised chromatin state during development by counteracting DNA hypermethylation, suggesting its role in epigenetic regulation of developmental processes (Muscò2024Shedding).

## Clinical Significance
QSER1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through mutations, expression alterations, and interaction changes. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), QSER1 is part of a gene module associated with tumor differentiation. Its expression is significantly upregulated in LUAD tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with worse overall survival and progression-free survival in patients (Yi2020Identifying). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), QSER1 is identified as a DNA methylation regulator with a significant hazard ratio, indicating its potential impact on patient survival. It is negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses (Zhao2024DNA).

QSER1 is also involved in immune evasion and cancer progression, as it is mutated in over 100 patient tumors across various malignancies, indicating its potential role in these processes (Patel2017Identification). In male infertility, a large de novo deletion involving QSER1 was identified in a patient with non-obstructive azoospermia, highlighting its potential significance in understanding male infertility (Oud2022A). Additionally, QSER1 interacts with miRNAs linked to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its involvement in the regulatory network affecting neurodegenerative disorders (Sanadgol2023Presenilin1Derived).

## Interactions
QSER1 (glutamine and serine rich 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cellular processes. It has been identified as part of a mechanism that restricts DNA methylation, working in conjunction with TET1 to antagonize the chromatin binding of DNMT3A and DNMT3B. This interaction helps preserve the developmental potential of stem cells by maintaining large unmethylated regions associated with developmental regulators (Gu2021The).

In the context of cancer, QSER1 has been observed to show significant variation in precursor intensity between breast and ovarian cancer. It is most frequently observed in ovarian cancer, although it shows higher average intensity in breast cancer when all peptides are considered. The peptide QPKVKAEPPPK, specific to QSER1, was detected in ovarian cancer samples, indicating its potential role in cancer biology (Dufresne2019The).

QSER1 is also associated with the BRD1-L isoform, which is suggested to regulate gene expression further from transcription start sites, potentially involving chromatin loop status. This interaction highlights QSER1's involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation (Fryland2016Identification).
