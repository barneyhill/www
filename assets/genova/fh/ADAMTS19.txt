# ADAMTS19

## Overview
ADAMTS19 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 19, which is part of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role as secreted metalloproteases involved in the processing of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, thereby influencing tissue remodeling and cellular signaling. The ADAMTS19 protein is particularly implicated in the regulation of ECM integrity and mesenchymal-to-endothelial signaling, which are crucial for normal physiological processes and development. Dysregulation of ADAMTS19, through genetic mutations or epigenetic modifications, has been associated with various pathological conditions, including colorectal cancer, heart valve disease, and premature ovarian failure, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Wünnemann2019Loss; Alonso2015Epigenetic; Fonseca2015Next).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADAMTS19 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the ADAMTS19 gene is frequently hypermethylated, leading to its transcriptional repression. This epigenetic silencing is associated with CRC characterized by BRAF mutations and the mucinous phenotype, and it may contribute to the metastatic spread of CRC, particularly to the ovary and omentum (Alonso2015Epigenetic). The hypermethylation of ADAMTS19 is also observed in other gastrointestinal cancers, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker for these malignancies (Alonso2015Epigenetic).

In the context of heart valve disease (HVD), loss-of-function mutations in ADAMTS19 have been linked to progressive, non-syndromic HVD in both humans and mice. These mutations result in valve maturation defects and increased cellularity and proteoglycan deposition, leading to ECM disorganization (Wünnemann2019Loss). The gene's role in maintaining ECM integrity and mesenchymal-to-endothelial signaling balance makes it a potential therapeutic target for HVD (Wünnemann2019Loss).

Additionally, a novel mutation in ADAMTS19 has been identified in a patient with premature ovarian failure (POF), suggesting a rare causative variant that may affect extracellular matrix turnover in ovarian somatic cells (Fonseca2015Next).
