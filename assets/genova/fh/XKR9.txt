# XKR9

## Overview
XKR9 is a gene that encodes the XK related 9 protein, a member of the XK family involved in apoptotic lipid scrambling. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein with eight membrane-spanning helices, organized into two structurally related domains. XKR9 plays a pivotal role in the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface during apoptosis, a process crucial for the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein is activated by caspase-3, which cleaves a specific site, releasing an inhibitory C-terminal segment and enabling its function. Despite its structural elucidation, the precise mechanisms and potential interaction partners required for XKR9's scramblase activity remain to be fully understood, highlighting the need for further research in this area (Straub2021CryoEM).

## Structure
The XKR9 protein is a monomeric membrane protein with a molecular weight of 43 kDa, consisting of eight membrane-spanning helices and two segments partly inserted into the lipid bilayer (Straub2021CryoEM). The structure is organized into two domains, each containing four transmembrane helices, forming a novel protein fold with two structurally related repeats (Straub2021CryoEM). These helices are connected by loops, and the protein includes two long intracellular regions with α-helices partly inserted in the membrane (Straub2021CryoEM).

The protein features furrow-like structures that may facilitate lipid translocation, similar to the phospholipid scramblase nhTMEM16, and contains cavities that might interact with lipid headgroups (Straub2021CryoEM). The presence of polar and charged residues within the transmembrane helices suggests potential roles in electrostatics and protein stability (Straub2021CryoEM). The C-terminus of XKR9 interacts with a hydrophobic site on the intracellular side, inhibiting its function until cleavage by caspase-3, which is a primary activating step (Straub2021CryoEM). The study did not observe significant conformational changes upon cleavage, indicating that additional components may be required for its scramblase activity (Straub2021CryoEM).

## Function
The XKR9 protein is a member of the XK family, which plays a crucial role in apoptotic lipid scrambling, a process essential for the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell surface. This exposure acts as a signal for macrophages to clear apoptotic cells, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating the orderly removal of dying cells (Straub2021CryoEM). XKR9 is activated by caspase-3, which cleaves a specific site on the protein, releasing a C-terminal segment and allowing the protein to function (Straub2021CryoEM). 

Structurally, XKR9 is a monomeric membrane protein with eight membrane-spanning helices organized into two structurally related repeats. The protein's C-terminus interacts with a hydrophobic site on the intracellular side, inhibiting its function until cleaved by caspase-3 (Straub2021CryoEM). Despite its defined structure, the study did not observe lipid scrambling activity upon reconstitution, suggesting that additional components might be required for its function (Straub2021CryoEM). Potential activation mechanisms include conformational changes, dimerization, or interaction with an extrinsic partner, similar to the interaction between XKR8 and basigin (Straub2021CryoEM). These insights provide a foundation for understanding the molecular processes XKR9 is involved in and its role in cell biology.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
XKR9, a member of the XK family involved in apoptotic lipid scrambling, has been studied for its potential interactions with other proteins. Despite extensive research, no direct interactions with accessory proteins like basigin, which is known to interact with the human homologue XKR8, have been confirmed for XKR9. This suggests that basigin is not an essential partner for XKR9's activity (Straub2021CryoEM). 

The protein is activated by caspase-3 cleavage, which removes an inhibitory C-terminal peptide, potentially allowing for interactions with other factors. However, the specific partners or subunits necessary for XKR9's function remain unidentified (Straub2021CryoEM). 

While XKR9 shares similarities with XKR8, which forms complexes with basigin or neuroplastin to facilitate its function, such interactions have not been observed for XKR9. This indicates that XKR9 might require different or additional components for its scramblase activity (Suzuki2016Xkr8; Straub2021CryoEM). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise interaction partners and mechanisms underlying XKR9's role in lipid scrambling.
