# DENND5B

## Overview
DENND5B is a gene that encodes the DENN domain-containing protein 5B, which is a member of the DENN domain-containing family of proteins. This protein is primarily involved in intracellular vesicular transport pathways, functioning as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases. The DENND5B protein plays a significant role in the regulation of intestinal triglyceride absorption and body mass by facilitating the post-Golgi transport and secretion of chylomicrons in enterocytes. These processes are crucial for lipid absorption in the intestine and have implications for metabolic health, including obesity and related conditions (Gordon2019DENND5B). Variants of the DENND5B gene have been associated with differences in body mass index (BMI) and lipid metabolism, particularly in females, highlighting its potential impact on body composition and metabolic diseases (Gordon2019DENND5B).

## Function
The DENND5B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the regulation of intestinal triglyceride absorption and body mass. It is involved in the post-Golgi transport and secretion of chylomicrons by enterocytes, which are essential for lipid absorption in the intestine. This process influences metabolic status and can contribute to obesity and related complications (Gordon2019DENND5B). The DENND5B protein is part of the DENN domain-containing family, which is involved in intracellular vesicular transport pathways, likely through its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity toward Rab GTPases (Gordon2019DENND5B). 

In humans, a common variant of DENND5B, p.(R52K), has been associated with lower body mass index (BMI) and abdominal circumference in females, suggesting its role in body composition and peripheral lipoprotein metabolism (Gordon2019DENND5B). The gene is highly expressed in the liver and intestine, particularly in the duodenum, indicating its importance in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Gordon2019DENND5B). The protein's activity in the transport and fusion of chylomicron secretory vesicles suggests its potential protective effects against conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Gordon2019DENND5B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DENND5B gene have been linked to various metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. In humans, a common variant of DENND5B, p.(R52K), has been associated with body mass index (BMI), suggesting its influence on body composition and peripheral lipoprotein metabolism (Gordon2019DENND5B). Studies have shown that females homozygous for the p.(R52K) variant have significantly lower BMI and abdominal circumference compared to those with the homozygous reference allele, although this effect was not observed in males (Gordon2019DENND5B). Another variant, p.(H487N), has been associated with LDL-C levels but not BMI, indicating that DENND5B may have multiple functions influencing metabolism (Gordon2019DENND5B).

In Dennd5b knockout mice, the absence of this gene leads to decreased absorption of dietary triglycerides due to a defect in chylomicron secretion, resulting in resistance to diet-induced obesity, changes in plasma lipids, and reduced aortic atherosclerosis (Gordon2019DENND5B). These findings suggest potential protective effects against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease due to reduced lipid accumulation in the liver (Gordon2019DENND5B). The gene's role in lipid metabolism and its variants' associations with metabolic traits highlight its clinical significance in obesity and cardiovascular diseases.
