# PCDH17

## Overview
Protocadherin 17 (PCDH17) is a gene that encodes a member of the δ-protocadherin subfamily, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion processes. The protein encoded by PCDH17, known as protocadherin 17, is a transmembrane protein characterized by its extracellular domain containing six cadherin repeats, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. This protein plays a crucial role in neural development, particularly in synaptic development and cell motility, by mediating interactions with the actin cytoskeleton and influencing dendritic spine morphology. PCDH17 is expressed prominently in brain regions such as the amygdala and hippocampus, which are associated with memory and emotional processing. Clinically, PCDH17 has been implicated in various diseases, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor. Additionally, genetic variations in PCDH17 have been linked to major mood disorders, highlighting its significance in both oncological and neurological contexts (Hayashi2014Protocadherin17; Biswas2009Cloning; Chang2017The).

## Structure
Protocadherin 17 (PCDH17) is a member of the δ-protocadherin subfamily, characterized by its role in cell-cell adhesion. The primary structure of PCDH17 includes an extracellular domain with six conserved cadherin repeats (EC1-6), a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain is crucial for homophilic binding and contains conserved cysteines important for disulfide bond formation (Biswas2009Cloning). The transmembrane domain shows a high sequence identity of 92% between human and zebrafish PCDH17, indicating its evolutionary conservation (Biswas2009Cloning).

The secondary structure of PCDH17 involves beta-sheets within the cadherin repeats, which facilitate adhesion. The tertiary structure is characterized by the folding of these repeats, forming linear arrangements stabilized by calcium ions (Harrison2020Familywide). The quaternary structure involves the formation of antiparallel trans dimers through EC1-EC4 and EC2-EC3 interfaces, with symmetric EC3:EC3 contacts at the dimer center (Harrison2020Familywide).

Post-translational modifications include N-linked and O-linked glycosylation, although these do not significantly impact protein-protein interfaces (Harrison2020Familywide). The cytoplasmic domain contains conserved motifs, CM1 and CM2, which are characteristic of the δ-protocadherin subfamily (Biswas2009Cloning).

## Function
Protocadherin 17 (PCDH17) is involved in several critical molecular processes within healthy human cells, primarily related to cell motility and synaptic development. PCDH17 plays a significant role in mediating cell-cell adhesion and enhancing cell motility by interacting with the actin cytoskeleton. It recruits actin regulator complexes, such as the WAVE complex, to intercellular contact sites, facilitating actin polymerization and promoting cell migration (Hayashi2014Protocadherin17; Hayashi2015Emerging). This interaction is crucial for the movement of growth cones along axons, particularly in neurons of the amygdala, where PCDH17 expression is prominent (Hayashi2014Protocadherin17).

PCDH17 also influences synaptic development and function by affecting dendritic spine morphology. Overexpression of PCDH17 has been shown to decrease spine density and alter spine morphology, which can impact synaptic transmission and plasticity (Chang2017The). These molecular activities suggest that PCDH17 is essential for maintaining proper neuronal wiring and function, contributing to the stability and formation of neural circuits in the brain (Hayashi2014Protocadherin17). The gene's expression in brain regions involved in memory and emotional processes, such as the amygdala and hippocampus, underscores its role in cognitive and emotional functions (Chang2017The).

## Clinical Significance
The PCDH17 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in synaptic function. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), PCDH17 is frequently silenced through promoter hypermethylation, leading to reduced mRNA and protein expression. This silencing is associated with poorer differentiation status and potentially worse prognosis in ESCC, suggesting that PCDH17 inactivation contributes to tumorigenesis (Haruki2010Frequent).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PCDH17 is significantly down-regulated and hypermethylated in leukemia stem cells compared to healthy hematopoietic stem cells. This downregulation is linked to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which plays a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Xu2019Reduced). In pediatric acute leukemia, PCDH17 expression is primarily downregulated by aberrant histone acetylation, and its restoration through histone deacetylase inhibitors can inhibit leukemic cell growth (Thanh2019PCDH17).

PCDH17 is also associated with major mood disorders, including bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Genetic variations in the PCDH17 region are linked to these conditions, with alterations in expression affecting synaptic function and contributing to the pathophysiology of mood disorders (Chang2017The).

## Interactions
Protocadherin-17 (PCDH17) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neural development and cell motility. PCDH17 interacts with the WAVE complex, a key regulator of actin polymerization, by recruiting its components, such as Nap1, WAVE1, and Abi-1, to interaxonal contacts. This interaction facilitates the recruitment of actin regulator complexes to these sites, promoting axon extension and cell motility (Hayashi2014Protocadherin17).

PCDH17 also recruits Lamellipodin (Lpd) and Ena/VASP proteins to cell-cell contacts, which are essential for actin dynamics and membrane protrusion. The presence of PCDH17 at these sites leads to the colocalization of Lpd and VASP, enhancing cell motility and axon migration (Hayashi2014Protocadherin17).

In terms of binding interactions, PCDH17 primarily engages in homophilic interactions, although it can also bind heterophilically with PCDH12. This binding specificity is mediated through its extracellular domains, which are involved in both homophilic and potential heterophilic interactions (Harrison2020Familywide). These interactions are critical for PCDH17's function in cell adhesion and neural connectivity.
