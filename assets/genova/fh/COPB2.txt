# COPB2

## Overview
The COPB2 gene encodes the COPI coat complex subunit beta 2, a critical component of the coatomer protein complex I (COPI) involved in intracellular transport processes. This protein is essential for the retrograde transport of vesicles between the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells, playing a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and the structural integrity of the Golgi (Feng2021COPB2:; Wang2020COPB2). As a cytoplasmic protein, COPI coat complex subunit beta 2 is integral to the sorting and modification of proteins, ensuring their proper function within the cell (Bhandari2019COPB2). Dysregulation of COPB2 expression is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and coatopathy, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular operations and disease states (Marom2020COPB2haploinsufficiency; Bhandari2019COPB2).

## Function
The COPB2 gene encodes a subunit of the coatomer protein complex I (COPI), which is essential for vesicular transport between the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells. This transport is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating the movement of proteins and lipids within cells (Feng2021COPB2:; Wang2020COPB2). COPB2 is one of the seven subunits of the COPI complex and plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity and polarity of the Golgi structure, as well as the maturity of membrane vesicles (Feng2021COPB2:).

In healthy human cells, COPB2 is involved in intracellular protein transport, specifically in the ER-to-Golgi and Golgi-to-ER vesicle-mediated transport. This function is vital for the proper sorting and modification of proteins, allowing them to perform their physiological roles (Zhou2019High). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for proper protein sorting and cellular homeostasis (Bhandari2019COPB2). By maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, COPB2 ensures the efficient transport of cellular materials, which is essential for normal cellular operations (Feng2021COPB2:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the COPB2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In cancer, COPB2 is frequently upregulated, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. In breast cancer, high COPB2 expression is linked to increased cell migration, invasion, and lymph node metastasis, while its down-regulation inhibits these processes and induces apoptosis (Bhandari2019COPB2). In prostate carcinoma, COPB2 upregulation is associated with lower survival rates, and its knockdown results in increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Mi2018Coatomer). COPB2 also plays a role in colorectal cancer, where its silencing activates apoptotic pathways, suggesting its function as an oncogene (Wang2020COPB2).

Beyond cancer, COPB2 haploinsufficiency is linked to a condition termed coatopathy, characterized by osteoporosis and developmental delay. This condition is associated with disrupted collagen trafficking, leading to bone fragility and developmental issues (Marom2020COPB2haploinsufficiency). Pathogenic variants in COPB2 have been identified in individuals with neurodevelopmental features, including microcephaly and spasticity, further expanding the phenotypic spectrum of COPB2-related disorders (Marom2020COPB2haploinsufficiency).
