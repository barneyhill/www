# SLU7

## Overview
SLU7 is a gene that encodes the SLU7 homolog, a splicing factor protein that plays a pivotal role in the pre-mRNA splicing process, specifically during the second step of splicing. This protein is integral to the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNA, ensuring the correct selection of the 3' splice site and maintaining the fidelity of splicing (Alberstein2007Regulation; Chua1999Human). Beyond its splicing function, SLU7 is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by preventing mitotic abnormalities and the formation of R-loops, which can lead to DNA damage (Jiménez2019Splicing). The protein's interactions with other spliceosomal components, such as Prp18 and Prp22, underscore its essential role in the splicing process (JAMES2002How). Dysregulation of SLU7 has been linked to genomic instability and diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Jiménez2019Splicing).

## Function
The SLU7 gene encodes a splicing factor that is crucial for the second step of pre-mRNA splicing, a process essential for generating mature mRNA from precursor mRNA. SLU7 is involved in the selection of the 3' splice site, ensuring the fidelity of splicing by preventing the activation of incorrect splice sites, particularly when the correct and incorrect sites are in close proximity (Alberstein2007Regulation). It operates within the spliceosome, a complex responsible for splicing, and is necessary for the structural rearrangement of the spliceosome between the two catalytic steps of splicing (Chua1999Human).

SLU7 also plays a significant role in maintaining genome integrity. It is involved in proper spindle assembly and sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis, preventing mitotic abnormalities such as defects in chromosome alignment and spindle polarity (Jiménez2019Splicing). The absence of SLU7 can lead to genomic instability, as it helps prevent the formation of R-loops, which are RNA-DNA hybrids that can induce DNA damage (Jiménez2019Splicing). SLU7's regulation of splicing extends to specific RNA processing factors like SRSF1 and SRSF3, further highlighting its role in maintaining cellular and genomic stability (Jiménez2019Splicing).

## Clinical Significance
The SLU7 gene plays a critical role in maintaining genome integrity, and its dysregulation is associated with several diseases. Alterations in SLU7 expression have been linked to genomic instability, which is a hallmark of cancer. In particular, SLU7 downregulation is observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhotic livers, suggesting its involvement in liver disease progression and hepatocarcinogenesis (Jiménez2019Splicing). The knockdown of SLU7 leads to the formation of R-loops and DNA damage, contributing to genomic instability and mitotic errors, such as loss of sister chromatid cohesion (Jiménez2019Splicing).

SLU7 is also implicated in the splicing of critical proteins like sororin and SRSF3. Its knockdown results in the accumulation of unspliced sororin pre-mRNA and the generation of truncated SRSF3 proteins, which further contribute to genomic instability (Jiménez2019Splicing). These splicing defects are associated with increased DNA damage and altered cell-cycle progression, particularly in cancer cells, making SLU7 a potential target for cancer therapy (Jiménez2019Splicing). The study of SLU7's role in these processes highlights its importance in disease contexts, particularly in liver-related conditions and cancer.

## Interactions
The SLU7 protein is involved in several critical interactions within the spliceosome complex, particularly during the second step of pre-mRNA splicing. SLU7 interacts with Prp18 and Prp22, forming a cooperative network essential for the splicing process. These interactions are crucial for the ATP-independent stage of the second transesterification step, where SLU7, Prp18, and Prp22 associate with the spliceosome in an ordered manner (JAMES2002How). The interaction between SLU7 and Prp18 is particularly important, as mutations in SLU7 that disrupt this interaction lead to defects in splicing activity (JAMES2002How).

SLU7 also plays a role in stabilizing the interaction of Prp8 with the 3' splice site (3 SS) during exon ligation. It crosslinks at specific positions near the 3 SS, suggesting its role in stabilizing the spliceosome structure during the splicing process (Chung2018Dynamic). Additionally, SLU7 interacts dynamically with pre-mRNA and then stably with the 3'-exon after Prp16-mediated spliceosome remodeling, facilitating the positioning of the 3' SS at the active site for exon ligation (Chung2018Dynamic). These interactions highlight SLU7's essential role in the precise execution of splicing events.
