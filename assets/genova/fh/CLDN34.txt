# CLDN34

## Overview
The CLDN34 gene encodes the protein claudin 34, which is a member of the claudin family of proteins. Claudins are integral membrane proteins that play a critical role in the formation and function of tight junctions, which are essential for maintaining the selective permeability barrier in epithelial and endothelial cell layers. As a transmembrane protein, claudin 34 contributes to the regulation of paracellular transport and cellular polarity, influencing various physiological processes. The expression and function of claudin 34 are of particular interest in the context of tissue-specific barrier properties and have implications in understanding certain pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
