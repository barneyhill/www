# NARS2

## Overview
The NARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase 2, a class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the attachment of asparagine to its corresponding tRNA, a crucial step in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins (Simon2015Mutations; Yang2024Novel). The NARS2 protein functions as a homodimer and is composed of 477 amino acids, featuring an aminoacyl-binding domain and a catalytic domain essential for its enzymatic activity (Simon2015Mutations; Hu2022Clinical). Mutations in the NARS2 gene have been linked to several mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome and nonsyndromic hearing loss, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Simon2015Mutations; Hu2022Clinical).

## Structure
The NARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, a protein crucial for attaching asparagine to its corresponding tRNA, facilitating protein synthesis. The NARS2 protein consists of 477 amino acids and functions as a homodimer (Yang2024Novel; Hu2022Clinical). It includes an anticodon-binding domain (ABD) and a catalytic domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Simon2015Mutations; Hu2022Clinical). The catalytic domain is where most mutations associated with diseases are located (Simon2015Mutations).

The protein's structure is characterized by hydrophobic pockets that play a role in maintaining its stability and function. For instance, the wild-type Leu62 is located in such a pocket, forming hydrophobic interactions with surrounding residues (Hu2022Clinical). Mutations like Leu62Pro and Phe170Cys can disrupt these interactions, affecting the protein's dimerization and stability (Hu2022Clinical).

NARS2 also contains three conserved motifs typical of class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are crucial for its function in charging mitochondrial tRNAs with asparagine (Yang2024Novel; Sofou2014Whole). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by its ability to form quaternary structures through dimerization, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Simon2015Mutations).

## Function
The NARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme that plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the attachment of asparagine to its corresponding tRNA, a fundamental step in translating mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins (Simon2015Mutations; Yang2024Novel). The NARS2 protein functions as a homodimer and is composed of 477 amino acids, featuring an aminoacyl-binding domain and a catalytic domain (Simon2015Mutations; Hu2022Clinical).

In healthy human cells, NARS2 is essential for the proper functioning of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is crucial for cellular energy production (Simon2015Mutations). The enzyme's activity supports the electron transport chain by ensuring the correct translation of mitochondrial proteins, thereby maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Simon2015Mutations). NARS2 is widely expressed in various tissues, including the brain and inner ear, indicating its importance in the normal functioning of the auditory and central nervous systems (Simon2015Mutations).

Mutations in NARS2 can disrupt these processes, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and associated clinical manifestations, such as nonsyndromic hearing loss and Leigh syndrome (Simon2015Mutations; Hu2022Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NARS2 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome, nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB94), Alpers syndrome, and combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 24 (COXPD24). Leigh syndrome is a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brain stem, often accompanied by elevated lactate levels and mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies (Simon2015Mutations). Nonsyndromic hearing loss linked to NARS2 mutations is identified as DFNB94, with the p.Val213Phe mutation specifically associated with this condition (Simon2015Mutations).

Alpers syndrome, another condition associated with NARS2 mutations, presents with symptoms such as epilepsy, microcephaly, and psychomotor delay (Sofou2021The). COXPD24 is characterized by a range of phenotypes, including visual and hearing abnormalities, myopathy, and neurodevelopmental disorders (Yang2024Novel). The pathogenicity of these mutations often results from impaired mitochondrial function due to defective protein synthesis, as seen in reduced levels of mitochondrial tRNA Asn and decreased activity of mitochondrial complexes (Simon2015Mutations). These conditions highlight the critical role of NARS2 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its impact on human health when mutated.

## Interactions
The NARS2 protein, a mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with mitochondrial tRNA (mtAsn), playing a crucial role in nuclear transcription regulation. This interaction promotes the binding of NARS2 with the epigenetic regulator HDAC2, impacting cell proliferation and metabolic alterations (Rouya2023Inter-organellar). The interaction between NARS2 and HDAC2 is RNA-dependent and requires mtAsn, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is absent in ρ0 cells, indicating the necessity of mitochondrial nucleic acids (Rouya2023Inter-organellar).

NARS2 also forms homodimers, a common feature among class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Mutations such as p.Asn381Ser can disrupt this dimerization, while others like p.Val213Phe do not affect it (Simon2015Mutations). Additionally, NARS2 is part of a complex interaction network with coronavirus proteins, although direct physical interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins were not confirmed (Feng2022The).

These interactions highlight NARS2's multifaceted role in cellular processes, extending beyond its primary function in mitochondrial protein synthesis to include significant regulatory roles in nuclear transcription and potential involvement in viral protein interaction networks.
