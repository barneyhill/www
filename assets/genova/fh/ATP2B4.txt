# ATP2B4

## Overview
ATP2B4 is a gene that encodes the protein ATPase plasma membrane Ca2+ transporting 4, commonly referred to as PMCA4. PMCA4 is a transmembrane enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis by actively transporting calcium ions out of cells, utilizing ATP hydrolysis. This protein is characterized by its 10 transmembrane domains and a large cytosolic loop, which are essential for its function in calcium ion transport and ATP binding. PMCA4 is involved in various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, cardiac function, and sperm motility, by regulating intracellular calcium levels. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that exhibit distinct regulatory properties. PMCA4's activity is modulated by interactions with calmodulin and other proteins, which influence its localization and function within cellular signaling pathways (Brini2009Calcium; Bozgeyik2017ATP2B4; Padányi2016Multifaceted).

## Structure
The ATP2B4 gene encodes the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4 (PMCA4), a protein involved in the transport of calcium ions across the cell membrane. PMCA4 is characterized by its structure, which includes 10 transmembrane domains that form a channel for calcium ion transport (Bozgeyik2017ATP2B4). The protein also contains a large cytosolic loop that houses the nucleotide-binding domain and a catalytic core essential for ATP hydrolysis (Tempel2007The).

The C-terminal region of PMCA4 is crucial for its regulatory functions, including calmodulin binding, which is a key aspect of its activation mechanism. This region is typically 70-200 amino acids in length and is involved in interactions with calmodulin, a calcium-binding protein that activates PMCA4 upon binding (Bozgeyik2017ATP2B4). Alternative splicing of the ATP2B4 gene results in two main isoforms, PMCA4a and PMCA4b, with PMCA4b having a larger calmodulin-binding domain and lower basal activity in the absence of calmodulin (Hattangady2020Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of PMCA4 include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its regulatory and functional properties (Tempel2007The). These structural features and modifications are critical for the protein's role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis.

## Function
The ATP2B4 gene encodes the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4 (PMCA4), a critical enzyme for maintaining calcium homeostasis in human cells. PMCA4 functions by actively transporting Ca2+ ions out of the cell, utilizing ATP hydrolysis to regulate intracellular calcium levels. This process is essential for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, signal transduction, and maintaining cellular integrity (Brini2009Calcium; Padányi2016Multifaceted).

PMCA4 is predominantly active in the plasma membrane and is involved in several specialized roles. In red blood cells, PMCA4b, a variant of PMCA4, is the main calcium transporter, crucial for maintaining low cytoplasmic calcium concentrations necessary for calcium-dependent signal transduction events (Zámbó2017Decreased). In cardiac physiology, PMCA4 interacts with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) via its PDZ domain, inhibiting nNOS activity by decreasing local calcium concentration, which affects cardiac contractility and hypertrophy (Brini2009Calcium).

PMCA4 also plays a significant role in male fertility, particularly in sperm motility. It is localized to the principal piece of the sperm tail, where it is essential for hyperactivated motility, a necessary function for sperm to traverse the female genital tract (Okunade2004Targeted). These functions highlight the importance of PMCA4 in maintaining calcium homeostasis and its impact on various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATP2B4 gene, which encodes the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4 (PMCA4), have been linked to several clinical conditions. Genetic variations in ATP2B4 are associated with resistance to severe malaria. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-coding and regulatory regions of the gene are linked to decreased expression of the PMCA4b protein in red blood cells (RBCs), leading to slower calcium expulsion. This alteration creates an environment that reduces Plasmodium falciparum growth, thereby providing protection against severe malaria (Joof2023Genetic; Joof2022Genetic).

In familial spastic paraplegia (FSP), a novel missense mutation (c.803G>A, p.R268Q) in ATP2B4 has been identified. This mutation is associated with progressive spastic paraplegia and is thought to cause calcium dysregulation by delaying intracellular calcium extrusion, leading to higher cytosolic calcium levels. The mutation is located in a protein aggregation-prone segment, potentially causing protein misfolding and destabilizing the PMCA4 structure (Li2014PMCA4; Ho2015PMCA4).

ATP2B4 variants have also been investigated in the context of bilateral adrenal hyperaldosteronism (BHA), although a definitive pathogenic role has not been established. These variants may affect aldosterone synthase expression and adrenal cell physiology (Hattangady2020Molecular).

## Interactions
ATP2B4, also known as PMCA4, is involved in several interactions that influence its function in calcium homeostasis. It interacts with calmodulin, a protein that regulates its activity by binding to ATP2B4 in a calcium-dependent manner, enhancing its ability to extrude calcium from cells (Nisar2022Identification). ATP2B4 also associates with PDZ domain-containing proteins, which affect its localization and function within cellular signaling pathways (Nisar2022Identification).

In the context of erythroid cells, ATP2B4 expression is regulated by the transcription factor GATA1. GATA1 binds to specific sites in the ATP2B4 promoter, influencing its expression. Mutations in GATA1 can disrupt this interaction, leading to altered ATP2B4 expression and affecting calcium homeostasis in red blood cells (Zambo2024Identification). Additionally, in multiple myeloma, exosomal miR-4261 targets ATP2B4, downregulating its expression and contributing to calcium overload in red blood cells. This interaction is mediated through miR-4261 binding to the 3'-UTR of ATP2B4, inhibiting its expression post-transcriptionally (Bian2022Exosomal). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing ATP2B4 activity and its role in maintaining calcium balance.
