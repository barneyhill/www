# SLC52A1

## Overview
The SLC52A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 52 member 1, also known as riboflavin transporter 1 (RFVT1), which is a transmembrane protein responsible for the transport of riboflavin (vitamin B2) across cell membranes. This protein plays a critical role in the absorption and distribution of riboflavin, particularly in the placenta and intestine, facilitating its uptake into cells where it is converted into essential cofactors for various enzymatic reactions (Grünert2023Riboflavin; Kang2020Riboflavin). The SLC52A1 gene is vital for maintaining adequate riboflavin levels, which are necessary for energy production and metabolic processes. Mutations in this gene can lead to riboflavin transporter deficiency, a condition that can be ameliorated with riboflavin supplementation (Grünert2023Riboflavin). While SLC52A1 is not directly linked to Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, it is part of a family of riboflavin transporters that includes genes associated with this disorder (Nalini2013Madras; Johnson2012Exome).

## Function
The SLC52A1 gene encodes the riboflavin transporter 1 (RFVT1) protein, which is crucial for the absorption and transport of riboflavin (vitamin B2) in the human body. This protein is primarily expressed in the placenta and intestine, where it facilitates the active transport of riboflavin across cell membranes (Grünert2023Riboflavin; Kang2020Riboflavin). Riboflavin is a precursor for the synthesis of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are essential cofactors for various enzymes involved in oxidation-reduction reactions, including those in fatty acid oxidation and amino acid metabolism (Grünert2023Riboflavin; Kang2020Riboflavin).

In healthy cells, RFVT1 ensures adequate riboflavin levels in the bloodstream, supporting energy production and the metabolism of fats, drugs, and steroids (Grünert2023Riboflavin). The protein's role in the placenta is particularly important for the transport of maternal riboflavin to the fetus, highlighting its significance in fetal development (Grünert2023Riboflavin). Deficiencies in RFVT1 can lead to metabolic disorders, but riboflavin supplementation can correct related symptoms, underscoring the protein's vital function in maintaining metabolic health (Grünert2023Riboflavin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC52A1 gene, which encodes riboflavin transporter 1 (RFVT1), are associated with riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD), a rare metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by symptoms similar to multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), including poor sucking, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, dicarboxylic aciduria, and elevated plasma acylcarnitine levels, primarily affecting newborns and infants. These symptoms can be life-threatening, leading to encephalopathy and hyperammonemia, but are treatable with riboflavin supplementation (Grünert2023Riboflavin).

RFVT1 deficiency is linked to mutations in the SLC52A1 gene, which is primarily expressed in the placenta and intestine. The disorder can present with a MADD-like phenotype in newborns and infants, while adults with SLC52A1 variants are often asymptomatic (Grünert2023Riboflavin). The gene's role in placental riboflavin transport is crucial, and catabolism during pregnancy may exacerbate riboflavin deficiency (Grünert2023Riboflavin).

While SLC52A1 mutations have not been directly linked to Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, the gene is part of the riboflavin transporter family, which includes SLC52A2 and SLC52A3, known to be associated with this syndrome (Nalini2013Madras; Johnson2012Exome).
