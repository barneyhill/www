# SMARCD1

## Overview
SMARCD1 is a gene that encodes a protein known as SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily d, member 1, which is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure, thereby facilitating the binding of transcription factors. As a chromatin remodeler, SMARCD1 is involved in various cellular processes, including neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and cardiac development. It also plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and cellular senescence in hepatocytes. The protein interacts with several other proteins, including the androgen receptor and components of the SWI/SNF complex, and is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Inoue2017SMARCD1; Nixon2019A; Ross2024SMARCD1).

## Structure
The SMARCD1 protein is 515 amino acids long and contains several important structural domains, including a SWIB domain and three predicted coiled-coil domains (C1, C2, and C3) (Nixon2019A). The SWIB domain is organized by four short helices and serves as a helical extension of the ARM repeat, while the YEATS-like domain of SMARCD1 is associated with the SWIB domain and the coiled-coil regions (Wang2022Structure). The YEATS-like domain is organized into two parallel four-stranded β-sheets but lacks a conserved acetyl-lysine binding pocket, suggesting a role independent of nucleosome binding (Wang2022Structure).

The C-terminal α helix of SMARCD1 is surrounded by other structural elements like the preHSA of SMARCA4 and a SANT domain of SMARCC, indicating its involvement in complex structural interactions (Wang2022Structure). The C-terminal region downstream of the SWIB domain is implicated in binding ARID subunits and is necessary for forming fully assembled BAF and PBAF conformations of the SWI/SNF complex (Nixon2019A). SMARCD1 is also known to interact with the androgen receptor (AR) via an FxxFF motif, which is crucial for hormone-dependent interactions (van2009Functional).

## Function
The SMARCD1 gene encodes a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which is essential for regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure to facilitate transcription-factor binding. This complex plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including neuronal differentiation, brain-region specification, memory formation, synaptic plasticity, and activity-responsive neurite outgrowth (Nixon2019A). In neurons, SMARCD1 is involved in the formation and maintenance of synaptic connections necessary for learning and memory, as evidenced by its role in the Drosophila ortholog Bap60, which is crucial for long-term memory in flies (Nixon2019A).

In hepatocytes, SMARCD1 regulates cellular senescence and lipid metabolism. It modulates the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, thereby preventing lipid droplet accumulation and cellular senescence. Its expression is influenced by dietary conditions, such as high-fat diets, which can lead to its downregulation and subsequent lipid accumulation (Inoue2017SMARCD1).

In cardiac development, SMARCD1 is expressed in undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells and declines as cells differentiate into ventricular cardiomyocytes. It interacts with transcription factors to regulate gene expression critical for cardiac maturation and function (Chow2019Modulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMARCD1 gene are associated with a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and small hands and feet. These mutations are often de novo and include both nonsense and missense types, which are clustered near functional domains of the protein. Despite some clinical overlap with other syndromes caused by mutations in SWI/SNF components, such as Coffin-Siris syndrome, individuals with SMARCD1 mutations typically lack the facial dysmorphisms associated with these conditions (Nixon2019A).

In cancer, SMARCD1 plays a role as an oncogene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where its expression is significantly elevated in tumors with specific non-hotspot mutant forms of p53. High SMARCD1 levels in these tumors are linked to poor overall survival, suggesting its involvement in oncogenic processes (Adduri2019SMARCD1). In breast cancer, SMARCD1 acts as an essential expression-restricted metastasis modifier. Both high and low expression levels correlate with better clinical outcomes, while intermediate levels are associated with worse outcomes, indicating that precise regulation of SMARCD1 expression is crucial for metastasis (Ross2024SMARCD1).

## Interactions
SMARCD1, also known as BAF60a, is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and participates in various protein interactions. It interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) through an FxxFF motif, functioning as a promoter-selective AR cofactor essential for the expression of the TMPRSS2 gene. This interaction is hormone-dependent and crucial for AR-mediated transcription (van2009Functional). SMARCD1 is also involved in the SWI/SNF complex, interacting with other core subunits such as SMARCA4 and SMARCC1, although certain mutations in SMARCD1 do not disrupt these interactions (Nixon2019A).

In the context of cancer, SMARCD1 interacts with splicing machinery and is implicated in regulating splicing programs in metastatic breast cancer cells. It is associated with core BAF complex proteins and other factors like GBAF, nBAF, and npBAF, highlighting its role in chromatin remodeling and mRNA processing (Ross2024SMARCD1). In glioblastoma, SMARCD1 interacts with the P53 tumor suppressor protein, enhancing the expression of P53 downstream genes involved in apoptosis, and modulates the Notch1 pathway, suggesting a complex regulatory role in tumor suppression (Zhu2020Smarcd1).
