# DRG2

## Overview
DRG2, or developmentally regulated GTP binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the OBG family of GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by DRG2 is characterized by its GTPase activity and is highly conserved across species, sharing structural similarities with DRG1. DRG2 plays a crucial role in cellular functions such as microtubule stabilization, endosomal recycling, and mitochondrial dynamics. It interacts with proteins like Tau and DFRP2, which are essential for its stability and function. DRG2 is also implicated in the regulation of endothelial cell function and has significant clinical relevance in cancer, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and response to therapies (Westrip2021Developmentally; Choi2024DRG2).

## Structure
DRG2 is a member of the OBG family of GTPases, characterized by a GTPase domain and additional domains that contribute to its larger size compared to typical Ras superfamily GTPases (Westrip2021Developmentally). The protein is highly conserved with DRG1, suggesting a similar structure, although a specific structure for DRG2 has not been reported (Westrip2021Developmentally). The yeast homologue of DRG1, Rbg1, includes a GTPase domain with three additional domains: a helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain, an S5D2L domain, and a TGS domain, which are likely present in DRG2 as well (Westrip2021Developmentally).

The HTH domain in DRG2 is involved in protein interactions and undergoes hydroxylation at a conserved lysine, a post-translational modification important for its function (Westrip2021Developmentally). The S5D2L domain is structurally similar to RNA/DNA binding proteins, while the TGS domain is involved in interactions with other proteins (Westrip2021Developmentally). DRG2 interacts with its binding partner DFRP2, which stabilizes the protein and prevents its degradation (Westrip2021Developmentally). The interaction involves the TGS and GTPase domains of DRG2, with DFRP2 wrapping around DRG2 in an extended conformation (Westrip2021Developmentally).

## Function
The DRG2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the developmentally regulated GTP-binding proteins (DRGs) subfamily, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes. DRG2 is involved in the regulation of microtubules, endosomes, and membrane tubules in human cells. It promotes microtubule polymerization by interacting with Tau, a protein that stabilizes microtubules, and affects the Akt-GSK3β-Tau pathway, leading to increased microtubule stabilization (Westrip2021Developmentally). DRG2 also plays a crucial role in endosomal recycling, where it co-localizes with endosomes and interacts with early endosomal proteins like Rab5. Its knockdown causes defects in endosomal recycling, indicated by the retention of transferrin (Westrip2021Developmentally).

In endothelial cells, DRG2 is essential for maintaining normal function and preventing senescence. It regulates the production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and its deficiency leads to increased ROS production, DNA damage, and cellular senescence, impairing endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenic functions (Le2022DRG2). DRG2 is also involved in mitochondrial dynamics, where its depletion leads to mitochondrial swelling, loss of membrane potential, and decreased ATP production (Westrip2021Developmentally).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DRG2 gene have significant implications in cancer. In HeLa cells, DRG2 depletion leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by swelling, loss of membrane potential, and decreased ATP production. This is associated with the downregulation of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, resulting in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, causing a G2/M cell cycle block (Westrip2021Developmentally). In melanoma, DRG2 is crucial for the surface localization of PD-L1, which is essential for the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. DRG2 depletion results in impaired PD-L1 recycling, reducing its surface presence and leading to resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy (Choi2024DRG2).

In lung cancer, miR-1915-3p targets DRG2, preventing apoptosis by downregulating its expression. Overexpression of DRG2 induces apoptosis, suggesting that its regulation is critical for cell survival in lung cancer (XU2015MicroRNA19153p). High DRG2 expression correlates with increased metastatic potential and reduced survival in non-small cell lung cancers and melanomas, indicating its role in tumor progression and metastasis (Westrip2021Developmentally). These findings highlight DRG2 as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment, with strategies focusing on disrupting its interactions or using GTPase inhibitors (Westrip2021Developmentally).

## Interactions
DRG2 interacts with DFRP2, forming a specific complex that is crucial for its stability and function. This interaction prevents DRG2 degradation by blocking ubiquitination, likely through a Skp1-Cullin1 containing ubiquitin ligase. The DFRP domain of DFRP2 wraps around DRG2, making contacts with its TGS and GTPase domains (Westrip2021Developmentally). Structural modeling suggests that DRG2 interacts with DFRP2 through specific helices and loops, although DFRP2 lacks some additional contacts seen in DRG1/DFRP1 interactions (Westrip2023Rewiring). Mutations at aspartate residues 257 and 277 in DRG2 affect its binding to DFRP2, highlighting the importance of these residues for the interaction (Westrip2023Rewiring).

DRG2 is also associated with ribosomes, particularly in its 30-kDa form, which is enriched in polysome fractions, indicating a strong interaction with the translation machinery. The 45- and 43-kDa forms are found in both cytosolic and ribosome-containing fractions (Nelson2009Association). DRG2 can bind to GTP, and its association with ribosomes is partially inhibited by GTP analogs, suggesting a regulatory role of GTP in its ribosomal interactions (Nelson2009Association).
