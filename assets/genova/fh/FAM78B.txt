# FAM78B

## Overview
FAM78B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 78 member B. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are not fully elucidated. FAM78B is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein, and it is implicated in cellular signaling pathways, potentially influencing cell growth and differentiation. The gene is expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting a broad role in human physiology. Research into FAM78B has highlighted its potential involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant for cellular homeostasis and development (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further studies are required to fully understand the functional dynamics and clinical implications of FAM78B.
