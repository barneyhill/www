# FGF16

## Overview
FGF16 is a gene that encodes the protein fibroblast growth factor 16, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which is involved in a variety of biological processes, particularly in cardiac development and function. The FGF16 protein functions as a growth factor and is primarily expressed in the heart, where it plays a critical role in the proliferation and survival of cardiomyocytes during embryonic development. It acts in a paracrine manner, primarily interacting with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1c (FGFR1c) and utilizing heparan sulfate as a co-factor. This interaction is essential for regulating cardiomyocyte growth and preventing cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. FGF16 is also implicated in cardiac regeneration and repair, making it a potential therapeutic target for heart-related conditions. Additionally, mutations in the FGF16 gene are associated with X-linked recessive metacarpal 4-5 fusion, highlighting its significance in both skeletal and cardiac development (Itoh2016Roles; Jamsheer2014Further; Hotta2008Fgf16).

## Function
FGF16 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which plays a crucial role in various biological processes, particularly in cardiac development and function. In healthy human cells, FGF16 is predominantly expressed in the heart, especially in cardiomyocytes, where it acts as a growth factor essential for the proliferation of these cells during embryonic development (Itoh2016Rolesa; Hotta2008Fgf16). FGF16 primarily activates FGFR1c with heparan sulfate as a co-factor, functioning in a paracrine manner to regulate cardiomyocyte growth and prevent cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by inhibiting FGF2-induced TGF-β1 expression (Itoh2016Rolesa).

FGF16 is also involved in cardiac regeneration and repair, as it induces the proliferation of cardiac progenitor cells and stimulates cell-cycle activity in human cardiomyocytes, making it a potential therapeutic target for cardiac repair (Jennbacken2019Phenotypic). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, influencing signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival. Its expression is induced by angiotensin II and promoted by FGF2 in cultured cardiomyocytes, highlighting its role in cardiac-specific gene regulation (Itoh2016Rolesa).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FGF16 gene are associated with X-linked recessive metacarpal 4-5 fusion (MF4), a rare congenital malformation characterized by the fusion of the fourth and fifth metacarpals. This condition can present with additional symptoms such as joint laxity and hypermobility, suggesting a potential influence on connective tissue properties. Specific mutations, such as the frameshift mutation p.E158DfsX25 and nonsense mutations p.R179X and p.S157X, result in truncated FGF16 proteins that lack essential receptor and heparan sulphate binding sites, impairing proper limb development (Jamsheer2014Further).

Despite severe heart developmental defects observed in Fgf16 null mice, human cases with FGF16 mutations do not typically show congenital heart anomalies. This discrepancy suggests the possibility of residual activity of the truncated protein or compensatory mechanisms by other FGFs in humans (Jamsheer2014Further). Additionally, FGF16 mutations have been linked to X-linked recessive hand malformations and associated cardiac disorders, including myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation, indicating its importance in both skeletal and cardiac development (Itoh2016Roles).

## Interactions
FGF16 primarily interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR1c, in a paracrine manner with heparan sulfate as a co-factor. This interaction is crucial for its role in heart development and repair (Itoh2016Roles). FGF16 competes with FGF2 for binding to FGFR1c, thereby inhibiting FGF2's activity and its induced expression of TGF-β1, which is associated with cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (Itoh2016Roles; Yu2016GATA4).

FGF16 is also regulated by the transcription factor GATA4, which directly enhances its expression by binding to conserved GATA-binding motifs in the FGF16 gene. This regulation is essential for cardiomyocyte replication and heart repair after injury (Yu2016GATA4). The interaction between GATA4 and FGF16 is facilitated by the co-activator p300, which binds to the promoter and intronic regions of the FGF16 gene (Yu2016GATA4).

Additionally, FGF16 is subject to post-transcriptional regulation through Mettl3-mediated m6A modification, which affects its mRNA stability and expression levels. This modification is part of a mechanism that restricts cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration (Jiang2022Mettl3mediated).
