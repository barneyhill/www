# DPP8

## Overview
DPP8 is a gene that encodes the protein dipeptidyl peptidase 8, a serine protease enzyme involved in a variety of cellular and molecular processes. The DPP8 protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm and is characterized by its ability to cleave N-terminal dipeptides from polypeptides, particularly when proline is at the penultimate position. This enzymatic activity implicates DPP8 in immune regulation, where it influences the activation and proliferation of immune cells, such as lymphocytes and macrophages. Additionally, DPP8 plays a role in cellular energy metabolism, affecting lipid and glucose metabolism, and is involved in energy catabolism pathways. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as integrin-β1 and talin, suggest its involvement in cell adhesion and migration, with potential implications in cancer metastasis. DPP8's activity is modulated by interactions with SUMO1, and it is sensitive to the redox state of cysteines. The gene's evolutionary history is suggested by its unique exon structure, indicating it may be more ancient compared to related genes like DPP4 and FAP (Zhang2013Advances; Cui2022New).

## Structure
The human DPP8 protein consists of 882 amino acids and shares 27% identity and 51% similarity with human DPPIV, as well as 61% identity and 79% similarity with DPP9 (Zhang2013Advances). The tertiary structure of DPP8 is likely similar to DPPIV and FAP, featuring a dimeric form with each monomer comprising an α/β-hydrolase domain and an 8-blade β-propeller domain. The active site is located at the interface of these domains (Zhang2013Advances). DPP8 has a larger substrate pocket (S2) than DPPIV, which suggests possible additional tertiary structure elements at the N-terminus or a larger β-propeller domain (Zhang2013Advances).

DPP8 lacks a transmembrane domain and is translated as an intracellular protein (Zhang2013Advances). It does not have any N-linked or O-linked glycosylation sites, and its activity is regulated by interactions with SUMO1, which enhances its activity. The enzyme is sensitive to the redox state of cysteines, with activity decreasing upon oxidation and increasing upon reduction (Zhang2013Advances). The sequence around the active-site serine is encoded by a single exon, unlike DPP4 and FAP, where it is encoded by two exons, suggesting that DPP8 is a more ancient gene (Zhang2013Advances).

## Function
Dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8) is a serine protease enzyme that plays a significant role in various molecular and cellular processes. It is primarily located in the cytoplasm and is involved in cleaving N-terminal dipeptides from polypeptides, particularly when proline is at the penultimate position (Zhang2013Advances; Cui2022New). DPP8 is implicated in immune regulation, influencing the activation and proliferation of immune cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages (Zhang2013Advances; Cui2022New). It interacts with substrates like inflammatory protein-10 (IP10), interfering T-cell chemokines (ITAC), and stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1), suggesting a role in modulating immune responses and inflammatory processes (Cui2022New).

In terms of cellular energy metabolism, DPP8 affects lipid and glucose metabolism and is involved in energy catabolism pathways through the activation of AMPK (Cui2022New). It also interacts with adenylate kinase 2 (AK2), a protein essential for cellular energy homeostasis (Cui2022New). DPP8 influences cell behavior, including cell adhesion and migration, and is associated with tumor cell adhesion and migration, indicating a potential role in cancer metastasis (Cui2022New).

## Clinical Significance
DPP8 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or function. In cancer, DPP8 is involved in tumorigenesis by affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration. It is expressed in several tumor types, including brain tumors, hematological malignancies like acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and gynecologic cancers such as breast and ovarian cancer (Zhang2013Advances; Cui2022New). In cervical cancer, silencing DPP8 leads to increased apoptosis and reduced cell migration, indicating its role in tumor progression (Cui2022New).

DPP8 is also associated with inflammatory and immune-related conditions. Its expression and activity are upregulated in chronic inflammatory responses, as seen in models of arthritis and asthma (Cui2022New). Inhibition of DPP8/9 can reduce inflammatory factor secretion, highlighting their role in chronic inflammation (Cui2022New). In liver diseases, DPP8 expression is increased in early hepatic fibrosis but downregulated in chronic liver injuries, suggesting a complex role in liver pathology (Cui2022New).

Additionally, DPP8/9 inhibitors have been shown to induce pyroptosis by activating inflammasomes, which is relevant in conditions like AML and autoinflammatory diseases (Cui2022New). These findings suggest that DPP8 could be a therapeutic target for various diseases, but further research is needed to understand its regulation and potential side effects.

## Interactions
Dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8) is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. DPP8 interacts with integrin-β1 and talin, which are crucial for cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is linked to the phosphorylation of adhesion-focal kinase and paxillin, suggesting a role in tumor metastasis (Cui2022New). DPP8 also interacts with nucleobindin-1 (NUCB1) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), which are involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, indicating its role in cell migration and invasion (Cui2022New).

DPP8 is associated with the activation of inflammasomes through its interaction with proteins such as NLRP1 and CARD8. These interactions suggest a role in immune regulation and the induction of immune cell pyroptosis (Cui2022New). DPP8/9 inhibitors can disrupt these interactions, leading to pyroptosis by activating caspase-1 through the inflammasome pathway (Cui2022New).

The activity of DPP8 is regulated by interactions with SUMO1, a small ubiquitin-like modifier, which enhances its enzymatic activity. This interaction is mediated by a novel SUMO1-binding arm in the propeller domain of DPP9 (Zhang2013Advances).
