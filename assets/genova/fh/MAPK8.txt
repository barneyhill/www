# MAPK8

## Overview
MAPK8, also known as the gene encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (JNK1), is a critical component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways. The MAPK8 gene is responsible for encoding the JNK1 protein, a kinase that is integral to the regulation of various cellular processes, including stress responses, apoptosis, and inflammation. As a kinase, JNK1 facilitates the transfer of phosphate groups to specific substrates, thereby modulating their activity and function. This protein is involved in the phosphorylation of key regulatory proteins, influencing processes such as autophagy, neuronal function, and cellular adaptation to environmental stress. The MAPK8 gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest in both physiological and pathological contexts, with implications in diseases such as cancer and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (Li2019Chronic; Wei2008JNK1Mediated; Xu2011JNK).

## Structure
MAPK8, also known as JNK1, is a protein kinase involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in stress responses, apoptosis, and inflammation. The primary structure of MAPK8 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of MAPK8 results in a three-dimensional shape essential for its kinase activity, allowing it to interact with other proteins and substrates effectively. 

MAPK8 contains a kinase domain, which is critical for its enzymatic activity, facilitating the transfer of phosphate groups to target proteins. This domain is highly conserved among MAP kinases, indicating its importance in the protein's function. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in MAPK8 and regulate its activity and interactions with other cellular components. 

The protein may also form dimers, representing its quaternary structure, which can influence its functional properties. Splice variants of MAPK8 can lead to different isoforms, each potentially having distinct roles in cellular processes (Zhang2023MAPK8; Uppugunduri2020In).

## Function
MAPK8, also known as JNK1, is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, MAPK8 is involved in the regulation of autophagy, particularly under conditions of cellular stress such as starvation. It mediates the phosphorylation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, leading to its dissociation from Beclin 1, which is a critical step in the induction of autophagy (Wei2008JNK1Mediated). This phosphorylation occurs at specific residues on Bcl-2, namely T69, S70, and S87, and is essential for promoting autophagy by disrupting the Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complex (Wei2008JNK1Mediated).

MAPK8 is also involved in the regulation of neuronal function, influencing microtubule stability, neurite formation, and synaptic plasticity. It phosphorylates microtubule-associated proteins, which is crucial for maintaining neuronal architecture and function (Xu2011JNK). Additionally, MAPK8 plays a role in stress-induced apoptosis and neuronal injury responses, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Xu2011JNK). These activities underscore MAPK8's role in cellular adaptation to environmental stress and its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAPK8 gene, which encodes the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), have been linked to several clinical conditions. A specific splice-site variant, c.311+1G>A, has been identified in a family with an autosomal dominant combination of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) and a novel connective tissue disorder (CTD) that overlaps with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). This mutation results in a loss-of-function and loss-of-expression of JNK1, leading to impaired responses to IL-17A and IL-17F, and compromised development of T H 17 cells. These impairments are crucial for mucocutaneous immunity to Candida and connective tissue homeostasis, suggesting that the mutation contributes to both CMC and CTD (Li2019Chronic).

In cancer, MAPK8 has been associated with gastric cancer risk, particularly in the context of the Fas signaling pathway. Genetic variations in MAPK8 have been linked to an increased risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma and gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma, indicating its role in apoptosis regulation and tumorigenesis (Hyland2013Genetic). Additionally, MAPK8 expression is upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma, where it is involved in cancer progression through interactions with miR-433-3p and circMED13L_012 (Chen2021CircMED13L012).

## Interactions
MAPK8, also known as JNK1, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular signaling pathways. It is a key component of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is activated in response to stress and external stimuli. MAPK8 interacts with proteins such as c-Jun, ATF2, and Elk-1, which are involved in transcriptional regulation (Xu2018MAPK8). 

In glioblastoma cells, MAPK8 has been identified as a hub gene in the protein-protein interaction network, indicating its central role in mediating resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) through the MAPK signaling pathway. Inhibition of MAPK8 reduces TMZ resistance, highlighting its interaction with other proteins in this pathway (Xu2018MAPK8).

MAPK8 also forms strong interactions with glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoforms, particularly GST-M1. This interaction has been confirmed through in silico and in vitro studies, demonstrating significant binding affinity and structural stability. The GST-M1-MAPK8 complex is stable, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations and mass spectrometry analysis (Uppugunduri2020In). These interactions suggest that MAPK8 plays a significant role in modulating cellular responses, including apoptosis and stress responses.
