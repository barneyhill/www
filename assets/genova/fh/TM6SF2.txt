# TM6SF2

## Overview
The TM6SF2 gene encodes the transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 protein, which is a critical component in lipid metabolism, particularly within hepatic cells. This protein is characterized by its multiple transmembrane helices and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. TM6SF2 plays a pivotal role in the lipidation of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), influencing the transport of triglycerides and cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues (SanchezPulido2014TM6SF2; Smagris2016Inactivation). Genetic variants of TM6SF2, such as E167K, have been associated with altered lipid profiles and are linked to conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cardiovascular diseases, underscoring the gene's significance in both hepatic and systemic lipid homeostasis (Day2015The; Dongiovanni2015Transmembrane).

## Structure
The TM6SF2 protein is characterized by its structure, which includes 10 predicted transmembrane helices. These helices contribute to its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment in liver cells (SanchezPulido2014TM6SF2; Smagris2016Inactivation). The protein contains tandem repeats of transmembrane regions, specifically between amino acids 217-351 and 61-186 in humans, indicating a complex arrangement of these helices (SanchezPulido2014TM6SF2).

A notable feature of TM6SF2 is the presence of the EXPERA domain, which is conserved among TM6SF, MAC30/TMEM97, and EBP protein families. This domain is characterized by a common transmembrane helix configuration and a predicted C-terminal ER retention signal, suggesting a potential shared catalytic function with sterol isomerase activity (SanchezPulido2014TM6SF2). The EXPERA domain is present twice in TM6SF proteins, indicating its significance in the protein's function (SanchezPulido2014TM6SF2).

The TM6SF2 protein is also associated with specific genetic variants, such as the E167K and L156P mutations, which are linked to changes in protein stability and function, potentially affecting its role in lipid metabolism (Ehrhardt2017Hepatic). However, detailed information on the tertiary and quaternary structures of TM6SF2 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The TM6SF2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the liver. It is involved in the lipidation process of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are crucial for transporting triglycerides and cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues. TM6SF2 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, where it facilitates the addition of neutral lipids to nascent ApoB-containing lipoproteins, a critical step in VLDL assembly (Smagris2016Inactivation; SanchezPulido2014TM6SF2).

Despite its role in lipidation, TM6SF2 is not essential for the secretion of these lipoproteins, as its inactivation does not affect the secretion of ApoB-containing lipoproteins but leads to smaller VLDL particles with reduced triglyceride content (Smagris2016Inactivation). The protein's function in lipid metabolism is further highlighted by its involvement in hepatic triglyceride metabolism, where its absence results in hepatic steatosis and increased liver triglyceride accumulation (Smagris2016Inactivation; Day2015The).

TM6SF2 also influences plasma lipid levels, with variants like E167K associated with lower circulating lipid levels and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, while increasing susceptibility to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (SanchezPulido2014TM6SF2; Day2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TM6SF2 gene, particularly the E167K variant, are significantly associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression to more severe conditions such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis. This variant leads to increased hepatic triglyceride content and is linked to advanced hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, independent of factors like BMI, age, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (Zhang2018The; Liu2014TM6SF2). The E167K variant is also associated with increased serum ALT and AST levels, markers of liver injury and NASH (Zhang2018The).

In addition to liver disease, the TM6SF2 E167K variant affects cardiovascular health. It reduces the secretion of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), leading to lower circulating lipids and a reduced risk of myocardial infarction, despite increasing susceptibility to progressive NASH (Dongiovanni2015Transmembrane). The variant is also implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in individuals with chronic liver disease, with the T allele being more prevalent in HCC patients (Raia2022The). These findings highlight the dual role of TM6SF2 in influencing both liver and cardiovascular outcomes.

## Interactions
TM6SF2 is known to interact with several proteins involved in lipid metabolism. It forms a complex with apolipoprotein B (APOB) and ER lipid raft proteins ERLIN1 and ERLIN2. This complex is crucial for regulating lipid droplet metabolism and stabilizing APOB, which is essential for lipoprotein secretion (Li2020Disruption). The interactions between TM6SF2, ERLIN1, and ERLIN2 help stabilize TM6SF2 itself, and the disruption of this complex can lead to APOB destabilization, contributing to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Li2020Disruption).

TM6SF2 interacts with APOB48, forming a protein complex that is significant for lipid metabolism. Specific domains of TM6SF2, particularly two luminal loops, are critical for its interaction with APOB48 (Li2020Disruption). The TM6SF2 E167K mutation, associated with decreased protein expression, attenuates the stabilizing effects on APOB48, highlighting the importance of these interactions in maintaining lipid homeostasis (Li2020Disruption).

TM6SF2 is also involved in the ER-to-Golgi transport of pre-VLDL particles, affecting the trafficking of ApoB-lipoproteins. This interaction may involve a critical component of the protein complex responsible for VTV assembly and release (Ehrhardt2017Hepatic).
