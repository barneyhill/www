# LYPLA1

## Overview
LYPLA1, or lysophospholipase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, primarily functioning as a depalmitoylase. This enzyme, also known as acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1), plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by facilitating the depalmitoylation of proteins, a reversible post-translational modification that influences protein localization, stability, and signaling pathways (Qu2020Androgen‐dependent; Won2016Molecular). Additionally, LYPLA1 exhibits lysophospholipase activity, contributing to the regulation of lysophospholipid levels, which are vital for cellular processes such as proliferation and signaling (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). The protein's structural features, including a catalytic triad and flexible loops forming a hydrophobic channel, enable its function in lipid binding and metabolism (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases; Liu2016FullLength). LYPLA1's involvement in various cellular interactions and pathways underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease contexts, such as cancer and inflammation (Mohammed2018Inhibition; Liu2016FullLength).

## Structure
LYPLA1, also known as acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1), is a member of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily and functions primarily as a depalmitoylase, although it was initially identified as a lysophospholipase (Won2016Molecular). The protein lacks the traditional cap domain found in other α/β-hydrolase family members, instead featuring flexible loops that form a lid over the active site serine, creating a potential hydrophobic channel for lipid binding (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). The catalytic triad of LYPLA1 consists of Ser 119, Asp 174, and His 208, which is a common feature in serine proteases, esterases, and lipases (Liu2016FullLength).

LYPLA1 is active as a monomer but can form weak dimers in some structures (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). The protein is involved in the depalmitoylation process, a post-translational modification crucial for protein function, particularly in the regulation of protein palmitoylation levels (Qu2020Androgen‐dependent). The enzyme's activity is regulated by microRNAs, such as miR-125a-5p, which target LYPLA1 and influence its expression and function (Qu2020Androgen‐dependent). The structural features of LYPLA1 contribute to its role in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
LYPLA1, also known as acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1), plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells. It is involved in the depalmitoylation process, a reversible post-translational modification that removes palmitic acid from proteins. This modification is crucial for regulating protein function, including their subcellular localization, stability, and signaling transduction (Qu2020Androgen‐dependent; Mohammed2018Inhibition). 

LYPLA1 also functions as a lysophospholipase, hydrolyzing lysophospholipids to maintain lipid homeostasis and lysophospholipid signaling. This activity is essential for regulating lysophospholipid levels, which are important for various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, metabolic activity, and signaling pathways like the MAPK pathway (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). 

In addition, LYPLA1 is involved in the metabolism of lysophospholipids, which act as bioactive second messengers modulating gene expression and are involved in processes such as growth stimulation and immune activation (Liu2016FullLength). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and membrane dynamics, contributing to the overall health and stability of human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LYPLA1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LYPLA1 is significantly overexpressed, particularly in SPC-A-1 cell lines. Suppression of LYPLA1 using small-interfering RNA has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells, suggesting its role as a tumor promoter. This indicates that LYPLA1 may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in lung cancer (Mohammed2018Inhibition).

In the context of late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) in males, the LYPLA1 gene is targeted by miR-125a-5p, which is regulated by testosterone. This interaction affects global protein palmitoylation levels, a process crucial for protein function. Testosterone deficiency in LOH patients correlates with decreased global protein palmitoylation, implicating the testosterone/miR-125a-5p/LYPLA1 pathway in the condition's molecular mechanisms (Qu2020Androgen‐dependent).

Additionally, LYPLA1 has been associated with immune responses and inflammation. In macrophages, decreased LYPLA1 expression contributes to responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli, suggesting that inhibiting LYPLA1 activity could be a potential treatment strategy for inflammation (Liu2016FullLength).

## Interactions
LYPLA1, also known as lysophospholipase 1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. It is part of the α/β hydrolase superfamily and is known for its depalmitoylation activity, which is crucial for regulating protein activity through reversible lipid modification (Mohammed2018Inhibition). LYPLA1 interacts with proteins such as CD95, which plays a role in apoptosis regulation (Mohammed2018Inhibition). 

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, LYPLA1 has been identified as an interacting protein with ubiquitin-like 3 (UBL3) in the mouse brain. This interaction suggests a potential role in the regulation of proteins through novel post-translational modifications, possibly impacting neurodegenerative disease mechanisms (Ageta2024Comprehensive). 

LYPLA1 is also involved in the hydrolysis of lysophospholipids, which are important for cellular signaling and membrane structure. It cooperates with LYPLA2 to maintain lipid homeostasis and lysophospholipid signaling, with both enzymes contributing to the hydrolysis of lysophospholipids (Wepy2019Lysophospholipases). These interactions and activities highlight LYPLA1's role in lipid metabolism and its potential impact on various cellular functions.
