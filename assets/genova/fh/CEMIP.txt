# CEMIP

## Overview
CEMIP, or cell migration-inducing hyaluronidase 1, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein involved in the degradation of hyaluronic acid, a major component of the extracellular matrix. The protein, also known as KIAA1199 or HYBID, is characterized by its ability to influence cell proliferation, migration, and tissue remodeling, making it significant in both physiological and pathological contexts. CEMIP is not a transmembrane protein but functions in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, where it plays a crucial role in processes such as osteogenic development and endothelial cell growth. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as heat shock proteins and tumor suppressors, further underscore its involvement in complex cellular pathways, including those related to cancer progression and metastasis (Xu2023CEMIP; Liu2023Research).

## Structure
CEMIP, also known as KIAA1199 or HYBID, is a protein encoded by the CEMIP gene in humans. It has a molecular weight of 153 kDa and consists of 1361 amino acids. The protein includes a 30 amino acid N-terminal signal peptide that is crucial for its translocation and proper function (Li2017Central; Yoshida2019Role). CEMIP contains several distinct domains: one G8 domain, two GG domains, and four PbH1 domains. The G8 domain, characterized by eight conserved glycine residues, is involved in extracellular ligand binding, while the PbH1 domains are associated with polysaccharide hydrolysis (Yoshida2019Role; de2020Expression).

CEMIP is a secreted protein and not a transmembrane protein. It undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at seven predicted sites, which may influence its function and stability (Yoshida2019Role; de2020Expression). The protein's structure and activity are influenced by its cellular environment, as specific conformations are required for its hyaluronan-degrading activity (de2020Expression). CEMIP has multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and localization, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
CEMIP (cell migration-inducing hyaluronidase 1) is a protein involved in the degradation of hyaluronic acid (HA), a key component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In healthy human cells, CEMIP plays a significant role in the metabolism of HA by converting high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid (HMW-HA) into low-molecular-weight hyaluronan (LMW-HA). This process is crucial for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of tissues, particularly in osteogenic development, where it supports endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis in cartilage regions (Liu2023Research).

CEMIP is active in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, where it influences cell proliferation, migration, and tissue remodeling. It is expressed in various human organs, including the skin and cartilage, and is found in the serum. At the subcellular level, CEMIP accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and interacts with heat shock protein A5 (HSPA5) (Liu2023Research).

Although the exact molecular mechanism of CEMIP in HA degradation is not fully understood, it is clear that living cells are essential for its function, as CEMIP does not exhibit HA enzyme activity in vitro without cellular processes (Liu2023Research).

## Clinical Significance
CEMIP (cell migration inducing hyaluronidase 1) is implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, CEMIP is significantly upregulated and associated with tumor progression and metastasis. It is notably overexpressed in colorectal cancer, where it enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling, contributing to tumor growth and resistance to therapies (Domanegg2022CEMIP). In breast cancer, high CEMIP expression correlates with poor prognosis and increased risk of metastasis (Dong2021High). Similarly, in gastric cancer, CEMIP upregulation is linked to poorer survival outcomes and increased cell proliferation (Song2021MiR148a3p).

CEMIP also plays a role in non-cancerous conditions. In osteoarthritis, increased CEMIP activity leads to the degradation of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid, exacerbating joint dysfunction (Liu2023Research). In rheumatoid arthritis, high CEMIP levels are associated with synovial proliferation and angiogenesis (Liu2023Research). Additionally, CEMIP is involved in skin aging and infections, where its expression affects hyaluronic acid levels and bacterial invasion (Liu2023Research). These findings highlight CEMIP's potential as a therapeutic target across various diseases.

## Interactions
CEMIP, also known as KIAA1199, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cancer progression and metastasis. It interacts with GRAF1, a tumor suppressor, through its 295-819 amino acid domain, binding to the SH3 domain of GRAF1. This interaction negatively regulates GRAF1's stability by promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which is crucial for activating the CDC42/MAPK pathway, a key regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis (Xu2023CEMIP).

CEMIP also acts as a scaffold protein, bridging GRAF1 with MIB1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, through its 820-1204 amino acid domain. This interaction facilitates the degradation of GRAF1, further promoting the CDC42/MAPK pathway and CRC metastasis (Xu2023CEMIP).

In the endoplasmic reticulum, CEMIP forms a stable complex with the chaperone protein BiP, which is necessary for CEMIP-mediated cell migration. This interaction results in calcium leakage from the ER into the cytoplasm, activating protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), which is involved in cell migration (Evensen2013Unraveling; Domanegg2022CEMIP).

CEMIP also interacts with MHC-I and clathrin, facilitating MHC-I internalization and degradation, which impairs antigen presentation and promotes immune evasion in CRC (Zhang2023Tumor).
