# ANKRD63

## Overview
ANKRD63 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 63 protein, which is part of the ankyrin repeat protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to mediate protein-protein interactions, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal organization (van2020Epigenomewide). The ANKRD63 protein has been identified in several brain regions, including the Putamen, Lenticular Nucleus, and Caudate Nucleus, suggesting its involvement in brain development and function (Srivast2020A). While the precise biological functions of ANKRD63 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, its association with mental health disorders and involvement in cell body formation highlight its potential significance in neurological and cellular structural processes (van2020Epigenomewide; Bobryshev2016Macrophages).

## Structure


## Function
ANKRD63 is a protein-coding gene that is part of the ankyrin repeat proteins, which are involved in various physiological processes through mediating specific protein-protein interactions (van2020Epigenomewide). These interactions suggest a role in cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal organization. ANKRD63 has been identified in specific brain regions, including the Putamen, Lenticular Nucleus, and Caudate Nucleus, indicating its potential involvement in brain development and function (Srivast2020A). 

The gene is expressed in the Nucleus Accumbens, Putamen, and Caudate, but its exact function in healthy human cells remains unclear (van2020Epigenomewide). ANKRD63 has been associated with mental health disorders, suggesting a possible role in neurological processes (van2020Epigenomewide). Additionally, ANKRD63 is involved in cell body formation, indicating a role in cellular structural processes (Bobryshev2016Macrophages). Despite these associations, the specific molecular activities and organismal outcomes of ANKRD63 in healthy human cells require further research to be fully understood.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the ANKRD63 gene is still under investigation, with current research suggesting its potential involvement in neurological disorders. In a study by Sanfeliu et al., ANKRD63 was identified as a differentially expressed gene in both the brain and blood of Mecp2 mutant mice, which are used as a model for Rett syndrome (RTT). The dysregulation of ANKRD63, along with other genes, was confirmed through qPCR, indicating its possible role in the mechanisms associated with RTT (Sanfeliu2019Transcriptomic). Although the specific clinical implications of ANKRD63 mutations or expression changes in RTT are not fully detailed, the study provides a foundation for further exploration of its role in this and potentially other neurological conditions.

Another study by Vogel et al. found that ANKRD63 was among the genes overlapping with partially methylated domains (PMDs) in the hypothalami of rat pups subjected to augmented maternal care. This suggests that epigenomic modifications involving ANKRD63 could influence gene expression profiles related to resilience, with possible implications for developing diagnostic biomarkers and therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders (Vogel2018Experiencedependent). However, the precise functions and clinical significance of ANKRD63 remain to be fully elucidated.
