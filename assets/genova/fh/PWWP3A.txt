# PWWP3A

## Overview
PWWP3A is a gene that encodes the protein PWWP domain containing 3A, a DNA repair factor that plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability. The protein is characterized by the presence of a PWWP domain, which facilitates its interaction with methylated histones, implicating it in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation. As a DNA repair factor, PWWP domain containing 3A is involved in the DNA damage response pathways, contributing to the repair of damaged DNA and ensuring proper cell cycle progression. This function is crucial for preventing apoptosis and maintaining genomic integrity, thereby supporting normal cellular function and stability (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
PWWP3A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in DNA repair processes, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. The protein contains a PWWP domain, which is known for its ability to bind to methylated histones. This binding suggests that PWWP3A is involved in chromatin organization and the regulation of gene expression. By participating in DNA damage response pathways, PWWP3A contributes to the repair of damaged DNA, which is essential for the proper progression of the cell cycle and the prevention of apoptosis. The activity of PWWP3A in these processes helps ensure that cells can effectively respond to and repair DNA damage, thereby maintaining the integrity of the genome and supporting normal cellular function. The precise localization of the PWWP3A protein within the cell, particularly in relation to chromatin, underscores its role in these critical molecular and cellular processes.
