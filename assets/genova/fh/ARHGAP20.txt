# ARHGAP20

## Overview
ARHGAP20 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase activating protein 20, a critical regulator of Rho family GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. The protein is categorized as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) and is characterized by the presence of several functional domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a Ras association (RA) domain, and a RhoGAP domain. These domains facilitate its role in modulating the activity of Rho GTPases, particularly RhoA, by enhancing GTPase activity and influencing cellular dynamics (Ruan2008A; Kalla2004Translocation). ARHGAP20 is predominantly expressed in the brain, indicating its potential involvement in neurogenesis and neuronal activity (Kalla2004Translocation). The gene's expression and regulation have been linked to various pathological conditions, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Herold2011Expression; Rohrbeck2009Cancer).

## Structure
The ARHGAP20 protein is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in regulating Rho-family GTPases. It contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a Ras association (RA) domain, and a RhoGAP domain. The PH domain is located in the amino-terminal region and spans amino acids 50-151 in transcript variants 1d and 1e, which is common in eukaryotic signaling proteins (Kalla2004Translocation). The RA domain, adjacent to the PH domain, spans amino acids 162-238 and is involved in GTPase-mediated signaling (Kalla2004Translocation). The central RhoGAP domain, essential for regulating Rho-like GTPases, spans amino acids 338-512 (Kalla2004Translocation).

The RhoGAP domain of ARHGAP20 is active toward RhoA but not Rac1 or Cdc42, and its activity is regulated by the RA domain, which binds to the GTP-bound active form of Rap1, enhancing its GAP activity (Ruan2008A). The protein's structure suggests a role in signaling pathways, although specific details on its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature (Kalla2004Translocation). Alternative splicing results in five transcript variants, which differ slightly in their amino-terminal regions (Kalla2004Translocation).

## Function
ARHGAP20 encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of Rho family GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. The protein contains several important domains, including a Ras association (RA) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain. The PH domain is crucial for the subcellular localization and activation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs), which in turn activate Rho family GTPases. The GAP domain specifically inactivates Rho GTPases, thereby influencing cell shape and motility (Kalla2004Translocation).

ARHGAP20 is predominantly expressed in the brain, suggesting its involvement in neurogenesis and neuronal activity. This is supported by the role of Rho GTPases in processes such as dendritic morphogenesis and synapse functioning (Kalla2004Translocation). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain normal cellular functions and tissue homeostasis by modulating the actin cytoskeleton and influencing cell-cell adhesion (mccormack2013regulation). These activities are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and dynamic behavior of cells.

## Clinical Significance
ARHGAP20 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Studies have shown that ARHGAP20 expression levels are significantly higher in CLL samples with deletions in chromosomal regions 13q14 and 11q22-23 compared to those with trisomy 12 or normal FISH diagnostics (Herold2011Expression). This elevated expression is particularly associated with cases that have a hemizygous deletion of the ATM locus, suggesting a functional link between these chromosomal deletions (Herold2011Expression). The unexpected high expression of ARHGAP20 in these cases indicates its potential role in the disease's progression and its association with specific genetic alterations (Herold2011Expression).

In addition to its role in CLL, ARHGAP20 is downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma, with significant decreases in expression compared to both transgenic and non-transgenic lung tissues. This suggests that ARHGAP20 may play a role in the signaling pathways altered in lung adenocarcinoma, potentially contributing to cancer progression (Rohrbeck2009Cancer). The differential expression of ARHGAP20 in these cancers highlights its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a target for therapeutic intervention.
