# RNF112

## Overview
RNF112, also known as ZNF179, is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 112, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by its RING finger domain, which is essential for its role in tagging substrate proteins with ubiquitin, marking them for degradation. RNF112 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in neuronal differentiation and development by regulating the cell cycle and modulating oxidative stress responses. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as TDP-43 and FOXM1, highlight its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, respectively. Alterations in RNF112 expression or function have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Kuk2022Prognostic; Lee2018Znf179; Zhang2023RNF112mediated).

## Structure
RNF112, also known as ZNF179, is a protein characterized by the presence of a classical C3HC4 RING finger domain, which is a hallmark of many E3 ubiquitin ligases. This domain is crucial for its function, as it facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, tagging them for degradation (Lee2018Znf179). The RING finger domain of RNF112 binds two zinc atoms in a cross-braced conformation, with a specific amino acid sequence that includes conserved cysteine and histidine residues, essential for its catalytic activity (Lee2018Znf179).

The protein is involved in autoubiquitination, a process that enhances its stability and E3 ligase activity (Lee2018Znf179). Mutations in the zinc-coordinating cysteine or histidine residues within the RING domain eliminate its E3 ligase activity, underscoring the importance of these residues for its function (Lee2018Znf179).

RNF112 is also known to interact with other proteins, such as promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf), which results in its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Lin2013Analysis). The protein's expression is regulated by Specificity protein 1 (SP1), which enhances its role in reducing oxidative stress (Yu2021Specificity).

## Function
RNF112, also known as ring finger protein 112, functions as a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. This activity is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. In healthy human cells, RNF112 is involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and development, particularly in the brain, where it is abundantly expressed. It modulates the expression of proteins such as p35 and p27, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, which is critical for neuronal differentiation (Lin2013Analysis).

RNF112 also interacts with the TDP-43 protein, mediating its polyubiquitination and accelerating its turnover, which helps prevent the formation of insoluble aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Lee2018Znf179). Additionally, RNF112 is involved in the regulation of oxidative stress responses, promoting the expression of cellular antioxidants and protecting neuronal cells from oxidative damage (Zhang2023RNF112mediated).

The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it may participate in transcriptional regulation and other nuclear functions, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the integrity of neuronal function (Zhang2023RNF112mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RNF112 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), RNF112 mutations are significantly associated with stages 2 and 3 of the disease, with mutant cases showing a notably worse prognosis compared to wild-type patients. Specifically, RNF112 mutations are linked to an 8.11 times worse prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker in OSCC (Kuk2022Prognostic).

In gastric cancer, RNF112 acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of the oncoprotein FOXM1. This interaction suppresses cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Low expression of RNF112 in gastric cancer tissues is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its role as a potential therapeutic target. The study also notes that RNF112 expression is increased by oxidative stress, which may have protective effects against cancer progression (Zhang2023RNF112mediated).

In the context of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), RNF112 is down-regulated in brain tissues following ICH, and its absence exacerbates brain injury by increasing inflammatory responses. This suggests a protective role of RNF112 in modulating inflammation during ICH (Zhang2018Rnf112).

## Interactions
RNF112, also known as ZNF179, is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with the transcription factor FOXM1. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of FOXM1, which is significant in the context of gastric cancer. The interaction between RNF112 and FOXM1 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pull-down assays, indicating that these proteins primarily colocalize in the cytoplasm. The N-terminus of RNF112 interacts with the DNA binding domain of FOXM1, facilitating its degradation via the proteasome pathway (Zhang2023RNF112mediated).

RNF112 also interacts with the compound RCM-1, which enhances the binding affinity between RNF112 and FOXM1. RCM-1 promotes the formation of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, increasing the thermal stability of both proteins and leading to increased ubiquitination and degradation of FOXM1 (Zhang2023RNF112mediated).

In addition to its role in cancer, RNF112 interacts with promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf) protein. This interaction is crucial for the translocation of RNF112 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and for regulating Plzf protein expression, which is important in neuronal differentiation (Lin2013Analysis).
