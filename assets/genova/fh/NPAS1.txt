# NPAS1

## Overview
Neuronal PAS domain protein 1 (NPAS1) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) family, which is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. The NPAS1 protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor and is involved in the regulation of gene expression critical for neurological and developmental processes. It forms heterodimers with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) to modulate the expression of genes such as tyrosine hydroxylase and erythropoietin, impacting dopamine synthesis and cellular responses to oxygen levels, respectively (Teh2007Neuronal; Ohsawa2005Novel). NPAS1 is also implicated in lung development and has been associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, due to its role in brain development and function (Levesque2007NPAS1; Michaelson2017Neuronal). The structural features of NPAS1, including its ligand-binding domains, suggest potential therapeutic applications for targeting neuropsychiatric conditions (Wu2016NPAS1ARNT).

## Structure
NPAS1 (neuronal PAS domain protein 1) is a transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) family. It contains a bHLH domain for DNA binding and two PAS domains, PAS-A and PAS-B, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Zhou1997Molecular; Wu2016NPAS1ARNT). The PAS domains are characterized by internal hydrophobic cavities, with volumes of 190 Å³ and 180 Å³, respectively, which serve as potential ligand-binding sites (Wu2016NPAS1ARNT). These domains are structurally similar to a baseball catcher's mitt, allowing for selective ligand binding (Wu2016NPAS1ARNT).

The NPAS1 protein forms heterodimers with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), utilizing six domain-domain interfaces to maintain stability (Wu2016NPAS1ARNT). The quaternary structure of the NPAS1-ARNT complex is similar to other bHLH-PAS heterodimers, such as HIF-2α-ARNT, with the bHLH, PAS-A, and PAS-B domains of ARNT twisting around NPAS1 (Wu2016NPAS1ARNT; Wu2017Structural).

NPAS1 is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system, with its mRNA appearing during embryonic development and increasing postnatally (Zhou1997Molecular). The protein's structure and ligand-binding capabilities suggest potential therapeutic applications in treating psychiatric disorders (Wu2016NPAS1ARNT).

## Function
Neuronal PAS domain protein 1 (NPAS1) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression in the central nervous system. It is part of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) family and functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor. NPAS1 is involved in the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels in dopaminergic neurons, which is crucial for dopamine synthesis. It negatively regulates TH expression by binding to the TH promoter, forming a heterodimer with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) (Teh2007Neuronal; Wu2016NPAS1ARNT).

NPAS1 is also implicated in the regulation of erythropoietin (EPO) expression in neuronal cells. It binds to the enhancer region of the EPO gene, potentially competing with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) for ARNT binding, thereby repressing EPO expression (Ohsawa2005Novel). This activity suggests a role in modulating the cellular response to oxygen levels.

In addition to its role in the nervous system, NPAS1 is involved in lung development, particularly in branching morphogenesis and the differentiation of neuroendocrine cells (Levesque2007NPAS1). These functions highlight NPAS1's importance in both neuronal and developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPAS1 gene have been linked to several neuropsychiatric disorders. NPAS1, along with NPAS3, is associated with conditions such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and bipolar disorder. Genetic deficiencies in NPAS1 can lead to behavioral abnormalities in mice, including diminished startle response, social recognition deficits, and increased locomotor activity (Wu2016NPAS1ARNT; ErbelSieler2004Behavioral). 

NPAS1 and NPAS3 are involved in the regulation of neuropsychiatric risk genes, with NPAS1 loss promoting postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. This suggests that NPAS1 plays a role in brain development and function, potentially impacting conditions like schizophrenia (Michaelson2017Neuronal). 

The NPAS1 protein must heterodimerize with ARNT to form functional transcription complexes. Disruptions in these interactions can affect transcriptional repression activity, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of related disorders (Wu2016NPAS1ARNT). 

The presence of ligand-binding pockets in NPAS1 suggests potential therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric disorders, as these proteins are genetically linked to such conditions (Wu2016NPAS1ARNT).

## Interactions
Neuronal PAS domain protein 1 (NPAS1) is a transcriptional repressor that interacts with the arylhydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT) to form heterodimers essential for its function. NPAS1 requires ARNT for nuclear localization, as it is excluded from the nucleus in the absence of ARNT due to a nuclear export signal in its N terminus. The interaction between NPAS1 and ARNT occurs via their N termini, facilitating NPAS1's nuclear translocation (Teh2006Neuronal).

NPAS1 also interacts with ARNT2, which is more restricted in expression to the brain and kidneys, to form heterodimers that are crucial for its nuclear localization and transcriptional repression activities (Teh2006Neuronal). These interactions allow NPAS1 to repress the transactivation functions of ARNT and ARNT2, suggesting that NPAS1 may inhibit transcription by overriding the activation function of adjacent transcription factors (Teh2006Neuronal).

In addition to its interactions with ARNT and ARNT2, NPAS1 forms heterodimers with ARNT in various tissues, including SH-SY5Y cells, telencephalon, and cerebellum, where it represses erythropoietin expression by binding to the enhancer region of the EPO gene (Ohsawa2005Novel). These interactions highlight NPAS1's role in regulating gene expression in the central nervous system.
