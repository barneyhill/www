# LCE1C

## Overview
The LCE1C gene encodes the late cornified envelope 1C protein, which is a crucial component of the epidermal differentiation process. This protein is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster, which is essential for the formation of the cornified envelope, a protective barrier in the skin's outermost layer. LCE1C is categorized as a structural protein involved in cross-linking with other proteins and lipids to maintain skin integrity and barrier function (Leśniak2024Dynamics). The protein is regulated by the transcription factor TAp63 and interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), suggesting roles in chromatin modification and nucleocytoplasmic transport (Yabuta2018Late). Variations in the LCE1C gene have been linked to skin disorders such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, as well as potential implications in cancer through its interaction with PRMT5 (Sun2018Association; Yabuta2018Late; Knüppel2012Multilocus).

## Function
The LCE1C gene encodes a protein that is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified envelope, a protective barrier in the epidermis. This protein is involved in epidermal differentiation, particularly at the later stages, where it contributes to the skin's barrier function by cross-linking with other structural proteins and lipids (Leśniak2024Dynamics). LCE1C proteins are believed to serve as cross-bridging proteins for cornified envelope components, similar to small proline-rich proteins (SPRR) (Leśniak2024Dynamics).

LCE1C is regulated by the transcription factor TAp63, which, when phosphorylated, upregulates LCE1C expression. This regulation is crucial for proper epidermal development and differentiation (Yabuta2018Late). The protein can form oligomers and interact with PRMT5, a protein involved in histone methylation, suggesting a role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation (Yabuta2018Late). LCE1C's interaction with importin α indicates its potential involvement in nucleocytoplasmic transport, although it is primarily localized in the cytoplasm (Yabuta2018Late). These molecular activities highlight LCE1C's role in maintaining skin integrity and its potential involvement in cellular processes like histone modification and nucleocytoplasmic transport.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LCE1C gene have been associated with several skin disorders, most notably psoriasis. Studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the LCE1C gene that are significantly associated with psoriasis vulgaris, particularly in Mongolian populations. SNPs such as rs6701216 have been highlighted as susceptibility loci for psoriasis, indicating a genetic predisposition linked to variations in LCE1C (Sun2018Association).

The LCE1C gene is also implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. Research has identified haplotype patterns involving LCE1C that are associated with this condition, suggesting that genetic variations in LCE1C contribute to the disease beyond known filaggrin mutations (Knüppel2012Multilocus).

In cancer research, LCE1C has been studied for its interaction with PRMT5, a protein involved in histone methylation. LCE1C is thought to sequester PRMT5 in the cytoplasm, potentially inhibiting its oncogenic activity. Insufficient expression of LCE1C may fail to inhibit PRMT5, which could contribute to tumorigenesis, particularly in cancer cells with mutant p63 proteins (Yabuta2018Late).

## Interactions
LCE1C interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), a protein that co-localizes in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. This interaction is significant as LCE1C promotes the cytoplasmic retention of PRMT5, thereby preventing its nuclear functions such as histone methylation. The interaction between LCE1C and PRMT5 was examined using co-immunoprecipitation assays, which revealed that LCE1C forms oligomers and interacts with PRMT5, although the interaction appears to be weak or involves only a small population of the proteins (Yabuta2018Late).

LCE1C is also involved in the transport of PRMT5 between the nucleus and cytoplasm. It forms oligomers, including dimers, which are transported into the nucleus via interaction with importin α, a protein identified through LC-MS/MS analysis. This interaction suggests that LCE1C may shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, although it lacks a nuclear export signal. The interaction with importin α is weak, indicating that only a small percentage of LCE1C interacts with it (Yabuta2018Late).

These interactions suggest a role for LCE1C in modulating PRMT5 activity, potentially influencing histone H3 methylation and contributing to tumor suppression (Yabuta2018Late).
