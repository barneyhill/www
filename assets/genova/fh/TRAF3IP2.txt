# TRAF3IP2

## Overview
TRAF3IP2 is a gene that encodes the TRAF3 interacting protein 2, a cytoplasmic adaptor protein integral to the regulation of immune responses and inflammatory signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its role in facilitating interactions between various signaling molecules. TRAF3 interacting protein 2 is involved in the activation of key signaling pathways, including those mediated by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are essential for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (Mummidi2019RECK; Zhang2020IL‑17). The gene's significance is underscored by its involvement in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, where mutations can lead to altered immune responses and disease susceptibility (Hüffmeier2010Common; Shafer2021Two).

## Structure


## Function
TRAF3IP2, also known as TRAF3 interacting protein 2, is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that plays a significant role in immune response regulation and inflammatory signaling pathways. It interacts with interleukin-17 (IL-17) receptors and is involved in the activation of stress-activated protein kinases such as JNK and p38 MAPK, as well as nuclear transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. These pathways are crucial for the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-13, which are involved in cell migration and proliferation (Mummidi2019RECK).

TRAF3IP2 is also implicated in the regulation of microRNAs that affect MMP-13 and RECK expression, influencing cell migration and proliferation (Mummidi2019RECK). In the context of IL-17 signaling, TRAF3IP2 mediates the effects of IL-17 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation, particularly in keratinocytes. It enhances the inflammatory response by increasing levels of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-23, TNF-α, and VEGF (Zhang2020IL‑17).

In healthy human cells, TRAF3IP2 is active in the cytoplasm, where it mediates signal transduction in the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, contributing to cytokine production and immune cell activation (Zhang2020IL‑17).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAF3IP2 gene are associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. A novel variant in TRAF3IP2 has been linked to familial scarring alopecia, which presents mixed features of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and folliculitis decalvans. This variant affects the interaction with the IL-17 receptor, suggesting a loss-of-function property that contributes to the disease phenotype (Nemer2020A). TRAF3IP2 mutations are also implicated in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), where biallelic nonsense mutations lead to a complete loss of protein expression, impairing IL-17-mediated immune responses and resulting in recurrent fungal infections (Shafer2021Two; Marujo2021A).

The gene is further associated with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with specific variants like p.D10N affecting protein interactions and altering immunoregulatory signaling pathways (Hüffmeier2010Common). In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), TRAF3IP2 polymorphisms are linked to increased disease susceptibility and the development of pericarditis, highlighting its role in IL-17-mediated and humoral immunity (Perricone2013TRAF3IP2). These findings underscore the significance of TRAF3IP2 in various immune-mediated conditions, where its genetic variability can influence disease risk and clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
TRAF3IP2, also known as ACT1, is a signal transducer involved in various protein interactions critical for inflammatory signaling pathways. It interacts with the SEFIR domain of IL-17 receptors, playing a crucial role in IL-17-dependent signaling pathways, particularly in NF-κB activation (Moon2021FYN–TRAF3IP2). TRAF3IP2 can homo-oligomerize via its SEFIR domain and acts as a K63 E3 ubiquitin ligase through its U-box domain. It recruits another E3 ligase, TRAF6, via its N-terminal TRAF-binding motif, forming a poly-ubiquitinated scaffold (Moon2021FYN–TRAF3IP2). 

The interaction with TRAF6 is significant, as it is a key player in NF-κB signaling. This interaction is supported by immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses, showing that both wild-type TRAF3IP2 and its fusion variant FYN-TRAF3IP2 can interact with TRAF6 (Moon2021FYN–TRAF3IP2). The p.D10N variant of TRAF3IP2, however, results in a nearly complete loss of interaction with TRAF6, which may modulate downstream signals of crucial immunoreceptors and lead to an imbalance in immune responses (Hüffmeier2010Common). 

TRAF3IP2 also interacts with the IL-17R complex, activating inflammatory signaling pathways, including IKK, IkBa phosphorylation/degradation, and NF-kB activation, as well as MAPK and c/EBP pathways (Izadpanah2022Targeting). These interactions highlight TRAF3IP2's role as a critical adaptor protein in mediating inflammatory responses.
