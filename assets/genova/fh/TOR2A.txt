# TOR2A

## Overview
The TOR2A gene encodes the protein torsin family 2 member A, which is part of the torsin family of proteins. Torsin family 2 member A is involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope and modulating protein interactions within the cell. This protein is categorized as a molecular chaperone, playing a crucial role in the proper folding and functioning of other proteins. Mutations in the TOR2A gene have been linked to neurological disorders such as dystonia, where the altered protein, torsinA(ΔE), leads to structural abnormalities in neurons (GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). Additionally, the gene product salusin-β is implicated in cardiovascular health, influencing blood pressure regulation and endothelial function (Sun2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TOR2A gene, which encodes the torsinA protein, have been implicated in several neurological and cardiovascular conditions. In the context of dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, the torsinA protein plays a critical role. The DYT1 form of dystonia is associated with a mutation in the TOR2A gene, leading to the expression of a mutant form of torsinA, known as torsinA(ΔE). This mutation disrupts normal protein interactions and causes structural abnormalities in the neuronal nuclear envelope, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disorder (GonzalezAlegre2019Advances).

Beyond neurological implications, the TOR2A gene product salusin-β has been linked to cardiovascular conditions, particularly hypertension. Elevated levels of salusin-β are observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats, where it contributes to increased arterial blood pressure and impaired vasodilatation. This effect is mediated through increased NAD(P)H oxidase activity and reactive oxygen species generation, which inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, leading to reduced nitric oxide production. Targeting salusin-β may offer a therapeutic approach for addressing endothelial dysfunction in hypertension (Sun2020A).
