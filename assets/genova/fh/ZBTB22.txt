# ZBTB22

## Overview
ZBTB22 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 22 protein, which is a member of the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation, often functioning as transcriptional repressors by binding to specific DNA sequences. The ZBTB22 protein is implicated in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is located within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region, suggesting potential roles in immune function and neuronal plasticity. Although the precise functions of ZBTB22 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, it has been associated with various conditions, including intellectual disabilities, psychopathologies related to hypercortisolism, and cancer, particularly in the context of its interaction with the DAXX protein (Douglas2020Genomic; Dall’2020Epigenomewide).

## Function
ZBTB22 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation and nuclear chromatin localization. It is part of the zinc finger and BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain-containing family, which typically functions as transcriptional regulators by binding to DNA. ZBTB22 plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression (Dall’2020Epigenomewide).

The protein is located within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region, which is crucial for immune functioning and neuronal plasticity. This suggests that ZBTB22 may have roles in these biological processes, although its specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed in the available literature (Dall’2020Epigenomewide). The gene has been associated with intellectual disability and psychopathologies following hypercortisolism, indicating its potential involvement in psychological and developmental issues (Dall’2020Epigenomewide).

In the context of cancer, ZBTB22 is part of a complex with DAXX, a gene involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Mutations in the DAXX-ZBTB22 complex have been noted in patients with poor response to cancer therapies, although the specific role of ZBTB22 in these processes is not well defined (Douglas2020Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
ZBTB22 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in gene regulation and protein interactions. In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and smoking, ZBTB22 is identified as a significant shared upregulated gene, suggesting its involvement in the biological mechanisms linking these conditions. The study highlights ZBTB22 as one of the most significant hub proteins, indicating its potential importance in the shared pathways between T2D and smoking (Ripon2022Statistical).

In rectal cancer, ZBTB22 is part of a complex with DAXX, located on chromosome 6p21.32. Mutations in this region, particularly in poor responders to neoadjuvant chemoradiation, suggest a role in predicting treatment response. Although the specific clinical significance of ZBTB22 mutations is not detailed, its regulatory role over DAXX and proximity to other cancer-related genes imply potential implications in cancer progression and treatment outcomes (Douglas2020Genomic).

In patients with endogenous hypercortisolism, ZBTB22 is associated with changes in DNA methylation, although these correlations did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing. This suggests a potential, albeit uncertain, link to cortisol-related psychopathologies (Glad2017Reduced).
