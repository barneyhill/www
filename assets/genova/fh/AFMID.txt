# AFMID

## Overview
AFMID, or arylformamidase, is a gene that encodes the enzyme arylformamidase, which is a member of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily. This enzyme is integral to the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, where it catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-formyl-L-kynurenine to L-kynurenine. This reaction is a crucial step in the conversion of tryptophan into nicotinic acid and NAD cofactors, which are essential for cellular energy metabolism and maintaining redox balance (Hugill2015Loss; Dobrovolsky2005Effect). Arylformamidase is predominantly expressed in the liver and kidney, reflecting its role in supporting high NAD+ production demands (Lin2018A). The enzyme's activity is also linked to immune response modulation and neuroprotection, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Dobrovolsky2005Effect). Mutations in the AFMID gene have been associated with various diseases, including renal failure, glucose metabolism disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Fifita2021Genetic; Hugill2015Loss).

## Structure
The AFMID protein, also known as arylformamidase, is involved in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Its primary structure consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, with a notable catalytic triad composed of Ser162, Asp247, and His279, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Pabarcus2005Cloning). The secondary structure of AFMID is predicted to have an α/β-hydrolase fold, a common structural motif in enzymes that perform hydrolysis reactions (Pabarcus2005Cloning). This fold is characterized by a core of beta sheets flanked by alpha helices, which is typical of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily.

The tertiary structure of AFMID is suggested to be similar to other hydrolases, with the catalytic triad forming the active site necessary for its function (Pabarcus2005Cloning). The quaternary structure of AFMID has not been explicitly detailed in the available literature, and there is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context. The enzyme's structure and function are significant due to its role in metabolizing tryptophan to nicotinic acid and NAD cofactors, which are essential for various biological processes (Pabarcus2005Cloning).

## Function
AFMID, or arylformamidase, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. This pathway is essential for the conversion of tryptophan into nicotinic acid, NAD(H), and NADP(H), which are vital for cellular energy metabolism and maintaining redox balance (Hugill2015Loss; Dobrovolsky2005Effect). AFMID specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-formyl-L-kynurenine to L-kynurenine, a key step in this metabolic process (Dobrovolsky2005Effect).

In healthy human cells, AFMID is highly expressed in the liver and kidney, where it supports the high demand for NAD+ production (Lin2018A). The full-length isoform of AFMID is predominant in these tissues, facilitating the maintenance of NAD+ levels, which is crucial for DNA repair and cellular metabolism (Lin2018A). AFMID's activity in the cytoplasm is also linked to immune response modulation and neuroprotection, as it helps regulate the levels of kynurenine pathway metabolites, which can influence neuronal and immune functions (Dobrovolsky2005Effect). The enzyme's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the AFMID gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In mice, the inactivation of the AFMID gene leads to significant imbalances in the kynurenine pathway, resulting in increased levels of kynurenine and its metabolites, which resemble conditions seen in renal failure. This disruption is associated with kidney damage and an abnormal immune system, as well as elevated plasma concentrations of formyl-kynurenine, kynurenine, and kynurenic acid (Dobrovolsky2005Effect).

AFMID mutations have also been implicated in glucose metabolism disorders. Mice with AFMID gene alterations exhibit impaired glucose tolerance due to defective insulin secretion, suggesting a potential link to diabetes (Hugill2015Loss). Additionally, AFMID has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Variants in the AFMID gene have been identified as potential risk factors for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), possibly due to their role in altering the kynurenine pathway and contributing to neuroinflammation (Fifita2021Genetic).

In cancer research, increased copy number variation of the AFMID gene has been observed in glioma samples, indicating a possible role in tumor development and progression (Liu2022Identification).
