# MEDAG

## Overview
The MEDAG gene encodes the protein mesenteric estrogen-dependent adipogenesis, which plays a significant role in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and metabolic reprogramming. MEDAG is particularly notable for its involvement in the progression of certain cancers, such as breast cancer and papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, where it influences tumor growth and metastasis through pathways like AKT/AMPK/mTOR and autophagy modulation under high glucose conditions (Li2021MEDAG; Li2022High; Song2019Evaluation). The protein's function and its impact on cancer progression make it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MEDAG gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers, notably breast cancer and papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). In breast cancer, MEDAG is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and is associated with adverse clinicopathological features such as vascular invasion and lymph node metastasis. High MEDAG expression correlates with poorer disease-free survival, particularly in both ER+/PR+ and ER-/PR- subtypes of breast cancer. MEDAG promotes breast cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, and it reduces sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug epirubicin through the AKT/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway (Li2021MEDAG).

In PTMC, MEDAG overexpression is linked to lymph node metastasis and multicentric tumors, contributing to poorer disease-free survival. The gene's expression is significantly higher in PTMC tissues compared to normal tissues, and it is involved in metabolic reprogramming, particularly affecting adipogenesis and lipid metabolism pathways (Song2019Evaluation).

MEDAG's role in cancer progression is further highlighted under high glucose conditions, where it accelerates breast cancer progression by modulating autophagy levels, particularly in diabetic patients (Li2022High). These findings suggest that MEDAG could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in these cancers.
