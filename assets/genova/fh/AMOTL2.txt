# AMOTL2

## Overview
The AMOTL2 gene encodes the Angiomotin-Like-2 protein, a member of the motin family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and polarity. This protein is characterized by its structural features, such as coiled-coil domains and a PDZ-binding domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its localization to cellular junctions (Bratt2002Angiomotin; Hultin2017AmotL2). AMOTL2 plays a significant role in endothelial cell function, particularly in angiogenesis, by regulating cell migration and proliferation (Wang2011Angiomotinlike2). It also interacts with key signaling pathways, such as the Hippo pathway, by modulating the subcellular localization of YAP1, thereby influencing cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Wang2011Angiomotinlike). Alterations in AMOTL2 expression or function have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in tumor progression and metastasis (Artinian2015Phosphorylation; Zou2024The).

## Structure
The AMOTL2 protein is part of the motin family and is characterized by several structural features. It contains coiled-coil domains, which are likely to form within the first 250 amino acid residues and towards the C-terminus, contributing to its secondary structure (Bratt2002Angiomotin). The C-terminal region of AMOTL2 includes a PDZ-binding domain, which is crucial for protein signaling and interactions with other proteins, such as Par3, facilitating its localization to cellular junctions (Bratt2002Angiomotin; Hultin2017AmotL2). 

AMOTL2 also features an amino-terminal glutamine-rich domain, which may play a role in its function as a scaffold protein (Mojallal2014AmotL2). The protein lacks the alanine-proline-rich angiostatin binding domain found in angiomotin, distinguishing it from other family members (Bratt2002Angiomotin). 

AMOTL2 exists in multiple isoforms, including a 60 kDa variant associated with malignancy and regulated by hypoxia, and a 100 kDa variant (Mojallal2014AmotL2). These isoforms may have distinct roles in cellular processes, such as disrupting cell polarity and promoting tumor invasion (Mojallal2014AmotL2). The protein also contains conserved tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which are potential sites for post-translational modifications (Bratt2002Angiomotin).

## Function
The AMOTL2 gene encodes the Angiomotin-Like-2 protein, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and polarity. In endothelial cells, AMOTL2 is essential for angiogenesis, as it regulates the migration and proliferation necessary for forming vascular structures. Knockdown of AMOTL2 disrupts tube formation and impairs wound healing, highlighting its importance in endothelial cell function (Wang2011Angiomotinlike2).

AMOTL2 is involved in maintaining cell polarity and organization by interacting with junctional cadherins and polarity proteins. It is crucial for the localization of cellular junctions and the organization of radial actin filaments, which are important for processes like aortic lumen expansion and epithelial cell packing (Hultin2017AmotL2). The protein also interacts with Par3 to control the formation and dynamics of tight and adherens junctions, linking polarity and cell-cell adhesion proteins to maintain stable cellular sheets (Hultin2017AmotL2).

AMOTL2 also regulates the subcellular localization of YAP1, a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, by promoting its cytoplasmic retention. This interaction is significant for controlling cell proliferation and preventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is associated with cancer progression (Wang2011Angiomotinlike).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the AMOTL2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In glioblastoma, AMOTL2 phosphorylation at serine 760 by the mTORC2 kinase enhances YAP signaling, promoting tumor growth and invasiveness. This phosphorylation prevents AMOTL2 from binding to YAP, leading to increased expression of YAP target genes, which are crucial for glioblastoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness (Artinian2015Phosphorylation).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), AMOTL2 is involved in the regulation of the LATS-YAP pathway. The circadian gene ARNTL2 suppresses AMOTL2, facilitating YAP nuclear translocation and promoting NPC metastasis. Knockdown of ARNTL2 results in increased AMOTL2 expression, which correlates with reduced NPC invasiveness and metastasis (Zou2024The).

AMOTL2 also plays a role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by interacting with the PPP2R2A protein, a regulatory subunit of the PP2A complex. This interaction regulates the phosphorylation of c-JUN, a protein involved in cell proliferation, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role for AMOTL2 in NSCLC (Cui2021AMOTL2).

## Interactions
AMOTL2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. It associates with the TRAPPII complex, specifically TRAPPC9 and TRAPPC10, under hypoxic conditions. This interaction is unique to the p60 isoform of AMOTL2, which also interacts with the PATJ/Pals1/Lin7 apical polarity protein complex through its PDZ-binding motif (Mojallal2014AmotL2). AMOTL2 binds to Par3, a polarity protein, which is essential for its junctional localization and actin filament organization. This interaction is mediated by the PDZ-binding domain of AMOTL2 and is crucial for the formation of radial actin filaments and cell junctions (Hultin2017AmotL2).

AMOTL2 also interacts with c-Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, with a higher affinity for its active form. This interaction promotes the peripheral translocation of c-Src, which is dependent on RhoB-containing endosomes (Huang2007Amotl2). In the context of non-small cell lung cancer, AMOTL2 binds to PPP2R2A, a regulatory subunit of the PP2A complex, inhibiting JUN dephosphorylation and suppressing cell proliferation (Cui2021AMOTL2). These interactions highlight AMOTL2's role in modulating cell shape, polarity, and growth.
