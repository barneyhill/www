# SGTA

## Overview
The SGTA gene encodes the small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat co-chaperone alpha, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular proteostasis by functioning as a co-chaperone. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal dimerization domain, a central tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, and a C-terminal glutamine-rich region, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins and complexes (Roberts2015Structural; MartínezLumbreras2018Structural). SGTA is involved in the cytosolic quality control of proteins, particularly in the stabilization and proper degradation of mislocalized proteins through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Benarroch2019The; Xu2012SGTA). It also acts as a chaperone for steroid hormone receptors, influencing their stability and activity, which is crucial for hormone signaling (Benarroch2019The). Additionally, SGTA's interactions with viral proteins and its involvement in oncogenesis highlight its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, making it a potential therapeutic target in various cancers and hormone-related conditions (Lu2013Expression; Yang2013High).

## Structure
SGTA is a 34 kDa protein composed of 313 amino acids, featuring three main structural domains: an N-terminal dimerization domain, a central tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, and a C-terminal glutamine-rich region (Roberts2015Structural; MartínezLumbreras2018Structural). The N-terminal domain, consisting of four α-helices, facilitates homodimerization through a tight hydrophobic interface, and interacts with ubiquitin-like domains in the BAG6 complex (Roberts2015Structural; Darby2014Solution). The TPR domain, composed of three tandem repeats forming a helix-turn-helix motif, is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones (Roberts2015Structural; MartínezLumbreras2018Structural).

The C-terminal domain is characterized by a glutamine-rich region and three repetitions of an NNP motif, which are crucial for substrate interaction and dimerization (MartínezLumbreras2018Structural). This domain is partially structured with α-helical regions and plays a role in substrate quality control, potentially using a tweezer-like motion to protect hydrophobic substrates (MartínezLumbreras2018Structural). SGTA's structure allows it to interact with various proteins, including hormone receptors and viral proteins, contributing to its role in cellular proteostasis (Roberts2015Structural).

## Function
SGTA (small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha) is a co-chaperone involved in the cytosolic quality control of proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis in healthy human cells. It interacts with hydrophobic regions of improperly or incompletely folded proteins, shielding these regions to prevent inappropriate interactions and aggregation, which are linked to neurodegenerative diseases (Benarroch2019The). SGTA collaborates with the BAG6 complex, which includes BAG6, UBL4A, and TRC35, to manage mislocalized proteins and promote their deubiquitylation, stabilizing these proteins and facilitating their proper degradation through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Benarroch2019The; Xu2012SGTA).

SGTA also acts as a chaperone for steroid hormone receptors, such as the androgen receptor (AR), stabilizing them in the cytoplasm and regulating their activity, which is crucial for proper hormone signaling (Benarroch2019The). It predominantly associates with Hsp70, suggesting its involvement in early stages of receptor folding, and affects receptor activity by enhancing it when knocked down and suppressing it when overexpressed (Paul2014The). Through these interactions, SGTA plays a significant role in the chaperone-dependent modulation of receptor function and protein quality control.

## Clinical Significance
SGTA (small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in protein quality control and cellular proliferation. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), high SGTA expression correlates with increased cell proliferation and poor prognosis, suggesting its involvement in oncogenesis. Knockdown of SGTA in ESCC cells results in decreased proliferation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Yang2013High). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SGTA is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis and higher tumor grades. Its expression correlates with Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation, and its knockdown leads to reduced cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest (Lu2013Expression).

SGTA also plays a role in regulating steroid hormone receptors, such as the androgen, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptors. It modulates receptor activity, which is significant in diseases like prostate cancer and polycystic ovary syndrome. In prostate cancer, SGTA expression is reduced during disease progression, and its knockdown suppresses androgen receptor-mediated gene expression and cell proliferation (Paul2014The). These findings highlight SGTA's clinical significance and its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers and hormone-related conditions.

## Interactions
SGTA (small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat co-chaperone alpha) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. SGTA interacts with the Bag6 complex, which includes Bag6, Ubl4A, and Trc35, playing a significant role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). This interaction is mediated by the noncanonical ubiquitin-like domain of Ubl4A, primarily through electrostatic interactions, which are crucial for recruiting SGTA to the Bag6 complex and enhancing substrate loading (Xu2012SGTA).

SGTA also binds to proteins with exposed hydrophobic patches, such as heat-denatured luciferase, indicating its chaperone-like activity. This binding is more transient compared to Bag6, which holds substrates in an unfolded yet soluble form (Xu2012SGTA). SGTA's interaction with the Bag6 complex is facilitated by Ubl4A, which acts as a matchmaker to enhance the association between SGTA and Bag6 (Xu2012SGTA).

In addition to its role in ERAD, SGTA interacts with viral proteins, such as the HIV-1 proteins Vpu and Gag, and the non-structural protein NS1 of parvovirus H-1, affecting viral processes like assembly and release (Benarroch2019The). SGTA also associates with intracellular aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly through its C-terminal domain, which interacts with polyglutamine aggregates (Kubota2021SGTA).
