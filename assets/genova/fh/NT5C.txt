# NT5C

## Overview
The NT5C gene encodes the enzyme 5', 3'-nucleotidase, cytosolic, which is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in nucleotide metabolism, where it catalyzes the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates to nucleosides, thus playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of intracellular nucleotide pools necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis (Hunsucker2005The). Structurally, the enzyme is a tetramer composed of two identical dimers and features a Rossmann-like fold typical of HAD superfamily proteins (Walldeén2007Crystal). Beyond its metabolic functions, NT5C is implicated in cellular signaling pathways, such as the AKT signaling pathway, where it undergoes phosphorylation that influences its interaction with the ARP2/3 complex, affecting actin assembly and cellular motility (Moniz2017Phosphoproteomic). This dual role in metabolism and cytoskeletal dynamics underscores the enzyme's importance in cellular homeostasis and function.

## Structure
The NT5C gene encodes the human cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase, which is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. The enzyme is tetrameric, consisting of two identical dimers, and is structurally similar to other enzymes in the HAD superfamily, such as mitochondrial 5(3)-deoxyribonucleotidase and cytosolic 5-nucleotidase III (Walldeén2007Crystal). The core domain of the enzyme features an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by eight α-helices, forming a Rossmann-like fold, which is common among HAD superfamily proteins (Walldeén2007Crystal). 

The active site is located between the core and cap domains and includes conserved motifs (Motif I, II, and III) that are crucial for the catalytic mechanism. These motifs facilitate the nucleophilic attack on the phosphate of the nucleoside monophosphate, leading to the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate (Walldeén2007Crystal). The enzyme also contains additional regulatory regions with two allosteric effector sites, which are involved in its activation (Walldeén2007Crystal). 

The NT5C protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and has splice variant isoforms that could affect its function and localization. These structural features and modifications are essential for its role in nucleotide metabolism.

## Function
The NT5C gene encodes the enzyme 5', 3'-nucleotidase, cytosolic, which plays a critical role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates to nucleosides. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining the balance of intracellular nucleotide pools, which is crucial for DNA and RNA synthesis and overall cellular homeostasis (Hunsucker2005The). NT5C is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in regulating nucleotide levels, particularly deoxyribonucleotides, which are important for cell division and DNA repair (Hunsucker2005The).

In addition to its role in nucleotide metabolism, NT5C has been identified as a novel substrate of the AKT signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of NT5C at serine 184 is sensitive to PI3K inhibition, suggesting a regulatory role in PI3K signaling. This phosphorylation does not significantly affect NT5C's catalytic activity but is involved in its interaction with the ARP2/3 complex, which is crucial for actin assembly and cellular processes such as cell migration and phagocytosis (Moniz2017Phosphoproteomic). NT5C's interaction with the ARP2/3 complex indicates its involvement in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility, highlighting its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell movement (Moniz2017Phosphoproteomic).

## Interactions
NT5C, a cytosolic nucleotidase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been identified as an interacting partner of ARPC1B, a component of the ARP2/3 complex, which plays a crucial role in actin assembly and cellular processes such as migration and phagocytosis. This interaction was confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that NT5C binds to ARPC1B and p34, another member of the ARP2/3 complex. The phosphorylation state of NT5C at serine 184 (S184) affects its binding affinity, with the S184A mutant showing enhanced binding compared to the wild-type or phospho-mimetic S184D mutant (Moniz2017Phosphoproteomic).

NT5C's interaction with the ARP2/3 complex suggests a regulatory role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, impacting cell motility and spreading. This interaction is potentially dependent on the phosphorylation of NT5C at S184, which is regulated by AKT, a kinase activated by PI3K signaling. Although S184 phosphorylation does not alter NT5C's catalytic activity, it may modulate the interaction with the ARP2/3 complex, thereby influencing actin-related processes (Moniz2017Phosphoproteomic). These interactions highlight NT5C's involvement in cytoskeleton-related functions and its potential role in PI3K-regulated cellular activities (Moniz2017Phosphoproteomic).
