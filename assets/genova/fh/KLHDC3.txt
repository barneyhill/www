# KLHDC3

## Overview
KLHDC3 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch domain containing 3, which functions as a substrate receptor within the CRL2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by its Kelch domains, which facilitate the recognition and binding of specific protein substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. KLHDC3 plays a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis by regulating the degradation of proteins such as IDO1, involved in immune response modulation, and the tumor suppressor p14 ARF, which influences cell growth and apoptosis. Through these interactions, KLHDC3 impacts critical cellular processes, including immune regulation and cell cycle control, and has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in the context of ovarian cancer (Hennes2024Monovalent; Zhang2021CRL2KLHDC3).

## Function
KLHDC3 is a substrate receptor in the CRL2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in the degradation of specific proteins, such as IDO1 and p14 ARF, through the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. In healthy human cells, KLHDC3 regulates the levels of IDO1, an enzyme involved in immune response modulation, by recognizing specific degrons, particularly those with a C-terminal glycine, which is essential for its interaction and subsequent degradation (Hennes2024Monovalent). This regulation is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing unnecessary accumulation of IDO1, which could otherwise affect immune responses (Hennes2024Monovalent).

KLHDC3 also targets the tumor suppressor protein p14 ARF for degradation. This process is mediated by the Kelch domains of KLHDC3 and is crucial for regulating cell growth and apoptosis. By promoting the degradation of p14 ARF, KLHDC3 influences the stability of p53, a key protein in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, thereby impacting cellular functions in a p53-dependent manner (Zhang2021CRL2KLHDC3). KLHDC3's activity in these pathways highlights its role in maintaining cellular structure and function, influencing cell division, and contributing to cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The KLHDC3 gene has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in ovarian cancer, where it is overexpressed and may function as an oncogene. This overexpression is associated with the suppression of ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, through the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p14 ARF. By promoting the degradation of p14 ARF, KLHDC3 indirectly supports the transcription of SLC7A11, a component that protects cells from oxidative stress, thereby potentially contributing to tumor growth and progression (Zhang2021CRL2KLHDC3).

KLHDC3 also plays a role in the degradation of the IDO1 protein, which is involved in immune modulation and cancer. The CRL2-KLHDC3 complex targets IDO1 for ubiquitination and degradation, a process that can be enhanced by monovalent pseudo-natural product degraders known as iDegs. These compounds induce conformational changes in IDO1, facilitating its degradation by KLHDC3. This mechanism suggests that KLHDC3 is crucial for regulating IDO1 levels, which could have implications for cancer treatment by modulating immune responses (Hennes2024Monovalent).

While KLHDC3's role in these processes is significant, the context does not provide specific information on diseases directly caused by mutations or expression alterations in the KLHDC3 gene.

## Interactions
KLHDC3 is a component of the CRL2-KLHDC3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating the stability of the p14ARF protein. KLHDC3 acts as an adaptor within this complex, specifically recognizing a C-terminal degron in p14ARF, leading to its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. This interaction is specific to KLHDC3, as other CRL2 receptors do not interact with p14ARF. The degradation process facilitated by KLHDC3 is absent in the murine homolog p19arf, which lacks the C-terminal degron (Zhang2021CRL2KLHDC3).

KLHDC3's interaction with p14ARF is mediated through its Kelch domains, which are essential for binding, while the BC-box and CUL2-box motifs are necessary for promoting p14ARF degradation. Mutants lacking these motifs fail to degrade and ubiquitinate p14ARF. Nucleophosmin (NPM) acts as a protective factor for p14ARF, sequestering it in the nucleoli and preventing KLHDC3-mediated degradation. Depletion of NPM increases the interaction between KLHDC3 and p14ARF, indicating that NPM protects p14ARF from degradation by KLHDC3 (Zhang2021CRL2KLHDC3).
