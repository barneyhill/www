# UTP20

## Overview
UTP20 is a gene that encodes the UTP20 small subunit processome component, a nucleolar protein integral to ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. This protein is a part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a ribonucleoprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in the early stages of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing and assembly, particularly in the maturation of 18S rRNA, which is essential for the formation of the small ribosomal subunit. UTP20 is involved in stabilizing RNA helices and facilitating the proper conformation of RNA expansion segments, which are crucial for ribosomal function. Additionally, UTP20 interacts with various nucleic acids and proteins, including U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and fibrillarin, highlighting its role in the complex network of interactions necessary for efficient ribosome assembly and function (Barandun2017The; Wang2007Human; Hunziker2019Conformational).

## Function
UTP20 is a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for the early stages of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. It plays a critical role in the processing and assembly of the 18S rRNA, a key component of the small ribosomal subunit. UTP20 is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the maturation of pre-rRNA, ensuring proper ribosome function and protein synthesis (Barandun2017The; Hunziker2019Conformational).

In the SSU processome, UTP20 provides structural support for RNA expansion segments ES3A and ES3B, stabilizing RNA helices in a specific conformation necessary for the proper assembly and function of the ribosomal subunit (Barandun2017The). It is involved in the chaperone functions within the 5' and central domains, controlling tertiary interactions between ribosomal RNA domains (Barandun2017The).

UTP20 is also implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression, particularly in yeast, where its expression may be regulated by Sfp1, a gene involved in cell size control. This suggests a potential link between ribosome biogenesis and cell size regulation (Bernstein2004The).

## Interactions
UTP20, also known as 1A6/DRIM, is a nucleolar protein involved in the processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and is a component of the small subunit processome. It interacts with several nucleic acids and proteins, playing a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. UTP20 is associated with U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), a key component of the small subunit processome, and is involved in the processing of 18S rRNA. This interaction is similar to its yeast counterpart, Utp20, which also associates with U3 snoRNA (Dez2007Roles; Wang2007Human).

In human cells, UTP20 interacts with fibrillarin, another component of the U3 snoRNP complex, indicating its role in forming part of the snoRNA protein complexes (snoRNPs) that guide chemical modifications in pre-rRNA processing (Wang2007Human). UTP20 is also associated with 32S and 12S rRNA precursors, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting its involvement in the maturation of 28S and 5.8S rRNA (Kong20101A6DRIM).

In yeast, UTP20 is part of the SSU processome and interacts with several snoRNAs, including U3, snR10, and snR30, as well as pre-rRNAs such as 35S and 32S, indicating its role in early ribosome assembly (Dez2007Roles).
