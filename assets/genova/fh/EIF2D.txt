# EIF2D

## Overview
EIF2D, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2D, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The EIF2D protein functions as a noncanonical translation initiation factor and plays a critical role in the recycling of the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is essential for efficient protein synthesis. It is particularly important under stress conditions, where it facilitates the translation of specific mRNAs, such as ATF4, by recruiting Met-tRNAiMet to mRNA/40S complexes without the need for the canonical eIF2•GTP•Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex. This function is crucial during the integrated stress response (ISR), allowing cells to adapt to various stressors. EIF2D also regulates translation through upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its own mRNA, highlighting its role in cellular adaptation and homeostasis (Vasudevan2020Translational; Akulich2019A).

## Structure


## Function
EIF2D (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2D) is involved in several critical processes related to protein synthesis in human cells. It plays a role in the recycling of the 40S ribosomal subunit during translation, which is essential for efficient protein synthesis. This process involves the disassembly of the 80S ribosome into its 60S and 40S subunits after protein synthesis is complete, with EIF2D implicated in the removal of the 40S subunit (Young202140S).

EIF2D also functions as a noncanonical initiation factor, particularly under stress conditions where it aids in the translation of specific mRNAs such as ATF4. It facilitates the recruitment of Met-tRNAiMet to mRNA/40S complexes without the canonical eIF2•GTP•Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex, which is crucial during the integrated stress response (ISR) (Vasudevan2020Translational).

In addition, EIF2D is involved in the regulation of translation through upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its own mRNA, which allows for specific control under stress conditions, such as hyperosmotic stress (Akulich2019A). This regulatory mechanism highlights its role in cellular adaptation to stress and its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF2D gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disorders. In schizophrenia, EIF2D expression varies with disease progression. It is increased in chronic schizophrenia patients but decreased in those experiencing their first episode, suggesting a correlation with disease duration and potentially serving as a biomarker for disease progression and redox status (GilabertJuan2019Time).

EIF2D also plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) associated with C9orf72 mutations. In these conditions, EIF2D is involved in the repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), which are toxic and contribute to disease pathology. Loss of EIF2D function reduces the production of these toxic proteins, suggesting that EIF2D could be a therapeutic target for these diseases (Sonobe2021A).

Additionally, EIF2D is crucial for the integrated stress response, particularly in the translation of ATF4 mRNA. Its deficiency can impair stress responses, which are relevant in conditions like retinitis pigmentosa and potentially other stress-related diseases (Vasudevan2020Translational).

## Interactions
EIF2D, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2D, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in translation initiation and ribosome recycling. EIF2D interacts with ribosomal subunits, facilitating the recruitment of Met-tRNAiMet to mRNA/40S complexes, which is essential for translation initiation. This interaction occurs without the canonical eIF2•GTP•Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex, suggesting a unique role for EIF2D in translation initiation (Young202140S).

EIF2D also functions alongside DENR and MCTS-1 as a Met-tRNAiMet delivery factor, particularly during the translation of mRNAs with multiple upstream open reading frames (uORFs). This interaction is crucial for the translational induction of ATF4 during the integrated stress response (Vasudevan2020Translational). EIF2D and DENR are shown to function redundantly in regulating ATF4 signaling, with EIF2D's RNA-binding motif being essential for this regulation (Vasudevan2020Translational).

In the context of viral translation, EIF2D, along with eIF2A, is involved in an IRES-independent mechanism of translation initiation in enteroviruses, which can occur even when eIF2α is phosphorylated. This suggests a role for EIF2D in alternative translation initiation pathways under stress conditions (Kim2023The).
