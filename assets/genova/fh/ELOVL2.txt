# ELOVL2

## Overview
ELOVL2 (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane enzyme involved in the elongation of very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) within the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme, ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2, plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are crucial for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and function, particularly in the retina and brain (AlSaleh2013ELOVL2). ELOVL2's activity is integral to lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis, influencing processes such as insulin secretion and glucose tolerance (Bellini2018Protective). Alterations in ELOVL2 expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including autism spectrum disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Wang2023A; Sun2018FADS1FADS2).

## Function
ELOVL2 (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the elongation of very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) within the endoplasmic reticulum of cells. It is particularly involved in the biosynthesis of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (AlSaleh2013ELOVL2). ELOVL2 catalyzes the elongation of C20 and C22 PUFAs, converting EPA to docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and subsequently to 24:5 n-3, which is a precursor to DHA (AlSaleh2013ELOVL2).

In healthy human cells, ELOVL2 is essential for maintaining adequate levels of DHA, a critical component of cell membranes, particularly in the retina and brain. DHA is vital for proper photoreceptor function and visual health, as it contributes to the structure of photoreceptor outer segment discs and the function of the visual pigment rhodopsin (Osada2021ADIPOR1). The enzyme's activity is also linked to lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis, impacting processes such as insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in beta cells (Bellini2018Protective). ELOVL2's function in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ELOVL2 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), specific polymorphisms in ELOVL2, such as rs9468304, have been linked to an increased risk of ASD in Chinese children, although the significance of this association was not maintained after correction for multiple testing (Sun2018FADS1FADS2). Other polymorphisms, like rs10498676, have been associated with decreased ASD risk (Sun2018FADS1FADS2).

ELOVL2 is also implicated in cancer biology, particularly in colorectal and prostate cancers. Altered expression of ELOVL2 influences cancer cell proliferation and migration by modulating membrane lipid composition and regulating signaling pathways involved in cancer progression. In colorectal cancer, ELOVL2 expression is associated with tumor growth and metastasis, making it a potential target for clinical diagnosis and treatment (Wang2023A).

In retinal health, ELOVL2 expression is crucial for maintaining docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels, which are essential for photoreceptor function. Deficiency in the adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1) leads to reduced ELOVL2 expression, contributing to photoreceptor degeneration and visual loss, as observed in studies on retinitis pigmentosa (Osada2021ADIPOR1).
