# SLC25A46

## Overview
SLC25A46 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 46, which is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in the processes of fission and fusion. This protein is a member of the mitochondrial solute carrier family and plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial lipid homeostasis and cristae architecture. Unlike typical mitochondrial carriers, SLC25A46 contains only one conserved carrier domain and is characterized by an extended N-terminus (Abrams2018Insights). It interacts with key mitochondrial fusion proteins such as mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), as well as components of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, facilitating lipid transfer between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (Janer2016SLC25A46; Abrams2018Insights). Mutations in SLC25A46 are associated with various neurological disorders, highlighting its essential role in mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism (Abrams2015Mutations).

## Structure
The SLC25A46 protein is a member of the mitochondrial solute carrier family and is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane. It is characterized by an extended N-terminus and contains only one conserved carrier domain, unlike typical mitochondrial carriers that have three such domains (Abrams2018Insights). The protein is composed of transmembrane helices, which are part of its secondary structure, and it is involved in mitochondrial dynamics and lipid homeostasis (Janer2016SLC25A46).

SLC25A46 is homologous to the yeast protein Ugo1, which functions as a molecular adaptor in mitochondrial fusion, suggesting a similar role for SLC25A46 in humans (Abrams2018Insights). The protein forms complexes with other mitochondrial dynamics proteins, such as MIC60, MFN2, and OPA1, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial morphology and cristae remodeling (Abrams2018Insights). The protein's structure has been modeled on the bovine mitochondrial ADP/ATP translocase, although the model is not highly accurate due to low sequence identity (Abrams2018Insights).

Mutations in SLC25A46, such as the p.R257Q variant, affect its interaction with other proteins, altering its distribution and potentially impacting mitochondrial function (Abrams2018Insights). These mutations are often located in regions that suggest an impact on protein interactions rather than direct transport function (Abrams2018Insights).

## Function
The SLC25A46 gene encodes a protein that is integral to maintaining mitochondrial lipid homeostasis and cristae architecture in healthy human cells. It is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in the processes of fission and fusion (Janer2016SLC25A46; Schuettpelz2023The). SLC25A46 interacts with key mitochondrial fusion proteins such as MFN2 and OPA1, as well as components of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, facilitating lipid transfer between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria (Janer2016SLC25A46; Abrams2018Insights).

The protein is involved in the stability of the MICOS complex, which is essential for maintaining cristae structure. Loss of SLC25A46 function leads to mitochondrial hyperfusion and altered ER morphology, impacting cellular respiration and leading to premature cellular senescence (Janer2016SLC25A46). SLC25A46 is also implicated in the oligomerization of GTPases like MFN2 and OPA1, which are crucial for mitochondrial fusion and fission, suggesting its role in providing a lipid platform necessary for these processes (Schuettpelz2023The). Overall, SLC25A46 is essential for proper mitochondrial function, impacting cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis (Abrams2015Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC25A46 gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders. These include inherited optic atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2), Leigh syndrome, progressive myoclonic ataxia, and lethal congenital pontocerebellar hypoplasia (Steffen2017Rapid; Terzenidou2017Novel; Abrams2015Mutations). The gene encodes a mitochondrial outer membrane protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics and cristae maintenance. Mutations can lead to mitochondrial hyperfusion, altered mitochondrial architecture, and disrupted lipid homeostasis, contributing to neurodegeneration (Janer2016SLC25A46; Li2021Reanalysis).

Specific mutations, such as L341P, result in rapid degradation of the protein, leading to severe neurological phenotypes, including cerebellar malformations and early death (Steffen2017Rapid). Other mutations, like R340C and E335D, produce a more stable protein and are linked to milder conditions such as CMT2 and dominant optic atrophy (Steffen2017Rapid). The severity of these conditions often correlates with the stability of the mutated SLC25A46 protein.

In some cases, mutations in SLC25A46 have been linked to optic atrophy and sensorimotor polyneuropathy, as observed in siblings with a novel homozygous variant (Kodal2022Case). These findings highlight the gene's critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and its impact on neurological health.

## Interactions
SLC25A46 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that plays a significant role in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in the processes of fission and fusion. It physically interacts with several key proteins involved in these processes. SLC25A46 has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with mitofusin 1 (MFN1), mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), which are integral components of the mitochondrial fusion machinery (Schuettpelz2022SLC25A46; Schuettpelz2023The). These interactions suggest that SLC25A46 is closely associated with the regulation of mitochondrial morphology and function.

In addition to its interactions with fusion proteins, SLC25A46 is also involved with the MICOS complex, specifically interacting with MIC25, indicating a role in maintaining mitochondrial cristae structure (Schuettpelz2023The). The protein's interaction with these components is crucial for the proper oligomerization of MFN2 and OPA1, as loss of SLC25A46 affects their oligomerization states, leading to altered mitochondrial morphology (Schuettpelz2022SLC25A46).

SLC25A46 also interacts with proteins from other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting its involvement in interorganellar contact sites and lipid flux, which are essential for mitochondrial dynamics (Schuettpelz2023The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SLC25A46 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.
