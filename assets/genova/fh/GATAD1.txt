# GATAD1

## Overview
GATAD1 is a gene that encodes the protein GATA zinc finger domain containing 1, which is a transcription factor involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. This protein is part of the zinc finger protein family and primarily functions within the nucleus, where it plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. GATA zinc finger domain containing 1 is known for its involvement in the recruitment of histone demethylase KDM1A/LSD1 to specific gene promoters, influencing the transcriptional repression of genes associated with the timing of puberty (Lomniczi2015Epigenetic). Additionally, it is implicated in cell proliferation and the cell cycle through its regulation of AKT signaling and interaction with various transcriptional regulators (Rrustemi2024Pathogenic). The protein's function is modulated by its phosphorylation state, affecting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and its subcellular localization, which underscores its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport (Rrustemi2024Pathogenic). Mutations in the GATAD1 gene have been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiac health (Yang2016Modeling).

## Function
GATAD1 is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression through its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. It is part of the zinc finger protein family and functions primarily in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to modulate transcriptional activity. GATAD1 is known to recruit the histone demethylase KDM1A/LSD1 to specific gene promoters, such as KISS1 and TAC3, leading to the removal of the activating histone mark H3K4me2. This activity is associated with the transcriptional repression of genes involved in the timing of puberty, suggesting a role in delaying its onset (Lomniczi2015Epigenetic).

In addition to its role in puberty regulation, GATAD1 is involved in cell proliferation and the cell cycle by controlling AKT signaling. It forms part of the EMSY complex, which binds to H3K4me3-marked active promoters, and interacts with several transcriptional regulators, including KDM5A and SIN3B, which are involved in transcriptional corepressor activity (Rrustemi2024Pathogenic). GATAD1's function is also influenced by its phosphorylation state, which affects its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and its subcellular localization, highlighting its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport (Rrustemi2024Pathogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GATAD1 gene are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood efficiently due to an enlarged and weakened heart muscle. A specific homozygous recessive missense mutation, S102P, has been identified in families with adult-onset DCM. This mutation affects the subcellular localization of GATAD1 in cardiomyocytes, potentially disrupting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, which are crucial for its nuclear localization (Rrustemi2024Pathogenic; Yang2016Modeling). 

Research using zebrafish models has demonstrated that GATAD1 mutations can lead to heart failure-like phenotypes under stress conditions, such as a high cholesterol diet and ethanol exposure. These models show increased mortality and cardiac remodeling, including enlarged ventricular chambers and decreased papillary muscle density (Ding2020Modeling; Yang2016Modeling). 

Alterations in GATAD1 expression levels have also been observed in human patients. The gene is overexpressed in female idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients compared to males, suggesting a potential role in gender differences in DCM (Yang2016Modeling). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GATAD1 in cardiac diseases and underscore the importance of understanding its molecular interactions and expression patterns.

## Interactions
GATAD1 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with the 14-3-3 family of proteins, particularly through phosphorylation at serine 102 (pS102). This interaction is significant for regulating GATAD1's subcellular localization by potentially blocking nuclear import, a mechanism similar to other 14-3-3 protein functions (Rrustemi2024Pathogenic). The phosphorylation of GATAD1 at S102 is essential for binding to 14-3-3 proteins, as demonstrated by isothermal titration calorimetry and x-ray crystallography, which confirmed the interaction despite GATAD1 not matching a known 14-3-3 binding motif (Rrustemi2024Pathogenic).

GATAD1 also participates in transcriptional repression by interacting with histone demethylase KDM1A. This interaction is involved in the repression of puberty-related genes such as KISS1 and TAC3 by reducing the activating histone mark H3K4me2 at their promoters (Lomniczi2015Epigenetic). GATAD1's role in transcriptional repression is part of a broader mechanism that prevents premature initiation of puberty by silencing specific genes in the hypothalamus (Lomniczi2015Epigenetic). These interactions highlight GATAD1's role in both cellular localization and gene expression regulation.
