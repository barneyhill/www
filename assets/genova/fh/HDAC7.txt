# HDAC7

## Overview
HDAC7 is a gene that encodes the protein histone deacetylase 7, a member of the class IIa histone deacetylases. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression through its role in chromatin remodeling, achieved by removing acetyl groups from histone proteins, which leads to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression (RUIJTER2003Histone; Clocchiatti2011Class). Histone deacetylase 7 is characterized by a conserved catalytic domain and is known to interact with various transcription factors and co-repressors, influencing processes such as cell differentiation, apoptosis, and vascular integrity (Martin2007Class; Ficner2009Novel). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which affects its subcellular localization and function (Dequiedt2005Phosphorylation). HDAC7 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Ouaïssi2008High; Yang2005Class).

## Structure
The human HDAC7 protein is a member of the class IIa histone deacetylases, characterized by a conserved catalytic domain located in the C-terminal half of the protein (RUIJTER2003Histone). The crystal structure of HDAC7's catalytic domain, spanning residues 515-900, reveals a fold similar to other Zn2+-dependent HDACs, with structural homology to HDAC4 and bacterial class II HDAH (Ficner2009Novel). This domain includes a second Zn2+ ion liganded by a conserved C-X-C-X5-H-X75-76-C motif, forming a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the active site, which may serve as a docking site for other proteins (Ficner2009Novel).

HDAC7 features a His residue in its active site, replacing the catalytic Tyr found in class I HDACs, a structural feature shared with HDAC4, suggesting a common mechanism among class IIa HDACs (Ficner2009Novel). The protein also contains conserved binding domains for C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), and 14-3-3 proteins on the N-terminus (RUIJTER2003Histone). HDAC7 can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which influences its localization and function (RUIJTER2003Histone).

## Function
HDAC7 is a class IIa histone deacetylase that plays a significant role in transcriptional repression by removing acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to chromatin condensation. It is primarily active in the nucleus and is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, cell differentiation, and maintaining vascular integrity (RUIJTER2003Histone; Clocchiatti2011Class).

In the thymus, HDAC7 is transiently expressed in CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes, where it associates with the MEF2D transcription factor to repress the proapoptotic gene nur77. This repression is crucial for the negative selection of thymocytes, ensuring the removal of self-reactive T cells (Martin2007Class). HDAC7 also interacts with co-repressors such as SMRT/N-CoR and BCoR, inhibiting the myogenic transcription factor MEF2, which is essential for muscle differentiation (RUIJTER2003Histone).

During embryogenesis, HDAC7 is specifically expressed in the vascular endothelium, where it maintains vascular integrity by repressing matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP10). This repression prevents the degradation of the extracellular matrix, which is vital for endothelial cell adhesion and blood vessel stability (Clocchiatti2011Class; Chang2006Histone). The absence of HDAC7 leads to vascular defects, highlighting its critical role in vascular development (Chang2006Histone).

## Clinical Significance
HDAC7 (histone deacetylase 7) has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In pancreatic adenocarcinomas, HDAC7 expression is significantly upregulated, with 81% of tumor samples showing increased mRNA levels compared to normal pancreatic tissue. This upregulation is associated with the progression of pancreatic cancer and suggests that HDAC7 could serve as a biomarker for this malignancy (Ouaïssi2008High).

HDAC7 is also involved in cancer treatment responses. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), such as vorinostat, selectively suppress HDAC7 expression, particularly in transformed cells sensitive to these inhibitors. This suppression is linked to the induction of cell death in cancerous cells, highlighting HDAC7's potential role in cancer therapy (Dokmanovic2007Histone).

Beyond cancer, HDAC7 is implicated in cardiovascular diseases. In null mice, HDAC7 is associated with cardiovascular defects, although specific human diseases directly linked to HDAC7 mutations are not detailed (Yang2005Class). HDAC7's involvement in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis further underscores its significance in disease pathogenesis (Ouaïssi2008High).

## Interactions
HDAC7 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in different cellular processes. It is known to associate with protein kinase D (PKD), which phosphorylates HDAC7, leading to its nuclear export. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of Nur77 expression during T cell receptor (TCR)-induced apoptosis, as it overcomes HDAC7-mediated repression of Nur77 (Dequiedt2005Phosphorylation).

In endothelial cells, HDAC7 interacts with β-catenin, a protein involved in cell proliferation. HDAC7 stabilizes β-catenin in the cytoplasm, preventing its nuclear translocation and thus modulating endothelial cell growth. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) can induce the degradation of HDAC7, allowing β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus and promote cell proliferation (Margariti2010Histone).

HDAC7 also interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), enhancing its transcriptional activity under hypoxic conditions. This interaction involves the formation of a complex with HIF-1α and p300, which increases the expression of HIF-1α target genes (Kato2004Histone).

Additionally, HDAC7 is associated with the myosin phosphatase complex, including protein phosphatase 1β (PP1β) and myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1), which dephosphorylates HDAC7, affecting its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and function in thymocytes (Parra2007Myosin).
