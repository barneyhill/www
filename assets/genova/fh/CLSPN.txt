# CLSPN

## Overview
The CLSPN gene encodes the protein claspin, a pivotal player in the DNA damage response and replication checkpoint pathways. Claspin is a nuclear protein that functions as a mediator in the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway, crucial for maintaining genomic stability and cell cycle control. It is categorized as a regulatory protein involved in DNA replication and repair processes. Claspin facilitates the activation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), which is essential for cell cycle arrest and DNA repair in response to replication stress or DNA damage. The protein interacts with various components of the DNA replication machinery and DNA repair proteins, such as BRCA1, to ensure proper genome duplication and chromosomal integrity. Alterations in the expression or function of CLSPN have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer prognosis and susceptibility (Chen2023A; Azenha2017Claspin; Chini2004Claspin).

## Structure
Claspin, encoded by the CLSPN gene, is a multifunctional protein involved in DNA replication and checkpoint regulation. It contains several functional domains essential for its role in these processes. The N-terminal region includes the replication fork-interaction domain (RFID), spanning amino acids 273-622, which is crucial for interactions with replication-associated proteins and chromatin at stalled replication forks. This region also contains two basic patches (BP1: aa 273-492 and BP2: aa 492-622) and a PCNA-interacting domain (PIP) (Yang2016Claspin; Azenha2020Implications).

The C-terminal region of Claspin features an acidic patch (AP) and the Chk1-activating domain (CKAD), spanning amino acids 837-1206, which is involved in Chk1 binding and activation. This region is also important for interactions with proteins like Cdc7, TopBP1, and DNA polymerase ε (Yang2016Claspin; Azenha2020Implications). Claspin undergoes phosphorylation, a common post-translational modification, which is crucial for its function in DNA damage response and replication checkpoint regulation (Smits2018Claspin).

Claspin exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, including one with a distinct C-terminus and another with an internal deletion, though the functional significance of these variants is not fully understood (Smits2018Claspin).

## Function
Claspin, encoded by the CLSPN gene, is a crucial nuclear protein involved in maintaining genomic stability and cell homeostasis. It plays a significant role in the DNA damage response and replication stress pathways by acting as a mediator in the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway. Claspin facilitates the activation of Chk1 kinase, which is essential for cell cycle checkpoint control, particularly during the S phase and in response to DNA damage or replication stress (Azenha2017Claspin; Chini2004Claspin).

In healthy human cells, Claspin is part of the replisome, ensuring precise genome duplication and regulating origin firing during DNA replication. It interacts with various DNA repair proteins, including BRCA1, and is involved in the phosphorylation of Chk1, which is necessary for cell cycle arrest and DNA repair (Lin2004Human; Azenha2017Claspin). Claspin also plays a role in stabilizing replication forks and preventing premature mitosis, thereby maintaining chromosomal integrity (Chini2004Claspin).

Claspin's expression is tightly regulated throughout the cell cycle, with its levels peaking at the S/G2 phase and declining at the onset of mitosis. This regulation is achieved through mechanisms such as ubiquitin-mediated degradation and stabilization by deubiquitinases (Azenha2017Claspin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CLSPN gene have been implicated in various cancers. High expression of CLSPN is associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including adrenocortical carcinoma, kidney chromophobe, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, and uveal melanoma. This high expression correlates with reduced overall survival and is linked to the tumor immune microenvironment, showing a negative correlation with immune cell infiltration, particularly CD8+ T cells (Chen2023A).

Specific variants of CLSPN, such as the c.1574A>G variant, have been associated with breast cancer. This variant may induce exon skipping, leading to a truncated protein that affects the DNA damage response pathway, particularly the activation of Chk1, a crucial step in checkpoint activation during DNA replication and damage response (Azenha2020Implications). Another variant, I783S, has been found to impair the DNA damage response by affecting CHK1 phosphorylation, suggesting a role in cancer susceptibility (Zhang2009Prevalence).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma, the CLSPN rs7520495 SNP is associated with poor cell differentiation, especially in patients who consume alcohol, indicating a genetic link between CLSPN polymorphisms and cancer progression (Hsieh2024The).

## Interactions
Claspin, encoded by the CLSPN gene, is a crucial protein involved in the DNA damage response and replication checkpoint pathways. It interacts with several key proteins to maintain genomic integrity. Claspin binds with checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) through its C-terminal CHK1-binding domain, facilitating CHK1 activation in response to DNA damage (Erkko2008Germline; Liu2012The). It also forms a complex with BRCA1, which localizes to the cell nucleus upon DNA damage, further promoting CHK1 activation (Erkko2008Germline).

Claspin interacts with the ATR kinase, playing a role in the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint pathway. This interaction is essential for the phosphorylation and activation of CHK1, which is crucial for protecting DNA replication forks (Focarelli2009Claspin; Liu2012The). Claspin also associates with the RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 complex, enhancing the activation of CHK1 (Liu2012The).

In addition to these interactions, Claspin is part of a protein complex with PCNA, an essential component of the DNA replication machinery, and interacts with replication-associated proteins such as Cdc45 and DNA polymerase ε (Erkko2008Germline; Azenha2020Implications). These interactions highlight Claspin's integral role in DNA replication and damage response processes.
