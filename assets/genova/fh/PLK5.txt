# PLK5

## Overview
PLK5 is a gene that encodes the protein polo-like kinase 5, which is a unique member of the polo-like kinase family. Unlike other kinases, the PLK5 protein is characterized by the absence of a functional kinase domain due to a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein that retains the polo box domain (PBD). This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions, allowing PLK5 to function in a kinase-independent manner. The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in neuron differentiation and glioblastoma suppression. PLK5 is implicated in various cancers, particularly brain tumors, where its expression is often downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation. This downregulation is associated with increased tumor malignancy, highlighting PLK5's potential role as a tumor suppressor and its significance in cancer biology (Su2023Potential; de2011Plk5).

## Structure
The human PLK5 gene encodes a protein that is unique within the polo-like kinase family due to its lack of a functional kinase domain. This is primarily due to a stop codon in exon 6, which results in a truncated protein that lacks the kinase domain but retains the polo box domain (PBD) (de2011Plk5). The PBD is involved in protein-protein interactions and is a characteristic feature of the polo-like kinase family (de2011Plk5). The human PLK5 protein is approximately 40 kDa in size and is expressed as a shorter form compared to its murine counterpart (de2011Plk5).

The PLK5 protein is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons and glial cells, and is involved in neuron differentiation and glioblastoma suppression (de2011Plk5). The protein's expression is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as promoter hypermethylation, which can lead to its downregulation in brain tumors (de2011Plk5). Despite the absence of a kinase domain, PLK5 can induce G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting that its C-terminal region, which includes the PBD, is sufficient for these functions (de2011Plk5). The protein's role as a tumor suppressor is further supported by its ability to induce apoptosis in glioblastoma cells (de2011Plk5).

## Function
PLK5 is a member of the polo-like kinase family, characterized by the presence of a polo box domain (PBD) involved in protein-protein interactions. Unlike other members of this family, PLK5 lacks a functional kinase domain due to a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein that retains the PBD. This suggests that PLK5 functions in a PBD-dependent manner rather than through kinase activity (de2011Plk5).

In healthy human cells, PLK5 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons and glial cells, where it plays a crucial role in neuron differentiation and axonal growth. It modulates neurite formation in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation, indicating its involvement in neuronal development and function (de2011Plk5). PLK5 is also expressed in other differentiated tissues, such as the parotid gland and kidney, but is not significantly present in proliferative tissues (de2011From).

The expression of PLK5 is downregulated in proliferating cells and accumulates in quiescent cells, suggesting a role in maintaining the differentiated state of cells and potentially acting as a tumor suppressor (de2011Plk5).

## Clinical Significance
PLK5, a member of the polo-like kinase family, is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression and function. In the context of cancer, PLK5 is considered a potential tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly reduced in several types of brain tumors, including glioblastomas, oligodendrogliomas, and astrocytomas, often due to promoter hypermethylation, which silences the gene (de2011Plk5). This downregulation is associated with higher tumor malignancy grades and progression, suggesting that PLK5 plays a protective role against tumorigenesis (Su2023Potential; de2011Plk5).

Reexpression of PLK5 in glioblastoma cells has been shown to induce apoptosis, highlighting its potential therapeutic significance in brain cancer (de2011Plk5). Beyond brain tumors, PLK5 expression is also reduced in other cancers, such as lung, cervical, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers, indicating a broader tumor suppressor role (Su2023Potential). The gene's expression levels have been linked to patient survival outcomes, with lower expression correlating with poorer prognosis in certain cancers (Su2023Potential). These findings underscore the importance of PLK5 in cancer biology and its potential as a diagnostic or therapeutic target.
