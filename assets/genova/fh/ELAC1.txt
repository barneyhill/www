# ELAC1

## Overview
The ELAC1 gene encodes the protein elaC ribonuclease Z 1, a member of the RNase Z family of enzymes, which are involved in RNA processing. This protein, also known as RNase Z S, is primarily localized in the cytosol and plays a role in the maturation of tRNA molecules by cleaving 3' extensions from tRNA precursors, a crucial step in tRNA biogenesis (Rossmanith2011Localization). Despite its involvement in RNA processing, RNase Z S is not essential for cell survival, as evidenced by its low processing efficiency and dispensability in certain cell lines (Rossmanith2011Localization). The ELAC1 gene is located on chromosome band 18q21 and has been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal and lung cancer, where it is often downregulated or deleted, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression and as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Kleivi2007Gene).

## Function
The ELAC1 gene encodes the short form of RNase Z, known as RNase Z S, which is primarily localized in the cytosol of human cells, with some weak presence in the nucleus (Rossmanith2011Localization). This enzyme is involved in the processing of tRNA molecules by removing 3' extensions from tRNA precursors, a critical step in tRNA biogenesis (Rossmanith2011Localization). Despite its role in tRNA processing, RNase Z S is not essential for cell survival and growth, as indicated by its low tRNA processing efficiency in vitro and its dispensability in certain cell lines (Rossmanith2011Localization).

The biological role of RNase Z S in healthy human cells remains unclear, as it is not involved in tRNA primary transcript processing and is part of a homozygous deletion in a lung cancer cell line, suggesting it may not be crucial for normal cellular functions (Rossmanith2011Localization). The ELAC1 gene product is implied to be responsible for processing nuclear-encoded tRNAs due to its cytosolic localization, but its precise function in healthy cells has yet to be fully elucidated (Rossmanith2011Localization).

## Clinical Significance
The ELAC1 gene, located on chromosome band 18q21, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in RNA processing. In colorectal cancer, ELAC1 is notably downregulated, particularly in liver metastases and carcinomatoses, which suggests its potential involvement in the progression of this disease (Kleivi2007Gene). Chromosomal loss at the ELAC1 locus has been associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, indicating that alterations in this gene may contribute to the aggressiveness of the cancer (Kleivi2007Gene).

In lung cancer, the ELAC1 locus is part of a 300 kb homozygous deletion that also includes the ME2 gene, suggesting that such deletions may play a role in the development or progression of lung cancer (Kleivi2007Gene). While the specific mechanisms by which ELAC1 alterations contribute to these cancers are not fully understood, the gene's involvement in RNA processing and cellular homeostasis is likely a factor in its clinical significance. The downregulation and chromosomal deletions involving ELAC1 highlight its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and as a target for therapeutic interventions.
