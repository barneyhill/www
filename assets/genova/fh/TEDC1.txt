# TEDC1

## Overview
TEDC1, or tubulin epsilon and delta complex 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the assembly and stability of microtubules, which are critical components of the cytoskeleton. The protein encoded by TEDC1 is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and maintaining cell shape. It is particularly active in the centrosome, contributing to the formation of the mitotic spindle, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Tang2021Rapid). TEDC1 is also implicated in centriole stability and ciliogenesis, functioning as part of the tubulin epsilon and delta (TED) complex (Stathatos2021Delta). Mutations in the TEDC1 gene have been linked to developmental disorders, including primary microcephaly, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Boonsawat2019Elucidation).

## Function
TEDC1 (tubulin epsilon and delta complex 1) plays a crucial role in the assembly and stability of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and maintaining cell shape. The protein is particularly active in the cytoplasm, with a significant presence in the centrosome, where it contributes to the formation of the mitotic spindle. This function is vital for ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division, a critical process for maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy (Tang2021Rapid).

In the context of glioblastoma models, TEDC1 is associated with DNA replication and spindle organization, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation. This suggests that TEDC1 may play a role in the proliferation of cells by facilitating the accurate replication and segregation of genetic material (Tang2021Rapid). Additionally, TEDC1 has been identified near single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with immune response, suggesting a potential role in immune function, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains less clear (Habimana2021GenomeWide). Overall, TEDC1's involvement in microtubule dynamics underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TEDC1 gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders, particularly primary microcephaly (PM) and related conditions. TEDC1, previously known as C14ORF80, is essential for centriole stability, a critical component of cell division. In patients with PM, mutations such as noncanonical splice variants and frameshift variants in TEDC1 have been identified. These mutations likely lead to truncated proteins, with some variants undergoing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which can disrupt normal protein function (Boonsawat2019Elucidation).

Clinical manifestations associated with TEDC1 mutations include microcephaly, primordial dwarfism, and moderate global developmental delay. Patients may also exhibit distinct facial features such as a broad forehead, facial scoliosis, mild ptosis, a beaked nose, short ears, and micrognathia (Boonsawat2019Elucidation). The genetic landscape of microcephaly highlights the importance of evaluating noncanonical splice-site variants, as these can significantly impact the understanding of the genetic basis of microcephaly and related developmental disorders (Boonsawat2019Elucidation). The study of TEDC1 mutations contributes to the broader understanding of centrosome-related pathways in primary microcephaly (Boonsawat2019Elucidation).

## Interactions
TEDC1 is involved in the stability and assembly of centrioles and microtubules, playing a crucial role in maintaining the structure of centrioles and basal bodies. It is part of the tubulin epsilon and delta (TED) complex, which includes TEDC2, and is essential for centriole stability. TEDC1 contains coiled-coil domains, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions, although specific details of these interactions are not extensively documented (Stathatos2021Delta).

TEDC1 has been identified as a regulator of centriole assembly and ciliogenesis, with its role in these processes being linked to its association with centriolar satellites. It is important to determine whether TEDC1 associates with centriolar satellites in both ciliating and non-ciliating cells, as this may influence its function in cilia-related or independent processes (Quarantotti2019Centriolar).

TEDC1 is also associated with δ-tubulin and ε-tubulin, potentially acting as a microtubule inner protein (MIP) that stabilizes these tubulins in centrioles. It may work alongside the centriolar protein CENPJ (SAS4), which is involved in centriole biogenesis and microtubule growth regulation (Arora2023Appearing; Stathatos2021Delta).
