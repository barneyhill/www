# LATS1

## Overview
LATS1 (large tumor suppressor kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which is a pivotal component of the Hippo signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The LATS1 protein functions primarily by phosphorylating and inactivating the oncogene YAP, thereby preventing it from promoting cell proliferation and survival. Structurally, LATS1 contains a kinase domain at its C terminus and several conserved domains that facilitate its regulatory functions. It interacts with various proteins, such as MOB1 and Beclin-1, to modulate processes like cell cycle regulation and autophagy. Clinically, alterations in LATS1 expression and mutations are associated with several cancers, including breast, glioma, and soft tissue sarcomas, highlighting its role as a tumor suppressor (Furth2017The; Ji2012Decreased; Hao2008Tumor).

## Structure
LATS1 (large tumor suppressor kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the Hippo signaling pathway. The primary structure of LATS1 includes a kinase domain located at the C terminus, which shares 85% sequence similarity with LATS2 (Furth2017The). The N-terminal region of LATS1, approximately 700 amino acids upstream of the kinase domain, contains two conserved domains, LCD1 and LCD2, which are essential for its function and regulation (Yu2014Mutation; Yabuta2013Nterminal).

The secondary structure of LATS1 includes a proline-rich domain and two PPxY motifs, which are crucial for interactions with proteins such as YAP and TAZ (Furth2017The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing for specific protein-protein interactions. The quaternary structure is characterized by the interaction of LATS1 with other proteins, such as Mob1, which is essential for its activation through phosphorylation (Ni2015Structural).

LATS1 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its activity and stability (Furth2017The). These modifications are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. The protein is largely disordered except for its C-terminal kinase domain, with flexibility in the region between the PPxY motifs (Verma2018Biophysical).

## Function
LATS1 (large tumor suppressor kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, where it functions primarily by phosphorylating and inactivating the oncogene YAP (Yes-associated protein). This phosphorylation event sequesters YAP in the cytoplasm, preventing it from entering the nucleus and activating transcription of genes that promote cell proliferation and survival (Hao2008Tumor).

In healthy human cells, LATS1 is involved in cell cycle regulation by inhibiting the activity of CycE/CDK2, thus limiting the G1/S transition. It also plays a role in mitotic exit by interacting with CDC25B and phosphorylating CDC26 (Furth2017The). LATS1 can induce G2/M cell cycle arrest or apoptosis by inhibiting CDC2/Cyclin B kinase activity, which is crucial for the G2/M transition (Yang2001Human).

LATS1 is active in various cellular locations, including the centrosomes, plasma membrane, and cytoplasm, and its localization can vary depending on the cell lineage (Furth2017The). It also regulates autophagy by interacting with and stabilizing Beclin-1, a key protein in autophagy, in a kinase-independent manner (Tang2019LATS1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LATS1 gene are implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, down-regulation of LATS1 mRNA expression is often due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis (Takahashi2005DownRegulation). In gliomas, decreased LATS1 expression correlates with advanced disease stages and poorer survival outcomes, making it an independent prognostic factor (Ji2012Decreased). 

In urinary bladder and colon cancers, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and variants in LATS1 are linked to altered gene expression and increased cancer risk. Some missense mutations in the serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain may affect the tumor suppressor activity of LATS1 (Saadeldin2015New). In soft tissue sarcomas, mutations and promoter hypermethylation of LATS1 contribute to tumor development (Hisaoka2002Molecular). 

LATS1 also plays a role in lung adenocarcinoma, where its acetylation at the K751 residue inhibits its activation, promoting tumor progression by enhancing YAP nuclear translocation (Yang2021LATS1). In infiltrative basal cell carcinomas, biallelic disruption of LATS1 is observed, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Tate2014Biallelic).

## Interactions
LATS1 interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in the Hippo signaling pathway. It directly interacts with the acetyltransferase CBP, which acetylates LATS1 at lysine 751, affecting its function and stability (Yang2021LATS1). This acetylation can be reversed by the deacetylases SIRT3 and SIRT4, which also interact with LATS1 (Yang2021LATS1). LATS1's interaction with MOB1 is significant for its activation, as MOB1 binds more strongly to the phosphorylated form of LATS1 (Yang2021LATS1).

LATS1 also interacts with the protein bPix, which promotes the phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ, indicating that LATS1 is necessary for bPix's function. This interaction is mediated by a lysine and glutamate-rich domain in bPix (Heidary2014Arhgef7). In the context of autophagy, LATS1 interacts with Beclin-1, promoting its self-dimerization and stabilization, which is crucial for repressing autophagy (Tang2019LATS1).

Additionally, LATS1 binds to F-actin, acting as a negative regulator of actin polymerization, which is important for cellular functions such as migration and adhesion (VisserGrieve2011LATS1). These interactions highlight LATS1's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential implications in cancer biology.
