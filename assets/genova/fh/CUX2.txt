# CUX2

## Overview
CUX2, or cut-like homeobox 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor protein involved in the regulation of neuronal development and differentiation, particularly within the cerebral cortex. The CUX2 protein is categorized as a transcriptional repressor and plays a crucial role in the formation of neuronal circuits by influencing dendritic and axonal branching. It is expressed in migratory projection neurons and is essential for the development of early neocortical circuits during fetal development. CUX2 also regulates the proliferation of neuronal precursors in the subventricular zone, ensuring a balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, it interacts with DNA repair proteins to maintain genome stability in neurons. Mutations in the CUX2 gene have been linked to neurological disorders such as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Cubelos2007Cux2; Chatron2018The; Miškić2021Adult; Weiss2019The).

## Function
CUX2 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the development and differentiation of neurons, particularly in the cerebral cortex. It is involved in the regulation of dendritic and axonal branching, contributing to the formation of neuronal circuits and synaptic connections (Weiss2019The). CUX2 is expressed in migratory projection neurons destined for the upper cortical layers and is involved in the formation of early neocortical circuits during fetal development (Miškić2021Adult). It acts as a transcriptional repressor, influencing the fate of neurons and contributing to the molecular specification of cortical cells (Miškić2021Adult).

In the subventricular zone of the cerebral cortex, CUX2 regulates the proliferation of neuronal intermediate precursors, controlling the number of upper layer neurons (Cubelos2007Cux2). It promotes cell cycle exit in a cell-autonomous manner, ensuring the proper balance between cell proliferation and differentiation (Cubelos2007Cux2). CUX2 also interacts with promoter regions of genes like p27 Kip1 and Neurod1, which are crucial for progenitor pool size and differentiation (Weiss2019The). Its activity is essential for maintaining genome stability and preventing oxidative DNA damage in neurons (Weiss2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CUX2 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders, primarily developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), intellectual disability (ID), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A recurrent de novo missense variant, p.Glu590Lys, in the CUX2 gene has been identified as a novel cause of DEE, characterized by a spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes such as infantile-onset myoclonic DEE, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and infantile spasms. Patients with this variant often experience seizures that are refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs, although some achieve seizure freedom with valproate. These patients typically exhibit severe intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, movement disorders, and autistic traits (Chatron2018The).

The p.Glu590Lys variant is not found in large population databases and is predicted to be damaging by several in silico tools, suggesting its rarity and pathogenicity. It is located in a critical domain of the CUX2 protein, potentially affecting its interaction with DNA, which may result in a partial loss of function or confer gain of function or dominant negative properties (Barington2018A; Chatron2018The). Another novel variant, p.Thr945Met, has been associated with DEE67, expanding the clinical spectrum of CUX2-related disorders (Zhang2022Novel).

## Interactions
CUX2 interacts with the OGG1 protein, a key enzyme in the base excision repair pathway, to facilitate the repair of oxidative DNA damage. This interaction is demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays, which show that CUX2 can stimulate OGG1's binding to 8-oxoG-containing DNA, enhancing its glycosylase and AP lyase activities. The Cut repeat domains of CUX2, such as CR1CR2 and CR3HD, are crucial for these interactions, as they increase OGG1's binding to damaged DNA and stimulate its enzymatic activities. Despite this stimulation, some Cut repeat proteins that enhance OGG1 do not bind DNA with high affinity, suggesting a transient interaction mechanism that may involve allosteric changes in OGG1 or transient alterations in DNA conformation (Pal2015CUX2).

In the female mouse liver, CUX2 is involved in the repression of male-biased genes and the activation of female-biased genes. It binds to specific genomic regions, often near STAT5 binding sites, and recruits chromatin remodeling proteins such as histone deacetylases and histone lysine methyltransferases to modify chromatin accessibility. This interaction suggests a complex network of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that modulate gene expression (Conforto2012Impact).
