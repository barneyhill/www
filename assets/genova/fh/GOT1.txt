# GOT1

## Overview
The GOT1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1, a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferase that plays a crucial role in amino acid metabolism. This enzyme is primarily involved in the reversible transamination process between aspartate and α-ketoglutarate, forming oxaloacetate and glutamate, which is vital for both amino acid biosynthesis and degradation (Saxena2021Structural; Jiang2015Expression). The GOT1 protein functions as a homodimer and is integral to the malate-aspartate shuttle, facilitating the transfer of reducing equivalents across the mitochondrial membrane, thereby maintaining cellular redox balance and energy metabolism (Kremer2021GOT1). Expressed in various tissues, including the liver, heart, and skeletal muscles, GOT1 is also involved in neuroprotection and cellular metabolism regulation (Shen2011Genomewide; Saxena2021Structural). Its clinical significance is underscored by its association with conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia and retinal degeneration, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Cheng2020Upregulation; Subramanya2023Rod).

## Structure
The GOT1 protein, encoded by the GOT1 gene, is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme involved in amino acid metabolism. It is a homodimer, consisting of two identical chains, each comprising 413 amino acid residues (Saxena2021Structural). The primary structure of GOT1 includes these amino acid sequences, which are crucial for its enzymatic function.

In terms of secondary structure, the GOT1 protein contains α-helices and β-sheets, forming a typical fold characteristic of aminotransferases (Saxena2021Structural). These structural elements are essential for maintaining the protein's stability and facilitating its catalytic activity.

The tertiary structure of GOT1 is organized to support its function as an aminotransferase, with a PLP cofactor-binding domain that is critical for its enzymatic activity (Saxena2021Structural). This domain is involved in the reversible transfer of amino groups, a key process in amino acid metabolism.

The quaternary structure of GOT1 is defined by its homodimeric nature, which is important for its stability and function. The dimerization of the protein allows for the proper alignment of active sites necessary for its catalytic role (Saxena2021Structural). The protein's structure is also influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions (Saxena2021Structural).

## Function
The GOT1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1, which is involved in amino acid metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible transamination between aspartate and α-ketoglutarate to form oxaloacetate and glutamate, a reaction crucial for both the degradation and biosynthesis of amino acids (Saxena2021Structural; Jiang2015Expression). GOT1 is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that plays a significant role in the malate-aspartate shuttle, facilitating the transfer of reducing equivalents across the mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for maintaining redox balance and supporting cellular energy metabolism (Kremer2021GOT1).

In healthy human cells, GOT1 is active in the cytosol and is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, red blood cells, and cardiac/skeletal muscles (Shen2011Genomewide). It coordinates glucose consumption and glycolysis, which are vital for cellular metabolism (Saxena2021Structural). GOT1 also acts as a scavenger of glutamate in brain neuroprotection following closed head injuries and stroke, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and neurological functions (Saxena2021Structural). Elevated serum AST activity, primarily of cytosolic origin, is often used as a marker for liver, heart, and muscle injury (Shen2011Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GOT1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A novel variant in the GOT1 gene, c.44C > G:p.P15R, has been associated with early-onset severe preeclampsia (EOPE). This variant is extremely rare and was identified in a patient with severe EOPE through whole-exome sequencing. In silico analysis suggests that this mutation could alter the electric environment of the enzymatic center of the GOT1 protein, potentially affecting its function, although its clinical significance remains uncertain (Zhang2020A).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression levels of GOT1 have been linked to poor prognosis. Studies have shown that elevated GOT1 expression is associated with shorter event-free survival and overall survival in patients undergoing chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. High GOT1 expression is considered an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in AML, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Cheng2020Upregulation).

In the context of retinal health, the deletion of GOT1 in rod photoreceptors leads to retinal degeneration. This is characterized by metabolic dysfunction, including disruptions in the malate-aspartate shuttle, which affects mitochondrial function and redox balance, ultimately leading to photoreceptor cell death (Subramanya2023Rod).

## Interactions
GOT1, or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular metabolism. In osteoblasts, GOT1 interacts with SIRT1, a deacetylase that regulates its activity through lysine deacetylation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining glycolysis and bone homeostasis, as SIRT1 deletion leads to increased acetylation and activity of GOT1, affecting glycolysis and bone mass (Jin2024SIRT1).

In the context of cancer, GOT1 is targeted by Aspulvinone O (AO), a natural inhibitor that binds to its active site. This interaction disrupts glutamine metabolism, particularly in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, by inhibiting GOT1's enzymatic activity, which is essential for NADPH production and redox balance (Sun2019Aspulvinone).

Mutations in GOT1 can alter its structural stability and interactions. For instance, mutations like L36R and Y159C affect the protein's secondary structure and binding interactions, potentially impacting its function in metabolic processes (Saxena2021Structural). These interactions and modifications highlight GOT1's role in various cellular pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
