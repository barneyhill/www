# KMT2C

## Overview
KMT2C, also known as lysine methyltransferase 2C, is a gene located on chromosome 7q36.1 that encodes a protein of the same name. The KMT2C protein is a member of the TRX/MLL gene family and functions as a histone methyltransferase, specifically catalyzing the monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1). This modification is crucial for the regulation of gene expression, particularly in enhancer regions, and is associated with active transcriptional states (Herz2012Enhancer-associated; Jiao2024The). As a component of the COMPASS-like complex, KMT2C plays a significant role in chromatin modification and gene regulation, interacting with various proteins and complexes to modulate DNA promoter and enhancer elements (Lavery2020KMT2CD). The protein's involvement in epigenetic regulation, DNA damage response, and tumor suppressor pathways highlights its importance in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis (Lee2009A; Jiao2024The). Mutations in the KMT2C gene are linked to several cancers and developmental disorders, underscoring its critical role in normal cellular function and development (Rao2015Hijacked; Fagan2019COMPASS).

## Structure
The KMT2C protein, also known as lysine methyltransferase 2C, is a large protein composed of 4911 amino acids and is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 7q36.1 (Jiao2024The). It is a member of the TRX/MLL gene family and functions as a histone methyltransferase, specifically catalyzing the monomethylation of histone H3 lysine K4 in enhancer regions (Jiao2024The). The protein structure includes several key domains: seven plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, a high mobility group (HMG) domain, two FY (phenylalanine tyrosine) enriched regions, and a SET (Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax) domain (Jiao2024The). The PHD fingers are involved in recognizing monomethylated H3K4, acting as 'readers' of the histone methylation status (Jiao2024The).

The SET domain is crucial for the protein's catalytic activity, facilitating the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to specific H3K4 sites (Jorge2023Deep). This domain is highly conserved and essential for the protein's role in epigenetic regulation (Fagan2019COMPASS). The KMT2C protein is part of the KMT2C/D COMPASS complexes, which are involved in modulating DNA promoter and enhancer elements (Lavery2020KMT2CD). These complexes interact with chromatin via histone tail post-translational modifications and DNA binding cofactors (Lavery2020KMT2CD).

## Function
KMT2C, also known as MLL3, is a lysine methyltransferase that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression through its function as a histone methyltransferase. It specifically catalyzes the monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), a modification associated with active enhancers, which is crucial for the recruitment of transcriptional activators involved in DNA replication and transcriptional co-activation (Herz2012Enhancer-associated; Jiao2024The). In healthy human cells, KMT2C is involved in maintaining the balance of epigenetic regulation of chromatin, essential for normal gene transcription (Jiao2024The).

KMT2C is also implicated in the DNA damage response and repair pathways. It participates in homologous recombination-mediated repair of double-strand breaks, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Jiao2024The). Additionally, KMT2C is involved in the regulation of tumor suppressor pathways, such as the p53 pathway, by facilitating the expression of p53-target genes in response to DNA damage (Lee2009A). This activity underscores its role in preventing tumorigenesis and maintaining genomic integrity. The protein's activity is associated with cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and cellular senescence, promoting factors like p21, p27, and p53 to prevent unlimited cell proliferation (Jiao2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KMT2C gene are implicated in various cancers and developmental disorders. In cancer, KMT2C is frequently mutated, with significant occurrences in breast, lung, colorectal, bladder, and gastric cancers, among others (Rao2015Hijacked; Rampias2019The). These mutations often result in loss of function, contributing to tumorigenesis by disrupting normal gene regulation and enhancer activity (Fagan2019COMPASS; Rampias2019The). In breast cancer, KMT2C acts as a tumor suppressor, with its loss associated with metastatic hormone-refractory breast cancer and shorter progression-free survival (Fagan2019COMPASS). In prostate cancer, KMT2C truncation mutations are linked to aggressive disease and poor prognosis, correlating with increased MYC target gene expression and reduced p16 INK4A expression (Limberger2022KMT2C).

KMT2C mutations are also associated with developmental disorders. Heterozygous germline loss of KMT2C is linked to autism spectrum disorder and Kleefstra syndrome, characterized by skeletal and intellectual defects (Fagan2019COMPASS). These mutations can lead to an inability to activate critical developmental signaling pathways, affecting growth and differentiation (Fagan2019COMPASS). The gene's role in enhancer priming and activation during embryonic development underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing aberrant growth (Fagan2019COMPASS).

## Interactions
KMT2C, also known as lysine methyltransferase 2C, is a component of the COMPASS-like complex, which plays a crucial role in chromatin modification and gene regulation. KMT2C interacts with several proteins, including WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L, and DPY-30, which are part of the WRAD complex. This complex enhances the methyltransferase activity of KMT2C, facilitating histone tail methylation, specifically targeting H3K4 residues (Lavery2020KMT2CD). KMT2C also interacts with the BAP1 histone deubiquitinating complex, which is involved in Polycomb-mediated transcriptional repression (Fagan2019COMPASS).

KMT2C is part of the KMT2C/D COMPASS complexes, which include unique binding partners such as NCOA6/ASC2, KDM6A/UTX, PTIP, and PAGR1/PA1. These interactions are essential for the regulation of DNA promoter and enhancer elements, influencing gene expression and chromatin structure (Lavery2020KMT2CD). KMT2C also interacts with transcription factors like GRHL2, which are involved in epithelial cell phenotypes and anti-tumor immunity (Fagan2019COMPASS). Additionally, KMT2C interacts with long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to regulate gene expression, such as LncRNA SSTR5-AS1 and HOTAIR, which modulate oncogene transcription in various cancers (Jiao2024The).
