# CD93

## Overview
CD93 is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, also known as CD93, which plays a pivotal role in various physiological and pathological processes. The CD93 protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a C-type lectin-like domain, multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains, and a mucin-like region, contributing to its diverse functional capabilities (Tossetta2023Role; Orlandini2014The). As a transmembrane receptor, CD93 is integral to angiogenesis, endothelial cell function, and immune response regulation, interacting with several proteins to mediate these processes (Tossetta2023Role; Barbera2021CD93). The protein exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the latter acting as a proangiogenic factor and playing a role in inflammation (Tossetta2023Role). CD93's involvement in disease states, such as cancer and cardiovascular conditions, underscores its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Tossetta2023Role; Olsen2015CD93).

## Structure
CD93 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein composed of 652 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 68 kDa that increases to 126 kDa under reducing conditions due to extensive glycosylation (Tossetta2023Role; Orlandini2014The). The protein structure includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal signal peptide, a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) with eight conserved cysteine residues, a sushi-like domain, five epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, a mucin-like region with multiple O-linked glycosylation sites, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail with a potential tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site (Tossetta2023Role; Orlandini2014The).

The CTLD is crucial for interactions with other proteins, such as multimerin 2 (MMRN2), and plays a role in angiogenesis (Tossetta2023Role; Cicaloni2022Bioinformatics). Glycosylation is a significant post-translational modification that affects the stability and cell surface expression of CD93 (Tossetta2023Role). The protein can exist in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the soluble form acting as a proangiogenic factor (Tossetta2023Role). CD93 is also subject to metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain cleavage, which contributes to its role in inflammation and angiogenesis (Orlandini2014The; Gupta2012Family).

## Function
CD93 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, by promoting endothelial cell adhesion, migration, and cytoskeletal dynamics. CD93 interacts with proteins such as β-dystroglycan, VE-cadherin, and multimerin 2 (MMRN2) to facilitate these processes, which are crucial for vascular maturation and stability (Tossetta2023Role; Barbera2021CD93).

In addition to its role in angiogenesis, CD93 is involved in efferocytosis, the clearance of apoptotic cells, which is essential for tissue homeostasis and preventing inflammatory diseases. Soluble CD93 (sCD93) acts as an opsonin, enhancing the phagocytic activity of macrophages by binding to apoptotic cells and the phagocytic integrin subunit αxβ2 (Tossetta2023Role).

CD93 also contributes to maintaining endothelial barrier function and vascular integrity. It limits the phosphorylation and turnover of VE-cadherin, thereby preserving endothelial cell junction stability and reducing vascular permeability (Tossetta2023Role; Vemuri2024CD93). These functions highlight CD93's critical role in vascular biology and immune response regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD93 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the T/T genotype of the SNP rs2749817 is linked to disseminated cancer at diagnosis and increased recurrence rates after radical operation, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for CRC prognosis (Olsen2015CD93). CD93 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and soluble CD93 levels are lower in CRC patients, indicating a role in tumor progression (Olsen2015CD93).

In glioblastoma, CD93 is upregulated in tumor-associated blood vessels, correlating with poor survival and abnormal vasculature. Silencing CD93 reduces tumor growth, highlighting its role in tumor angiogenesis (Tossetta2023Role; Lugano2018CD93). CD93 is also implicated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where its expression correlates with poor prognosis and high tumor stages (Tossetta2023Role).

In cardiovascular diseases, SNPs such as rs2749812 and rs3746731 are linked to coronary heart disease and hypertension, with circulating soluble CD93 levels associated with cardiovascular events (Tossetta2023Role). CD93 is also involved in systemic sclerosis, where increased serum levels correlate with disease severity (Tossetta2023Role). These findings suggest CD93 as a potential therapeutic target in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
CD93, a transmembrane glycoprotein, engages in several critical interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with multimerin-2 (MMRN2), a key interaction that stabilizes CD93 by preventing its proteolytic cleavage and is essential for maintaining vascular integrity in tumors (Xu2024Structural; Lugano2018CD93). This interaction is crucial for the activation of β1 integrin, which is necessary for fibronectin fibrillogenesis and extracellular matrix deposition during tumor angiogenesis (Lugano2018CD93). The interaction between CD93 and MMRN2 is mediated by specific cysteine residues in CD93, which are essential for binding (Khan2017Multimerin2).

CD93 also interacts with β1 integrin, promoting its activation and facilitating fibronectin network formation, which is vital for endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (Lugano2018CD93). Additionally, CD93 forms a complex with β-dystroglycan, enhancing endothelial cell migration and organization into capillary-like structures (Tossetta2023Role). The interaction with IGFBP7 is another significant aspect, as it plays a role in endothelial cell angiogenesis and can be targeted for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Xu2024Structural). These interactions highlight CD93's role in modulating integrin activity and maintaining vascular integrity, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies in angiogenic diseases.
