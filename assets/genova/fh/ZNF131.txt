# ZNF131

## Overview
ZNF131 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 131, a member of the BTB/POZ protein superfamily. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and play a crucial role in gene regulation. As a transcription factor, zinc finger protein 131 is involved in modulating gene expression, particularly in the brain, testis, thymus, and central nervous system, indicating its importance in various physiological processes (Han2008Highthroughput). It functions as a repressor of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) signaling and interacts with other transcription factors, such as Kaiso, to regulate genes involved in cell cycle and tumorigenesis (Robinson2017The). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including SUMOylation, which influences its role in cellular processes and disease contexts, such as cancer and immune system disorders (Iguchi2015BTBZF; Oh2012Small).

## Structure
ZNF131 is a human gene encoding a protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are motifs that facilitate binding to DNA. These domains contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, allowing it to interact with specific DNA sequences. Zinc finger proteins, including ZNF131, often undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence their activity and interactions. 

The ZNF131 protein may exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, leading to structural and functional diversity. These isoforms can result in variations in the protein's structure, potentially affecting its DNA-binding capabilities and regulatory functions. The presence of zinc finger domains is a defining feature of ZNF131, and these domains are crucial for its role in gene regulation. 

While specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ZNF131 are not provided, the general characteristics of zinc finger proteins suggest a complex structure that supports its function in DNA binding and regulation. The structural diversity introduced by splice variants and post-translational modifications further underscores the protein's versatility in cellular processes.

## Function
ZNF131 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is part of the BTB/POZ protein superfamily, characterized by a BTB/POZ domain and multiple zinc finger structures, which are crucial for DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Trappe2002The). ZNF131 is ubiquitously expressed, with high levels in the brain, testis, thymus, and central nervous system, indicating its involvement in various physiological processes (Han2008Highthroughput).

In the nucleus, ZNF131 functions as a transcriptional regulator, modulating the expression of target genes. It acts as a repressor of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) signaling by inhibiting the binding of the E2-ERα complex to the estrogen response element, thereby affecting estrogen-regulated gene expression (Han2008Highthroughput). ZNF131 also interacts with Kaiso, another transcription factor, to co-occupy promoters of genes involved in tumorigenesis and Wnt signaling, such as Cyclin D1, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation (Robinson2017The).

The nuclear localization of ZNF131 is mediated by specific nuclear localization signals, which facilitate its transport into the nucleus, where it exerts its function as a transcription factor (Donaldson2007Nuclear). This localization is essential for its role in regulating gene expression related to development and cellular differentiation (Donaldson2007Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF131 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and immune system disorders. In breast cancer, ZNF131 acts as a negative regulator of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) signaling. Alterations in its expression or function can influence estrogen-induced cell growth, potentially serving as a tumor suppressor by counterbalancing estrogen-induced trans-activation, which is crucial in breast cancer development (Oh2013Zinc; Oh2012Small). The SUMOylation of ZNF131 enhances its inhibitory effect on estrogen signaling, suggesting a role in modulating estrogen-related cellular processes and influencing breast cancer progression (Oh2012Small).

In the immune system, ZNF131 is essential for T and B cell development. Deficiency in ZNF131 leads to impaired T cell proliferation and activation, affecting the maintenance of the peripheral T cell pool and potentially contributing to autoimmune diseases (Iguchi2015BTBZF). In B cells, ZNF131 is crucial for the transition from pro-B to pre-B cell stages, and its deficiency results in reduced proliferation and increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors, which can lead to developmental arrest and genomic instability (Iguchi2018A).

## Interactions
ZNF131 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It physically interacts with human polycomb protein 2 (hPc2), a component of polycomb nuclear bodies, in both yeast and mammalian cells. This interaction is crucial for the SUMOylation of ZNF131, as hPc2 acts as a SUMO E3 ligase, enhancing the modification of ZNF131 with SUMO1 (Oh2012Small). The interaction between ZNF131 and hPc2 is mediated by specific domains, such as the SIM1 domain of hPc2, which is essential for binding and SUMOylation activity (Oh2012Small).

ZNF131 also interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), inhibiting its homo-dimerization, which is necessary for estrogen-dependent gene expression. This interaction is facilitated by the C-terminal region of ZNF131, which is critical for its inhibitory function on estrogen signaling (Oh2013Zinc).

Additionally, ZNF131 associates with Kaiso, another POZ-ZF protein, and co-occupies promoters of genes involved in tumorigenesis and Wnt signaling, such as CCND1. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in Kaiso-mediated processes (Robinson2017The).
