# FAM228B

## Overview
FAM228B is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 228, member B. This protein is involved in various biological processes, although its precise functions remain to be fully elucidated. The FAM228B protein is not categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, but it has been implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts. Research has highlighted its potential role in mental health, infectious diseases, and cancer, suggesting that FAM228B may influence brain function and disease progression. Alterations in the expression of FAM228B have been associated with mood disorders, COVID-19, and racial disparities in endometrioid endometrial cancer, indicating its significance in diverse medical conditions (Bateman2017Race‐specific; Fiori2021Treatmentemergent; Salihoğlu2023CompCorona:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FAM228B gene have been associated with several medical conditions. In the context of mental health, changes in FAM228B expression have been observed in individuals with depression, those treated with antidepressants, and individuals who have died by suicide. This suggests a potential link between FAM228B expression and brain function, particularly in relation to mood disorders (Fiori2021Treatmentemergent; Salihoğlu2023CompCorona:).

In the realm of infectious diseases, FAM228B has been noted for its over-expression in patients with SARS-CoV-2, indicating a possible connection to brain function during acute COVID-19 (Salihoğlu2023CompCorona:).

FAM228B has also been implicated in racial disparities in endometrioid endometrial cancer. Studies have shown that FAM228B expression is associated with progression-free survival in Black patients, suggesting it may play a protective role in this demographic (Javadian2021Histopathologic; Bateman2017Race‐specific).

In familial essential tremor, a novel variant in FAM228B was identified, although it did not reach statistical significance after correction, indicating a potential but unconfirmed association with the condition (DiezFairen2021Exomewide).
