# NGB

## Overview
Neuroglobin (NGB) is a gene that encodes the neuroglobin protein, a member of the globin family primarily expressed in the brain and nervous tissues. Neuroglobin is a monomeric protein characterized by its classical 3/3 globin fold and hexacoordinated heme iron, which distinguishes it from other globins by regulating ligand affinity and facilitating interactions with small gaseous molecules such as oxygen and carbon monoxide (Vallone2004The; Ardiccioni2019Ligand). Functionally, neuroglobin is involved in neuroprotection, particularly under hypoxic conditions, by modulating apoptotic pathways and scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (Fago2008A; Fago2004Functional). Its expression is upregulated in response to stress, suggesting a role in cellular defense mechanisms (Ascenzi2014Mammalian). Neuroglobin's interactions with proteins such as cytochrome c and mitochondrial components further underscore its significance in cellular signaling and energy metabolism, highlighting its potential clinical relevance in neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic injuries (Fiocchetti2017Neuroglobin; Semenova2023Molecular).

## Structure
Neuroglobin (NGB) is a monomeric globin protein primarily expressed in the brain and nervous tissues. Its primary structure consists of a single polypeptide chain with 151 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 17,000 (Dewilde2001Biochemical). The secondary structure of NGB features a classical 3/3 globin fold, comprising eight α-helices that form a three-over-three α-helical sandwich, which accommodates the heme group (Vallone2004The; De2021Structural).

The tertiary structure of NGB includes a heme-binding domain where the heme iron is hexacoordinated by the distal histidine His64(E7) and the proximal histidine His96(F8) (Vallone2004The; Ardiccioni2019Ligand). This hexacoordination is a distinctive feature that regulates ligand affinity, as the bond between the heme iron and the distal histidine must be broken for an exogenous ligand to bind (Vallone2004Thea). NGB also contains a large internal cavity and tunnel system, which influences its function and dynamics by facilitating ligand access to the heme pocket (De2021Structural).

NGB does not typically form quaternary structures like hemoglobin. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect its function and stability (De2021Structural).

## Function
Neuroglobin (NGB) is a globin protein primarily expressed in the brain and nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in cellular protection and oxygen homeostasis. NGB is involved in reversible oxygen binding, similar to myoglobin, but its low concentration in neurons suggests functions beyond oxygen storage or transport (Hankeln2004The; Brunori2005Neuroglobin). It is characterized by a hexacoordinated heme iron, which involves both proximal and distal histidine residues, allowing it to bind small gaseous ligands like oxygen and carbon monoxide (Vallone2004The).

NGB is implicated in neuroprotection, particularly under hypoxic conditions, by potentially modulating early events in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. It achieves this through a rapid electron-transfer reaction with cytochrome c, maintaining it in a non-apoptotic state (Fago2008A). NGB also acts as a scavenger of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, protecting neurons from oxidative stress (Fago2004Functional). Its expression is upregulated in response to hypoxia and other stressors, suggesting a role in stress response mechanisms (Ascenzi2014Mammalian). NGB's presence near mitochondria further supports its involvement in cellular defense and energy metabolism (Fago2008A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NGB gene, which encodes neuroglobin, have been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases and conditions associated with oxidative stress and ischemic injury. Increased expression of neuroglobin has been observed in the cortical peri-infarct regions of stroke patients, suggesting a role in neuronal recovery post-ischemia (Li2013Neuroglobin). Conversely, low levels of neuroglobin expression in brain neurons have been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, as neuroglobin's protective mechanism involves inhibiting apoptosome formation and caspase activation, thus preventing apoptosis (Raychaudhuri2009Neuroglobin).

Neuroglobin's interaction with cytochrome c is crucial in preventing apoptosis by blocking apoptosome assembly, which is significant in conditions like Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, as well as ischemia and hypoxia (Semenova2023Molecular). In retinal neurodegeneration, neuroglobin is considered a potential therapeutic target due to its ability to ameliorate oxidative stress and apoptosis, with studies showing that manipulating its levels can affect retinal ganglion cell survival and mitochondrial function (Solar2021Neuroglobin). These findings underscore the potential clinical significance of neuroglobin in treating or managing conditions related to hypoxia, ischemia, and neurodegeneration (De2021Structural).

## Interactions
Neuroglobin (NGB) interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. One notable interaction is with cytochrome c, where NGB forms a transient complex that may protect neurons from ischemia-induced cell death. This interaction involves electrostatic forces and facilitates electron transfer, potentially inhibiting apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c from binding to apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and blocking apoptosome assembly (Bønding2008The; Semenova2023Molecular).

NGB also interacts with mitochondrial proteins, such as the subunit α of electron transfer flavoprotein and cytochrome c1, which are crucial for regulating mitochondrial activity. These interactions help suppress mitochondrial complex III activity and reduce reactive oxygen species production, offering protection against ischemic/hypoxic neurotoxicity (Fiocchetti2017Neuroglobin).

Additionally, NGB acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) by interacting with the GDP-bound Gαi subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. This interaction inhibits Gα activity, enhancing the Gβγ-dependent pathway, which promotes cell survival through phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation (Fiocchetti2017Neuroglobin). These interactions highlight NGB's role in neuroprotection and cellular signaling.
