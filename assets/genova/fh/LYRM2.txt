# LYRM2

## Overview
LYRM2 is a gene that encodes the protein LYR motif containing 2, which plays a critical role in mitochondrial function. The protein is involved in the assembly and function of mitochondrial complex I, a crucial component of the electron transport chain responsible for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production in cells. As a mitochondrial protein, LYR motif containing 2 is essential for the integration of the N-module into complex I, facilitating proper mitochondrial respiration. It interacts with NDUFAB1, a mitochondrial acyl-carrier protein, indicating its involvement in the transient assembly processes within the mitochondria. The protein's activity is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular health (Dibley2020The; Huang2019LYRM2).

## Function
LYRM2 is a crucial component in the assembly and function of mitochondrial complex I, a key part of the electron transport chain involved in oxidative phosphorylation. This protein is essential for the integration of the N-module into complex I, which is vital for proper mitochondrial respiration and energy production in cells (Dibley2020The). In LYRM2 knockout cell lines, there is a notable defect in the assembly of complex I, particularly affecting the N-module, leading to impaired mitochondrial respiration (Dibley2020The). Despite these defects, some fully assembled complex I is still present, indicating partial functionality (Dibley2020The).

LYRM2 interacts with NDUFAB1, an accessory subunit in complex I, suggesting a transient interaction during the assembly process (Dibley2020The). This interaction is mediated by a pantetheine-4Ј-phosphate (4Ј-PP) prosthetic group, which is essential for the proper assembly of complex I (Dibley2020The). The protein is active in the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix, where it plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Huang2019LYRM2). Overall, LYRM2 is integral to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular health.

## Clinical Significance
LYRM2 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function. In colorectal cancer, LYRM2 is upregulated, promoting tumor growth by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation through its interaction with mitochondrial complex I. Overexpression of LYRM2 increases complex I activity, leading to enhanced cell proliferation and larger tumor volumes, while knockdown of LYRM2 results in reduced tumor growth (Huang2019LYRM2).

In schizophrenia, LYRM2 has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. A study identified LYRM2 among 57 mitochondrial genes linked to schizophrenia, suggesting that its involvement may be related to loss of function or copy number variations rather than increased gene dosage (Hjelm2015Evidence).

LYRM2 has also been identified as a candidate gene in type 1 diabetes susceptibility. Gene expression analyses revealed that LYRM2 expression is significantly regulated by type 1 diabetes-associated SNPs, indicating a potential role in the disease's genetic predisposition (Ram2016Systematic).

While LYRM2's role in other diseases is not fully detailed, its involvement in mitochondrial complex I assembly suggests that mutations or disruptions in LYRM2 could contribute to mitochondrial-related disorders (Dibley2020The).

## Interactions
LYRM2 is involved in several key interactions within the mitochondria, particularly with components of mitochondrial complex I. It plays a crucial role in the assembly of complex I by interacting with NDUFAB1, a mitochondrial acyl-carrier protein. This interaction is essential for the integration of the N-module into complex I, facilitating the assembly of multi-subunit mitochondrial complexes (Dibley2020The). 

In LYRM2 knockout cell lines, a defect in complex I assembly was observed, characterized by the absence of the N-module. This defect was partially rescued by complementation with a Flag-tagged LYRM2, indicating a direct role in complex I assembly (Dibley2020The). LYRM2 also shows a strong interaction with NDUFAB1, suggesting a transient interaction during the assembly or integration of the N-module (Dibley2020The).

In colorectal cancer cells, LYRM2 interacts with complex I through phosphorylation by the Akt signaling pathway. This phosphorylation at serine residue 58 enhances the interaction between LYRM2 and complex I, promoting complex I activity and supporting tumor growth (Huang2019LYRM2). These interactions highlight LYRM2's role in mitochondrial bioenergetics and its potential impact on cellular metabolism.
