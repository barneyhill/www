# SIX5

## Overview
The SIX5 gene encodes the SIX homeobox 5 protein, a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in various developmental processes, including eye, muscle, and kidney development. As a member of the Six family of homeobox genes, SIX5 is characterized by a Six domain and a Six-type homeodomain, which are crucial for its function in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Pham2005Characterisation; Kawakami2000Six). The protein is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and is involved in the regulation of gene expression through interactions with other proteins, such as the Eya family, to facilitate nuclear translocation and gene activation (Ohto1999Cooperation). Mutations in SIX5 have been linked to several human diseases, including myotonic dystrophy type 1 and nonsyndromic hearing impairment, underscoring its clinical significance (Kakar2022Identification; Klesert2000Mice). Additionally, SIX5 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, through its activation of long non-coding RNAs that influence mRNA stability and protein deubiquitylation (Yuan2022SIX5activated).

## Structure
The SIX5 protein is characterized by the presence of a Six domain and a Six-type homeodomain, both essential for its function as a transcription factor. The homeodomain acts as a sequence-specific DNA binding domain, while the Six domain is necessary for forming a stable homodimer complex that enhances binding activity (Pham2005Characterisation; Kawakami2000Six). The Six4/5 subfamily, which includes SIX5, has additional C-terminal sequences containing a transactivation domain, although no activation domain has been identified specifically for SIX5 (Kawakami2000Six).

The protein's molecular weight is approximately 100 kDa, and it is primarily located in the nucleoplasm, with some presence in the cytoplasm (Pham2005Characterisation). The SIX5 protein is expressed at low levels in cells, and its detection has been facilitated by the development of monoclonal antibodies (Pham2005Characterisation).

A missense variant, c.44G>C, results in a substitution of glycine to arginine at position 15 (p.Gly15Arg) in the SIX5 protein, located in the conserved SIX5 domain. This variant may influence DNA-binding specificity and protein-protein interactions (Kakar2022Identification). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and alternative splicing can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions.

## Function
The SIX5 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including eye development, muscle function, and kidney development. In healthy human cells, SIX5 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate the expression of target genes. This regulation is essential for cellular differentiation and organogenesis (Pham2005Characterisation).

SIX5 is involved in the development of the eye, as evidenced by its expression in the lens and its association with cataract formation when deficient (Klesert2000Mice). The gene's role in muscle development is suggested by its expression in skeletal muscle and its potential targeting of muscle-specific genes (Pham2005Characterisation). Additionally, SIX5 is implicated in the regulation of the Na,K-ATPase 1 subunit gene (Atp1a1), indicating its involvement in ion transport and muscle function (Pham2005Characterisation).

In embryonic development, SIX5, along with SIX4, is important for the proliferation and differentiation of cells in the ventral body wall, contributing to proper body wall closure and preventing defects such as omphalocele (Takahashi2018Mice). These functions highlight the gene's significance in developmental processes and its potential impact on organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SIX5 gene have been implicated in several human diseases. In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a dominantly inherited disorder, SIX5 is considered a contributing factor. Mice deficient in the Six5 gene develop cataracts, suggesting that SIX5 deficiency may be a genetic mediator of cataracts in DM1. The cataracts in these mice are consistent with those observed in DM1 patients, indicating that SIX5 haploinsufficiency might contribute to this phenotype (Klesert2000Mice).

SIX5 has also been associated with nonsyndromic hearing impairment. A study identified a homozygous missense variant in the SIX5 gene linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment in a consanguineous family. This variant was classified as a variant of uncertain significance but was conserved across species, suggesting potential pathogenicity (Kakar2022Identification).

In lung adenocarcinoma, SIX5 transcriptionally activates the long noncoding RNA LINC01468, which promotes cancer progression by affecting mRNA stability and protein deubiquitylation. This interaction highlights the role of SIX5 in exacerbating malignant behaviors in lung cancer cells (Yuan2022SIX5activated).

## Interactions
SIX5 (SIX homeobox 5) is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins, notably the Eya (Eyes absent) family, to regulate gene expression. SIX5 forms complexes with Eya proteins, facilitating their nuclear translocation, which is crucial for their cooperative function in gene activation. This interaction is particularly significant in the activation of the myogenin promoter, where SIX5, in combination with Eya3, shows substantial activation, highlighting the importance of the C-terminal region of SIX5 in this process (Ohto1999Cooperation).

SIX5 can induce the nuclear translocation of Eya proteins, such as Eya3, enhancing their transactivation potential. This is evidenced by the increased nuclear presence of Eya proteins when coexpressed with SIX5, as shown in transient transfection assays (Ohto1999Cooperation). The interaction between SIX5 and Eya proteins is further supported by immunoprecipitation analyses, which demonstrate the formation of complexes between these proteins in the nucleus (Ohto1999Cooperation).

In addition to its role in muscle development, SIX5 is implicated in lung adenocarcinoma progression by activating the long non-coding RNA LINC01468. This activation promotes cancer progression through interactions with proteins like SERBP1 and USP5, affecting mRNA stability and protein deubiquitylation (Yuan2022SIX5activated).
