# KLHL15

## Overview
KLHL15 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 15, which functions as a substrate-specific adaptor in Cullin3 (CUL3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. This protein is characterized by its domain structure, including an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain, a middle BACK domain, and C-terminal Kelch motifs, which facilitate its role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Shi2019Kelchlike; Song2024Mutations). The KLHL15 protein is predominantly located in the nucleus and is involved in various cellular processes, including the DNA damage response and neuronal development, by regulating the turnover of proteins such as CtIP and doublecortin (DCX) (Song2021The; Ferretti2016Cullin3KLHL15). Mutations in the KLHL15 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including X-linked intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance in cognitive function and brain development (Song2024Mutations; Hu2015Xexome).

## Structure
The KLHL15 protein is a member of the Kelch-like family and is characterized by a specific domain structure that includes an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain, a middle BACK domain, and C-terminal Kelch motifs. The BTB domain is involved in homodimerization and binding to cullin3 (Cul3), facilitating the formation of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (Shi2019Kelchlike; Song2024Mutations). The BACK domain, although not fully characterized, is thought to position the Kelch-motif beta-propeller and its bound substrate within these complexes (Song2024Mutations). The Kelch motifs form a cone-shaped beta-propeller structure, which is crucial for substrate binding and selective interaction (Shi2019Kelchlike; Song2024Mutations).

KLHL15 is involved in targeting specific substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, playing a role in various cellular processes and signaling pathways (Song2024Mutations). The protein's interaction with substrates involves a conserved FRY tripeptide motif, which is necessary for ubiquitination (Song2021The). KLHL15 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, contributing to structural and functional diversity. The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its function.

## Function
KLHL15 is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a substrate-specific adaptor for Cullin3 (CUL3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein complex is involved in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, playing a crucial role in regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, KLHL15 is predominantly located in the nucleus, where it targets proteins such as CtIP and the B′β subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) for degradation (Oberg2012Selective; Ferretti2016Cullin3KLHL15).

KLHL15 is involved in the DNA damage response by regulating the turnover of CtIP, a protein essential for DNA-end resection during double-strand break repair. By promoting CtIP degradation, KLHL15 influences the balance between homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, two critical DNA repair pathways (Ferretti2016Cullin3KLHL15). KLHL15 also regulates neuronal development by mediating the degradation of doublecortin (DCX) proteins, which are involved in neuronal dendritogenesis (Song2021The).

The activity of KLHL15 is tissue-specific, with high expression levels in tissues such as the lung, muscle, spleen, and hematopoietic stem cells, as well as in certain cancers like leukemia (Ferretti2016Cullin3KLHL15).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KLHL15 gene have been linked to X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), a condition predominantly affecting males. These mutations can lead to severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and anomalies in cortical development (Hu2015Xexome). KLHL15 is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of specific neuronal proteins, including the B'b regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and neuronal differentiation (Song2024Mutations). Disruptions in this process due to KLHL15 mutations can result in neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and mental health issues (Song2024Mutations).

KLHL15 also targets doublecortin (DCX) and doublecortin-like kinases (DCLK1, DCLK2) for degradation, proteins that are essential for neurogenesis and neuronal migration. Mutations in these proteins are associated with lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia, conditions linked to intellectual disability and epilepsy (Song2021The). Alterations in KLHL15 expression or dosage, such as duplications, may also contribute to brain anomalies like agenesis of the corpus callosum (Schumann2016Arraybased). These findings underscore the gene's significant role in neurodevelopmental processes and its potential impact on cognitive function.

## Interactions
KLHL15 is a protein that functions as an adaptor in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, specifically interacting with the Cullin3 (Cul3) scaffold to form the Cul3-KLHL15 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is involved in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of specific substrates, including the B′β subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and the CtIP protein, which is crucial for DNA-end resection during homologous recombination (Oberg2012Selective; Ferretti2016Cullin3KLHL15).

KLHL15 selectively targets the B′β subunit of PP2A for degradation, influencing the composition and function of PP2A holoenzymes. This interaction is mediated through the Kelch domain of KLHL15 and the N terminus of B′β, with specific amino acids playing a key role in binding (Oberg2012Selective). The degradation of B′β by KLHL15 is crucial for regulating PP2A activity and substrate specificity, particularly in the brain (Oberg2012Selective).

KLHL15 also interacts with CtIP, targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation, which is essential for controlling DNA repair processes. The interaction between KLHL15 and CtIP is mediated by the C-terminal Kelch domain of KLHL15 and the FRY tripeptide sequence in CtIP (Ferretti2016Cullin3KLHL15). This interaction is critical for regulating DNA-end resection and the choice of DNA double-strand break repair pathways (Ferretti2016Cullin3KLHL15).
