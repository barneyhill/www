# MRTFA

## Overview
MRTFA, or myocardin-related transcription factor A, is a gene that encodes a transcription coactivator protein involved in the regulation of gene expression associated with cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. The MRTFA protein is categorized as a transcription coactivator and plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity of serum response factor (SRF), thereby influencing the transcription of genes critical for cell growth, migration, and differentiation. The activity of MRTFA is intricately regulated by actin dynamics, with its localization and function being dependent on the polymerization state of actin. In its inactive state, MRTFA is sequestered in the cytoplasm through interaction with G-actin, but upon actin polymerization, it translocates to the nucleus to activate SRF-mediated gene expression. This regulatory mechanism underscores MRTFA's involvement in various physiological processes, including adipogenesis, osteogenesis, and epithelial morphogenesis, as well as its implications in pathological conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, fibrosis, and metabolic disorders (Hyväri2020MyocardinRelated; Gau2018SRF’ing; Sidorenko2019Nucleoskeletal).

## Function
MRTFA (myocardin-related transcription factor A) is a transcription coactivator that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression related to cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. It interacts with serum response factor (SRF) to modulate the transcription of genes involved in cell growth, migration, and differentiation (Sidorenko2019Nucleoskeletal). MRTFA is regulated by actin dynamics, with its activity and localization influenced by the polymerization state of actin. In resting conditions, MRTFA is sequestered in the cytoplasm through interaction with G-actin, but upon actin polymerization, it translocates to the nucleus to activate SRF-mediated gene expression (Gau2018SRF’ing).

In healthy human cells, MRTFA is involved in the differentiation of various cell types, including adipose stem cells and mammary epithelial cells. It regulates the balance between adipogenesis and osteogenesis in human adipose stem cells by influencing actin polymerization and SRF activity (Hyväri2020MyocardinRelated). In mammary epithelial cells, MRTFA is crucial for normal acinar morphogenesis, affecting cell proliferation and differentiation (Seifert2017Tightly). MRTFA also plays a role in cell motility by regulating the expression of proteins that control actin polymerization and reorganization, which is essential for processes like cell migration and adhesion (Gau2018SRF’ing).

## Clinical Significance
MRTFA (myocardin-related transcription factor A) plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in regulating gene expression related to the actin cytoskeleton. Alterations in MRTFA expression or function can contribute to cardiovascular diseases, fibrosis, and metabolic disorders. In the context of vascular diseases, MRTFA is implicated in pathological vascular remodeling and atherosclerosis. Its expression is increased in injured arteries and atherosclerotic lesions, promoting vascular smooth muscle cell migration and neointima formation, which are key processes in these conditions (Jiang2015The).

MRTFA is also involved in fibrotic diseases, particularly in myocardial infarction, where it regulates myofibroblast activation and fibrosis. MRTFA deficiency leads to reduced fibrosis and myofibroblast activity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for fibrotic remodeling (Small2010MyocardinRelated).

In metabolic disorders, MRTFA influences the fate of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, affecting the balance between adipogenesis and osteogenesis. Its absence results in increased adipogenesis and osteopenia, highlighting its role in bone health and potential implications for osteoporosis (Bian2016Myocardinrelated). Additionally, MRTFA is linked to lipid accumulation in vascular smooth muscle cells, contributing to atherosclerosis (Alajbegovic2021MRTFA).

## Interactions
MRTFA (myocardin-related transcription factor A) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in gene regulation and cell migration. It forms a complex with serum response factor (SRF) to regulate the expression of genes involved in cell motility and differentiation (Zhang2007A; Gau2018SRF’ing). MRTFA also interacts with STAT3, enhancing the transactivity of certain promoters, such as Cyr-61, in breast cancer cells, which suggests a synergistic effect in promoting cell migration (Liao2014MRTFA).

MRTFA binds to YAP through a conserved PPXY motif, enhancing TEAD-YAP transcriptional activity, which is significant in cancer metastasis (Kim2016MRTF). It also interacts with SMAD3 to drive TGFβ1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Gau2018SRF’ing). The interaction with Brg1 is crucial for MRTFA to induce smooth muscle-specific gene expression, where MRTFA acts as a bridge connecting Brg1 and SRF (Zhang2007A).

MRTFA's interaction with actin is modulated by phosphorylation through Protein Kinase N (PKN), which affects its binding to actin and subsequently its transcriptional activity (Sakaguchi2019Protein). These interactions highlight MRTFA's role in coordinating transcriptional responses and cellular dynamics.
