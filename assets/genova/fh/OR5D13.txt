# OR5D13

## Overview
OR5D13 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily D member 13, which belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odorants, facilitating the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways upon binding specific molecules. Beyond their primary olfactory function, OR5D13 and similar receptors are implicated in various non-olfactory cellular processes, such as skin cell proliferation and regeneration, highlighting their broader physiological significance (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The expression patterns of OR5D13 suggest a potential involvement in maintaining epidermal homeostasis, particularly in the context of sensitive skin conditions, where its downregulation may affect skin health (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Function
OR5D13 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily known for their role in detecting odorants in the nasal epithelium, where they bind specific molecules to initiate a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR5D13, like other olfactory receptors, is involved in various cellular processes beyond olfaction, including epidermal/keratinocyte proliferation, migration, regeneration, and cytokine production (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

In the context of sensitive skin, OR5D13 and other olfactory receptor genes are downregulated, which might be linked to disturbances in epidermal homeostasis. This downregulation suggests a potential role in maintaining skin health, although it remains unclear whether the lower expression of OR5D13 is a cause or consequence of sensitive skin conditions (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The expression of OR genes, including OR5D13, is notably higher in the epidermis and stratum corneum compared to the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, indicating their significant role in the outer layers of the skin (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).
