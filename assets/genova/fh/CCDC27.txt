# CCDC27

## Overview
CCDC27 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain-containing protein 27, which is characterized by its structural motif known as the coiled-coil domain. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including its potential involvement in ubiquitin-independent proteolysis. The coiled-coil domain is a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions, which is consistent with CCDC27's interaction with components of the proteasome, such as PSMA3, under genotoxic stress conditions. Although the precise biological functions of CCDC27 remain to be fully elucidated, its association with the proteasome suggests a role in protein degradation pathways, particularly in stress responses in cancer cells (Mittenberg2018Combined). Additionally, CCDC27 has been mentioned in gene clustering analyses related to osteoporosis, indicating a potential link to bone health, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (Toti2013Gene).

## Structure


## Interactions
CCDC27, a coiled-coil domain-containing protein, has been identified to interact with PSMA3, a component of the 20S proteasome, in human multiple myeloma cells under genotoxic stress conditions induced by doxorubicin and bortezomib. This interaction was discovered using a GST pull-down approach combined with proteomics analysis. The study suggests that CCDC27, along with other proteins, may be involved in ubiquitin-independent proteolysis, as proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are potential substrates for degradation by the 20S proteasome (Mittenberg2018Combined).

While CCDC27 is mentioned in the context of gene clustering analysis related to osteoporosis, the specific physical interactions of CCDC27 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed. The focus is primarily on its association with osteoporosis through gene clustering rather than direct interaction studies (Toti2013Gene).

Overall, the interaction of CCDC27 with PSMA3 highlights its potential role in proteasome-related pathways, particularly under stress conditions in cancer cells, although further studies are needed to elucidate its broader interaction network.
