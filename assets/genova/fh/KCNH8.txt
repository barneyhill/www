# KCNH8

## Overview
KCNH8 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 8, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of potassium ion flow across cell membranes. This protein is a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, specifically subfamily H, and plays a critical role in maintaining cellular electrical excitability. It is particularly important in neurons, where it helps set the resting membrane potential and shape action potentials, thereby influencing neuronal signal transmission and muscle contraction (Ellinghaus2017Genomewide; Wisniewska2012Novel). The expression of KCNH8 is regulated by β-catenin and is notably present in thalamic neurons, contributing to neuronal excitability and various physiological processes such as neurotransmitter release and heart rate regulation (Linta2013MicroarrayBased; Wisniewska2012Novel). Alterations in KCNH8 have been linked to several medical conditions, including chronic venous disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Li2023Genomewide; Ellinghaus2017Genomewide).

## Function
KCNH8 encodes a protein that is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, specifically the subfamily H. These channels are crucial for regulating the flow of potassium ions across cell membranes, which is essential for maintaining the cell's electrical excitability. In healthy human cells, KCNH8 is involved in setting the resting membrane potential and shaping action potentials, particularly in neurons, influencing processes like signal transmission and muscle contraction (Ellinghaus2017Genomewide; Wisniewska2012Novel).

The KCNH8 gene is expressed in thalamic neurons and is regulated by β-catenin, suggesting its role in neuronal excitability. It encodes a potassium voltage-gated channel that contributes to the proper excitability of neurons by modulating ion conductance, which is crucial for propagating, inhibiting, or modifying electric signals in neurons (Wisniewska2012Novel). The protein is typically active in the cell membrane, contributing to the overall excitability and signaling in the nervous system (Linta2013MicroarrayBased).

KCNH8 channels are also involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmitter release, heart rate regulation, insulin secretion, epithelial electrolyte transport, and smooth muscle contraction (Ellinghaus2017Genomewide). These diverse functions highlight the importance of KCNH8 in maintaining normal cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
KCNH8 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in encoding a voltage-gated potassium channel. Alterations in KCNH8 expression have been associated with chronic venous disease (CVD). A genome-wide association study identified KCNH8 as a susceptibility locus for CVD, with the SNP rs727139 located within the third intron of the gene. This SNP is significantly associated with CVD and is thought to create a new donor splice site, potentially leading to the loss of several protein domains, which may affect venous dilatation and varicose vein formation (Ellinghaus2017Genomewide).

KCNH8 is also involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It plays a role in regulating neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability, and its dysfunction may contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Studies have shown motor neuron hyperexcitability in ALS, with differential expression of voltage-gated potassium channels, including KCNH8, observed in ALS motor neurons (Li2023Genomewide).

In the context of post-operative atrial fibrillation (poAF), KCNH8 has been found to be differentially expressed, suggesting a potential role in altered resting membrane potential mediated by potassium currents (Sigurdsson2017Postoperative).
