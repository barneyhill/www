# SMG9

## Overview
SMG9 is a gene that encodes the SMG9 nonsense mediated mRNA decay factor, a protein integral to the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. This pathway is crucial for the surveillance and degradation of mRNAs containing premature termination codons, thereby preventing the synthesis of potentially deleterious truncated proteins. The SMG9 protein is a component of the SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 complex, where it functions as a scaffold, facilitating interactions and modulating the kinase activity of SMG1. Structurally, SMG9 is characterized by a GTP-binding domain, although it can also bind ATP, and it forms a pseudo-symmetric heterodimer with SMG8, essential for its role in the NMD pathway. Beyond its canonical role in mRNA decay, SMG9 has been implicated in other cellular processes, including interactions with GPX4 in the ferroptosis pathway. Clinically, mutations in the SMG9 gene are linked to severe developmental disorders, and its dysregulation is associated with various pathologies, including hepatocellular carcinoma, where it acts as an oncogene (Han2021SMG9; Kueckelmann2024SMG1:SMG8:SMG9complex; Jin2021SMG9; AriasPalomo2011The).

## Structure
The SMG9 protein is a component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway and forms part of the SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 complex. Structurally, SMG9 contains a GTP-binding pocket within its G domain, although it has been observed to bind ATP in some contexts, indicating a unique nucleotide recognition capability (Langer2020Structure; Zhu2019CryoEM). The G domain of SMG9 is central to its function, with specific motifs such as the P loop, Switch I, and Switch II playing crucial roles in nucleotide binding and interaction with other proteins (Zhu2019CryoEM).

In terms of secondary structure, SMG9 features a globular fold with a mixed β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, similar to other GTPase family proteins (Li2017Structure). The tertiary structure of SMG9 involves interactions with SMG8, forming a pseudo-symmetric heterodimer, which is essential for its role in the SMG1C complex (Zhu2019CryoEM).

SMG9's quaternary structure is characterized by its integration into the SMG1C complex, where it acts as a scaffold, facilitating interactions between SMG1 and SMG8, and modulating the kinase activity of SMG1 (AriasPalomo2011The). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in the NMD pathway.

## Function
SMG9 is a critical component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, which is responsible for degrading mRNAs containing premature termination codons to prevent the production of truncated and potentially harmful proteins. In healthy human cells, SMG9 forms a complex with SMG1 and SMG8, known as the SMG1:SMG8:SMG9 complex, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the robustness of NMD (Zhu2019CryoEM; Kueckelmann2024SMG1:SMG8:SMG9complex). SMG9 is essential for the proper assembly and function of this complex, as it directly binds to SMG1 and facilitates the binding of SMG8, thereby regulating the kinase activity of SMG1 (Zhu2019CryoEM).

The SMG1:SMG8:SMG9 complex is involved in the phosphorylation of UPF1, a key step in the NMD pathway, which allows the binding and activation of other NMD factors such as SMG5, SMG7, and SMG6, leading to the degradation of faulty mRNA (Kueckelmann2024SMG1:SMG8:SMG9complex). SMG9 also plays a role in the dissociation of the NMD complex from UPF1 after phosphorylation, which is necessary for the recycling of NMD factors (Kueckelmann2024SMG1:SMG8:SMG9complex). This regulatory function of SMG9 ensures the proper execution of NMD, contributing to normal cellular function and gene expression regulation (Yamashita2009SMG8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMG9 gene are associated with several severe developmental disorders. SMG9 deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive condition, is characterized by severe global developmental delay, brain and heart malformations, facial dysmorphic features, and other abnormalities. This condition was first described in 2016 and involves homozygous truncating variants in the SMG9 gene (Lecoquierre2019Confirmation). A novel SMG9 variant, NM_019108.3:c.1177C>T, p.(Gln393*), has been identified in a patient with symptoms including cleft lip and palate, brain abnormalities, and heart defects (Lecoquierre2019Confirmation).

In zebrafish models, SMG9 deficiency leads to premature aging phenotypes, despite some improvements in heart and brain abnormalities during the larval stage. This is linked to the upregulation of genes like SMOX, which contributes to neuronal damage and aging through reactive oxygen species production (Lai2024Effect). SMG9 mutations also result in heart and brain malformation syndrome, characterized by congenital abnormalities and increased oxidative stress (Lai2024Effect).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SMG9 is upregulated and acts as an oncogene, promoting tumor progression through mechanisms involving cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Jin2021SMG9). High SMG9 expression correlates with poor prognosis, including overall survival and disease-free survival (Jin2021SMG9).

## Interactions
SMG9 is a critical component of the SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 complex, which plays a significant role in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. SMG9 interacts directly with SMG1 and SMG8, forming a heterodimer with SMG8 that is essential for regulating the kinase activity of SMG1. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal guanine nucleotide-binding domain of SMG9 and the N-terminal G-like domain of SMG8, which is crucial for inhibiting SMG1 kinase activity (Zhu2019CryoEM).

The interaction between SMG9 and SMG8 is characterized by specific helices and residues, such as Ile335 and Phe338 of SMG8 interacting with Val212 and Tyr358 of SMG9. Mutations in SMG9, like M390R and Y515R, significantly impair this interaction (Li2017Structure). SMG9 also forms extensive hydrophobic contacts with SMG1, particularly involving the HEAT-10 and HEAT-11 repeats of SMG1 (Zhu2019CryoEM).

In addition to its role in the NMD pathway, SMG9 interacts with GPX4, a key enzyme in the ferroptosis pathway, promoting its degradation in response to the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3. This interaction is independent of SMG9's role in NMD (Han2021SMG9).
