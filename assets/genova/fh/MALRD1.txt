# MALRD1

## Overview
MALRD1, also known as MAM and LDL receptor class A domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical metabolic processes, particularly bile acid signaling and lipid metabolism. The protein is characterized by the presence of multiple MAM (meprin-A5-tyrosine phosphatase μ) and LDL receptor class A domains, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and intracellular trafficking (Reue2015Diet1). Predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the small intestine and to a lesser extent in the kidney cortex, the MALRD1 protein is integral to the regulation of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19) levels, thereby influencing bile acid homeostasis and broader metabolic pathways such as glucose and cholesterol regulation (Wang2022The). Its evolutionary conservation across species underscores its biological significance (Wang2022The). The protein's involvement in intracellular compartments like the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus further supports its role in protein processing and cellular signaling (Wang2022The).

## Structure
The MALRD1 gene encodes a protein characterized by the presence of nine MAM (meprin-A5-tyrosine phosphatase μ) domains interspersed with nine LDL receptor (LDLR) class A domains. These domains are integral to the protein's function, facilitating protein-protein interactions and potentially forming disulfide bridges (Reue2015Diet1). The protein has a predicted molecular weight of 236 kDa and is highly conserved across species, including humans, mice, and other vertebrates (Wang2022The). 

The primary structure of MALRD1 is its amino acid sequence, which is conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Wang2022The). The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins with MAM and LDLR domains, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure would describe the overall 3D conformation of the protein, influenced by the arrangement of its domains. The quaternary structure, if applicable, would involve the assembly of multiple protein subunits, but specific details are not mentioned in the context.

MALRD1 is primarily expressed in the small intestine and, to a lesser extent, in the kidney cortex, with localization to the epithelial cell layer within the intestine (Wang2022The). The protein is associated with intracellular membranes, suggesting a role in vesicular trafficking (Reue2015Diet1).

## Function
MALRD1, also known as MAM and LDL receptor class A domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in bile acid signaling and lipid metabolism. The protein is primarily expressed in the epithelial cell layer of the small intestine and, to a lesser extent, in the kidney cortex (Wang2022The). MALRD1 plays a crucial role in regulating the levels of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19) in enterocytes, which are cells lining the intestine. This regulation is significant for maintaining bile acid homeostasis, a process essential for lipid metabolism and energy balance (Wang2022The).

The MALRD1 protein contains multiple MAM and LDL receptor class A domains and is active within intracellular compartments, where it interacts and co-localizes with FGF19. This interaction suggests that MALRD1 influences FGF15/19 levels at both mRNA and post-transcriptional levels, impacting the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (Wang2022The). By modulating FGF15/19, MALRD1 indirectly affects metabolic processes such as glucose homeostasis and cholesterol regulation, highlighting its role in broader metabolic pathways (Wang2022The). The protein's activity in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus further supports its involvement in protein processing and trafficking, contributing to its regulatory functions in cellular signaling (Wang2022The).

## Clinical Significance
The MALRD1 gene, also known as Diet1, plays a significant role in bile acid metabolism and has potential clinical implications. Alterations in MALRD1 expression can impact the levels of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19), which is crucial for regulating bile acid synthesis in the liver. A deficiency in MALRD1 leads to reduced ileal Fgf15 mRNA and protein levels, which can result in increased bile acid synthesis and altered cholesterol metabolism (Wang2022The). In mouse models, a null mutation in the Diet1 gene, which is synonymous with MALRD1, has been shown to confer resistance to hypercholesterolemia by enhancing cholesterol conversion to bile acids. This mutation also causes symptoms akin to bile acid diarrhea (BAD) in humans, such as elevated bile acid levels and increased gastrointestinal motility (Lee2018Diet1).

Genetic variations in the DIET1 gene, particularly a coding variant, have been associated with altered FGF19 secretion levels, suggesting that these variations may influence bile acid metabolism and contribute to conditions like primary BAD. A specific non-synonymous variant in the DIET1 coding region has been linked to BAD and FGF19 secretion levels, highlighting the potential impact of genetic variations in MALRD1 on bile acid-related disorders (Lee2018Diet1).

## Interactions
MALRD1, also known as MAM and LDL receptor class A domain containing 1, is involved in regulating bile acid signaling through its interaction with fibroblast growth factors FGF15 and FGF19. MALRD1 is primarily expressed in the small intestine and plays a crucial role in modulating the levels of FGF15/19, which are important for maintaining bile acid homeostasis. The protein interacts and co-localizes with FGF19 within an intracellular compartment, suggesting that it influences FGF15/19 levels at both mRNA and post-transcriptional levels (Wang2022The).

In the context of bile acid metabolism, MALRD1 has been shown to regulate the production of FGF15 in enterocytes. Deficiency in MALRD1 results in reduced ileal Fgf15 mRNA and protein levels, while its expression increases Fgf15 mRNA and protein secretion (Reue2015Diet1). This interaction highlights MALRD1's role in the enterohepatic circulation and its impact on bile acid synthesis and excretion.

In addition to its role in bile acid signaling, MALRD1 has been identified in the haemolymph of blister beetles, where it binds to ligands such as lipocalins and internalizes them through receptor-mediated endocytosis, suggesting a potential role in detoxification and transport processes (Fratini2021Unraveling).
