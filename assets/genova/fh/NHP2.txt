# NHP2

## Overview
NHP2 is a gene that encodes the NHP2 ribonucleoprotein, a critical component of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex. This protein is integral to the pseudouridylation and processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), playing a vital role in ribosome biogenesis and telomere maintenance. NHP2 is categorized as a ribonucleoprotein and is involved in the assembly and stability of H/ACA snoRNPs, which are essential for cellular functions such as RNA modification and telomerase activity. The protein's structure includes a conserved central domain that is crucial for its function, and it forms a core trimer with other proteins like NOP10 and dyskerin, facilitating the recognition and binding of H/ACA RNAs. Mutations in the NHP2 gene can lead to disorders such as dyskeratosis congenita, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Trahan2009Effects; Meier2005The; Benyelles2020NHP2).

## Structure
The NHP2 protein is a core component of H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) and is involved in the pseudouridylation of RNA. It is a small basic protein with a molecular weight of 17.2 kDa and shares homology with the ribosomal protein L30 and the 15.5K/NHP2L1/NHPX protein, which are involved in C/D snoRNPs and U4 spliceosomal snRNPs (Meier2005The). NHP2 does not bind to a specific RNA motif but associates non-specifically with RNA secondary structures, indicating a flexible binding capacity (Meier2005The).

The protein's structure includes a conserved central domain crucial for its function, particularly involving a hydrophobic β-strand and an invariant glycine residue at position 59. Alterations in this domain, such as the deletion of specific hydrophobic residues or substitution of the glycine, result in impaired function, highlighting the importance of these structural features (Henras2001Accumulation). NHP2 forms part of a core trimer with NOP10 and NAP57, which is essential for the assembly of H/ACA RNPs. This trimer provides specificity for H/ACA RNA recognition, independent of GAR1 (Meier2005The; Wang2004Architecture).

## Function
NHP2 is a crucial component of the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which plays a significant role in the biogenesis of ribosomes and the maintenance of telomeres in healthy human cells. It is involved in the assembly and stability of H/ACA small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs), which are essential for the pseudouridylation and processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Meier2005The; Henras2001Accumulation). NHP2, along with other core proteins such as dyskerin, NOP10, and GAR1, forms a trimer that binds to H/ACA RNAs, providing a composite RNA-binding surface necessary for RNP assembly (Trahan2009Effects; Meier2005The).

In the context of telomerase activity, NHP2 associates with the human telomerase RNA component (hTR), ensuring its stability and proper functioning. This interaction is vital for maintaining telomere length, which is crucial for cellular aging and stability (Benyelles2020NHP2; Pogačić2000Human). NHP2 is active in the nucleolus and Cajal bodies, where it contributes to the accumulation and function of H/ACA RNAs, impacting both ribosome function and telomere maintenance (Trahan2009Effects; Meier2005The). Deficiencies or mutations in NHP2 can lead to diseases such as dyskeratosis congenita, highlighting its importance in cellular function and organismal health (Benyelles2020NHP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NHP2 gene are associated with several telomere-related disorders, most notably dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HH), and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, skin abnormalities, and increased cancer risk. Patients with NHP2 mutations often exhibit very short telomeres and reduced levels of TERC, the RNA component of telomerase, which contributes to the disease's clinical manifestations (Trahan2009Effects; Vulliamy2008Mutations).

NHP2 mutations can disrupt the assembly of H/ACA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), affecting both telomerase function and ribosomal RNA biogenesis. This disruption can lead to a broader range of disorders, as seen in patients with HH and PF, where NHP2 deficiency impacts snoRNPs involved in pre-rRNA processing (Trahan2009Effects; Benyelles2020NHP2). Specific mutations, such as V126M and Y139H, impair the binding of NHP2 to NOP10, crucial for RNP assembly, leading to reduced cellular levels of hTR and short telomeres (Trahan2009Effects).

The clinical significance of NHP2 mutations extends beyond telomere maintenance, as they also affect ribosome biogenesis, potentially exacerbating the severity of associated diseases (Benyelles2020NHP2).

## Interactions
NHP2 is a component of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which is essential for the pseudouridylation of ribosomal and small nuclear RNAs. It forms a core trimer with dyskerin and NOP10, which binds specifically to H/ACA RNAs to form box H/ACA RNPs (Benyelles2020NHP2). NHP2 interacts with a broad range of RNA structures, unlike its archaeal counterpart L7Ae, which binds specifically to an RNA K-loop motif (Koo2011Structure). 

In humans, NHP2, along with NOP10, associates with human telomerase RNA (hTR) and H/ACA snoRNAs, but not with box C/D snoRNAs like U3 and U13 (Pogačić2000Human). The protein is involved in the assembly of H/ACA RNPs, and mutations in NHP2 can impair its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, affecting RNP assembly (Trahan2009Effects). 

NHP2 also interacts with other proteins such as GAR1 and SHQ1, forming various complexes during different stages of RNP assembly. These interactions are largely RNA-independent, except for the NAF1-GAR1 association (Schlotter2023Proteomic). The dynamic and transient nature of these associations highlights the complexity of NHP2's role in the biogenesis of H/ACA RNPs (Schlotter2023Proteomic).
