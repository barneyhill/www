# CSMD1

## Overview
CSMD1 (CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1) is a gene that encodes a type-I transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of the complement system, primarily acting as a complement inhibitor. The CSMD1 protein is characterized by its large extracellular region, which includes multiple CUB and complement control protein (CCP) domains, facilitating its role in protein-protein interactions and complement regulation (Escudero‐Esparza2013The; Baum2020CUB). It is predominantly expressed in neural tissues and epithelial cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining synaptic integrity by inhibiting excessive complement activity, thus preventing synaptic pruning and neural damage (Kraus2006CSMD1; Baum2020CUB). Beyond its neurological functions, CSMD1 is implicated in cancer biology, acting as a tumor suppressor with its expression levels inversely correlated with tumor progression in various cancers (Shull2013Somatic; Ermis2022The). Additionally, genetic variants of CSMD1 have been associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, underscoring its significance in both health and disease (Werren2024Biallelic; Ermis2022The).

## Structure
The CSMD1 protein is a large type-I transmembrane protein composed of 3,564 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 388 kDa (Kraus2006CSMD1; Werren2024Biallelic). Its structure includes a large extracellular region characterized by 14 N-terminal CUB domains, each separated by complement control protein (CCP) domains, followed by a tandem array of 15 CCP domains (Escudero‐Esparza2013The; Gialeli2021Complement). These domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and are typical of complement regulatory proteins (Baum2020CUB).

The CSMD1 protein features a single transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail, which contains several predicted phosphorylation sites on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, suggesting potential roles in signal transduction (Kraus2006CSMD1; Gialeli2021Complement). The protein's tertiary structure involves the overall 3D conformation crucial for its function, particularly in transmembrane integration (Werren2024Biallelic). The quaternary structure is suggested by the protein's ability to interact with other proteins, as indicated by its role in complement inhibition and potential involvement in cell signaling processes (Escudero‐Esparza2013The).

CSMD1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, and may also be subject to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and stability (Ermis2022The).

## Function
The CSMD1 gene encodes a type-I transmembrane protein that functions as a complement inhibitor, primarily in neural tissues. It is highly expressed in the central nervous system and epithelial tissues, where it plays a crucial role in regulating the classical complement pathway. CSMD1 inhibits the formation of C3 convertase, thereby preventing excessive complement deposition on cells and protecting them from complement-mediated damage (Escudero‐Esparza2013The; Kraus2006CSMD1).

In the brain, CSMD1 is predominantly expressed by neurons and is enriched at synapses. It opposes the complement cascade, a process that labels synapses for elimination by microglia, thus regulating synaptic pruning, which is essential for normal brain development. The absence of CSMD1 leads to increased complement activity, fewer synapses, and aberrant neural circuit development, highlighting its role in maintaining synaptic integrity (Baum2020CUB).

CSMD1 is also involved in the degradation of complement components C4b and C3b through factor I-mediated pathways and inhibits the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC), further underscoring its protective role against complement activation (Escudero‐Esparza2013The). The protein's expression in nerve growth cones suggests a role in axonal guidance during development (Kraus2006CSMD1).

## Clinical Significance
The CSMD1 gene is implicated in various cancers and neurological disorders due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In cancer, CSMD1 acts as a tumor suppressor and is frequently mutated, deleted, or methylated, contributing to tumorigenesis. It is underexpressed in several cancers, including breast, colorectal, and head and neck cancers, where its reduced expression is linked to poor prognosis and high tumor grade (Shull2013Somatic; Ermis2022The). In colorectal cancer, CSMD1 mutations are associated with early diagnosis and poor survival, with frequent methylation contributing to gene silencing (Shull2013Somatic). In breast cancer, CSMD1 interacts with the EGFR pathway, and its reduced expression correlates with poor outcomes (Ermis2022The).

CSMD1 is also involved in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Variants in CSMD1 are linked to schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, with lower mRNA levels associated with cognitive impairments in schizophrenia patients (Ermis2022The). Biallelic variants in CSMD1 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and cortical malformations, highlighting its role in neural development (Werren2024Biallelic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CSMD1 in both cancer and neurological conditions.

## Interactions
CSMD1 interacts with several components of the complement system, playing a role as a complement inhibitor. The CSMD1 protein, particularly its CCP 17-21 Fc fragment, binds directly to complement components C4b and C3b, which are involved in the classical and lectin pathways of the complement cascade. This interaction is dose-dependent and suggests that CSMD1 interferes with the complement system by promoting the factor I-mediated degradation of C4b and C3b, thus facilitating their breakdown into degradation products (Escudero‐Esparza2013The). CSMD1 also inhibits the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) by preventing the deposition of component C7 onto the erythrocyte membrane, and to a lesser extent, C8, but not C9 (Escudero‐Esparza2013The).

In breast cancer cells, CSMD1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This interaction has been confirmed through proximity ligation assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and ELISA, showing that CSMD1 directly binds to EGFR. The presence of CSMD1 decreases EGFR signaling by reducing its phosphorylation and promoting its degradation through the lysosomal pathway. This modulation of EGFR signaling by CSMD1 enhances the chemosensitivity of cancer cells (Gialeli2021Complement).
