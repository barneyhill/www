# STK16

## Overview
STK16 is a gene that encodes the serine/threonine kinase 16, a member of the NAK kinase family, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. The protein product of STK16 is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in maintaining Golgi structure and organization, as well as regulating actin dynamics essential for cell cycle progression and cytokinesis (Liu2017STK16). STK16 also participates in the regulation of secretory functions, particularly in hepatocytes, by interacting with proteins such as MAL2 and WDR1 to facilitate protein sorting and secretion at the trans-Golgi network (Wang2019SerineThreonine). Additionally, STK16 can translocate to the nucleus under certain conditions, where it may influence nuclear processes and participate in the TGF-β signaling pathway (Wang2019SerineThreonine). The gene's expression and activity have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including colorectal cancer, where it acts as an oncogene by stabilizing the c-MYC protein, thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Peng2024STK16).

## Structure
STK16 is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the human NAK family, characterized by a complete kinase catalytic domain, a short N-terminal domain, and a brief C-terminus (Wang2019SerineThreonine). The primary structure of STK16 includes 305 amino acids encoded by 915 nucleotides (Wang2019SerineThreonine). The kinase domain of STK16 is typical of Ser/Thr kinases but lacks certain amino acids conserved in tyrosine kinases (Wang2019SerineThreonine). 

STK16 has an atypical activation loop architecture, known as the activation segment C terminal helix, which is a distinctive feature of the NAK family (Wang2019SerineThreonine; Tanaka2022Degradation). This structure suggests that STK16 is constitutively active, as its regulation is independent of atypical activation loop phosphorylation (Wang2019SerineThreonine). 

Post-translational modifications of STK16 include myristoylation at Gly2 and palmitoylation at Cys6 and Cys8, which regulate its subcellular localization (Wang2019SerineThreonine). STK16 is also capable of autophosphorylation and phosphorylates other substrates primarily at threonine and serine residues (Wang2019SerineThreonine). The protein is myristoylated and palmitoylated, which are crucial for its function and localization (Wang2019SerineThreonine). 

The protein does not encode any regulatory domains, with only 29 out of its 305 amino acids being outside the catalytic site (LópezCoral2018A). The specific domains or prominent folds of STK16 have not been detailed in the available literature.

## Function
STK16 (serine/threonine kinase 16) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in maintaining Golgi structure and organization. STK16 regulates actin dynamics, which are essential for the integrity and function of the Golgi complex. Disruption of STK16 activity can lead to fragmented Golgi structures and impaired cell cycle progression, particularly affecting mitotic entry and cytokinesis (Liu2017STK16).

STK16 is also involved in the regulation of secretory functions, particularly in hepatocytes. It interacts with proteins such as MAL2 and WDR1 to facilitate the sorting and secretion of proteins at the trans-Golgi network. This kinase activity is vital for proper protein secretion, as evidenced by the impaired secretion of proteins like albumin and haptoglobin when STK16 is inhibited (Wang2019SerineThreonine).

In addition to its role in the Golgi, STK16 can translocate to the nucleus under certain conditions, where it may participate in nuclear processes. It is involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway and can activate gene promoters, indicating a role in cell signaling and regulation (Wang2019SerineThreonine).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STK16 gene have been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer. STK16 is significantly overexpressed in colorectal cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with advanced clinical stages and poorer overall survival times. The gene acts as an oncogene by stabilizing the c-MYC protein, a key transcription factor involved in cell proliferation, through phosphorylation at serine 452. This stabilization prevents c-MYC degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, enhancing cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Peng2024STK16).

In addition to its role in cancer, STK16 has been studied in the context of smooth muscle contractions related to male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The STK16 inhibitor, STK16-IN-1, has shown potential in inhibiting non-adrenergic contractions in prostate and bladder tissues, suggesting a role for STK16 in conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia and overactive bladder. This inhibition could improve treatment outcomes when combined with existing therapies (Li2019The).

Mutations at the Tyr198 site of STK16 significantly affect its kinase activity and localization, which are crucial for its function in cellular processes. These mutations could potentially impact its role in disease progression, although the clinical significance of these mutations is not fully addressed (Wang2019Tyr198).

## Interactions
STK16, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its cellular functions. It has been identified as a binding partner of MAL2, a protein involved in hepatic secretion pathways. This interaction was confirmed through split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid assays and is significant for the regulation of constitutive secretion in hepatic cells (In2014Serinethreonine). STK16 also interacts with actin, directly binding to it and regulating actin dynamics, which is crucial for maintaining Golgi structure and cell cycle progression (Liu2017STK16).

STK16 is part of the NAK kinase family and interacts with several other proteins, including GlcNAcK, DRG1, WDR1, and GRB2. These interactions suggest its involvement in diverse cellular processes such as the TGF-β signaling pathway, protein secretion, and Golgi assembly (Wang2019SerineThreonine). The interaction with GlcNAcK, although not a substrate of STK16, affects the phosphorylation of STK16's substrates and is significant for its function in the Golgi complex (Wang2019SerineThreonine). STK16 also interacts with synaptogyrin-2, a synapse-associated protein, suggesting a role in synaptic plasticity (Tanaka2022Degradation).
