# MAP7

## Overview
MAP7, or microtubule-associated protein 7, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the stabilization and organization of microtubules within cells. The MAP7 protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and neuronal development. It achieves these functions through its microtubule-binding domain (MTBD), which forms a long α-helix that interacts with microtubules, stabilizing their structure and facilitating the recruitment of motor proteins like kinesin-1. This interaction is vital for the transport of cellular cargo and the maintenance of cellular architecture, particularly in neurons where MAP7 contributes to axonal branch development. The gene's expression and regulation are implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where alterations in MAP7 expression can influence disease progression and patient prognosis (Yu2021Plasma; Adler2024A; Fu2016High).

## Structure
MAP7 (microtubule-associated protein 7) is characterized by its microtubule-binding domain (MTBD), which is crucial for its interaction with microtubules. The MTBD of MAP7 forms a long α-helix, approximately 130 Å in length, spanning residues R66 to E148, and binds along the protofilament of microtubules (Adler2024A). This domain is composed of 112 amino acids and is primarily α-helical in solution, with a central long α-helical segment and a short four-residue 'hinge' sequence that exhibits decreased helicity and increased flexibility (Adler2023Resonance). 

The MTBD interacts with microtubules through an extended α-helix that engages with two tubulin dimers, stabilizing the microtubule lattice via longitudinal interactions (Adler2023A). The interaction is characterized by electrostatic binding events between the charged residues of MAP7 and the negatively charged carboxy-terminal tails of tubulin (Adler2023A). 

MAP7 also contains a coiled-coil domain, which facilitates dimerization and interaction with microtubules. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate its activity. Multiple splice variants of MAP7 exist, potentially altering its functional properties. These structural features contribute to MAP7's role in stabilizing microtubules and facilitating cellular processes like cargo transport and axonal branch development.

## Function
MAP7, also known as microtubule-associated protein 7, plays a critical role in stabilizing microtubules (MTs) within cells, which is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function. It is particularly important in neurons, where it stabilizes MTs in axons and contributes to the development of axonal branches (Adler2024A). MAP7 facilitates intracellular organization and organelle trafficking by recruiting kinesin-1 to the MT lattice, which is crucial for the transport of cellular cargo and spindle segregation during cell division (Adler2024A). 

The protein's microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) forms a long α-helix that interacts with the MT lattice, stabilizing it through robust binding mechanisms that are not affected by MT-stabilizing drugs (Adler2024A). This interaction involves both rigid and flexible regions of MAP7, with the binding extending beyond a single tubulin heterodimer, which supports MT stabilization (Adler2024A). MAP7 is also involved in the growth of metaphase spindles in neural stem cells, highlighting its role in cell division and development (Adler2023A). The protein's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, particularly in areas with high microtubule dynamics, such as neuronal cells (Adler2023Resonance).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAP7 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML), high MAP7 expression is associated with adverse outcomes, including shorter overall survival and event-free survival in patients under 60 years old. This suggests that MAP7 high expression serves as an adverse prognostic biomarker in CN-AML, potentially due to its influence on gene and microRNA expression and related cell signaling pathways (Fu2016High). High MAP7 expression is linked to the up-regulation of oncogenic genes and down-regulation of tumor suppressor and immune activation pathways, contributing to leukemogenesis (Fu2016High).

In gastric cancer, MAP7 is a direct target of miR-409-3p, and its high expression is associated with larger tumor size and advanced TNM stage. The circNEK9/miR-409-3p/MAP7 axis plays a significant role in gastric cancer progression, where circNEK9 up-regulates MAP7 by sponging miR-409-3p. This interaction promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating MAP7's oncogenic role in gastric cancer (Yu2021Plasma). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MAP7 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
MAP7 (microtubule-associated protein 7) is known for its interactions with microtubules (MTs) and kinesin motor proteins, particularly kinesin-1. MAP7 binds to MTs through its microtubule-binding domain (MTBD), which is 112 amino acids long and forms a long α-helix. This interaction stabilizes MTs and facilitates kinesin-1-mediated cargo transport by enhancing the binding rate of kinesin-1 to MTs (Adler2023Resonance; Adler2023A; Chaudhary2019MAP7). MAP7's interaction with kinesin-1 is crucial for organelle transport, as it increases the number of kinesin-1 motors engaged simultaneously, leading to higher forces and enhanced processivity (Chaudhary2019MAP7).

MAP7 also interacts with the carboxy-terminal tails (CTTs) of tubulin, which are part of the MT structure. This interaction is primarily electrostatic, involving charged residues on both MAP7 and the CTTs, and contributes to the stabilization of the MAP7-MT complex (Adler2023A; Adler2024A). The binding affinity of MAP7 to the α-CTT is weaker compared to its interaction with entire MTs, with a dissociation constant of 91.3 µM (Adler2023A). These interactions are important for MAP7's role in cellular processes such as mitosis, cell migration, and polarization (Adler2024A).
