# PLA2G4C

## Overview
The PLA2G4C gene encodes the protein phospholipase A2 group IVC (cPLA2γ), a member of the phospholipase A2 enzyme family. This enzyme is characterized by its calcium-independent activity and is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, leading to the release of arachidonic acid and other fatty acids. cPLA2γ plays a crucial role in phospholipid remodeling and maintaining membrane composition, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Asai2003Human). It exhibits lysophospholipase and transacylase activities, functioning as a CoA-independent transacylase, and is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle tissues (Underwood1998A; Murakami2020Updating). The enzyme is also implicated in cellular responses to oxidative stress and is involved in interactions with proteins related to hepatitis C virus replication (Xu2012Cytosolic). Variations in the PLA2G4C gene have been associated with several diseases, including colorectal cancer, multiple system atrophy, autism spectrum disorder, and gliomas, highlighting its clinical significance (hartmann2002novel; Olsen2015Prognostic; Nakahara2023Genomewide; Liu2016The).

## Function
The PLA2G4C gene encodes the group IVC phospholipase A2 (cPLA2γ), a calcium-independent enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid and other fatty acids. This enzyme is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in phospholipid remodeling and maintaining membrane composition (Asai2003Human). cPLA2γ is also involved in the mobilization of fatty acids in phosphatidylethanolamine, contributing to the modulation of phospholipid composition in cells (Asai2003Human).

cPLA2γ exhibits lysophospholipase and transacylase activities, functioning as a CoA-independent transacylase that transfers fatty acids between phospholipids within cells (Murakami2020Updating). It is highly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle, suggesting a role in these tissues, potentially related to its calcium independence and involvement in muscle environments where calcium fluxes occur due to contractions (Underwood1998A). The enzyme's activity is linked to cellular responses to oxidative stress, where it is activated by reactive oxygen species through the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway, enhancing arachidonic acid release (Asai2003Human). This activity suggests a role in cellular signaling and stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PLA2G4C gene have been implicated in several diseases. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1549637 (T4A) in PLA2G4C is associated with a worse prognosis, particularly in stage II patients. The A allele of this SNP is linked to higher CRC-specific mortality, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker for planning adjuvant therapy (Olsen2015Prognostic).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, a genome-wide association study identified the rs2303744 SNP in PLA2G4C as a susceptibility locus for Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) in East Asian populations. This variant affects the transacylation activity of the cPLA2γ enzyme, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration through altered membrane phospholipid remodeling and α-synuclein aggregation (Nakahara2023Genomewide).

The PLA2G4C gene is also associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the Northeast Han Chinese population. The rs251684 variant shows a significant association with ASD, indicating a potential role in nervous system dysfunction and cognitive impairment (Liu2016The).

In gliomas, a novel polymorphism in PLA2G4C serves as a molecular diagnostic marker for detecting allelic loss on chromosome 19q, which is common in diffuse gliomas and linked to specific clinical features (hartmann2002novel).

## Interactions
PLA2G4C, also known as cytosolic phospholipase A2 gamma, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and assembly. PLA2G4C colocalizes with HCV proteins NS4B and NS5A, and it interacts with NS4B, facilitating the transport of HCV nonstructural proteins from replication sites to lipid droplets, which are crucial for HCV assembly (Xu2012Cytosolic). This interaction is essential for the formation of membranous webs, structures associated with HCV replication, and is dependent on the catalytic activity of PLA2G4C (Xu2012Cytosolic).

PLA2G4C also plays a role in lipid droplet formation, where it translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to lipid droplets upon oleate stimulation. This translocation is crucial for its function in membrane remodeling during HCV infection and lipid droplet formation (Su2017Requirement). The enzyme's association with membranes is integral to its function, as demonstrated by its behavior as an integral membrane protein and its requirement for a specific amino acid sequence for proper membrane association (Su2017Requirement).
