# ST18

## Overview
The ST18 gene encodes a C2H2C-type zinc finger transcription factor, which is a member of the MyT1/NZF family of zinc finger proteins. This transcription factor, also known as Neural Zinc Finger Factor-3 (NZF-3), plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression related to apoptosis and inflammation. The protein is characterized by its unique zinc finger domains, which enable it to bind DNA and modulate transcriptional activity in various cellular contexts, including fibroblasts and myeloid cells (Michalek2011Cysteine; Maruyama2020Zinc). ST18 is involved in critical cellular processes such as apoptosis, inflammation, and neuronal differentiation, and its dysregulation has been implicated in diseases like pemphigus vulgaris and Alzheimer's disease (Kim2021Genomewide; Assaf2021ST18). Through its interactions with other proteins and DNA, ST18 influences pathways that maintain cellular homeostasis and respond to environmental stimuli (Nunnelly2022St18; Yang2008The).

## Structure
The ST18 protein, also known as Neural Zinc Finger Factor-3 (NZF-3), is a member of the MyT1/NZF family of zinc finger proteins. It contains six zinc finger (ZF) domains arranged in a specific pattern, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor (Michalek2011Cysteine). These domains are characterized by a CCHHC motif, which is unusual compared to classical zinc finger domains and involves five conserved cysteine and histidine residues (Besold2015Neural). The zinc fingers of ST18 fold into a series of loops without significant alpha-helical or beta-sheet content, similar to other proteins in its family, such as NZF-1 and MyT1 (Michalek2011Cysteine).

The central domain of ST18 is necessary for its activity, and the protein acts as both an activator and repressor of gene transcription (Michalek2011Cysteine). ST18 interacts with other proteins, such as Sin3B, which recruits histone deacetylases to act as a transcriptional repressor (Michalek2011Cysteine). The protein's zinc binding domains show upwards of 100% homology with those of MyT1 and NZF-1, indicating a highly conserved structure within this family (Michalek2011Cysteine).

## Function
The ST18 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression related to apoptosis and inflammation in healthy human cells. It is a member of the NZF/MyT1 family of transcription factors, characterized by zinc finger domains, and is primarily active in the nucleus where it binds DNA to influence cellular processes (Maruyama2020Zinc). In fibroblasts, ST18 is involved in promoting apoptosis and regulating proinflammatory gene expression. It enhances the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1α, and TNF-α, and its overexpression leads to increased apoptosis (Yang2008The). ST18 is also implicated in the regulation of proapoptotic pathways, including mitochondrial signaling and the BCL2 family, while negatively modulating antiapoptotic pathways like Akt and NF-κB (Yang2008The).

In myeloid cells, ST18 acts as a negative regulator of VEGF-A expression, which is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity during inflammatory responses. It inhibits the transcription factor Sp1, thereby reducing VEGF-A production and protecting against vascular leakage and septic death (Maruyama2020Zinc). These functions highlight ST18's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in critical cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
The ST18 gene is implicated in several diseases due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a blistering autoimmune disease, genetic variations in the ST18 promoter region are linked to increased disease risk. A specific risk allele up-regulates ST18 activity, leading to overexpression in the skin, which disrupts epidermal cell-cell adhesion and increases tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) secretion by keratinocytes. This results in a more severe PV phenotype (Assaf2021ST18). The rs17315309 variant within the ST18 locus is associated with extensive disease involvement in PV patients, suggesting that genotyping for this variant could help predict patient response to TNFα-blocking treatments (Assaf2021ST18).

ST18 is also linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), where it is associated with cognitive decline and Clinical Dementia Rating scores. Alterations in ST18 expression can impact myelination, a critical process for neural signal transmission, and influence AD symptoms (Kim2021Genomewide). In fibroblasts, ST18 regulates proapoptotic and proinflammatory gene expression, and its dysregulation may contribute to conditions involving excessive apoptosis and inflammation, such as impaired wound healing in diabetic patients (Yang2008The).

## Interactions
ST18, a zinc finger transcription factor, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in gene expression. It has been shown to bind specifically to DNA sequences in the promoters of target genes, such as the TNF promoter, where it enhances transcriptional activity (Yang2008The). This interaction is crucial for its role in regulating proapoptotic and proinflammatory gene expression in fibroblasts.

ST18 also interacts with the transcription factor NF-κB, which is involved in the activation of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. This interaction suggests that ST18 may modulate inflammatory responses through NF-κB activation (Yang2008The). Additionally, ST18 has been implicated in the modulation of ERK signaling pathways, particularly in the context of pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune disease. Overexpression of ST18 in keratinocytes leads to increased ERK activity, which is associated with a loss of cell cohesion when treated with pathogenic IgG (Radeva2019ST18).

ST18's interactions extend to its role in neuronal differentiation, where it acts in conjunction with Neurog1 to influence cell identity in progenitor cells (Nunnelly2022St18). These interactions highlight ST18's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including inflammation, apoptosis, and neuronal differentiation.
