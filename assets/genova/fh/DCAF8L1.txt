# DCAF8L1

## Overview
DCAF8L1 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 8 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as an adaptor within the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and homeostasis. The protein encoded by DCAF8L1 is involved in linking specific substrates to the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This process is essential for regulating various cellular activities, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and signal transduction (Zou2016Genomewide). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, underscoring its role in maintaining cellular equilibrium. Notably, DCAF8L1 has been implicated in the pathology of hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression is significantly elevated, suggesting a role in tumor progression and aggressiveness (Wu2024m1A). This highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer research.

## Structure


## Function
DCAF8L1 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 8 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for regulating protein degradation. This protein functions as an adaptor, linking specific substrates to the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, thereby facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. This process is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell, influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and signal transduction (Zou2016Genomewide).

DCAF8L1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular and organismal health by ensuring proper protein turnover and function. The protein's role in these cellular compartments underscores its importance in maintaining the balance of protein synthesis and degradation, which is vital for normal cellular function and response to environmental changes (Zou2016Genomewide).

In the context of cancer, DCAF8L1 has been identified as significantly increased in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, suggesting a potential role in tumor aggressiveness and progression. This highlights its involvement in pathological conditions, although its precise function in healthy cells remains focused on maintaining cellular homeostasis (Wu2024m1A).

## Clinical Significance
DCAF8L1 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have shown that the expression of DCAF8L1 is significantly increased in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. This elevated expression is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poorer overall survival rates in patients, suggesting that DCAF8L1 plays a crucial role in the malignant phenotype of HCC. It is part of a prognostic model based on m1A RNA methylation patterns, which are correlated with autophagy, indicating its potential as a biomarker for predicting patient outcomes in HCC (Wu2024m1A).

The gene's expression is regulated by m1A modification, with a negative correlation observed between m1A levels and DCAF8L1 expression. Experimental manipulation of ALKBH3, a demethylase, affects DCAF8L1 expression, further supporting its regulation by m1A modification (Wu2024m1A). Additionally, DCAF8L1 is among the genes closely related to poor prognosis in HCC, highlighting its potential involvement in the disease's progression (Ding2020Discovery). These findings suggest that DCAF8L1 could be a valuable target for therapeutic strategies in HCC.
