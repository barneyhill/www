# GOLT1A

## Overview
GOLT1A (Golgi Transport 1A) is a gene that encodes the GOLT1A protein, a transmembrane protein involved in the transport processes within the Golgi apparatus. This protein is crucial for vesicular trafficking, particularly in the modulation of the ER-to-Golgi transport network, which is essential for maintaining cellular function and homeostasis. GOLT1A is evolutionarily conserved and characterized by four putative transmembrane domains, with its yeast homolog, Got1p, localized in the Golgi apparatus. The protein's role extends to influencing membrane properties and modulating vesicle formation, which is vital for various cellular processes, including stress response and apoptosis. GOLT1A's interactions within the cell, particularly with proteins like YIPF5 and GOT1B, suggest its involvement in ER export processes and ER stress pathways, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and pathological conditions such as cancer (Cramer2023A; Ikeda2015miR378a3p).

## Function
GOLT1A (Golgi Transport 1A) is a protein involved in the transport processes within the Golgi apparatus, an essential organelle responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids. The GOLT1A protein plays a critical role in vesicular trafficking, ensuring the proper delivery of cellular components, which is vital for maintaining cellular function and homeostasis. It is implicated in the modulation of the ER-to-Golgi transport network, particularly in the context of cancer cells, where it may interfere with the normal cargo recognition functions of COPII vesicles. These vesicles are responsible for transporting proteins from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (Ikeda2015miR378a3p).

GOLT1A is described as an evolutionarily conserved protein with four putative transmembrane domains, and its yeast homolog, Got1p, is localized in the Golgi apparatus (Ikeda2015miR378a3p). The protein's involvement in the ER-to-Golgi network suggests it may influence membrane properties and modulate vesicle formation, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including stress response, apoptosis, and the mitotic checkpoint in cancer cells (Ikeda2015miR378a3p).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GOLT1A gene have been implicated in various cancer-related conditions. In breast cancer, GOLT1A is associated with tamoxifen resistance. The downregulation of miR-378a-3p, which targets GOLT1A, is linked to endocrine therapy resistance. Overexpression of GOLT1A correlates with poor relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients, suggesting its role in the malignant progression and development of tamoxifen resistance (Ikeda2015miR378a3p).

In adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), a GOLT1A-KISS1 gene fusion has been identified, which is associated with high metastatic potential. This fusion introduces upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that suppress the translation of the metastasis suppressor KISS1, despite high mRNA levels. The presence of this fusion in highly metastatic ACC cell lines suggests its role in promoting metastasis (Zhang2020GOLT1AKISS1).

GOLT1A is also upregulated in gastrointestinal goblet cell adenocarcinomas (GCA), distinguishing it from colorectal adenocarcinomas. This upregulation is part of a distinct transcriptional profile that may aid in the diagnosis of GCA (Lin2021Gastrointestinal).

## Interactions
GOLT1A, encoding the protein GOT1A, is involved in several interactions within the cell, particularly in the context of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. GOT1A is part of a complex with YIPF5 and GOT1B, which plays a role in ER export processes. This complex is implicated in a transcription-independent function of ATF6, a key regulator of ER stress responses. The interaction between GOT1A and ATF6 suggests that GOT1A may modulate ATF6's recruitment to genomic sites, thereby influencing ER stress pathways (Cramer2023A).

GOT1A and GOT1B, both small polytopic membrane proteins, localize to the ER, ERGIC, and early Golgi, and interact with each other and YIPF5. These interactions are not part of the core ER-export machinery but may act as molecular mediators linking secretion and ER stress (Cramer2023A). The GOT1A/B/YIPF5 complex is suggested to be involved in a feedback mechanism regulating ER export, potentially acting as a quality control system within the ER (Cramer2023A).

In breast cancer cells, GOLT1A is targeted by miR-378a-3p, a tumor-suppressive miRNA. This interaction affects tamoxifen sensitivity, with GOLT1A expression being associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients (Ikeda2015miR378a3p).
