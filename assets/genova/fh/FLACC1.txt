# FLACC1

## Overview
FLACC1 is a gene that encodes the protein flagellum associated containing coiled-coil domains 1, which is involved in cellular processes related to the structure and function of flagella. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in the assembly or stability of flagellar components. While the precise biological functions of the FLACC1 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its genetic variations have been implicated in several health conditions, including cardiac autonomic neuropathy and Parkinson's Disease, indicating its potential significance in human health and disease (Pfaff2020Reference; Bekenova2024Genetic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The FLACC1 gene has been associated with cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN), a complication of diabetes mellitus that affects cardiac innervation and increases morbidity and mortality risks. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the FLACC1 gene, rs13016963, has been linked to an increased risk of developing CAN. In a study focusing on the Kazakh population, the AA genotype of this polymorphism was found to increase the risk of CAN by more than two times under a codominant model, and nearly two times under a dominant model. The additive model indicated that each additional risk allele increased the likelihood of developing CAN by 1.5 times (Bekenova2024Genetic).

Alterations in the expression of FLACC1 have also been observed in the context of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Differential expression of FLACC1 was noted in individuals with different genotypes of SVA insertion polymorphisms, which are associated with PD progression. This suggests that changes in FLACC1 expression may be relevant to understanding genetic factors involved in PD, although a direct link to specific diseases beyond these associations has not been established (Pfaff2020Reference; Pfaff2021Reference).
