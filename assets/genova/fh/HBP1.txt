# HBP1

## Overview
HBP1, or HMG-box transcription factor 1, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of cell cycle and differentiation processes. The protein product of HBP1 is a member of the high mobility group (HMG) proteins, characterized by its HMG-box domain, which facilitates DNA binding and chromatin remodeling. HBP1 functions as a transcriptional regulator, acting as both an enhancer and repressor of gene expression, and is implicated in the modulation of key signaling pathways, including the WNT/β-catenin pathway. It plays a critical role in cell cycle inhibition by repressing oncogenes and inducing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, thereby functioning as a tumor suppressor. HBP1's interactions with proteins such as the retinoblastoma protein (RB) and its involvement in chromatin dynamics underscore its significance in cellular differentiation and cancer biology (Lin2001Cloning; Yee2004The; Bollaert2019The).

## Structure
The HBP1 protein is a member of the high mobility group (HMG) proteins and contains a characteristic HMG-box domain, which is crucial for DNA binding. This domain is located between amino acids 431 and 500 and shows complete homology with the rat HBP1 protein, indicating similar DNA binding capabilities (Lin2001Cloning; Zhuma1999Human). The protein is 514 amino acids long and includes two nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs, 435-KRPMNAFMLFAKKYRVE-451 and 503-KRKR-506, which facilitate its transport into the nucleus (Lin2001Cloning).

HBP1 also contains two pocket protein-binding sequences: an LXCXE site at amino acids 35 to 39 and an IXCXE site at amino acids 323 to 327, suggesting potential interactions with proteins such as Rb and p130 (Lin2001Cloning). A 28 amino acid sequence between amino acids 93 and 120 shows 86% homology with an activation domain identified in the rat HBP1 gene (Lin2001Cloning).

The protein is involved in chromatin remodeling and may act as an enhancer or repressor of gene expression. It is also implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and differentiation, with potential roles as both an oncogene and tumor suppressor (Lin2001Cloning; Štros2007The).

## Function
HBP1 (HMG-box transcription factor 1) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and differentiation in healthy human cells. It acts as a cell cycle inhibitor by preventing the transition from the G1 to the S phase, primarily through the repression of genes like N-Myc and c-Myc, and by inducing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as CDKN2A (p16 INK4A) and CDKN1A (p21 CIP1) (Bollaert2019The). HBP1 is involved in chromatin remodeling, affecting gene transcription by repressing DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and EZH2, leading to global DNA hypomethylation and reduced histone methylation (Bollaert2019The).

HBP1 also interacts with the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, inhibiting it by binding to TCF4 and preventing the activation of WNT target genes, which include c-Myc and cyclin D1 (Bollaert2019The). In terms of differentiation, HBP1 expression increases during the differentiation of myogenic and preadipocyte cells and is linked to the differentiation of several cell lines (Bollaert2019The). It positively regulates the transcription of histone H1 0, associated with terminal differentiation, and induces the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in myeloid cells (Bollaert2019The). HBP1's role in cell cycle arrest and senescence supports its function as a tumor suppressor (Bollaert2019The).

## Clinical Significance
HBP1 (HMG-box transcription factor 1) plays a significant role in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cervical cancer, methylation of HBP1 by PRMT1 at R378 promotes tumor progression by facilitating actin cytoskeleton remodeling, enhancing glycolysis, and providing energy for tumor growth and metastasis. This methylation diminishes HBP1's stability and reduces its ability to repress metastasis and tumorigenesis by downregulating GSN expression (Wang2022Methylation).

In breast cancer, reduced HBP1 expression is linked to increased tumorigenesis and invasiveness, correlating with poor prognosis and relapse-free survival. High WIP1 expression alongside low HBP1 levels is associated with poor outcomes (Zhang2006The). HBP1 also acts as a tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma, where its overexpression leads to increased apoptosis and reduced tumor aggressiveness. Lower HBP1 expression is associated with more aggressive tumors and poorer survival outcomes (Claeys2018ALK).

HBP1 is involved in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway, and its loss-of-function mutations may lead to constitutive Wnt signaling and cancer. Alterations in HBP1 expression can impact cancer progression by modulating reactive oxygen species levels and signaling pathways (Yee2004The). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, HBP1 mediates the anticancer effects of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, with its expression linked to the drug's efficacy (Chan2020Regulatory).

## Interactions
HBP1 (HMG-box transcription factor 1) is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation. HBP1 specifically interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (RB) and p130, but not with p107, indicating a selective binding affinity within the RB protein family (Yee2004The; Shih1998Regulation). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the G1 phase of the cell cycle and differentiation processes (Yee2004The).

HBP1 also cooperates with RB to activate the histone H1 0 gene promoter, with their interaction being essential for this activation. The presence of RB enhances HBP1's binding to the H1 0 H4 box, suggesting that RB facilitates or stabilizes HBP1's binding to its target sequence (Lemercier2000Involvement). This interaction is further supported by gel shift assays, which demonstrate that RB can enhance the DNA-binding activity of HBP1 (Lemercier2000Involvement).

In muscle cell differentiation, HBP1 inhibits MyoD family transcriptional activation, a process dependent on its ability to bind to RB and p130 (Shih1998Regulation). The interaction between HBP1 and RB is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation techniques, indicating a functional connection in terminal differentiation (Shih1998Regulation).
