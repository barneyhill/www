# PRXL2A

## Overview
PRXL2A is a gene that encodes the protein peroxiredoxin like 2A, which plays a crucial role in cellular redox regulation. This protein is categorized as an antioxidant and is involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress by reducing peroxides. It contains a PRX-like domain and a CXXC domain at the N-terminal, which are essential for its function in thioredoxin activation (Chen2019miR125b). Peroxiredoxin like 2A is active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein's interaction with the platelet-activating factor receptor (PTAFR) highlights its role in metabolic regulation, particularly in suppressing hepatic lipogenesis (Wang2024Adipose). Additionally, PRXL2A is involved in physiological adaptations to environmental stressors, such as high-altitude adaptation in human populations (Chen2019miR125b). Its dysregulation has been linked to the progression of certain cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma, where it contributes to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance (Chen2019miR125b).

## Structure


## Function
PRXL2A, also known as peroxiredoxin like 2A, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular redox regulation. This protein functions as an antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress by reducing peroxides. It exhibits dual activities due to its PRX-like domain and an essential CXXC domain at the N-terminal, which allows for thioredoxin (TRX) activation (Chen2019miR125b). PRXL2A is active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in signaling pathways, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

In healthy human cells, PRXL2A is involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress, a critical function for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is activated in monocytes stimulated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and modulates osteoclast differentiation, indicating its role in bone metabolism (Chen2019miR125b). PRXL2A is also one of the antioxidants involved in high-altitude adaptation in human populations living in the Andes, suggesting its importance in physiological adaptation to environmental stressors (Chen2019miR125b).

While the context primarily focuses on the role of PRXL2A in cancerous cells, its function in healthy cells is centered around its antioxidant properties and involvement in cellular signaling and stress response pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PRXL2A gene, also known as FAM213A, have been implicated in the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). PRXL2A is upregulated in OSCC tumors, which is associated with a worse prognosis for patients. This upregulation helps tumor cells resist oxidative stress, contributing to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance (Chen2019miR125b). The gene acts as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulator, decreasing oxidative stress markers and intracellular ROS levels, which enhances oncogenic characteristics such as proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation in cancer cells (Chen2019miR125b).

The microRNA miR-125b is identified as an upstream regulator of PRXL2A. Downregulation of miR-125b in OSCC leads to increased PRXL2A expression, which is linked to worse overall survival, particularly in patients with nodal involvement (Chen2019miR125b). miR-125b acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of PRXL2A, leading to reduced expression of PRXL2A and decreased oncogenic potential in OSCC cells (Chen2019miR125b). The miR-125b-PRXL2A axis, with nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) as a downstream effector, is implicated in OSCC pathogenesis, highlighting the potential of targeting this pathway in cancer therapy (Chen2019miR125b).

## Interactions
PRXL2A, also known as peroxiredoxin like 2A, is a protein that interacts with the platelet-activating factor receptor (PTAFR) to suppress hepatic lipogenesis. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of lipid metabolism and involves high-affinity binding between PRXL2A and PTAFR, as demonstrated through binding assays such as pulldown assays and microscale thermophoresis (Wang2024Adipose). The binding of PRXL2A to PTAFR induces calcium mobilization, which activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to the suppression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-controlled hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) (Wang2024Adipose).

Mutational analysis has identified specific residues in PTAFR that are critical for PRXL2A binding, highlighting the specificity of this interaction (Wang2024Adipose). The interaction between PRXL2A and PTAFR also involves GNAQ, a GÎ±q protein, which is essential for the downstream signaling events that reduce the expression of the fatty acid synthesis gene Acc1 (Wang2024Adipose). This signaling axis is distinct from the PAF-PTAFR axis, which is primarily involved in inflammatory responses (Wang2024Adipose). These interactions underscore the role of PRXL2A in metabolic regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target for diseases associated with hepatic lipid accumulation.
