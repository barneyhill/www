# C10orf53

## Overview
C10orf53 is a gene located on chromosome 10 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 10 open reading frame 53. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. The protein is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein, and current research is focused on understanding its role in cellular pathways and potential implications in human health and disease. Studies have suggested that C10orf53 may interact with other proteins and participate in regulatory networks, highlighting its potential significance in cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is necessary to clarify the biological functions and clinical relevance of C10orf53.
