# WDR73

## Overview
The WDR73 gene encodes the WD repeat domain 73 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, a structural motif involved in protein-protein interactions. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, microtubule organization, and cell adhesion. The WD repeat domain 73 protein is particularly significant in maintaining spindle orientation during mitosis and is involved in the regulation of focal adhesion and extracellular matrix pathways, which are crucial for cell adhesion and migration (Li2022WDR73; Colin2014LossofFunction). Mutations in the WDR73 gene are linked to severe clinical conditions such as Galloway-Mowat syndrome, characterized by neurological and renal abnormalities, underscoring the gene's importance in neurodevelopment and renal function (Colin2014LossofFunction; Vodopiutz2015WDR73Mutations).

## Structure
The WDR73 protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which are motifs of approximately 40-60 amino acids typically ending with Trp-Asp (WD) (Colin2014LossofFunction). These repeats fold into a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet blade, and multiple blades assemble into a domain known as a beta-propeller. WDR73 is predicted to contain six WD40 repeats, forming an incomplete six-bladed propeller structure (Colin2014LossofFunction). This structure is hypothesized to require interaction with another protein to form a complete seven-bladed propeller, similar to other proteins like Seh1 and Sec (Colin2014LossofFunction).

The protein's tertiary structure is crucial for its function in cell signaling networks, as the WD40 domains serve as platforms for protein assembly (Colin2014LossofFunction). Mutations in WDR73, such as p.Tyr43* and p.Arg256Profs*18, can truncate the protein or alter the number of WD40 repeats, impacting its structural integrity and function (Colin2014LossofFunction). WDR73 is involved in microtubule regulation and localizes to spindle poles and microtubule asters during mitosis, indicating its role in cell cycle processes (Colin2014LossofFunction).

## Function
The WDR73 gene encodes a WD40-repeat-containing protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, cell adhesion, and microtubule organization. In healthy human cells, WDR73 is involved in maintaining proper spindle orientation and polarity during mitosis, which is essential for accurate cell division (Li2022WDR73). The protein localizes to spindle poles and microtubule asters during mitosis, indicating its involvement in microtubule dynamics and organization (Colin2014LossofFunction).

WDR73 is also implicated in the regulation of focal adhesion (FA) and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related pathways, which are critical for cell adhesion and spreading. It interacts with PIP4K2C, a kinase involved in actin cytoskeleton restructuring, thereby influencing FA formation and cell migration (Li2022WDR73). The protein's role in these processes is particularly significant in podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney, where it helps maintain cellular architecture and function (Colin2014LossofFunction).

In addition to its structural roles, WDR73 is involved in the regulation of the G1/S transition in the cell cycle, influencing the expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, which are crucial for cell cycle progression (Tilley2021Disruption). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing aberrant cell cycle re-entry, particularly in differentiated cells like neurons and podocytes (Tilley2021Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR73 gene are associated with several severe conditions, most notably Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GMS), a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by microcephaly and nephrotic syndrome. These mutations can lead to a range of neurological and renal abnormalities, including cerebellar atrophy, intellectual disability, and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (Colin2014LossofFunction). The gene encodes a protein with WD40 repeats, which are crucial for protein complex assembly and cell-signaling networks. Mutations in WDR73 can disrupt these processes, leading to significant clinical manifestations (Colin2014LossofFunction).

WDR73 mutations have also been linked to infantile neurodegeneration and variable glomerular kidney disease. Patients with these mutations often present with cerebellar ataxia, dystonia, intellectual disability, and visual impairments, with the severity of kidney disease varying among individuals (Vodopiutz2015WDR73Mutations). The mutations can result in structural changes to the WDR73 protein, affecting its function and leading to the observed clinical phenotypes (Vodopiutz2015WDR73Mutations).

In addition to GMS, WDR73 mutations are implicated in cerebellar hypoplasia and severe intellectual disability, with potential variable phenotypes including microcephaly and nephrotic syndrome (Jiang2017WDR73). These findings highlight the gene's critical role in neurodevelopment and renal function.

## Interactions
WDR73 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with components of the Integrator complex, specifically INTS9 and INTS11, as demonstrated by proteomic analysis and confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments in podocytes and HEK293T cells (Tilley2021Disruption). These interactions suggest that WDR73 may localize to the same cellular compartments as the Integrator complex, which is involved in RNA processing and transcriptional regulation (Tilley2021Disruption).

WDR73 also interacts with PIP4K2C, a kinase involved in the generation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is crucial for actin cytoskeleton restructuring and focal adhesion formation. This interaction was confirmed using GST pulldown assays, and WDR73 depletion was shown to reduce PIP4K2C and PIP4K2A protein levels, affecting PIP2 production and focal adhesion formation (Li2022WDR73). The interaction with PIP4K2C highlights WDR73's role in cell adhesion and spreading, as well as its potential involvement in kidney disease pathways (Li2022WDR73).

These interactions underscore WDR73's involvement in critical cellular functions, including cell division, adhesion, and transcriptional regulation, and its potential implications in diseases such as Galloway-Mowat syndrome.
