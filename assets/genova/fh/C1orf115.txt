# C1orf115

## Overview
C1orf115, or chromosome 1 open reading frame 115, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. The protein encoded by C1orf115, also referred to as Required for Drug-induced Death 1 (RDD1), has been studied for its role in modulating drug response and survival outcomes in cancer patients. It is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but its expression levels have been linked to prognostic implications in several cancer types, including colorectal cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and grade III gliomas. The gene's involvement in multi-drug resistance and its potential as a biomarker for chemotherapy response highlight its significance in personalized medicine and cancer treatment strategies (Dai2017Integrated; Lau2020Systematic; Zuo2021A; Lian2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
C1orf115, also known as Required for Drug-induced Death 1 (RDD1), has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In colorectal cancer (CRC), low expression of C1orf115 is associated with poorer survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Lian2020Identification). Similarly, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), C1orf115 is significantly associated with prognosis, indicating its role in disease progression (Zuo2021A).

In the context of multi-drug resistance, C1orf115 has been identified as a significant gene, where its loss confers resistance to multiple anti-cancer drugs. This resistance is observed in both in vitro studies and in vivo models, highlighting its importance in chemotherapy response (Lau2020Systematic). The gene's expression levels could serve as a biomarker for predicting patient response to chemotherapy, making it a potential target for personalized cancer therapies.

In grade III gliomas, C1orf115 is associated with clinical survival rates, with its upregulation linked to increased survival, suggesting a protective role in this type of brain tumor (Dai2017Integrated). These findings underscore the gene's potential clinical significance across different cancer types.
