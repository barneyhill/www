# RNF135

## Overview
RNF135, also known as Riplet or REUL, is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 135, a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family. This protein is characterized by its RING finger domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for its ubiquitination activity. RNF135 plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response by modulating the RIG-I pathway, a critical component in antiviral defense mechanisms. It achieves this by promoting the polyubiquitination of RIG-I, thereby enhancing interferon production. Beyond its immunological functions, RNF135 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, such as glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, mutations and altered expression of RNF135 are associated with clinical conditions like neurofibromatosis type 1 microdeletion syndrome and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Oshiumi2013A; Wang2022RNF135; Gu2024Ubiquitination).

## Structure
RNF135, also known as Riplet or REUL, is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes several functional domains. The protein comprises an N-terminal RING finger domain, which is a type of zinc finger domain involved in mediating protein-protein interactions, crucial for its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Zhang2019Backbone). This domain is followed by two coiled coil domains, which are typically involved in facilitating protein dimerization or oligomerization, contributing to the protein's structural stability and function.

The C-terminal region of RNF135 contains the PRY-SPRY/B30.2 domain, which is essential for its biological functions, including its involvement in innate immunity and cell proliferation. This domain is particularly important for the interaction with RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene-I), promoting antiviral signaling through ubiquitination (Zhang2019Backbone). Although the gross structure of RNF135 is not altered by the R286H mutation associated with Macrocephaly, macrosomia, facial dysmorphism (MMFD) syndrome, this mutation may impact protein-protein interactions (Zhang2019Backbone).

The structural basis for RNF135's interactions remains largely unknown, as no crystal or NMR structure of the full-length protein or its PRY-SPRY domain has been reported, highlighting the need for further structural and functional characterization (Zhang2019Backbone).

## Function
RNF135, also known as Riplet, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by regulating the RIG-I pathway. RIG-I is a cytoplasmic sensor that detects viral RNA and initiates the production of type I interferons, essential for antiviral defense. RNF135 facilitates the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, which is necessary for the release of RIG-I's autorepression, allowing it to interact with other signaling molecules such as TRIM25 and TBK1. This interaction is vital for the downstream signaling that leads to interferon production (Oshiumi2013A).

In addition to its role in immune responses, RNF135 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. It has been implicated in the regulation of glioblastoma cell proliferation and the inhibition of tongue cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Zhang2019Backbone). RNF135 is also associated with the degradation of the p21 protein, influencing cell cycle regulation in glioblastoma cells (Gu2024Ubiquitination). Despite its significant roles, the full-length structure of RNF135 and the structural basis for its interactions with RIG-I and other proteins remain largely unknown (Zhang2019Backbone).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RNF135 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In lung adenocarcinoma, RNF135 is highly expressed and promotes cell proliferation and autophagy, contributing to cancer progression by enhancing the phosphorylation of ULK1 (Zhuang2024RNF135). In glioblastoma, RNF135 is upregulated, promoting cell growth and colony formation, which is associated with poorer overall survival in patients (Gu2024Ubiquitination).

In neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) microdeletion syndrome, RNF135 haploinsufficiency is linked to overgrowth and dysmorphic facial features. The formation of a chimeric gene involving RNF135 and SUZ12 in these patients may lead to a toxic gain of function, affecting the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and contributing to the clinical phenotype (Ferrari2017Identification; Tritto2023Deregulated). RNF135 haploinsufficiency is also associated with an increased risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) in NF1 patients (KehrerSawatzki2017Emerging).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RNF135 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with increased cell migration and poorer clinical outcomes (Wang2022RNF135). The methylation status of RNF135 is a significant prognostic factor in HCC, correlating with immune cell infiltration and patient survival (Wang2022RNF135).

## Interactions
RNF135, also known as Riplet, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play crucial roles in various biological processes. One of the primary interactions of RNF135 is with RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene-I), a key player in the innate immune response. RNF135 interacts with RIG-I through its PRY-SPRY domain, facilitating Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, which enhances antiviral signaling (Zhang2019Backbone). This interaction is essential for the activation of the IFN1 promoter, promoting interferon expression and contributing to the antiviral response (Lai2019RNF135).

In the context of cancer, RNF135 has been shown to interact with p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. RNF135 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of p21, primarily at the K163 site, promoting the proliferation of glioblastoma cells (Gu2024Ubiquitination). This interaction suggests a mechanism by which RNF135 influences cell cycle regulation and tumor progression.

RNF135 also interacts with ULK1, a protein involved in autophagy, in lung adenocarcinoma. This interaction enhances ULK1 phosphorylation, promoting autophagy and cell proliferation (Zhuang2024RNF135). These interactions highlight RNF135's role in modulating immune responses and cancer progression through its involvement in ubiquitination processes.
