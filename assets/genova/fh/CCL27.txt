# CCL27

## Overview
CCL27 is a gene that encodes the protein C-C motif chemokine ligand 27, a member of the CC chemokine family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in skin-specific immune responses. CCL27 is predominantly expressed in the skin, where it is produced by keratinocytes and is involved in the recruitment of T cells to the skin by binding to the CCR10 receptor. This interaction is crucial for maintaining skin homeostasis and mediating inflammatory responses. The protein's structure includes a unique C-terminal region that contributes to its function and ability to form oligomers, which are important for its biological activity (LopesMarques2019Convergent; Miller2017Chemokines). CCL27 is also expressed in the central nervous system, where it exists in alternatively spliced forms, including a non-secreted variant that targets the nucleus (Blatt2017The). The gene's expression is modulated by various cytokines, highlighting its role in both normal immune function and pathological conditions such as inflammatory skin diseases and cancer (Homey2000Cutting; Pivarcsi2007Tumor).

## Structure
The CCL27 protein is a chemokine involved in skin-specific immune responses. Its molecular structure includes a conserved quaternary structure characterized by a disordered N-terminal region, a 310-helix, three antiparallel β-strands, a C-terminal α-helix, and a disordered stretch of positive residues. The C-terminal region, particularly the disordered region, is unique to CCL27 and plays a role in nuclear import (LopesMarques2019Convergent). 

CCL27 can form higher-order oligomers, similar to other CC-type chemokines like CCL5, although it does not form tetramers. These oligomers are important for its function and are influenced by the amino acid composition and conformation of inter-subunit interfaces (Miller2017Chemokines). 

The protein is produced by keratinocytes in the skin and is involved in mediating the adhesion and homing of skin-infiltrating T cells by binding to the CCR10 receptor (LopesMarques2019Convergent). CCL27 is also expressed in the central nervous system in the form of two alternatively spliced RNA forms, including PESKY, a non-secreted form targeting the nucleus (Blatt2017The). These structural features and splice variants contribute to its diverse roles in immune responses.

## Function
CCL27, also known as cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK), is a chemokine predominantly expressed in the skin, particularly in the epidermis. It plays a crucial role in the immune system by recruiting skin-homing memory T cells, specifically CLA+ T cells, to the skin. This recruitment is essential for immune surveillance and response in cutaneous tissues (Morales1999CTACK).

CCL27 binds to the chemokine receptor CCR10, which is expressed on various cell types, including T cells, melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and dermal microvascular endothelial cells. This interaction induces a chemotactic response, facilitating the migration of T cells to the skin, thereby contributing to skin homeostasis and potentially playing a role in inflammatory responses (Homey2000Cutting).

The expression of CCL27 is upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α, indicating its involvement in inflammatory processes. Conversely, its expression is downregulated by IL-10, suggesting a regulatory mechanism in immune responses (Homey2000Cutting). CCL27's role in recruiting T cells to the skin is significant in conditions like graft-versus-host disease, where it is implicated in the migration of CD4+ T cells to inflamed skin (faaij2006possible).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL27 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in skin-related diseases and cancer. Inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are associated with increased levels of CCL27, which contribute to chronic inflammation. Treatment with CCL27-neutralizing antibodies has been shown to reduce skin inflammation in animal models, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for these conditions (LopesMarques2019Convergent).

In the context of cancer, particularly skin cancers like basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a progressive loss of CCL27 expression is observed during the malignant transformation of keratinocytes. This down-regulation is linked to the activation of the EGFR-Ras-MAPK signaling pathways, which allows tumor cells to evade immune surveillance by reducing T cell recruitment to the tumor site (Pivarcsi2007Tumor). The loss of CCL27 expression is considered a mechanism of tumor immune escape, facilitating tumor progression and metastasis (Pivarcsi2007Tumor).

In mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, increased serum and epidermal levels of CCL27 are associated with a higher probability of disease recurrence, indicating its potential as a marker for disease activity and prognosis (Goteri2012Serum).

## Interactions
CCL27, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 27, primarily interacts with the chemokine receptor CCR10. This interaction is significant in the recruitment and retention of T cells in the skin, playing a crucial role in skin-related immune responses and inflammatory processes. CCL27 is produced by keratinocytes and can be induced by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β. CCR10 is expressed by various cell types, including melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and T cells (Homey2000Cutting).

The CCL27-CCR10 interaction is involved in several pathological conditions. In allergic contact dermatitis, CCL27 expression remains elevated even after clinical symptoms subside, contributing to the retention of T cells in the skin and potentially leading to retest reactions and flare-ups (Moed2004Increased). In graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), CCL27/CCR10 interactions facilitate the migration of CD4+ T cells to the skin, correlating with disease activity (faaij2006possible). In drug-induced cutaneous reactions like toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, CCL27 attracts CCR10-expressing cytotoxic T cells to the skin, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Tapia2004Involvement).
