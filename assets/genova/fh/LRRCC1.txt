# LRRCC1

## Overview
LRRCC1, or leucine rich repeat and coiled-coil centrosomal protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structural and functional organization of centrioles within the centrosome of human cells. The protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and centrosomal functions. LRRCC1 is crucial for maintaining centriole integrity and is involved in the assembly and signaling of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular processes such as cell division and signaling pathways like Hedgehog signaling. The protein's localization at the distal end of centrioles is vital for establishing centriole rotational asymmetry, influencing ciliary beat direction in multiciliated cells (Gaudin2021Evolutionary). Mutations in the LRRCC1 gene have been linked to ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome, and other clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Gaudin2021Evolutionary; Tyc2020Exome).

## Function
LRRCC1, or leucine rich repeat and coiled-coil centrosomal protein 1, plays a crucial role in the organization and function of centrioles within the centrosome of human cells. It localizes asymmetrically at the distal end of centrioles, contributing to the establishment of centriole rotational asymmetry, which is important for controlling centriole rotational polarity and potentially influencing ciliary beat direction in multiciliated cells (Gaudin2021Evolutionary). LRRCC1 is involved in the structural integrity of centrioles and the ciliary gate, which is essential for proper Hedgehog signaling and axoneme extension (Gaudin2021Evolutionary).

The protein is also implicated in primary cilium assembly and ciliary signaling, with its depletion leading to defects in centriole structure, ciliary assembly, and signaling (Gaudin2021Evolutionary). LRRCC1 cooperates with other distal centriole components, such as C2CD3, to maintain the organization of the distal region of centrioles, which is crucial for the proper assembly of distal appendages and centriole length control (Gaudin2021Evolutionary). These functions are vital for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of centrioles, which are essential for proper cell division and function in healthy human cells (Gaudin2021Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRRCC1 gene are implicated in several clinical conditions, most notably Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a ciliopathy characterized by developmental delays and neurological abnormalities. LRRCC1 mutations lead to defects in ciliary structure and function, particularly affecting the morphology of distal appendages and centriole length, which disrupts the organization of the ciliary gate and impairs Hedgehog signaling, a pathway crucial for development (Gaudin2021Evolutionary). These structural anomalies prevent the accumulation of Smoothened (SMO) in the cilium, a common consequence of ciliopathic mutations (Gaudin2021Evolutionary).

LRRCC1 is also associated with an increased risk of aneuploid conception, as mutations in this gene can lead to meiotic errors and fertility issues (Tyc2020Exome). Additionally, rare genetic variants in LRRCC1 have been linked to rosacea, suggesting a role in neurogenic inflammation and neural synaptic processes (Deng2023Whole).

The gene's involvement in ciliopathies and other conditions underscores its clinical significance, with research indicating that LRRCC1 is essential for proper ciliary assembly and signaling, and its disruption can lead to significant clinical manifestations (Gaudin2021Evolutionary; Shaheen2016Characterizing).

## Interactions
LRRCC1 is involved in various protein interactions crucial for multiciliated cell (MCC) function, particularly in the context of Xenopus species. It contains coiled-coil domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in the migration and docking of basal bodies (BBs) at the cell surface and organizing the apical cytoskeleton. The IntAct protein interaction database indicates that LRRCC1 interacts with multiple factors related to centrosomes, cilia, and microtubule organization. Notable interactors include CCDC77, AZI1/CEP131, PCM1, and CEP72, which have varying associations with centrioles, cilia, or microtubules (Nommick2021Lrrcc1).

LRRCC1 is systematically located on one side of Centrin-positive BBs, suggesting its association with the BB rootlet. This localization is crucial for its role in BB organization and function throughout various stages of differentiation, docking, and ciliary growth (Nommick2021Lrrcc1). The absence of LRRCC1 leads to the collapse of intermediate filament networks in MCCs, indicating its role in stabilizing these structures and suggesting that it may be part of a molecular network that includes ciliary adhesion complexes (Nommick2021Lrrcc1).
