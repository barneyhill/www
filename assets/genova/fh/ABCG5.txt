# ABCG5

## Overview
ABCG5 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 5 (ABCG5) protein, which is a crucial component of the ABC transporter family. This protein functions as a half-transporter and forms a heterodimer with ABCG8, another member of the same subfamily, to facilitate the transport of sterols across cellular membranes. The ABCG5 protein is characterized by its transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains, which are essential for its role in ATP binding and hydrolysis, enabling the transport of sterols. The ABCG5/ABCG8 complex is primarily expressed in the liver and intestines, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis by regulating the absorption and excretion of sterols. Mutations in the ABCG5 gene can lead to sitosterolemia, a disorder marked by the accumulation of plant sterols in the body, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health (Wang2020Recent; Graf2003ABCG5; Bastida2017Two).

## Structure
The ABCG5 protein, also known as sterolin-1, is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and functions as a half-transporter. It forms an obligate heterodimer with ABCG8, known as sterolin-2, to mediate sterol transport across cell membranes (Bastida2020ABCG5). The protein consists of 651 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 70 kD (Lee2001Identification). Its structure includes six transmembrane helices (TMHs) and an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) (Farhat2022Structural; Velamakanni2007ABCG). The NBD contains ATP-binding motifs, including Walker A and Walker B motifs, which are crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Silverton2011Variation).

The transmembrane domain (TMD) of ABCG5 is linked to the NBD by a triple-helical bundle, forming a compact transporter conformation (Farhat2022Structural). The protein's structure also features a conserved phenylalanine array near the sterol-binding site, which is important for sterol selectivity (Farhat2022Structural). The TMD polar relay, a cluster of polar amino acids, is located in the transmembrane segments and on the triple-helical bundles (Bastida2020ABCG5). The protein is predicted to have two potential N-glycosylation sites, which may affect its stability and localization (Lee2001Identification).

## Function
ABCG5, in conjunction with ABCG8, forms a critical heterodimeric transporter complex involved in the regulation of sterol absorption and excretion in human cells. This complex is primarily active in the liver and intestines, where it plays a vital role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. In the liver, ABCG5/ABCG8 facilitates the excretion of cholesterol into bile, a process essential for the regulation of plasma cholesterol levels and the prevention of sterol accumulation (Wang2020Recent; Graf2003ABCG5). In the intestines, the transporter limits the absorption of dietary plant sterols and cholesterol by pumping them back into the intestinal lumen, thereby reducing their plasma concentrations (Wang2020Recent).

The ABCG5/ABCG8 complex is localized to the apical membranes of enterocytes and hepatocytes, where it functions to transport neutral sterols across cell membranes (Graf2003ABCG5). This activity is crucial for the selective absorption and excretion of sterols, preventing the accumulation of plant sterols in tissues and maintaining normal plasma sterol levels (Wang2020Recent). The proper functioning of this transporter is essential for cholesterol homeostasis and the prevention of disorders such as sitosterolemia (Graf2002Coexpression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCG5 gene are associated with sitosterolemia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of plant sterols in the body. This condition leads to elevated plasma levels of plant sterols and cholesterol due to increased absorption and decreased excretion of sterols. Clinical manifestations include xanthomas, premature coronary atherosclerosis, and hematologic abnormalities such as macrothrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia (Hubacek2001Mutations; Bastida2017Two; Sun2020Compound).

Specific mutations in ABCG5, such as missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations, can disrupt the formation of stable ABCG5-ABCG8 heterodimers, which are crucial for sterol transport. These disruptions can lead to the clinical symptoms of sitosterolemia (Bastida2017Two; Heimer2002Mutations). For instance, the missense mutation p.Arg446Gln affects the protein's structure, potentially decreasing its stability and impairing sterol transport (Sun2020Compound).

The condition can be misdiagnosed as familial hypercholesterolemia due to similar symptoms, but it responds well to treatments like ezetimibe and dietary modifications (Bastida2017Two). Early diagnosis through genetic testing is crucial for appropriate management and treatment (Bastida2017Two).

## Interactions
ABCG5 interacts primarily with ABCG8 to form a functional heterodimeric transporter complex. This interaction is essential for the transport of sterols, as neither ABCG5 nor ABCG8 can function effectively on their own. The heterodimerization occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is necessary for the complex to exit the ER and reach the cell surface, where it can perform its role in sterol transport (Polgar2006Mutational; Wang2015Relative).

The ABCG5/ABCG8 complex is involved in the excretion of sterols from the liver into bile and from enterocytes into the intestinal lumen, thus playing a critical role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. The interaction between these two proteins is crucial for their proper localization and function, as misfolded or improperly assembled proteins are retained in the ER and targeted for degradation (Polgar2006Mutational; Wang2015Relative).

There is no specific information available on the interactions of ABCG5 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its interaction with ABCG8. The focus of the studies is primarily on the functional and regulatory aspects of the ABCG5/ABCG8 complex in sterol metabolism (Wang2015Relative; Repa2002Regulation).
