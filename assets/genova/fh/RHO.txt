# RHO

## Overview
The RHO gene encodes the protein rhodopsin, a critical component of the visual system, specifically functioning as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in the rod cells of the retina. Rhodopsin is integral to the process of scotopic vision, enabling vision in low-light conditions. It achieves this by binding to the chromophore 11-cis-retinal, which, upon photon absorption, undergoes isomerization to all-trans-retinal, triggering a cascade of molecular events that culminate in the transmission of visual signals to the brain (Athanasiou2018The; Mendes2005Mechanisms). Structurally, rhodopsin is characterized by seven transmembrane alpha-helices, forming a pocket for the chromophore and facilitating its role in phototransduction (Hargrave1983The). Mutations in the RHO gene are associated with various retinal degenerative diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its clinical significance (Mendes2005Mechanisms).

## Structure
Rhodopsin (RHO) is a visual receptor protein found in the rod cells of the retina, characterized by a single polypeptide chain of 348 amino acids (Khorana1992Rhodopsin). Its primary structure includes alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments, with hydrophobic regions rich in valine, leucine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine, and hydrophilic regions containing charged amino acids (Hargrave1983The). The secondary structure of rhodopsin consists of seven transmembrane alpha-helices, which are essential for spanning the lipid bilayer (Nathans1983Isolation; Hargrave1983The).

The tertiary structure of rhodopsin forms a pocket for the chromophore 11-cis-retinal, which is linked to the c-amino group of Lys-296 via a protonated Schiff base, stabilized by the carboxylate group of Glu-113 (Khorana1992Rhodopsin). This interaction is crucial for the protein's function in visual phototransduction. Rhodopsin also contains a disulfide bond between Cys-110 and Cys-187, and palmitoyl groups on Cys-322 and Cys-323, which are important for its structural integrity (Khorana1992Rhodopsin).

Post-translational modifications of rhodopsin include phosphorylation, which occurs in the C-terminal domain and plays a regulatory role in its function (Nathans1983Isolation). These structural features are critical for rhodopsin's role as a G protein-coupled receptor in the visual process.

## Function
Rhodopsin, encoded by the RHO gene, is a critical protein in the visual system, specifically located in the rod cells of the retina. It functions as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with seven transmembrane α-helices, playing a pivotal role in scotopic (dim-light) vision. Rhodopsin binds to the chromophore 11-cis-retinal, derived from vitamin A, within a pocket formed by the α-helices. This binding suppresses the constitutive activity of the receptor through an inverse agonist mechanism. Upon photon absorption, 11-cis-retinal isomerizes to the all-trans conformation, initiating a cascade of molecular events that result in a nerve impulse being sent to the brain, allowing for vision in low-light conditions (Athanasiou2018The).

In healthy human cells, rhodopsin is synthesized in the rod cell inner segments and transported to the outer segments, where it is densely packed into stacks of membranous discs. The protein adopts a seven transmembrane helical bundle configuration in these disc membranes, with the N-terminus residing in the interior of the rod discs and the C-terminus in the cytoplasm of the outer segments. Upon activation by light, rhodopsin couples with the G protein transducin to initiate the first step in vision, converting the light signal into a chemical signal that can be processed by the brain (Athanasiou2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RHO gene, which encodes the rhodopsin protein, are a significant cause of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a group of inherited retinal degenerative diseases. RP is characterized by the progressive loss of rod photoreceptor cells, often followed by cone degeneration, leading to vision loss. Over 120 point mutations in the RHO gene have been identified, with the majority causing autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) (Mendes2005Mechanisms). These mutations can lead to various pathogenic mechanisms, including gain-of-function, loss-of-function, and dominant-negative effects. For instance, some mutations result in the misfolding of rhodopsin, impairing its maturation and delivery, which destabilizes photoreceptors and leads to degeneration (Mendes2005Mechanisms).

RHO mutations are also associated with sector retinitis pigmentosa, a variant where specific retinal quadrants are affected, often resulting in a better visual prognosis compared to generalized RP (Jung2023Clinical). The p.L31Q mutation in the RHO gene has been identified as a novel pathogenic variant linked to sector RP (Xiao2018Sector). Additionally, certain RHO mutations can cause congenital stationary night blindness, a condition characterized by impaired night vision without progressive degeneration (Mendes2005Mechanisms).

## Interactions
Rhodopsin (RHO) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that participates in several critical interactions within the visual phototransduction pathway. It interacts with transducin, a G-protein, to initiate the phototransduction cascade. Upon activation by light, rhodopsin undergoes a conformational change that allows it to bind to transducin, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit, which then activates phosphodiesterase (PDE6) (Chen2022Capturing). Rhodopsin also interacts with arrestin, which binds to phosphorylated rhodopsin to terminate the signal, preventing further activation of transducin (Zhao2019CryoEM).

The P23H variant of rhodopsin, associated with heritable retinal degenerations, shows altered interactions compared to the wild-type protein. The P23H rhodopsin interactome is enriched with proteins involved in ubiquitination and protein degradation, reflecting its misfolded state and subsequent targeting for degradation via ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathways (Kim2022Network). This variant also interacts with ribosomal quality control proteins, indicating that both translational and post-translational quality control mechanisms are involved in its regulation (Kim2022Network).

Rhodopsin can form dimers, with the primary dimerization interface involving transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) and cytoplasmic helix 8 (H8). These dimers can interact with multiple signaling proteins, such as Gi proteins and arrestin, potentially accommodating simultaneous binding without interference (Zhao2019CryoEM).
