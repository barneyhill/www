# FGF2

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a gene that encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which is involved in a wide array of biological processes, including cell growth, embryonic development, and tissue repair. The protein product of FGF2, also known as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), is a multifunctional growth factor that plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis, wound healing, and the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. FGF2 is categorized as a growth factor and functions primarily through its interaction with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which are transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors. The protein is secreted via an unconventional pathway, lacking a signal peptide, and is known for its ability to bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix, which modulates its stability and activity. FGF2's involvement in various signaling pathways underscores its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts, including its roles in cancer progression and neurological disorders (Dienstmann2014Genomic; Belov2013Molecular; Steringer2017Key).

## Structure
Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a protein that ranges in size from 150 to 300 amino acids, with a core homology domain of 125 amino acids. This domain adopts a conserved beta-trefoil fold consisting of 12 antiparallel beta strands, characteristic of paracrine FGFs (Belov2013Molecular). The primary structure of FGF2 includes key residues such as K127, R128, and K133, which are crucial for binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and heparan sulfates, essential for its unconventional secretion pathway (Steringer2017Key).

FGF2 lacks a signal peptide, indicating it is secreted via an unconventional pathway involving direct translocation across the plasma membrane. This process is facilitated by oligomerization, forming structures such as trimers and hexamers, which are stabilized by disulfide bridges between cysteine residues C77 and C95 (Steringer2017Key). The protein can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative translational initiation, with the 18 kDa form being extracellular and larger forms being nuclear (KARDAMI2004Fibroblast; Van2000FIF). These isoforms have distinct functions, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and migration (Van2000FIF).

## Function
Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a critical protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis. In healthy human cells, FGF2 plays a significant role in wound healing and tissue regeneration by promoting the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. It is particularly active in the extracellular matrix, where it binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which act as low-affinity receptors, anchoring FGF2 in intercellular spaces and protecting it from degradation (Takayama2002Effects).

FGF2 exerts its effects through high-affinity transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, known as fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which activate intracellular signaling pathways such as MAPK and phospholipase C (Van2000FIF). This activation leads to various cellular responses, including increased cell proliferation and migration, which are essential for tissue repair and regeneration (Shimabukuro2009Fibroblast).

FGF2 is also involved in maintaining the fast-cycling state of human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells, highlighting its role in cell proliferation and morphology maintenance during in vitro propagation (Zaragosi2006Autocrine). Its angiogenic activity is crucial for enhancing microvessel density, which supports wound repair and tissue regeneration (Shimabukuro2009Fibroblast).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FGF2 gene are implicated in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In Parkinson's disease, FGF2, along with FGF20, is involved in increasing dopaminergic neuron numbers and providing neuroprotection (Turner2016Dysregulated). In Alzheimer's disease models, overexpression of FGF2 has been shown to restore cognitive functions and reduce amyloid β deposition (Turner2016Dysregulated). In major depressive disorder, decreased expression of FGF2 is observed in cortical areas and serum levels, with FGF2 demonstrating antidepressant effects in animal models (Turner2016Dysregulated). FGF2 is also linked to anxiety-related conditions, influencing neuron and glia survival and affecting gene transcription related to anxiety (Turner2016Dysregulated).

In cancer, FGF2 is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinomas, contributing to autocrine growth stimulation, cell survival, and neoangiogenesis, and is implicated in resistance to anti-VEGF therapy (Dienstmann2014Genomic). High serum FGF2 levels are associated with poor prognosis in small-cell lung cancer (Dienstmann2014Genomic). FGF2 is also involved in remyelination processes in demyelinating diseases, with increased expression correlating with recovery of motor function (Messersmith2000Fibroblast).

## Interactions
Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) participates in various physical interactions with proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. FGF2 interacts with protein kinase CK2, specifically binding to its regulatory β subunit. This interaction stimulates CK2 activity towards nucleolin, a natural substrate, and is crucial for modulating CK2 activity, which is essential for cell viability and mitogenic signaling (Bonnet1996Fibroblast). FGF2 also interacts with the splicing factor SF3a66, which is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, suggesting a role in splicing regulation (Gringel2004Nuclear).

FGF2 binds to the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, particularly the 23-kDa isoform, which is involved in the splicing machinery and modulates apoptosis (Sluzalska2021Intracellular; Claus2003Differential). It also interacts with translokin (CEP57), facilitating its nuclear translocation, which is necessary for its mitogenic activity (Sluzalska2021Intracellular). FGF2 forms complexes with ribosomal proteins RPL6 and RPS19, indicating a potential role in the DNA damage response and ribosomal function (Sluzalska2021Intracellular). These interactions highlight FGF2's involvement in regulating gene expression, cell cycle, and cellular responses.
