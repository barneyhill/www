# COL9A1

## Overview
The COL9A1 gene encodes the collagen type IX alpha 1 chain, a critical component of the extracellular matrix, particularly within cartilage. This protein belongs to the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices) group and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cartilage by interacting with other collagen types and proteoglycans (Jäälinoja2007Trimerization; Shaw1991FACIT). The collagen type IX alpha 1 chain is part of a heterotrimeric complex that includes alpha-2(IX) and alpha-3(IX) chains, contributing to the stability and organization of the extracellular matrix (Jäälinoja2007Trimerization). The gene is located on chromosome 6q12–q13 and is involved in various biological processes, including chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, which are essential for normal skeletal development and joint stability (DREIER2008Collagen; Gerecke1997Complete). Mutations in COL9A1 are associated with several disorders, such as multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and Stickler syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance (Trefilova2021The).

## Structure
The COL9A1 gene encodes the alpha-1 chain of type IX collagen, a component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is part of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices) group and is a heterotrimer composed of three genetically distinct chains: alpha-1(IX), alpha-2(IX), and alpha-3(IX) (Jäälinoja2007Trimerization). The primary structure of the alpha-1 chain includes a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, which contains three collagenous domains (COL1-COL3) and four non-collagenous domains (NC1-NC4) (Jäälinoja2007Trimerization).

The secondary structure of collagen IX involves the formation of a triple helix, as indicated by circular dichroism analysis, which shows typical collagen triple helical spectra (Jäälinoja2007Trimerization). The tertiary structure involves the folding of the chain, while the quaternary structure refers to the assembly of the three different chains into a heterotrimer. The NC1 domain plays a role in chain selection specificity, influencing the formation of homotrimers (Jäälinoja2007Trimerization).

Post-translational modifications of collagen IX may include hydroxylation and glycosylation, which are common in collagen proteins and contribute to their stability and function. The gene is located on human chromosome 6q12–q13, along with other collagen genes such as COL12A1 and COL19A1 (Gerecke1997Complete).

## Function
The COL9A1 gene encodes the alpha 1 chain of type IX collagen, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix in cartilage. Type IX collagen is a nonfibrillar collagen that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cartilage by interacting with other collagen types and proteoglycans. It is associated with the surface of type II collagen fibrils, contributing to the stability and organization of the extracellular matrix (Mendler1989Cartilage; Shaw1991FACIT).

In healthy cells, type IX collagen is involved in the interaction of fibrils with each other and with other matrix components, which is essential for the biomechanical properties of connective tissues (Shaw1991FACIT). The alpha 1 chain of type IX collagen, encoded by COL9A1, is part of a complex assembly with collagens II and XI, forming heterotypic fibrils that are crucial for cartilage resilience and flexibility (Mendler1989Cartilage).

Type IX collagen also plays a role in modulating the surface properties of cartilage fibrils and linking non-collagenous components to the fibril periphery, which is vital for normal skeletal development and joint stability (DREIER2008Collagen). Its presence is particularly important in growth cartilage, where it influences chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, contributing to proper bone growth and development (DREIER2008Collagen).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the COL9A1 gene, which encodes the alpha 1 chain of type IX collagen, are associated with several diseases and conditions. Mutations in COL9A1 can lead to multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder characterized by abnormal bone growth and early-onset osteoarthritis (Trefilova2021The). The gene is also implicated in Stickler syndrome, a disorder affecting connective tissues (Trefilova2021The).

Alterations in COL9A1 expression are linked to osteoarthritis (OA). In osteoarthritic chondrocytes, COL9A1 expression is reduced due to hypermethylation of its promoter, contributing to cartilage degradation (Imagawa2014Association). The gene's expression is also negatively regulated by lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which is elevated in OA cartilage, further reducing type IX collagen synthesis and destabilizing the cartilage matrix (Durand2020The).

In cancer, COL9A1 expression is altered in various malignancies, including oral squamous cell carcinoma and head and neck cancers, where it is overexpressed in tumor tissues, suggesting a role in tumor proliferation and metastasis (Roi2021Comparative). Additionally, mutations in COL9A1 have been linked to hearing loss, highlighting its broader clinical significance (Hofrichter2019Exomewide).

## Interactions
The COL9A1 gene encodes the alpha 1 chain of type IX collagen, which is a crucial component of the cartilage extracellular matrix. Type IX collagen interacts with cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a significant interaction for cartilage structure and function. COMP binds to specific noncollagenous (NC) domains of type IX collagen, particularly NC1, NC2, NC3, and NC4, with the NC2 domain showing the highest frequency of binding. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal domain of COMP, which is essential for binding to type IX collagen (Holden2001Cartilage).

The interaction between COMP and type IX collagen is specific and involves the noncollagenous domains of type IX collagen. This binding is reversible and dependent on the presence of zinc ions, highlighting the importance of metal ions in stabilizing these interactions (Holden2001Cartilage). The binding sites for type II and type IX collagen on COMP may be the same or closely located, suggesting a shared mechanism in collagen fibrillogenesis and tissue homeostasis (Holden2001Cartilage).

In addition to protein interactions, the COL9A1 gene is regulated by the transcription factor SOX9, which binds to enhancer elements within the gene. SOX9 functions as a dimer to activate COL9A1 expression, with its activity being dependent on the spatial arrangement of its binding sites (Genzer2007A).
