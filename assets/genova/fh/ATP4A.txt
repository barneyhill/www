# ATP4A

## Overview
The ATP4A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the gastric H+/K+ ATPase, a critical enzyme involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion. This gene is primarily expressed in the parietal cells of the stomach, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining the acidic environment necessary for digestion and pathogen defense. The protein product of ATP4A, a P-type ATPase, functions as a transmembrane enzyme that facilitates the exchange of hydrogen and potassium ions across the gastric epithelium, utilizing ATP hydrolysis to drive this process against a concentration gradient (Bublitz2010In; Singh2013ATP4A). The proper functioning of this enzyme is essential for gastric homeostasis, and mutations in ATP4A have been implicated in various gastric disorders, including gastric neuroendocrine tumors and autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis (Benítez2019A; Calvete2021Case).

## Structure
The ATP4A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the gastric H+/K+ ATPase, a P-type ATPase crucial for gastric acid secretion. The primary structure of this protein consists of approximately 1,000 amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain that includes the catalytic sites necessary for its function (Singh2013ATP4A). The secondary structure is characterized by enriched alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are typical of P-type ATPases and contribute to the protein's stability and function (Singh2013ATP4A).

The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is essential for its role in ion transport across the gastric membrane. This structure was modeled using homology modeling based on the X-ray crystal structure of pig renal Na+, K+-ATPase, and validated through a Ramachandran plot, indicating a high-quality model (Singh2013ATP4A). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the alpha subunit with the beta subunit, encoded by the ATP4B gene, which stabilizes the alpha subunit and directs the heterodimer to membrane destinations within the cell (Singh2013ATP4A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating the activity of the ATP4A protein, which is crucial for its function in gastric acid secretion (Bublitz2010In).

## Function
The ATP4A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the gastric H+/K+ ATPase, a crucial enzyme for acid secretion in the stomach. This proton pump is primarily active in the parietal cells of the stomach lining, where it facilitates the exchange of intracellular hydrogen ions (H+) for extracellular potassium ions (K+), a process essential for maintaining the acidic environment of the stomach (Calvete2017A; Singh2013ATP4A). The enzyme operates as a P-type ATPase, utilizing energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport ions against a concentration gradient, which is vital for the production of gastric acid (HCl) (Singh2013ATP4A).

The alpha subunit of the H+/K+ ATPase contains the catalytic sites necessary for ATP binding and ion recognition, playing a key role in the electro-neutral exchange of cytoplasmic H+ and external K+ (Singh2013ATP4A). This activity is critical for digestion, as the acidic environment activates digestive enzymes and provides a defense mechanism against ingested pathogens (Benítez2019A). The proper function of ATP4A is essential for gastric homeostasis, and its malfunction can lead to conditions such as hypochlorhydria and vitamin B12 malabsorption anemia (Calvete2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP4A gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the gastric H+/K+ ATPase, are linked to several gastric disorders. A notable mutation, p.R703C, is associated with gastric neuroendocrine tumors (gNETs) and autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis. This mutation impairs parietal cell function, leading to gastric achlorhydria, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased oxidative stress, which contribute to chronic inflammation and tumor development (Benítez2019A; Calvete2021Case).

In familial cases, ATP4A mutations can cause an atypical form of type I gastric neuroendocrine tumors characterized by early onset, aggressive behavior, and iron-deficiency anemia due to achlorhydria. This condition arises from altered proton pump activity, leading to iron malabsorption while maintaining normal vitamin B12 absorption (Calvete2015Exome).

In mouse models, ATP4A deficiency results in gastric achlorhydria, severe hyperplasia, and mucocystic metaplasia. These changes are accompanied by upregulation of growth factors and altered neuroendocrine signaling, although progression to gastric cancer is not typically observed (JUDD2005Gastric). The deficiency also leads to increased serum gastrin levels and changes in gastric gland morphology (JUDD2005Gastric).

## Interactions
The ATP4A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme, which is essential for gastric acid secretion. This protein interacts with several other proteins to form a functional network crucial for its activity. One of the primary interactions is with ATP4B, the beta subunit of the H+/K+ ATPase, which stabilizes the alpha subunit and is necessary for the enzyme's function (Singh2013ATP4A). 

ATP4A also interacts with proteins such as PPA1, LHPP, PPA2, FXYD5, APLP1, COX7A1, and CTCF, with interaction scores above 0.702. These interactions are categorized into three clusters, with strong interactions observed between cluster I and cluster III proteins/enzymes (Singh2013ATP4A). The FXYD5 protein, part of the FXYD family, interacts with Na+/K+ ATPase and modulates its properties, potentially affecting cell adhesion and metastasis (Singh2013ATP4A).

The ATP4A protein is also involved in transcriptional regulation through its interaction with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which binds to chromatin insulators (Singh2013ATP4A). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network in which ATP4A participates, emphasizing its role in maintaining gastric acid homeostasis.
