# PSMC3

## Overview
The PSMC3 gene encodes the proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 3, also known as Rpt5, which is a critical component of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome complex. This protein is part of the AAA-ATPase family, characterized by its role in ATP-dependent processes, specifically the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The PSMC3 protein contributes to the mechanical unfolding and translocation of substrates into the 20S core of the proteasome, facilitating their subsequent degradation. This function is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within eukaryotic cells, impacting various cellular processes such as mRNA translation, immune signaling, and chromatin remodeling. Mutations in the PSMC3 gene have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and other pathological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Ebstein2023PSMC3; Kröll‐Hermi2020Proteasome; Ebstein2021De).

## Structure
The PSMC3 gene encodes the Rpt5 subunit of the 26S proteasome, which is part of the AAA-ATPase family. This subunit is integral to the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome complex, which is involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Kröll‐Hermi2020Proteasome). The PSMC3 protein features a hexameric ring structure typical of AAA-ATPase proteins, contributing to the mechanical unfolding and translocation of substrates into the 20S core of the proteasome (Ebstein2023PSMC3).

Structurally, PSMC3 contains an N-terminal α/β domain, with critical residues such as G262, I261, M259, R304, and E305 located in loops adjacent to the substrate tunnel. These residues are essential for maintaining loop flexibility and stability, impacting substrate trafficking and interactions with other subunits (Ebstein2023PSMC3). The C-terminal α-helical domain includes the E383L variant, which can disrupt hydrogen bond networks, affecting the association between the 19S complex and the 20S core particle (Ebstein2023PSMC3).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity and interactions of PSMC3, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure and function are crucial for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and are implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders when mutated (Ebstein2021De).

## Function
The PSMC3 gene encodes a subunit of the 26S proteasome, specifically the ATPase subunit Rpt5, which is part of the 19S regulatory particle. This subunit is crucial for the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis in eukaryotic cells (Ebstein2023PSMC3; Kröll‐Hermi2020Proteasome). The 26S proteasome consists of a 20S core particle and a 19S regulatory particle, with PSMC3 playing a key role in substrate unfolding and translocation into the 20S core for degradation (Kröll‐Hermi2020Proteasome).

In healthy human cells, PSMC3 is involved in regulating various cellular functions, including mRNA translation, immune signaling, and chromatin remodeling (Ebstein2023PSMC3). It also plays a role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and integrated stress response (ISR), mechanisms that help cells cope with proteotoxic stress (Ebstein2023PSMC3). The PSMC3 subunit is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular processes like protein quality control and stress responses (Ebstein2023PSMC3).

Proper function of PSMC3 is critical for the normal operation of the proteasome, preventing the accumulation of ubiquitin-modified proteins and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kröll‐Hermi2020Proteasome). Disruptions in PSMC3 function can lead to proteasome dysfunction and associated pathological conditions (Ebstein2023PSMC3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PSMC3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting neurodevelopment and sensory functions. De novo variants in PSMC3 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disabilities and neurodevelopmental delay, often associated with type I interferonopathies. These variants disrupt proteasome function, leading to proteotoxic stress and an elevated type I interferon signature, which contributes to the pathophysiology of these disorders (Ebstein2023PSMC3; Ebstein2021De).

In a separate study, a novel homozygous variant in PSMC3 was identified in patients with a neurosensory syndrome characterized by deafness and cataracts. This variant leads to impaired proteasome function, resulting in proteotoxic stress and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. The condition is marked by a constitutive activation of the TCF11/Nrf1 pathway, which is typically a response to proteasome inhibition (Kröll‐Hermi2020Proteasome).

In lung adenocarcinoma, overexpression of PSMC3 is negatively correlated with overall survival and relapse-free survival, suggesting that high levels of PSMC3 expression are associated with poor clinical outcomes (Ullah2022Identifying). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PSMC3 in various diseases.

## Interactions
PSMC3, a subunit of the 26S proteasome, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in protein degradation. It interacts with Argonaute 2 (AGO2), a key protein in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. This interaction is RNA-independent and requires the N-terminal coiled-coil motif of PSMC3. PSMC3 plays a critical role in maintaining AGO2 stability by preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. It facilitates the interaction of AGO2 with the deubiquitylase USP14, which mediates the deubiquitination of AGO2, thereby stabilizing it and promoting RNAi (Jia2022PSMC3).

PSMC3 is also part of the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, where it associates with other ATPases to facilitate substrate unfolding and translocation. Structural modeling has shown that specific amino acid substitutions in PSMC3 can affect its interactions within the 26S proteasome, particularly influencing substrate trafficking and interactions with other AAA-ATPase subunits (Ebstein2023PSMC3). These interactions are essential for the proper assembly and function of the proteasome, impacting cellular protein homeostasis and potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders when disrupted (Ebstein2023PSMC3).
