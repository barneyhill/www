# EDF1

## Overview
Endothelial differentiation-related factor 1 (EDF1) is a gene that encodes a low-molecular weight intracellular protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within endothelial cells. The EDF1 protein is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential biological functions. It acts as a transcriptional coactivator for non-steroid nuclear receptors and plays a critical role in regulating nitric oxide production through its interaction with calmodulin, a calcium-binding protein. Additionally, EDF1 is implicated in the cellular response to oxidative stress, especially under conditions of magnesium deficiency, highlighting its importance in maintaining vascular homeostasis and endothelial function (Locatelli2021Magnesium).

## Function
EDF1 (endothelial differentiation-related factor 1) is a low-molecular weight intracellular protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in endothelial cells. It is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental biological importance (Locatelli2021Magnesium).

In healthy human cells, EDF1 functions both in the cytosol and the nucleus. In the cytosol, it binds to calmodulin, a calcium-binding protein that modulates several calcium-regulated enzymes, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (Locatelli2021Magnesium). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of nitric oxide production, which is vital for vascular function.

In the nucleus, EDF1 acts as a transcriptional coactivator for non-steroid nuclear receptors involved in lipid metabolism, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) (Locatelli2021Magnesium). PPARγ regulates the transcription of genes implicated in fatty acid and energy metabolism, and its activation by EDF1 inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules and reduces monocyte/macrophage homing to atherosclerotic plaques (Locatelli2021Magnesium).

EDF1 is also involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress, particularly under conditions of magnesium deficiency, where it is upregulated to protect cells against oxidative modifications (Locatelli2021Magnesium). This stress response role highlights its importance in maintaining vascular homeostasis and endothelial performance.

## Clinical Significance
EDF1 (endothelial differentiation-related factor 1) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, reduced expression of EDF1 is associated with a lower risk of distant relapse in patients treated with tamoxifen, suggesting its potential as a predictor of clinical outcomes in tamoxifen therapy (MendesPereira2011Genomewide). EDF1 is also part of a metagene linked to tamoxifen sensitivity, highlighting its role in drug resistance (Mihály2013A).

In the context of hepatic lipogenesis, EDF1 interacts with the long noncoding RNA Blnc1, forming a transcriptional complex crucial for lipogenic gene expression. This interaction is significant in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), conditions linked to obesity (Zhao2018Long).

Magnesium deficiency has been shown to upregulate EDF1, contributing to oxidative stress and lipid accumulation in vascular endothelial cells. This process is associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased cardiovascular risk, suggesting that EDF1 plays a role in the development of atherogenic conditions under low magnesium levels (Locatelli2021Magnesium). EDF1's involvement in these pathways underscores its clinical significance in various metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.

## Interactions
EDF1 (endothelial differentiation-related factor 1) is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. EDF1 binds to calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner, with this interaction being modulated by intracellular calcium levels and phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylation at specific sites, such as Thr-91 and Ser-87, reduces EDF1's affinity for CaM (Mariotti2000Interaction; Mariotti2004The). 

EDF1 also interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a component of the transcription machinery, and this interaction is not affected by phosphorylation (Mariotti2000Interaction). In the context of adipogenesis, EDF1 forms a complex with CaM and calcineurin (Cn), sequestering CaM and potentially inactivating Cn, which is crucial for the regulation of the CaM/Cn/NFAT signaling pathway (LópezVictorio2013EDF1).

Additionally, EDF1 interacts with long non-coding RNA lncPrep + 96kb 2.2 kb, which influences its subcellular localization and function, affecting estradiol production in granulosa cells (Feng2020LncPrep). These interactions highlight EDF1's role in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction.
