# SELENOW

## Overview
SELENOW is a gene that encodes the protein selenoprotein W, a small, thiol-based antioxidant protein involved in cellular redox regulation and protection against oxidative stress. Selenoprotein W is characterized by a conserved Cys-X-X-Sec (CXXU) motif, which is essential for its function in redox reactions (Ko2019SGlutathionylation; Kang2021Compensatory). This protein is predominantly expressed in muscle and brain tissues, where it plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by undergoing S-glutathionylation, a posttranslational modification that prevents harmful disulfide bond formation under oxidative conditions (Ko2019SGlutathionylation). Beyond its antioxidant functions, selenoprotein W is implicated in bone physiology, particularly in osteoclast differentiation and bone remodeling, and has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, where it modulates tau protein homeostasis (Kim2021Selenoprotein; Ren2024Selenoprotein).

## Structure


## Function
Selenoprotein W (SELENOW) is a small protein that plays a significant role in cellular antioxidant defense and redox regulation. It contains a conserved Cys-X-X-Sec (CXXU) motif, similar to the CXXC motif found in thioredoxin, which is crucial for its function in redox reactions (Ko2019SGlutathionylation; Kang2021Compensatory). SELENOW is primarily expressed in muscle and brain tissues, where it contributes to protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced damage by undergoing S-glutathionylation. This posttranslational modification prevents the formation of disulfide bonds that could lead to cell death under oxidative conditions (Ko2019SGlutathionylation).

In bone physiology, SELENOW is involved in osteoclast differentiation and bone remodeling. It acts as a positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis by promoting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and NFATc1, which are essential for osteoclast differentiation (Kim2021Selenoprotein; Kim2018Gradual). SELENOW's expression is downregulated by the RANKL/RANK signaling pathway, and its deficiency leads to increased bone mass due to impaired osteoclast function (Kim2021Selenoprotein). This suggests that SELENOW plays a critical role in maintaining a balance between osteoclast and osteoblast activity, crucial for bone health (Kim2021Selenoprotein).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SELENOW gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), SELENOW plays a crucial role in modulating tau homeostasis. SELENOW deficiency is associated with increased tau levels, synaptic defects, and memory deficits, suggesting that its downregulation may contribute to AD pathology (Ren2024Selenoprotein). Overexpression of SELENOW in AD mouse models has been shown to ameliorate memory impairment and reduce tau-related pathologies, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Ren2024Selenoprotein).

SELENOW is also involved in bone remodeling, where it regulates osteoclast differentiation. Deficiency in SELENOW leads to increased bone mass due to reduced osteoclast formation, while overexpression results in enhanced osteoclastogenesis and an osteoporotic phenotype. This suggests that dysregulation of SELENOW expression can contribute to bone-related conditions such as osteoporosis (Kim2021Selenoprotein).

SELENOW's role in protecting cells from oxidative stress is linked to its antioxidant activity. Deficiency in SELENOW is associated with conditions like Keshan disease and white muscle disease, highlighting its importance in cellular protection against oxidative stress (Ko2019SGlutathionylation).

## Interactions
SELENOW, or selenoprotein W, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, SELENOW interacts with tau protein, forming a disulfide linkage between cysteine-37 (C37) of SELENOW and cysteine-322 (C322) of tau. This interaction is crucial for modulating tau homeostasis, as SELENOW promotes tau degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, competing with Hsp70 for binding to tau and inhibiting tau acetylation at K281 (Ren2024Selenoprotein).

SELENOW also interacts with the Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery, affecting tau degradation and synaptic maintenance. This interaction helps maintain neuronal structure and function, particularly by reducing the 4-repeat isoform of tau, which is implicated in Alzheimer's pathology (Ren2024Selenoprotein).

In addition to its role in neurodegeneration, SELENOW is involved in redox regulation through S-glutathionylation. It interacts with glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi) and glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1), which mediate and reverse its S-glutathionylation, respectively. This modification protects SELENOW from oxidative stress-induced cell death by preventing the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds (Ko2019SGlutathionylation).
