# PLA2G3

## Overview
PLA2G3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group III (sPLA2-III), a member of the secreted phospholipase A2 family. This enzyme is characterized by its unique molecular structure, which includes a central sPLA2 domain flanked by large N- and C-terminal regions, and is homologous to the group III bee venom enzyme (Valentin2000Novel). Functionally, sPLA2-III is involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes, playing a critical role in the hydrolysis of phospholipids to release arachidonic acid, a precursor for eicosanoids (Murakami2016The). The enzyme is also implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including mast cell activation, sperm maturation, and atherogenesis (Sato2008Analyses; Murakami2016The; Sato2010Group). Clinically, alterations in PLA2G3 expression are associated with inflammatory diseases, cancer, and reproductive health issues, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental cues (Murakami2019Group; Murase2017Group).

## Structure
PLA2G3 encodes a secreted phospholipase A2 enzyme with a unique molecular structure compared to other mammalian sPLA2s. The primary structure of PLA2G3 consists of a polypeptide chain of 490 amino acids, which includes a central sPLA2 domain flanked by large N- and C-terminal regions (Valentin2000Novel). The sPLA2 domain is homologous to the group III bee venom enzyme and contains 10 cysteines, which are characteristic of group III sPLA2s (Valentin2000Novel). 

The secondary structure of PLA2G3 includes typical features of group III sPLA2s, such as the Ca2+ loop and catalytic site, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Murakami2011Integrated). The tertiary structure involves the folding of the protein to form a functional enzyme, with the N- and C-terminal regions potentially folding separately from the central sPLA2 domain (Valentin2000Novel).

PLA2G3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, which affects its secretion and function (Murakami2019Group). The enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing various phospholipids and shows a preference for polyunsaturated fatty acids (Murakami2016The). The presence of splice variant isoforms has not been specifically detailed in the provided context.

## Function
PLA2G3 encodes for group III secreted phospholipase A2, an enzyme involved in various biological processes, including lipid metabolism and inflammation. In healthy human cells, PLA2G3 is involved in the hydrolysis of phospholipids, leading to the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor for eicosanoids, which are signaling molecules that play roles in inflammation and cell proliferation (Murakami2016The). The enzyme is active in several cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it participates in membrane remodeling and lipid metabolism (Murakami2016The).

PLA2G3 is also implicated in the regulation of mast cell activation and maturation, which are crucial for proper immune responses and allergy regulation. It works in conjunction with fibroblastic L-PGDS to produce PGD2, promoting mast cell maturation through the DP1 receptor (Murakami2016The). Additionally, PLA2G3 plays a role in sperm maturation and fertility by remodeling polyunsaturated fatty acids in the sperm membrane, which is essential for sperm motility and function (Sato2010Group). These functions highlight the enzyme's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental cues in healthy human cells (Murakami2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLA2G3 gene, which encodes the sPLA2-III enzyme, have been linked to several inflammatory and cancerous conditions. Overexpression of PLA2G3 in transgenic mice leads to spontaneous inflammation in various tissues, including the skin, lungs, liver, and spleen, suggesting its role in systemic inflammatory responses (Sato2009Group). In the skin, this overexpression results in dermatitis characterized by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resembling human psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (Sato2009Group).

In the context of colorectal cancer, sPLA2-III is implicated in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis. High expression levels of this enzyme in colon cancer cells are associated with increased tumor growth and poorer prognosis in patients (Murase2017Group). Studies using Pla2g3 knockout mice have shown that the absence of this gene results in reduced susceptibility to colitis and colorectal cancer, indicating that sPLA2-III exacerbates these conditions by promoting inflammation and tumor development (Murase2017Group).

PLA2G3 is also involved in male fertility, where its absence leads to compromised sperm membrane phospholipid remodeling, resulting in reduced sperm motility and fertility (Murakami2019Group). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PLA2G3 in inflammatory diseases, cancer, and reproductive health.

## Interactions
PLA2G3, or phospholipase A2 group III, is involved in several interactions that influence its function and role in various biological processes. PLA2G3 interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the cell surface, which facilitates its action on cells. This interaction is crucial for the enzyme's ability to release arachidonic acid and produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulation. The N- and C-terminal domains of PLA2G3 enhance its binding to heparanoids, which are essential for its function in cellular environments (Murakami2003Cellular).

PLA2G3 also interacts with cyclooxygenase enzymes, specifically COX-1 and COX-2. Coexpression of PLA2G3 with these enzymes significantly increases PGE2 production, indicating a functional coupling that enhances the enzyme's role in inflammatory responses (Murakami2003Cellular).

In the context of atherosclerosis, PLA2G3 is expressed in macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells within atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting its involvement in local lipoprotein modification and foam cell formation. This interaction contributes to the enzyme's role in promoting atherogenic processes (Sato2008Analyses).
