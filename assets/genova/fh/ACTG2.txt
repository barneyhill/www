# ACTG2

## Overview
The ACTG2 gene encodes the actin gamma 2, smooth muscle protein, which is a critical component of the cytoskeleton in visceral smooth muscle cells. This protein is categorized as an actin isoform and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and contractile function of smooth muscle tissues, particularly within the gastrointestinal and urinary systems. Actin gamma 2 is involved in forming F-actin bundles, essential for cytoskeletal organization and force transmission in response to contractile stimuli. Mutations in the ACTG2 gene are linked to severe smooth muscle dysfunctions, such as Megacystis Microcolon Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome (MMIHS) and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO), highlighting its clinical significance in smooth muscle-related pathologies (Assia2019Recurrent; Hashmi2020Pseudoobstruction–inducing).

## Function
The ACTG2 gene encodes actin gamma 2, a predominant actin isoform in visceral smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which are crucial for maintaining actin-myosin interactions necessary for muscle contraction (Hashmi2020Pseudoobstruction–inducing). In healthy human cells, ACTG2 plays a significant role in the organization and function of smooth muscle cells, particularly in the gastrointestinal and urinary systems, where it contributes to the contractile function of smooth muscle tissues (Hashmi2020Pseudoobstruction–inducing). 

ACTG2 is involved in forming F-actin bundles, which are essential for maintaining the structure and function of the cytoskeleton in cells (Hashmi2020Pseudoobstruction–inducing). It is thought to be important for dynamic submembranous actin that polymerizes in response to contractile stimuli, linking the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton and enhancing membrane rigidity as tension is generated (Hashmi2020Pseudoobstruction–inducing). This submembranous network is critical for the development of tension and transmission of force from the contractile apparatus to the ECM and neighboring cells (Hashmi2020Pseudoobstruction–inducing).

ACTG2 may also play roles in cell migration, spreading, and resistance to passive stretch, with less emphasis on active contraction (Hashmi2020Pseudoobstruction–inducing). Despite its critical role in smooth muscle function, the full understanding of ACTG2's normal physiology remains incomplete (Hashmi2020Pseudoobstruction–inducing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTG2 gene are primarily associated with visceral myopathy, a disorder characterized by smooth muscle dysfunction affecting the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. One of the most severe conditions linked to ACTG2 mutations is Megacystis Microcolon Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome (MMIHS), which involves symptoms such as a massively distended bladder and functional intestinal dysmotility (Assia2019Recurrent). Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is another condition associated with ACTG2 mutations, often requiring total parenteral nutrition and leading to severe complications (Milunsky2017Diagnosis).

ACTG2 mutations, particularly recurrent arginine substitutions, are significant contributors to the disease burden and severity in these disorders. Specific mutations, such as p.Arg178, p.Arg257, and p.Arg40, have been linked to varying severities of MMIHS (Assia2019Recurrent). These mutations can impair ACTG2 polymerization, reducing smooth muscle contractility and leading to severe outcomes like total parenteral nutrition dependence (Hahn2022ACTG2).

The gene's mutations are often autosomal dominant, but some studies suggest potential recessive inheritance patterns, indicating allelic heterogeneity (Matera2020Novel). Molecular diagnosis of ACTG2 mutations is crucial for identifying these conditions, as it is more reliable than histopathology (Hahn2022ACTG2).

## Interactions
ACTG2, a protein encoded by the ACTG2 gene, is involved in various interactions critical for its function in smooth muscle cells. The protein participates in actin filament dynamics and interacts with several other proteins. The His41 side chain of ACTG2 is located at the interface of the G-actin:DNAse-1 complex and interacts with Tropomodulin-1 in the alpha-actin:tropomodulin-1-leiomodin-1 complex. The Arg40 residue also interacts with DNAse-I, while the Leu143 residue is buried in the protein core, playing a role in conformational transitions between actin forms. The Thr149 side chain is at the interface of actin-containing protein complexes, including the alpha-actin:tropomodulin-leiomodin complex and the alpha-actin:gelsolin domain-1 complex. The Glu196 side chain forms hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with Arg257, and the Arg336 residue is located at the interface between subdomains 1 and 3, involved in actin fiber depolymerization (Matera2020Novel).

Mutations in ACTG2, such as R178L and R178C, disrupt its interaction with actin filaments, leading to impaired polymerization and contractility. These mutations destabilize inter-domain contacts, particularly with H74, affecting the protein's conformation and polymerization (Thorson2013De).
