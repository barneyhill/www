# ZNF91

## Overview
ZNF91 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 91, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, categorizing ZNF91 as a transcriptional repressor. The protein plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by repressing SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposons, particularly in human embryonic stem cells. This repression is crucial for preventing aberrant gene expression and maintaining a stable genome. ZNF91 is predominantly expressed in T-lymphoid cells, suggesting a role in immune function, and has been implicated in various diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer, due to its regulatory functions (Horváth2024Mini-heterochromatin; Haring2021ZNF91; Bellefroid1995Emergence).

## Structure
ZNF91 is a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein contains a KRAB domain at the N-terminus, which is a potent transcriptional repressor interacting with TIF1 family proteins to form a complex involved in chromatin remodeling (Mark2001Molecular). ZNF91 has undergone significant evolutionary changes, including the addition of seven zinc fingers through local segmental duplication, which are present in humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas but absent in orangutans and other primates (Jacobs2014An). These zinc fingers are located in a single exon, while the KRAB domain is encoded by two separate exons (Bellefroid1995Emergence).

The protein is composed of 1191 amino acids and includes multiple zinc finger motifs, which are essential for its function as a transcription repressor (Nishimura2001Characterization). ZNF91 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional domains and interactions. The protein is predominantly expressed in T-lymphoid cells, suggesting a role in immune function (Bellefroid1995Emergence).

## Function
ZNF91 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in repressing SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposons in human cells. It is a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. ZNF91 specifically targets the VNTR region of SVAs, binding predominantly at the Alu-VNTR border, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability by preventing the transcriptional activation of these retrotransposons (Haring2021ZNF91).

In human embryonic stem cells, ZNF91 is critical for maintaining the repression of SVAs, as its deletion leads to the derepression and transcriptional activation of these elements. This activation is associated with the loss of repressive epigenetic marks, such as H3K9me3, and the gain of activating marks like H3K4me3 and H3K27ac (Haring2021ZNF91). The repression of SVAs by ZNF91 is vital for preventing aberrant gene expression, which can lead to genomic instability and diseases such as cancer (Haring2021ZNF91).

ZNF91 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression by acting as a transcriptional repressor. It binds to specific regions within gene promoters, such as the human FcγRIIB gene promoter, to exert its repressive effects (Nishimura2001Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF91 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating transposable elements and gene expression. In the context of neurological disorders, ZNF91 is involved in the regulation of SVA transposons, which can impact gene expression in neural cells. A notable example is X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP), where an SVA insertion in the TAF1 gene is linked to the disease. ZNF91 helps establish a mini-heterochromatin domain over this SVA, limiting its regulatory impact. However, when this repression is lost, it leads to increased intron retention and reduced expression of TAF1, contributing to XDP pathology (Horváth2024Mini-heterochromatin).

In cancer, ZNF91 mutations have been identified in colorectal cancer (CRC), where it is one of the significantly mutated genes in a subset of patients. This suggests a potential novel role in CRC tumorigenesis or progression (Zhao2022Comprehensive). Additionally, ZNF91 is part of a nine-gene panel used to predict recurrence in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, indicating its relevance in cancer prognosis (Han2019Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF91 in both neurological and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
ZNF91 is known to interact with SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposons, specifically binding to the VNTR region of these elements. This interaction is crucial for the repression of SVAs in human embryonic stem cells, as demonstrated by the increased transcriptional activity of SVAs upon ZNF91 deletion (Haring2021ZNF91). ZNF91 binds predominantly at the Alu-VNTR border of SVAs, with a significant portion of its binding sites located within these elements. This binding is essential for establishing a repressive chromatin state, which involves the recruitment of corepressor proteins like KAP1 (Haring2021ZNF91).

ZNF91 also interacts with chromatin modifiers to establish local heterochromatin over SVAs, characterized by DNA methylation and the histone mark H3K9me3, in a TRIM28-dependent manner. This interaction limits the influence of SVAs on the host genome by preventing their expression and restricting their cis-acting influence on surrounding regions in neural cells (Horváth2024Mini-heterochromatin). The cooperative role between ZNF91 and DNA methylation is crucial for maintaining SVA silencing, as demonstrated by the significant transcriptional activation of SVAs when both ZNF91 and DNA methylation are inhibited (Horváth2024Mini-heterochromatin).
