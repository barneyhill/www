# DNAJC6

## Overview
DNAJC6 is a gene that encodes the protein auxilin, a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40), which functions as a co-chaperone in cellular processes. Auxilin is primarily involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a critical mechanism for synaptic vesicle recycling in neurons. This protein interacts with the ATPase Hsc70 to facilitate the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles, ensuring efficient synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter release (Edvardson2012A; Ng2020DNAJC6). DNAJC6 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a vital role in maintaining the health of dopaminergic neurons by supporting lysosomal function and preventing the accumulation of neurotoxic proteins (Chiu2024Downregulation). Mutations in DNAJC6 have been linked to neurological disorders such as juvenile parkinsonism and early-onset Parkinson's disease, highlighting its importance in neuroprotection and synaptic function (Olgiati2016DNAJC6Mutations; Ng2020DNAJC6).

## Function
The DNAJC6 gene encodes the protein auxilin, which is a member of the J-domain proteins (JDPs) family, also known as DNAJs or HSP40s. Auxilin plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a process essential for the recycling of synaptic vesicles in neurons. This recycling is vital for maintaining synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter release (Edvardson2012A; Ng2020DNAJC6). Auxilin functions as a co-chaperone by interacting with the ATPase Hsc70, facilitating the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles. This interaction is critical for the disassembly of clathrin coats, allowing for the rapid and continuous recycling of synaptic vesicles (Edvardson2012A; Chiu2024Downregulation).

In healthy human cells, DNAJC6 is highly expressed in central nervous system neurons, where it supports the viability of dopaminergic neurons by maintaining lysosomal function and preventing the accumulation of neurotoxic proteins like α-synuclein (Chiu2024Downregulation). The proper function of DNAJC6 is crucial for neuroprotection, as it prevents the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons by ensuring effective lysosomal degradation and autophagic processes (Chiu2024Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAJC6 gene, which encodes the nerve-specific J protein auxilin, are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably juvenile parkinsonism and early-onset Parkinson's disease. These conditions are characterized by symptoms such as tremor at rest, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability, with the severity and age of onset depending on the extent of auxilin deletion or reduced expression (Olgiati2016DNAJC6Mutations; Koutras2014J). In some cases, patients also experience mental retardation, epilepsy, and a lack of responsiveness to L-Dopa (Koutras2014J).

DNAJC6 mutations lead to impaired synaptic vesicle recycling due to disrupted clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is crucial for neurotransmission. This impairment is linked to the lack of L-Dopa responsiveness observed in some patients (Koutras2014J; Ng2020DNAJC6). In juvenile parkinsonism-dystonia, patients exhibit progressive motor and cognitive symptoms, including dystonia, learning difficulties, and neuropsychiatric features, often with limited response to conventional treatments (Ng2020DNAJC6).

The genetic heterogeneity of these conditions is highlighted by the presence of different phenotypes depending on the specific mutations, with complete loss-of-function variants causing more severe juvenile forms and milder mutations leading to early-onset Parkinson's disease (Olgiati2016DNAJC6Mutations).

## Interactions
DNAJC6, also known as auxilin, is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis through its interactions with several proteins. Auxilin specifically interacts with clathrin and Hsc70, a heat shock protein, to facilitate the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles. This interaction is mediated by the J domain of auxilin, which binds to Hsc70, stimulating its ATPase activity necessary for clathrin dissociation (Koutras2014J; Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40). The J domain of auxilin contains a conserved HPD motif that is crucial for its interaction with Hsc70 (Eisenberg2007Multiple).

Auxilin also binds to clathrin and the clathrin adaptor protein AP2, recruiting Hsc70 to clathrin-coated vesicles (Yim2010Endocytosis). This binding is essential for the rapid recycling of synaptic vesicles, which is critical for neurotransmission (Koutras2014J). In addition, auxilin interacts with dynamin, a GTPase involved in the severing of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane, although it does not directly influence the severing process (Eisenberg2007Multiple).

Mutations in DNAJC6 can disrupt these interactions, leading to impaired synaptic vesicle recycling and contributing to neurological disorders such as juvenile parkinsonism-dystonia (Ng2020DNAJC6).
