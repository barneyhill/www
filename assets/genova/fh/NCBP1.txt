# NCBP1

## Overview
NCBP1, or nuclear cap-binding protein subunit 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the cap-binding complex (CBC), which is essential for mRNA processing in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by NCBP1 is categorized as an RNA-binding protein, specifically involved in binding the 7-methylguanylate cap structure at the 5' end of RNA polymerase II-transcribed RNAs. This interaction is crucial for various RNA metabolic processes, including transcription elongation, pre-mRNA splicing, and mRNA export. NCBP1 forms a canonical CBC with NCBP2 and an alternative complex with NCBP3, highlighting its versatility in RNA processing pathways. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions and activity. NCBP1's role extends to interactions with several protein complexes, underscoring its importance in RNA fate decisions and snRNP maturation (Dou2020Affinity; Gebhardt2015mRNA).

## Structure
NCBP1, also known as nuclear cap-binding protein subunit 1, is a key component of the cap-binding complex (CBC) involved in mRNA processing. The primary structure of NCBP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of NCBP1 is its three-dimensional conformation, stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges. 

NCBP1 forms a quaternary structure by interacting with NCBP2 to create the canonical CBC, which is essential for binding the 7-methylguanylate cap of mRNA (Dou2020Affinity). NCBP1 contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, which is crucial for its cap-binding function (Dou2020Affinity). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating the activity of NCBP1, influencing its interactions with other proteins and its function in mRNA export (Gebhardt2015mRNA). Despite the detailed understanding of its interactions and functions, specific details about splice variant isoforms of NCBP1 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
NCBP1, or nuclear cap-binding protein subunit 1, is a critical component of the cap-binding complex (CBC) in human cells. This complex binds to the 5'-end N7-methylguanosine cap of RNA polymerase II-transcribed RNAs, playing a vital role in various RNA processing activities. NCBP1 enhances the cap-binding affinity of NCBP2 and serves as a platform for interactions with other proteins, influencing the fate of RNAs by directing them towards productive or destructive pathways (Dou2020Affinity).

NCBP1 is involved in transcription elongation, pre-mRNA splicing, and mRNA export. It interacts with several complexes, such as P-TEFb, U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP, and ARS2, which are crucial for RNA fate decisions (Dou2020Affinity). NCBP1 is also associated with the survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex, which is involved in snRNP biosynthesis and assembly, indicating its role in snRNP maturation (Dou2020Affinity).

In addition to its role in the canonical CBC with NCBP2, NCBP1 can form an alternative CBC with NCBP3, which is involved in mRNA export and antiviral responses (Gebhardt2015mRNA). This alternative complex highlights the adaptability and redundancy of the mRNA export machinery (Gebhardt2015mRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NCBP1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. A rare missense variant, rs143745791, in the NCBP1 gene is suggestively associated with an increased risk of developing multiple primary cancers, particularly breast cancer in combination with other cancers. This variant has been linked to a higher likelihood of developing additional cancers, such as cervical cancer, in women who carry it (Cavazos2022Assessment). Although germline variants in NCBP1 have not been previously associated with cancer, its expression has been linked to promoting lung cancer growth and poor prognosis. It is also overexpressed in basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Cavazos2022Assessment).

The NCBP1 gene is also involved in electrophilic-stress signaling within the nucleus, which affects protein translation and mRNA splicing. This process can lead to the production of alternatively spliced proteins that inhibit global translation, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis. However, the direct clinical significance of these mechanisms in relation to specific diseases remains to be fully elucidated (Chang2024NCBP1).

## Interactions
NCBP1, a component of the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA processing and export. NCBP1 forms the canonical CBC with NCBP2, binding to the 5' cap of RNA polymerase II-transcribed RNAs, and is involved in transcription elongation, pre-mRNA splicing, and RNA export (Dou2020Affinity). NCBP1 also forms an alternative CBC with NCBP3, which can substitute for NCBP2 and is involved in mRNA export, particularly under conditions where NCBP2 is absent (Gebhardt2015mRNA).

NCBP1 interacts with various protein complexes, including the SMN complex, particularly with GEMIN5, GEMIN4, and DDX20, indicating a role in snRNP maturation (Dou2020Affinity). It is also associated with the EJC and TREX complexes, which are involved in mRNA processing and export (Dou2020Affinity; Gebhardt2015mRNA). NCBP1's interactions extend to proteins like SRRT, PHAX, KPNA3, and HNRNPUL2, which are part of complexes involved in mRNA processing and transport, such as the CBCA and CBCAP complexes (Dou2020Affinity).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, NCBP1 interacts with CUL4B, promoting cancer progression through upregulation of CUL4B, which is involved in cell proliferation and migration (Zhang2019NCBP1).
