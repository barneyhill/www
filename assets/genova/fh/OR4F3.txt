# OR4F3

## Overview
OR4F3 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily F member 3, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules within the olfactory epithelium. Upon binding specific odorants, OR4F3 initiates a signal transduction pathway that ultimately leads to the perception of smell (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR4F3 is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, where it may contribute to biological processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and regeneration. Its expression in the skin, for instance, suggests a potential involvement in epidermal homeostasis and sensitivity, with implications for skin conditions (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Function
OR4F3 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily known for their role in detecting odor molecules in the olfactory epithelium, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR4F3, like other olfactory receptors, binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory signals processed by the brain (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing).

In addition to their role in olfaction, olfactory receptors, including OR4F3, are expressed in non-olfactory tissues and may be involved in various biological processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and regeneration. These receptors are thought to play roles in epidermal and keratinocyte proliferation, migration, and cytokine production, potentially affecting epidermal homeostasis (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The expression of OR4F3 and other olfactory receptor genes in the skin suggests they may have functions beyond odor detection, possibly influencing skin conditions and sensitivity (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The downregulation of OR4F3 in sensitive skin might be a consequence of the condition, indicating its potential involvement in maintaining normal skin physiology (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).
