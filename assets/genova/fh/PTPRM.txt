# PTPRM

## Overview
PTPRM, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type M, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor-like protein involved in cell signaling and adhesion. This protein is a member of the type IIb subfamily of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and plays a crucial role in regulating protein tyrosine phosphorylation, a key process in controlling signaling pathways that affect cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein's extracellular domain facilitates cell-cell interactions, contributing to tissue organization and integrity through interactions with cadherin/catenin complexes. PTPRM is expressed in various cell types, including neurons, glial cells, epithelial cells, and the prostate, where it functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, and migration (Li2023Role; NunesXavier2019The; Sudhir2015Loss).

## Structure
PTPRM, a member of the R2B family of receptor tyrosine phosphatases, features a complex molecular structure. The extracellular domain (ECD) consists of a MAM (Meprin-A5-mu) domain, an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain, and four fibronectin type III (FN) domains. The FN4 domain includes a Furin protease cleavage site, and post-cleavage, the receptor subunits remain associated at the plasma membrane. The ECD forms homophilic trans dimers between adjacent cells, essential for cell-cell adhesion, with major contact points at the MAM-Ig and FN1-FN2 junctions, creating a rigid rod-like structure stabilized by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic packing (hay2021structure).

The intracellular segment of PTPRM includes two phosphatase domains, with the first being catalytically active. The D2 domain, although often catalytically inactive, can modulate the activity of the D1 domain and may serve as a substrate binding site or protein scaffold (hay2021structure). The juxtamembrane region, consisting of six distinct exons, shows variation in size and nucleotide identity, suggesting a role in substrate recognition and specificity (Besco2004Genomic).

PTPRM is subject to alternative splicing, particularly in the juxtamembrane domain, which is crucial for signal transduction regulation (Besco2004Genomic).

## Function
PTPRM, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type M, is a transmembrane receptor-like protein that plays a significant role in cell signaling and adhesion. It is part of the type IIb subfamily of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and is involved in regulating protein tyrosine phosphorylation, a critical process for controlling signaling pathways that influence cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Li2023Role; Sudhir2015Loss).

In healthy human cells, PTPRM is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it facilitates cell-cell interactions through its large extracellular region. This region includes domains such as the MAM domain, immunoglobulin domain, and fibronectin type III repeat sequences, which mediate cell-cell aggregation and adhesion (Li2023Role). PTPRM's role in cell adhesion is crucial for maintaining tissue organization and integrity, as it interacts with cadherin/catenin complexes and is involved in E-cadherin-mediated adhesion (NunesXavier2019The).

PTPRM also transduces signals from the extracellular environment into the cell, influencing cell growth, activation, and signal transduction. It is expressed in various cell types, including neurons, glial cells, epithelial cells, and the prostate, where it functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, and migration (Li2023Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PTPRM gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), PTPRM expression is significantly lower compared to normal ovarian tissues, and its reduced expression is associated with advanced clinical stages, larger tumor diameters, and recurrence, suggesting a role in EOC progression and prognosis (Li2023Role). In breast cancer, lower PTPRM levels correlate with higher tumor grades and poorer prognosis, with knockdown experiments showing increased cell proliferation and invasion (Sun2012Protein). 

In colorectal cancer, PTPRM is frequently downregulated due to loss of heterozygosity and promoter hypermethylation, contributing to tumorigenesis in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Its loss is associated with disrupted cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways, promoting cancer development (Sudhir2015Loss). 

Conversely, in cervical cancer, PTPRM is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, promoting tumor growth and lymph node metastasis through the Src-AKT signaling pathway (Liu2020High). These findings highlight the complex role of PTPRM in cancer, where its expression levels and interactions can significantly impact disease progression and patient outcomes.

## Interactions
PTPRM (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type M) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cell signaling and adhesion. It interacts with E-cadherin/a-catenin/b-catenin complexes in tissues such as the rat heart, lung, and brain. PTPRM directly binds to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, regulating its phosphorylation and function, which is crucial for cell-cell adhesion (Sun2012Protein). In lung cancer cells, PTPRM interacts with STAT3, specifically dephosphorylating it at the Y705 site, a process inhibited by DDIAS. This interaction is significant for regulating STAT3 activity, which is associated with cancer malignancy (Im2020DDIAS).

PTPRM also plays a role in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. It counterregulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, affecting several tyrosine residues, including Y992 and Y1068, which are linked to cell migration and proliferation (Hyun2011Diverse). In prostate cancer cells, PTPRM interacts with cadherin/catenin complexes, promoting E-cadherin-mediated adhesion in a catalytically-independent manner (NunesXavier2019The). These interactions highlight PTPRM's role in modulating cellular communication and adhesion, impacting various signaling pathways and cellular behaviors.
