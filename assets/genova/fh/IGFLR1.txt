# IGFLR1

## Overview
The IGFLR1 gene encodes the protein IGF-like family receptor 1, which is categorized as a transmembrane receptor. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including immune response modulation and cancer progression. IGFLR1 is particularly notable for its role in colorectal cancer (CRC), where it is expressed in specific immune cell types and is associated with immune cell infiltration and the interferon receptor pathway. The gene's expression levels have been identified as an independent prognostic factor in CRC, correlating with patient survival outcomes. These characteristics make IGFLR1 a potential target for precision therapy and immunotherapy in cancer treatment (Jin2024Prognostic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The IGFLR1 gene, also known as TMEM149, has significant clinical implications, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). Alterations in IGFLR1 expression are associated with various cancers and immune responses. In CRC, IGFLR1 is highly expressed in specific immune cells, such as CXCL13+BHLHE40+TH1-like cells, CD8+Tex cells, and Treg cells, and is one of the top nine mutational genes in CRC cell lines (Jin2024Prognostic). Its expression is linked to immune cell infiltration, especially CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells, and is associated with the interferon receptor (INFR) pathway (Jin2024Prognostic).

IGFLR1 expression is an independent prognostic factor in stage II and III CRC, with higher levels correlating with better overall survival, disease-free survival, and cancer-specific survival (Jin2024Prognostic). It is also involved in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and target for precision therapy (Jin2024Prognostic). The gene's expression and mutations are linked to immune cell infiltration and patient prognosis, indicating its role in the development of personalized therapy strategies for CRC patients (Jin2024Prognostic). These findings highlight IGFLR1's potential as a target for immunotherapy in CRC (Jin2024Prognostic).
