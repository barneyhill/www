# WNT7A

## Overview
WNT7A is a gene that encodes the Wnt family member 7A protein, a secreted glycoprotein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various developmental and physiological processes. The WNT7A protein plays a pivotal role in both β-catenin dependent and independent signaling pathways, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination. It is particularly significant in the development of the female reproductive system, limb formation, and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. The protein interacts with Frizzled receptors and co-receptors such as LRP5 and LRP6, facilitating its role in signaling pathways. Mutations in the WNT7A gene are linked to limb malformation syndromes, including Fuhrmann syndrome and Al-Awadi-Raas-Rothschild syndrome, highlighting its critical function in human development (Parr1998Sexually; Al‐Qattan2013Molecular; Lan2019Roles).

## Structure
The WNT7A protein is a 39 kDa conserved secreted glycoprotein composed of 349 amino acids. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide of 31 amino acids, followed by a sequence containing four key modification sites: an O-palmitoylation site at serine 206 and glycosylation sites at asparagine residues 83, 127, and 295 (Lan2019Roles). The protein is characterized by a high cysteine content, with 25 of its 26 cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds, which are crucial for its structural integrity and function (Lan2019Roles).

The secondary and tertiary structures of WNT7A are not explicitly detailed in the context, but it is known that Wnt proteins generally have a two-domain structure with a flexible linker region. The N-terminal domain is essential for binding to the Reck protein, while the C-terminal domain is involved in interactions with Frizzled receptors (von2013A; Eubelen2018A). The linker region is intrinsically disordered and plays a role in molecular recognition (Eubelen2018A).

WNT7A does not have splice variant isoforms, as it generates only one transcript (Lan2019Roles). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and palmitoylation, which are essential for its secretion and function (von2013A; Lan2019Roles).

## Function
WNT7A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various developmental and homeostatic processes in healthy human cells. The WNT7A protein is a secreted glycoprotein that participates in both β-catenin dependent and independent signaling pathways. In the β-catenin dependent pathway, WNT7A interacts with cell surface receptors, leading to the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. This accumulation allows β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of target genes, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate determination (Lan2019Roles; Peng2012Expression).

WNT7A plays a significant role in the development of the female reproductive system, limb formation, and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. It is expressed in the epithelium of the Müllerian duct, crucial for the development of the female reproductive tract, and is involved in dorsoventral patterning during limb development (Parr1998Sexually; Lan2019Roles). In the central nervous system, WNT7A promotes vasculature formation and is involved in synapse formation and function, particularly in the cerebellum and hippocampus (Lan2019Roles). Additionally, WNT7A is implicated in maintaining homeostasis in skeletal muscle, cartilage, and hair follicles (Lan2019Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WNT7A gene are associated with several limb malformation syndromes, including Fuhrmann syndrome and Al-Awadi-Raas-Rothschild syndrome (AARRS). These conditions are characterized by varying degrees of limb aplasia or hypoplasia, with Fuhrmann syndrome typically resulting from partial loss of WNT7A function and AARRS from complete loss (Woods2006Mutations; Al‐Qattan2013Molecular). Specific mutations, such as R292C and A109T, have been identified in affected individuals. The R292C mutation acts as a functional null, leading to more severe limb morphology effects, while the A109T mutation retains some activity, resulting in milder phenotypes (Woods2006Mutations).

WNT7A mutations also impact the development of the urogenital system, with potential outcomes including rudimentary or absent uterus in females and hypogonadism in males (Al‐Qattan2013Molecular). Additionally, craniofacial and thoracic anomalies have been reported in some cases, possibly due to interactions with other factors like the MSX2 transcription factor (Al‐Qattan2013Molecular). The gene's role in limb development is crucial, as it influences pathways that regulate gene expression and chondrogenesis, leading to the observed phenotypes in these syndromes (Woods2006Mutations).

## Interactions
WNT7A interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the Wnt signaling pathway. It binds to the Frizzled receptors FZD8 and FZD5, with a preference for FZD8 over FZD4, which it binds with low affinity (Vallon2018A; Carmon2008Wnt7a). WNT7A also interacts with the co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6, which are essential components of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Vallon2018A).

The protein RECK is a significant binding partner for WNT7A, stabilizing it in its active, monomeric, hydrophobic form. This interaction is crucial for the bioavailability and signaling activity of WNT7A. RECK can enhance the formation of WNT7A complexes with FZD8, suggesting a role in facilitating the presentation of WNT7A to Frizzled receptors (Vallon2018A). 

WNT7A also forms a complex with GPR124 and RECK, although GPR124 does not directly bind WNT7A. Instead, GPR124 enhances RECK expression on the cell surface, indirectly influencing WNT7A signaling (Vallon2018A). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving WNT7A in cellular signaling pathways.
