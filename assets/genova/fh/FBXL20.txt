# FBXL20

## Overview
FBXL20 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 20, a member of the F-box protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an F-box motif, which is crucial for its role in forming SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complexes involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Additionally, the protein contains leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that facilitate protein-protein interactions, enhancing its functional versatility. FBXL20 plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of specific proteins, such as Vps34, particularly in response to DNA damage. This regulation is crucial for processes like autophagy and receptor degradation, which are essential for maintaining cellular balance and responding to stress. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and is influenced by p53-dependent transcriptional control, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling and potential implications in cancer progression (Xiao2015FBXL20mediated; ZHU2012Role).

## Structure
FBXL20 is a member of the F-box protein family, characterized by the presence of an F-box motif that plays a crucial role in protein-protein interactions. This motif is integral to the formation of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complexes, which are involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The protein also contains leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which are essential for facilitating protein binding. These LRRs contribute to the protein's ability to interact with various substrates, enhancing its functional versatility.

The molecular structure of FBXL20 is influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and stability. These modifications can affect the protein's interaction with other molecules and its participation in cellular processes. The specific arrangement and interaction of the F-box motif and LRRs within FBXL20 contribute to its tertiary structure, allowing it to perform its role in the SCF complex effectively.

While the primary structure of FBXL20 is defined by its amino acid sequence, detailed information on its secondary and quaternary structures is not provided in the available context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned, indicating a need for further research to elucidate these aspects.

## Function
FBXL20 is a crucial component of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a significant role in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of proteins, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating intracellular signaling. In healthy human cells, FBXL20 specifically mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of Vps34, a catalytic subunit in the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes. Vps34 is vital for the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), a lipid that regulates autophagy and receptor degradation (Xiao2015FBXL20mediated).

The regulation of Vps34 by FBXL20 is phosphorylation-dependent and is controlled by p53-dependent transcription, particularly in response to DNA damage. This mechanism acts as a checkpoint for p53 to regulate autophagy and receptor degradation, which are essential processes for cellular homeostasis (Xiao2015FBXL20mediated). FBXL20 functions as an adaptor for the CUL1-SKP1 complex, enhancing the interaction with Vps34 under DNA damage conditions, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation (Xiao2015FBXL20mediated).

FBXL20 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular homeostasis and organismal development by regulating protein levels, cell cycle progression, and signal transduction (Xiao2015FBXL20mediated).

## Clinical Significance
FBXL20 has been implicated in the progression of colorectal adenocarcinoma. Studies have shown that FBXL20 mRNA expression is upregulated in a significant portion of colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, with a notable increase in older patients. This upregulation is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, suggesting a role in tumor progression. Silencing FBXL20 in colorectal cancer cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (ZHU2012Role).

FBXL20 also plays a role in the regulation of autophagy and receptor degradation, particularly in response to DNA damage. It acts as an adaptor protein in the SCF complex, mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of Vps34, a key player in autophagy. This process is regulated by p53, and disruptions in this pathway can affect cellular homeostasis and response to DNA damage. In p53 wild-type cells, FBXL20 expression is induced upon DNA damage, leading to reduced Vps34 levels and autophagy. However, in p53-null cells, this regulation is lost, resulting in constant elevated FBXL20 expression, which may contribute to cancer cell survival under stress (Xiao2015FBXL20mediated).

## Interactions
FBXL20 interacts with Vps34, a catalytic subunit in the class III PtdIns3 kinase complexes, as part of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) complex. This interaction facilitates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Vps34, particularly in response to DNA damage (Xiao2015FBXL20mediated). The binding between FBXL20 and Vps34 is enhanced by the phosphorylation of Vps34 at threonine 159 (T159), which is mediated by CDK1 during mitosis. This phosphorylation is crucial for the degradation of Vps34 upon DNA damage (Xiao2015FBXL20mediated).

FBXL20 contains leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that are involved in binding with Vps34, while the C2 domain of Vps34 is important for its interaction with FBXL20 (Xiao2015FBXL20mediated). The interaction is part of a ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated degradation pathway, which is enhanced upon DNA damage (Xiao2015FBXL20mediated). FBXL20 is also regulated by p53, which controls its expression in response to DNA damage, thereby influencing the degradation of Vps34 and the regulation of autophagy and receptor degradation (Xiao2015FBXL20mediated).
