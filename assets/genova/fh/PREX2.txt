# PREX2

## Overview
PREX2 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate dependent Rac exchange factor 2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in critical cellular signaling pathways. The protein plays a pivotal role in activating the small GTPase Rac1, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell motility, glucose metabolism, and insulin signaling (barrows2015regulation). Structurally, PREX2 contains several domains, such as the Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which are crucial for its GEF activity, as well as DEP, PDZ, and 4-phosphatase homology (IP4P) domains that regulate its interactions and autoinhibition (D’Andrea2021Structural). The protein's function and interactions, particularly with PTEN, a tumor suppressor, have significant implications in cancer biology, where mutations in PREX2 can lead to dysregulated Rac1 activity and contribute to oncogenesis (D’Andrea2021Structural; Mense2015PTEN).

## Structure
PREX2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a crucial role in cell signaling pathways by activating the small GTPase Rac1. The protein structure of PREX2 includes several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains an N-terminal Dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which together form the minimal RhoGEF catalytic subunit responsible for its GEF activity (D’Andrea2021Structural). The C-terminal region of PREX2 includes two DEP domains, two PDZ domains, and a 4-phosphatase homology domain (IP4P), which are involved in autoinhibition and interactions with other proteins (D’Andrea2021Structural).

In its basal state, PREX2 is autoinhibited, with the C-terminal domains blocking the catalytic DH-PH tandem domains, preventing Rac1 activation (D’Andrea2021Structural). The IP4P domain plays a significant role in maintaining this autoinhibited conformation by interacting with the DH-PH domains and the PH-DEP1 linker (D’Andrea2021Structural). Truncating mutations in PREX2 can disrupt these autoinhibitory interactions, leading to increased GEF activity and enhanced signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway (Lissanu2016Truncating). These structural features and mutations are significant in the context of cancer, where they can lead to hyperactivation of Rac1 and contribute to oncogenesis (D’Andrea2021Structural).

## Function
PREX2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a crucial role in the activation of the small GTPase RAC1, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell motility, glucose metabolism, and insulin signaling. In healthy human cells, PREX2 facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on RAC1, thereby activating downstream effectors like p21-activated kinases (PAK) (barrows2015regulation). This activation is significant in the insulin signaling pathway, where PREX2 interacts with the insulin receptor and other proteins like PTEN and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, influencing glucose metabolism and cell proliferation (barrows2015regulation).

PREX2 also inhibits the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN, which is crucial for maintaining PI(3,4,5)P3 levels and propagating insulin signals. This inhibition affects the phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream targets, which are essential for insulin-mediated glucose uptake (tsonou2020exploring; barrows2015regulation). The protein is activated by PI(3,4,5)P3 and Gβγ, generated following receptor tyrosine kinase and GPCR activation, and is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane (barrows2015regulation). These interactions and regulatory mechanisms highlight PREX2's role in insulin signaling and its potential implications in diseases like cancer and diabetes (barrows2015regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PREX2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), PREX2 is associated with radiation resistance, making it a predictor of poor response to radiotherapy. High PREX2 expression correlates with a poorer progression-free interval in CRC patients, although it does not correlate with advanced TNM classification or tumor position (Li2024PREX2).

In melanoma, PREX2 mutations are frequent, with a mutation rate of approximately 14% in metastatic tumors. These mutations, such as truncating mutations, can accelerate tumor development and are associated with increased tumor lethality (Chroscinski2014Registered; Lissanu2016Truncating). PREX2 mutations also contribute to resistance against MAPK-targeted therapies in BRAF-driven melanoma (Ford2024A).

PREX2 is overexpressed in several other cancers, including breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, and is often mutated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). These mutations can lead to enhanced tumor proliferation and migration by affecting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Yeung2019CELF2; Yang2019Somatic). The interaction of PREX2 with PTEN, a tumor suppressor, is significant in these processes, as PREX2 mutations can escape PTEN's inhibitory effects, promoting oncogenesis (Mense2015PTEN).

## Interactions
PREX2 interacts with several proteins, most notably PTEN, a tumor suppressor. The interaction between PREX2 and PTEN involves multiple domains. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PREX2 binds to the phosphatase and C2 domains of PTEN, inhibiting PTEN's phosphatase activity. This inhibition is specific to PREX2, as the PH domain of its homolog, P-REX1, does not inhibit PTEN (Hodakoski2013Regulation). The PTEN:P-Rex2 complex is characterized by PTEN binding to the PDZ2 and IP4P domains of PREX2, which occludes the PTEN active site and promotes a closed conformation of PREX2, affecting its interactions with other proteins (D’Andrea2021Structural).

PREX2 also interacts with the small GTPase Rac1, facilitating its activation. However, PTEN can inhibit PREX2-catalyzed activation of Rac1, thereby restraining tumor cell invasion (Mense2015PTEN). The interaction between PTEN and PREX2 is significant in cancer, as mutations in PREX2 can lead to unregulated Rac1 activity by avoiding PTEN inhibition (D’Andrea2021Structural).

CELF2, an RNA-binding protein, interacts with the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of PREX2, reducing its association with PTEN and enhancing PTEN's phosphatase activity. This interaction is significant in non-small cell lung carcinoma, where CELF2 acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating the PREX2-PTEN interaction (Yeung2019CELF2).
