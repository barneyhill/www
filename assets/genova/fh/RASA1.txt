# RASA1

## Overview
RASA1 is a gene that encodes the RAS p21 protein activator 1, commonly referred to as p120 RasGAP, a crucial regulatory protein in the Ras signaling pathway. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which accelerates the conversion of active Ras-GTP to its inactive Ras-GDP form, thereby acting as a negative regulator of Ras signaling. The RASA1 protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a RasGAP module, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, C2 domain, and SH2/SH3/SH2 motifs, which facilitate its interaction with Ras and other signaling molecules (Scheffzek2018Ras-Specific). RASA1 plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, and is essential for vascular development and maintenance. Mutations in the RASA1 gene are linked to vascular anomalies such as capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) syndrome and Parkes Weber syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in vascular biology (Revencu2008Parkes; Zhang2020Role).

## Structure
The RASA1 protein, also known as p120GAP, is a 120 kDa protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the Ras signaling pathway. It contains several important domains, including a carboxy-terminal RasGAP module, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a C2 domain, and an SH2/SH3/SH2 motif (Scheffzek2018Ras-Specific). The RasGAP module is largely helical and consists of two subdomains: a central domain (GAPc) essential for catalytic activity and an extra domain (GAPex) that is not necessary for GAP activity (Scheffzek2018Ras-Specific). The protein's structure facilitates its interaction with Ras, primarily through the switch and P-loop regions, with a key feature being the 'arginine finger' (Arg789), which stabilizes the transition state of the GTP hydrolysis reaction (Scheffzek2018Ras-Specific).

The RASA1 protein is involved in forming a stable complex with GDP-bound Ras, which is significant for its function in cellular signaling (Scheffzek1997The). The protein's structure also includes regions such as polyglycine, polyproline, and polyglutamine in the N-terminal region, contributing to its dynamic features (Virupaksha2021Structural). The study of its 3D structure has been approached through computational methods due to the lack of x-ray crystallographic data (Virupaksha2021Structural).

## Function
The RASA1 gene encodes the p120 Ras GTPase-activating protein (p120 RasGAP), which functions as a negative regulator of the Ras small GTP-binding protein. In healthy human cells, RASA1 enhances the ability of Ras to hydrolyze bound GTP, converting it to its inactive GDP-bound form. This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation by controlling Ras signal transduction pathways (Chen2019RASA1-dependent; Scheffzek2018Ras-Specific).

RASA1 is involved in the export of collagen IV from endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells, which is essential for the formation and maintenance of vascular basement membranes. This process is critical during developmental angiogenesis, where RASA1 ensures the proper folding and secretion of collagen IV, preventing its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent endothelial cell death (Chen2019RASA1-dependent).

The protein is also implicated in the regulation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, which is important for various cellular processes, including the development of blood and lymphatic vasculature. Disruption of RASA1 can lead to dysregulated Ras signaling, resulting in vascular abnormalities (Chen2019RASA1-dependent; Lapinski2012RASA1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RASA1 gene are associated with several vascular anomalies, most notably capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) syndrome and Parkes Weber syndrome. These conditions are characterized by atypical capillary malformations and fast-flow vascular lesions such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) (Revencu2008Parkes; Zhang2020Role). Parkes Weber syndrome, in particular, is marked by multifocal capillary malformations and can lead to cardiac overload or failure in some cases (Revencu2008Parkes).

RASA1 mutations can also result in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)-like symptoms, with significant phenotypic overlap complicating diagnosis. Including RASA1 in molecular testing for HHT could improve diagnostic accuracy (Hernandez2015Mutations). Additionally, RASA1 mutations have been linked to other conditions such as vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (Zhang2020Role).

The gene's role in angiogenesis and vascular development means that its mutations can lead to a variety of vascular disorders, and its downregulation has been associated with neuropathic pain and other conditions (Zhang2020Role).

## Interactions
RASA1, also known as p120RasGAP, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate various cellular processes. It interacts with the Ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EPHB4) as a critical effector in the EPHB4 signaling pathway, which is essential for proper embryonic blood vessel formation. This interaction is necessary for the recruitment of RASA1 to the activated EPHB4 receptor, facilitating effective receptor signaling and suppressing endothelial mTORC1 activity (Kawasaki2014RASA1). 

RASA1 also interacts with p190RhoGAP (ARHGAP35) through an SH2-pTyr interaction, which is significant for its role in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Zhang2020Role). Additionally, RASA1 binds to activated RAS proteins, enhancing their GTPase activity and thus regulating the Ras/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, which are crucial for vascular smooth muscle cell growth and migration (Zhang2020Role). 

Mutations in RASA1 can disrupt these interactions, leading to vascular abnormalities and conditions such as capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) syndrome (Hernandez2015Mutations). These interactions highlight RASA1's role in maintaining normal vascular development and function.
