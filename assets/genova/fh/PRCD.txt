# PRCD

## Overview
The PRCD gene encodes the photoreceptor disc component protein, which is integral to the function and maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the retina. This small, highly conserved protein is primarily localized to the photoreceptor outer segment disc membranes, where it plays a critical role in the morphogenesis and maintenance of these structures. The PRCD protein is characterized by its interaction with rhodopsin, a key protein in the phototransduction pathway, and is essential for maintaining the proper organization and density of rhodopsin within the rod outer segment disc membranes (Spencer2016Progressive; Sechrest2020Loss). Post-translational modifications, such as S-acylation, are crucial for the protein's stability and localization (Spencer2016Progressive). Mutations in the PRCD gene are linked to retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative retinal disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Zangerl2006Identical; Myers2022R17C).

## Structure
The PRCD protein is a small, highly conserved protein consisting of 54 amino acids in humans and dogs, and 53 in mice (Spencer2019PRCDa; Allon2019PRCD). Its primary structure includes a highly conserved N-terminus composed of hydrophobic residues, which form an α-helical signal sequence domain that acts as a membrane anchor (Spencer2016Progressive; Murphy2016Palmitoylation). This domain is too short to span the membrane completely due to the presence of positively charged arginines following the hydrophobic sequence (Spencer2016Progressive).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including S-acylation at a cysteine residue (Cys2), which is crucial for its stability and localization to the photoreceptor outer segment (Spencer2016Progressive; Murphy2016Palmitoylation). This modification is likely a palmitoyl moiety (Spencer2019PRCDa). The C-terminus of PRCD is hydrophilic and exposed to the cytosolic space, lacking clear secondary structure predictions (Spencer2016Progressive).

PRCD interacts with rhodopsin, which is essential for its intracellular stability and proper localization (Spencer2016Progressive). The protein is tightly associated with photoreceptor disc membranes, with a molar ratio of 1:290 with rhodopsin in bovine discs (Spencer2019PRCD).

## Function
The PRCD gene encodes a small protein that plays a crucial role in the maintenance and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. In healthy human cells, PRCD is localized to the photoreceptor outer segment disc membranes, where it is involved in the morphogenesis and maintenance of these structures (Sechrest2020Loss). The protein is specifically concentrated at the base of the photoreceptor outer segments, suggesting its involvement in the machinery of disc assembly (Allon2019PRCD). PRCD interacts with rhodopsin, a key protein in phototransduction, and is essential for maintaining the proper density and organization of rhodopsin in the rod outer segment disc membranes (Sechrest page 10 of 19).

The PRCD protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including S-acylation, which is necessary for its proper localization and stability within the photoreceptor outer segments (Spencer2016Progressive). This modification is crucial for its interaction with rhodopsin, which is vital for the intracellular stability of PRCD (Spencer2016Progressive). The absence of PRCD leads to structural defects in the outer segment discs, resulting in the accumulation of vesicles in the interphotoreceptor space, indicating its role in outer segment maintenance and disc morphogenesis (Sechrest2020Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRCD gene are associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a group of inherited retinal degenerative diseases characterized by progressive vision loss. The most common mutation involves a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at the second amino acid (C2Y), which leads to protein instability and mislocalization, contributing to the disease phenotype in both dogs and humans (Zangerl2006Identical; Myers2022R17C). This mutation has been identified in various dog breeds and a human patient with autosomal recessive RP, indicating a shared genetic basis for the disease across species (Zangerl2006Identical).

The PRCD gene is predominantly expressed in the retina, particularly in the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptor, and ganglion cell layers. Mutations in PRCD can lead to altered protein localization within the cytoplasm, impairing its function and interactions with other proteins in the retina (Zangerl2006Identical). The R17C mutation, although considered a non-disease-causing ethnic-specific polymorphism, has been linked to RP in a heterozygous state, suggesting it may contribute to the disease phenotype in certain populations (Zangerl2006Identical; Myers2022R17C).

## Interactions
The PRCD protein interacts primarily with rhodopsin, a major protein in photoreceptor discs. This interaction is crucial for PRCD's localization to the photoreceptor outer segments and its intracellular stability. PRCD binds specifically to rhodopsin, as demonstrated by experiments showing the preservation of rhodopsin binding to immobilized PRCD peptide even after dilution of solubilized disc lysate (Spencer2016Progressive). The interaction between PRCD and rhodopsin is not affected by the bleaching status of rhodopsin, indicating a stable association (Spencer2016Progressive).

PRCD also interacts with TULP1 and TUB, proteins involved in the vesicular trafficking of photoreceptor proteins. These interactions are necessary for the proper localization of PRCD to the outer segments of photoreceptors. Mislocalization of PRCD in TULP1- and TUB-deficient mice suggests that these proteins play a role in trafficking PRCD to the outer segments (Remez2020TULP1). The interaction between PRCD and TULP1 was confirmed through yeast growth assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, with the interacting regions mapped to the C-terminal parts of TULP1 and TUB, which include the highly conserved tubby domain (Remez2020TULP1).
