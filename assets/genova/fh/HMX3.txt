# HMX3

## Overview
HMX3, or H6 family homeobox 3, is a gene that encodes a homeodomain protein functioning primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is integral to the development of the vestibular system in the inner ear, which is crucial for balance and hearing, as well as the hypothalamus, where it influences growth hormone regulation. The HMX3 protein is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and interact with various proteins, facilitating its role in transcriptional regulation. Its expression is evolutionarily conserved, indicating its fundamental role in developmental processes. Mutations or dysregulation of HMX3 have been linked to significant clinical conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia, where it contributes to aberrant cell differentiation and oncogenic pathways (Wang2004Hmx2; Nagel2020Aberrant; Miller2009Molecular).

## Function
HMX3 (H6 family homeobox 3) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of the vestibular system of the inner ear, which is essential for balance and hearing. It is coexpressed with HMX2 in the dorsolateral otic epithelium during embryogenesis, contributing to the transition of the otocyst into a fully developed vestibular system. The absence of HMX3, as observed in knockout models, results in severe vestibular defects, including the absence of semicircular canals, utriculo-sacular fusion, and degeneration of the vestibule, leading to a complete loss of balance (Wang2004Hmx2; Miller2009Molecular).

HMX3 is also involved in the development of the hypothalamus, where it regulates the expression of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). In knockout mice, the loss of HMX3 leads to disrupted neuroendocrine function, resulting in reduced growth hormone levels and severe postnatal growth retardation (Wang2004Hmx2). The gene's expression in the otic epithelium and its coexpression with HMX2 indicate its role in ear development, with evolutionary conservation suggesting shared regulatory sites and functional redundancy (Nagel2020Aberrant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the HMX3 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant expression of HMX3 is associated with interference in cell differentiation processes in AML, contributing to the disease's pathology. In AML, HMX3 is often co-expressed with HMX2 due to their genomic proximity, and this co-expression is linked to deregulated developmental processes and signaling pathways, such as NFkB and WNT-signaling, which are implicated in leukemic activation (Nagel2020Aberrant). 

HMX3 is identified as a crucial vulnerability factor in MECOM-negative KMT2A::MLLT3 acute myelomonocytic leukemia, where its expression is associated with a distinct gene expression profile specific to leukemia. Silencing HMX3 in these leukemia cells leads to cell cycle arrest, forced differentiation, and apoptosis, indicating its essential role in maintaining the leukemic state (ArzaApalategi2023The). 

Additionally, mutations in transcription factor binding sites of HMX3 can enhance its expression, contributing to the pathogenesis of AML by affecting gene regulation and promoting oncogenic pathways (Nagel2020Aberrant). These findings suggest that HMX3 plays a significant role in the development and progression of certain leukemia subtypes.

## Interactions
HMX3, a homeodomain protein, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its developmental functions. Although typically considered a transcription factor due to its DNA-binding domain, HMX3 can interact with other proteins even in the absence of this domain. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified 539 potential binding partners of mouse HMX3, with several interactions conserved in zebrafish, including Prmt2, Azin1b, Hmgn3, Hmgb1a, and the WDR domain of Tle3b (Haws2023Analyses).

Prmt2 and Tle3b-WDR bind only to the full-length Hmx3a, indicating that their binding sites are located in the C-terminal portion of the protein, which is absent in certain mutants (Haws2023Analyses). Azin1b binds to all truncated proteins, suggesting its binding site is in the N-terminal portion retained by the mutants (Haws2023Analyses). Hmgn3 and Hmgb1a show differential binding affinities to Hmx3a mutants, which may explain the varying phenotypes observed in hmx3a mutants (Haws2023Analyses).

These interactions suggest that HMX3 may function in transcriptional regulation and DNA interaction through its binding partners, rather than solely through direct DNA binding (Haws2023Analyses).
