# PCBD2

## Overview
PCBD2 is a gene that encodes the protein pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase 2, which is involved in the metabolic pathway of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) regeneration. This protein functions as a dehydratase, catalyzing the conversion of pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine to quinonoid dihydrobiopterin, a critical step in maintaining the availability of BH4, an essential cofactor for the hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids and the production of neurotransmitters. PCBD2 is part of a family of proteins that play a role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and signal transduction pathways. The protein's activity is crucial for normal cellular function and has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
