# ACTN3

## Overview
The ACTN3 gene encodes the protein actinin alpha 3 (α-actinin-3), which is a structural protein predominantly expressed in fast-twitch muscle fibers. These fibers are essential for rapid and forceful muscle contractions, making α-actinin-3 crucial for activities that require speed and power, such as sprinting and weightlifting (MacArthur2008An; Lee2016How). As a member of the actinin family, α-actinin-3 is a key component of the Z-line in skeletal muscle fibers, where it plays a vital role in cross-linking actin filaments and maintaining the structural integrity of the sarcomere (MacArthur2004A; Lee2016How). The presence or absence of α-actinin-3, influenced by the R577X polymorphism, significantly affects muscle performance and fiber type composition, with implications for athletic performance and susceptibility to muscle-related conditions (Broos2016Evidence; Seto2013ACTN3).

## Structure
The ACTN3 gene encodes a protein involved in muscle function, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of the ACTN3 protein is a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-level structures. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of ACTN3 results in a compact, three-dimensional shape essential for its role in muscle fibers. In terms of quaternary structure, ACTN3 is known to dimerize, which is crucial for its functional activity in muscle tissue.

ACTN3 contains specific domains, including spectrin repeats and an actin-binding domain, which are vital for its interaction with other proteins and its role in muscle contraction. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common and can influence the protein's function and interactions. The existence of splice variant isoforms of ACTN3 may lead to variations in its function within muscle fibers, potentially affecting muscle performance and adaptation. These structural features and modifications underscore the importance of ACTN3 in muscle physiology and its potential impact on athletic performance.

## Function
The ACTN3 gene encodes the protein α-actinin-3, which is primarily expressed in fast-twitch muscle fibers, also known as type II fibers. These fibers are responsible for rapid and forceful muscle contractions, making α-actinin-3 crucial for activities requiring power and speed, such as sprinting and weightlifting (MacArthur2008An; Lee2016How). α-Actinin-3 is a structural component of the Z-line in skeletal muscle fibers, where it cross-links and anchors actin filaments, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the sarcomere (MacArthur2004A; Lee2016How).

In healthy human cells, α-actinin-3 interacts with several structural, signaling, and metabolic proteins, influencing muscle fiber characteristics and overall muscle performance (Broos2016Evidence). The presence of α-actinin-3 is associated with enhanced muscle performance, particularly in activities requiring speed and power, due to its role in maintaining the fast-twitch muscle phenotype and supporting rapid muscle contractions (Broos2016Evidence; MacArthur2008An). The absence of α-actinin-3, due to the R577X polymorphism, leads to a shift in muscle fiber characteristics towards slow-twitch properties, affecting muscle metabolism and contractile properties (Seto2013ACTN3; Lee2016How).

## Clinical Significance
The ACTN3 gene, encoding the protein α-actinin-3, is clinically significant due to its association with various muscle-related conditions. A common polymorphism, R577X, results in α-actinin-3 deficiency, which has been linked to several muscle disorders. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), ACTN3 deficiency is associated with reduced muscle strength but may confer a protective effect against contraction-induced damage, potentially slowing disease progression (Hogarth2017Evidence). This protective effect is thought to be due to a shift towards a slow-twitch, oxidative muscle phenotype, which is less susceptible to damage (Hogarth2017Evidence).

In McArdle disease, the ACTN3 577X allele appears to enhance exercise capacity in women, suggesting a protective role (Houweling2018Is). The ACTN3 genotype also influences muscle function in inflammatory myopathies and Pompe disease, potentially modifying disease severity and onset (Houweling2018Is).

The absence of α-actinin-3 is linked to increased susceptibility to muscle injuries, particularly in athletes. For instance, professional football players with the 577XX genotype have higher odds of muscle injuries compared to those with the RR genotype (Massidda2019ACTN3). This genotype is also associated with a higher incidence of ankle injuries in dancers (Del2018More).

## Interactions
ACTN3, or actinin alpha 3, is a protein primarily expressed in fast-twitch muscle fibers and plays a significant role in muscle structure and function. It is a major component of the skeletal muscle Z-disk and interacts with various structural, metabolic, and signaling proteins. One of the key interactions of α-actinin-3 is with calsarcin-2, a protein involved in muscle function. Calsarcin-2 has a significantly higher binding affinity for α-actinin-2 compared to α-actinin-3, with a 13.6-fold difference, which influences calcineurin signaling pathways in muscle tissues (Seto2013ACTN3).

In the absence of α-actinin-3, α-actinin-2 compensates by upregulating and competing with calcineurin for binding to calsarcin-2. This competition results in enhanced calcineurin signaling and a shift in muscle fiber properties toward a slow-twitch, oxidative phenotype (Seto2013ACTN3). The interaction of α-actinin-3 with other proteins, such as titin and vinculin, is also noted, although these proteins preferentially bind to α-actinin-2 (Lee2016How). These interactions highlight the specialized roles of α-actinin isoforms in muscle function and their impact on muscle performance, particularly in the context of α-actinin-3 deficiency.
