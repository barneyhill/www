# PCBP4

## Overview
PCBP4, or poly(rC) binding protein 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the KH-domain RNA-binding protein family, which plays a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The protein encoded by PCBP4 is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability, particularly influencing the expression of key cell cycle regulators such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. By binding to the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs, PCBP4 modulates their stability and expression, thereby impacting cell cycle progression and cellular responses to DNA damage. Additionally, PCBP4 functions as a tumor suppressor, with its loss linked to increased tumorigenesis, especially in lung tissue. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as ZFP871 and p53, further underscore its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing cancer development (Scoumanne2010The; Yan2016Mice).

## Structure


## Function
PCBP4, also known as poly(C)-binding protein 4, is a member of the KH-domain RNA-binding protein family involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In healthy human cells, PCBP4 plays a crucial role in regulating the stability of mRNA transcripts, particularly the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. It binds to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the p21 mRNA, reducing its stability and thereby modulating its expression levels. This regulation is important for controlling cell cycle progression and response to DNA damage (Scoumanne2010The).

PCBP4 is also implicated in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, acting as a mediator of p53 tumor suppression. It can induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis independently of p53 by modulating p21 levels, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing tumor development (Scoumanne2010The; Yan2016Mice). In the cytoplasm and nucleus, PCBP4 is involved in mRNA metabolism, including stabilization, splicing, and translation, which are essential for cellular responses to stress and DNA damage (Yan2016Mice).

The loss of PCBP4 expression is associated with increased tumorigenesis, particularly in lung tissue, highlighting its role as a tissue-specific tumor suppressor (Yan2016Mice).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PCBP4 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer development and progression. PCBP4 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its deficiency is linked to increased susceptibility to various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and kidney tumors. In PCBP4-deficient mice, the absence of this gene leads to increased expression of ZFP871, which targets the tumor suppressor protein p53 for degradation, thereby reducing p53 expression and contributing to tumorigenesis (Yan2016Mice).

In human cancers, PCBP4 expression is often reduced in poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting its role in lung cancer development (Yan2016Mice). The loss of PCBP4 expression is frequently associated with chromosome 3p21 loss of heterozygosity, which may cooperate with p53 mutations to promote lung cancer progression (Yan2016Mice).

PCBP4 also plays a role in chemoresistance. In human maxillary cancer cells, PCBP4 contributes to cisplatin resistance by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest, allowing cells to repair DNA damage and avoid apoptosis. Suppression of PCBP4 reduces this resistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin in treating head and neck cancers (Ito2015Suppression).

## Interactions
PCBP4, also known as poly(C)-binding protein 4, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in tumor suppression and cell cycle regulation. PCBP4 interacts with the mRNA of ZFP871, a protein that targets the tumor suppressor p53 for degradation. This interaction affects the stability of ZFP871 mRNA, thereby influencing p53 levels and activity. The loss of PCBP4 leads to increased expression of ZFP871, resulting in enhanced degradation of p53 and increased tumor susceptibility (Yan2016Mice).

PCBP4 also binds to the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the p21 transcript, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, affecting its mRNA stability. This interaction is crucial for the post-transcriptional regulation of p21, as PCBP4 binding decreases the stability and expression of p21 mRNA, thereby modulating cell cycle progression and response to DNA damage (Scoumanne2010The).

These interactions highlight PCBP4's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating key proteins involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis, such as p53 and p21, through mRNA stability and degradation pathways (Scoumanne2010The; Yan2016Mice).
