# RBP4

## Overview
Retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) is a gene that encodes a transport protein belonging to the lipocalin family, which is primarily involved in the mobilization and transport of retinol, an active form of vitamin A, from the liver to various tissues. The protein, also named retinol binding protein 4, plays a critical role in maintaining vitamin A homeostasis and is essential for processes such as vision, growth, and metabolism. RBP4 is synthesized mainly in the liver and adipose tissue and circulates in the bloodstream, where it forms a complex with transthyretin (TTR) to prevent renal filtration and ensure efficient retinol delivery. Beyond its role in retinol transport, RBP4 also functions as a fatty acid-binding protein, implicating it in lipid metabolism. Mutations in the RBP4 gene have been linked to several ocular and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Perduca2018Human; Steinhoff2022Retinoid; Olsen2020Retinol).

## Structure
Retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) is a member of the lipocalin family, characterized by its ability to bind hydrophobic ligands such as retinol and fatty acids. The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 21 kDa and is primarily synthesized in the liver, with additional production in adipose tissue (Perduca2018Human). RBP4's structure includes a single binding site for retinol, and it undergoes conformational changes when retinol is removed, allowing it to bind fatty acids in its central cavity (Perduca2018Human).

The tertiary structure of RBP4 is a compact, globular form that creates a binding pocket for retinol. High-resolution crystal structures have revealed that the apo form of RBP4, which lacks retinol, can bind fatty acids such as palmitic and lauric acid (Perduca2018Human). Key amino acids involved in ligand binding include Leu 35, Phe 36, Met 88, and Tyr 90, which are crucial for the interaction with both retinoids and fatty acids (Perduca2018Human).

RBP4 typically functions as a monomer, indicating it lacks a quaternary structure. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is a crucial transport protein responsible for the mobilization of retinol, an active form of vitamin A, from the liver to various tissues, including adipose tissue, retina, and brain. It is primarily synthesized in the liver and adipose tissue and circulates in the bloodstream, where it binds retinol to facilitate its delivery to cells (Perduca2018Human; Flores‑Cortez2022Interplay). In the bloodstream, RBP4 forms a complex with transthyretin (TTR), which stabilizes the retinol-RBP4 complex and prevents its loss through renal filtration (Flores‑Cortez2022Interplay).

RBP4 plays a significant role in maintaining vitamin A homeostasis, especially during periods of deficient dietary intake, by mobilizing liver stores of vitamin A and ensuring its availability in circulation (Olsen2020Retinol). Once retinol is delivered to target cells, it can be converted into retinaldehyde, essential for vision, or further oxidized into retinoic acid, which acts as a ligand for nuclear receptors involved in growth, development, and metabolism (Olsen2020Retinol). RBP4 also has a dual role as a fatty acid-binding protein, indicating its involvement in lipid metabolism in addition to retinol transport (Perduca2018Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RBP4 gene are associated with several ocular and dermatological conditions. Pathogenic variants can lead to retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by night blindness and progressive vision loss. Specific mutations, like the homozygous c.67C>T variant, result in a truncated, non-functional RBP4 protein, causing retinitis pigmentosa and severe childhood acne vulgaris (CehajicKapetanovic2020A). Another mutation, c.111+1G.A, disrupts a donor splice site, leading to undetectable serum retinol levels and retinal degeneration (Cukras2012Exome).

Alterations in RBP4 expression levels are linked to metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. Overexpression in adipose tissue can cause glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis, while elevated RBP4 levels are associated with hypertension and coronary artery disease (Steinhoff2022Retinoid). In the context of retinal diseases, high-dose vitamin A treatment has shown potential benefits in patients with RBP4-related retinal dystrophy, improving symptoms like night vision and visual field (Smirnov2022Large). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RBP4 in both ocular and systemic health.

## Interactions
Retinol Binding Protein 4 (RBP4) primarily interacts with transthyretin (TTR) in the liver to form a complex that prevents renal filtration and facilitates the transport of retinol in the bloodstream (Cioffi2020Discovery; Steinhoff2022Retinoid). This interaction is crucial for maintaining retinoid homeostasis, as TTR stabilizes the RBP4-retinol complex, protecting it from catabolism and ensuring efficient delivery of retinol to extrahepatic tissues (Steinhoff2022Retinoid).

RBP4 also interacts with the membrane receptor 'stimulated by retinoic acid 6' (STRA6), which is involved in the uptake of retinol into target cells. This interaction is significant in tissues with high retinol demand, such as the retina and reproductive organs (Steinhoff2022Retinoid). STRA6 can activate the JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway, which is implicated in insulin resistance by impairing insulin signaling (Steinhoff2022Retinoid).

Additionally, RBP4 can interact with Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2/4), leading to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines through a signaling cascade involving nuclear factor κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and p38, which further affects insulin sensitivity (Steinhoff2022Retinoid). These interactions highlight RBP4's role in both retinoid transport and metabolic regulation.
