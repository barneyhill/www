# CDH2

## Overview
The CDH2 gene encodes the protein cadherin 2, also known as N-cadherin, which is a type of transmembrane protein crucial for mediating cell-cell adhesion. This protein plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of various tissues, particularly in the neural and skeletal systems. N-cadherin is involved in essential processes such as synaptogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and osteoblast differentiation, contributing to neural connectivity and bone formation. The protein's structure includes extracellular cadherin domains that facilitate its adhesive functions, and it undergoes post-translational modifications necessary for its activity. CDH2's interactions with other proteins, such as β-catenin and neuroligin-1, underscore its importance in synaptic function and cellular signaling pathways. Mutations in the CDH2 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as cardiac conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Marie2013CadherinMediated; Halperin2021CDH2; László2022Flying).

## Structure
The CDH2 gene encodes N-cadherin, a protein involved in cell-cell adhesion. N-cadherin is a 906 amino acid protein that plays a crucial role in synaptogenesis and synapse function (Halperin2021CDH2). The primary structure of N-cadherin includes a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure is characterized by extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, which are composed of repeated motifs of about 110 amino acid residues. These motifs autonomously fold into structural units comprising seven β strands forming two β sheets, similar to the immunoglobulin-like domain (Hulpiau2009Molecular).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, facilitating the protein's function in cell adhesion. The quaternary structure of N-cadherin involves the formation of dimers through a strand exchange at the dimer interface, where a tryptophan residue at position 2 interacts with a hydrophobic pocket in the opposite EC domain (Hulpiau2009Molecular).

N-cadherin undergoes post-translational modifications, including proteolytic cleavage by furin protease, which is crucial for its maturation and function (Halperin2021CDH2). The protein also contains a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail, which are essential for its role in cell adhesion and signaling.

## Function
The CDH2 gene encodes N-cadherin, a protein crucial for cell-cell adhesion and signaling in various tissues, including neural and skeletal systems. In neural development, CDH2 is essential for processes such as neurite outgrowth, axon specification, and synaptogenesis. It promotes the polarization of postmitotic cells and is involved in the recruitment of centrosomes and the formation of the first neurite through PI3K signaling. CDH2 also interacts with the SLIT-ROBO signaling pathway, which is important for axon guidance and targeting, and contributes to synaptic adhesion and spine morphology (László2022Flying).

In the skeletal system, CDH2 plays a significant role in osteoblastogenesis, the process of bone formation by osteoblasts. It is involved in early osteogenic differentiation and modulates cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling, particularly the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. CDH2 interacts with β-catenin, affecting its cytoplasmic pools and transcriptional activity, which influences bone homeostasis by impacting osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (Marie2013CadherinMediated).

CDH2 is active at the cell membrane, where it influences processes like synaptic plasticity and tissue architecture maintenance, playing a vital role in both neural and skeletal development (Marie2013CadherinMediated; László2022Flying).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDH2 gene, which encodes the N-cadherin protein, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. In the context of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), CDH2 is strongly linked due to its critical role in synaptic development, with mutations in the ApoE gene affecting CDH2 functions also associated with ASD (László2022Flying). CDH2 mutations are implicated in a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and callosal malformations, among other symptoms (Accogli2019De). 

In Alzheimer's disease, CDH2 is involved in synaptic plasticity and is affected by amyloid-beta plaques, which decrease its surface level, contributing to synapse loss and cell death (László2022Flying). CDH2 mutations are also linked to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a condition characterized by the replacement of heart muscle with fibrous or fatty tissue, leading to arrhythmias (Mayosi2017Identification). 

Additionally, CDH2 variants have been associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and Tourette disorder (TD), with specific variants affecting protein expression and contributing to these neuropsychiatric conditions (Moya2013Rare; Halperin2021CDH2).

## Interactions
CDH2, or cadherin 2, is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence synaptic function and neuronal migration. It forms intracellular macromolecular complexes with cadherins and catenins, such as β-catenin, which are essential for maintaining cell-to-cell connections and neurite outgrowth (László2022Flying). CDH2 interacts with presynaptic neurexin1β and is crucial for synaptic morphology and function, affecting AMPA-mediated synaptic transmission (László2022Flying).

In synaptic function, CDH2 interacts with neuroligin-1, a postsynaptic protein, through the scaffolding protein S-SCAM. This interaction is vital for the clustering of neuroligin-1 and the accumulation of presynaptic vesicles, which are essential for synaptic maturation and function (Stan2010Essential). CDH2 also interacts with the actin motor MYO10, facilitating its transport to the plasma membrane, and with Drebrin-like (DBNL), which is involved in endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton remodeling (MartinezGaray2020Molecular).

CDH2's interactions extend to the SLIT-ROBO signaling pathway, where it recruits Abelson kinase (ABL) via CABLES, leading to β-catenin phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, affecting transcription and adhesion (László2022Flying). These interactions underscore CDH2's role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal migration.
