# TH

## Overview
The TH gene encodes the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, a critical component in the biosynthesis of catecholamines, which include neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Tyrosine hydroxylase is a member of the tetrahydropterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family and functions as a tetrameric enzyme with a complex regulatory mechanism involving phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA, the rate-limiting step in catecholamine synthesis, and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm of neurons and adrenal medulla cells. The regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase is essential for maintaining neurotransmitter homeostasis, and disruptions in its function are associated with various neurometabolic disorders, including DOPA-responsive dystonia and Parkinson's disease (BuenoCarrasco2022Structural; Tekin2014Complex; Szigetvari2018The).

## Structure
Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is a tetrameric enzyme composed of identical subunits, each containing 498 amino acids and a ferrous iron atom (Daubner1993Expression). The enzyme is part of the tetrahydropterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family, which includes phenylalanine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase (Daubner1993Expression). The primary structure of TH includes distinct domains: an N-terminal regulatory domain (RD), a central catalytic domain (CD), and a C-terminal oligomerization domain (OD) (BuenoCarrasco2022Structural).

The secondary structure of TH features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with the regulatory domain containing a structured ACT domain and a flexible N-terminal tail (BuenoCarrasco2022Structural). The tertiary structure of TH involves the catalytic domain, which contains the active site iron and binding sites for substrate and cofactor (BuenoCarrasco2022Structural). The quaternary structure is a homotetramer, forming a dimer of dimers with P222 symmetry (Szigetvari2018The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at serine 40, play a crucial role in regulating TH activity and stability (BuenoCarrasco2022Structural). Splice variants of TH result in different isoforms, which may have distinct regulatory properties (Bezem2016Stable).

## Function
The human gene TH encodes the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of catecholamines, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of the amino acid tyrosine to L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine, in a rate-limiting step of catecholamine synthesis (BuenoCarrasco2022Structural; Szigetvari2018The). Tyrosine hydroxylase is primarily active in the cytoplasm of neurons and adrenal medulla cells, where it plays a vital role in maintaining normal levels of catecholamines, which are essential for various physiological functions such as motor control, emotion, and stress response (Tekin2014Complex; Szigetvari2018The).

The enzyme's activity is regulated through feedback inhibition by dopamine and phosphorylation at specific serine residues, notably serine 40, which is crucial for reactivating the enzyme after inhibition (Daubner2011Tyrosine; BuenoCarrasco2022Structural). This regulation ensures balanced neurotransmitter levels, preventing neurotoxic accumulation and maintaining dopamine homeostasis in neurons (BuenoCarrasco2022Structural). Disruptions in TH function can lead to neurometabolic diseases characterized by low levels of brain dopamine and norepinephrine, affecting motor functions and leading to conditions such as DOPA-responsive dystonia (Szigetvari2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene are linked to several neurological disorders. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the TH gene, leading to reduced levels of catecholamines such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. This deficiency manifests as dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) and infantile parkinsonism, with symptoms ranging from motor retardation to fluctuating extrapyramidal symptoms and intellectual impairments (Waløen2016Tyrosine; Hoffmann2003Tyrosine). 

Specific mutations, such as R233H, are associated with severe reductions in dopamine levels and often result in poor responses to L-DOPA treatment (Waløen2016Tyrosine). Other mutations, like Q381K, L205P, and R202H, are linked to DRD, affecting the enzyme's activity and impairing dopamine synthesis (Haavik1998Tyrosine). 

Alterations in TH expression and interactions are also implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). While TH mutations are not major genetic determinants in PD, they may influence susceptibility to the disease (Bademci2012Tyrosine). The interaction of TH with proteins like alpha-synuclein can reduce TH activity, contributing to the neurodegenerative processes observed in PD (Tekin2014Complex).

## Interactions
Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) interacts with several proteins that regulate its activity and stability. A significant interaction occurs with the 14-3-3 family of proteins, particularly the 14-3-3γ isoform, which binds to TH when it is phosphorylated at Ser19. This binding is facilitated by CaMPKII and is influenced by cellular stimuli such as depolarization or increased calcium levels. The interaction with 14-3-3 proteins affects the dephosphorylation rates of Ser19 and Ser40, playing a crucial role in TH regulation (Tekin2014Complex; Ghorbani2019Serine).

TH also interacts with α-synuclein, a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's. This interaction reduces TH activity and dopamine content in cells, impacting catecholamine biosynthesis (Tekin2014Complex). Additionally, TH binds to GTP cyclohydrolase I and vesicular monoamine transporter proteins, which are involved in dopamine synthesis and synaptic vesicle filling, respectively (Tekin2014Complex).

The phosphorylation of TH at Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40 is regulated by various kinases and phosphatases, with 14-3-3 proteins modulating these phosphorylation events. This complex regulation involves hierarchical phosphorylation and potential conformational changes within the TH protein (Ghorbani2019Serine).
