# RPP25L

## Overview
RPP25L is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p25-like protein, which is involved in RNA processing and modification. This protein is a component of the ribonucleoprotein complex, playing a role in the maturation of precursor tRNA and rRNA sequences. Although the precise function of the RPP25L-encoded protein within these complexes is not fully understood, it is believed to exhibit functional redundancy with RPP25, another subunit of the RNase P and RNase MRP complexes. This redundancy is evidenced by the ability of RPP25L to compensate for the loss of RPP25 in certain cellular contexts (Köferle2021Interrogation). The protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to essential RNA-based cellular processes. Further studies are required to delineate the specific molecular functions and interactions of the RPP25L protein in human cells.

## Function
RPP25L is a protein that functions as part of the ribonucleoprotein complex involved in RNA processing and modification. It is closely related to RPP25, a known component of the RNase P and RNase MRP ribonuclease complexes, which are essential for processing precursor tRNA and rRNA sequences. Although the specific function of RPP25L in these processes has not been fully validated, studies suggest a functional redundancy between RPP25 and RPP25L. This redundancy is indicated by the ability of RPP25L to compensate for the loss of RPP25, as demonstrated in CRISPR depletion assays where overexpression of either protein rescued sensitivity to RPP25L loss (Köferle2021Interrogation).

RPP25L is active in the nucleolus, where it likely contributes to the maturation of tRNA, a crucial step in the proper functioning of RNA-based cellular processes. The protein's role in these processes is supported by its involvement in the ribonucleoprotein complex, which is essential for RNA processing and modification (Köferle2021Interrogation). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific molecular activities and interactions of RPP25L in healthy human cells.
