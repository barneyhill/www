# FAM110A

## Overview
FAM110A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 110 member A, which plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and mitotic spindle organization. The FAM110A protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein, given its localization to the centrosome and microtubule organizing center during interphase and its accumulation at spindle poles during mitosis. This localization suggests its involvement in maintaining proper mitotic spindle structure, crucial for chromosome segregation and genomic stability (Hauge2007Characterization). The gene is expressed in various tissues and is notably upregulated in CD4+ lymphocytes upon stimulation, indicating its role in T cell expansion (Hauge2007Characterization). FAM110A's expression is cell cycle-regulated, with increased levels during the S and G2/M phases, underscoring its importance in cell cycle commitment and progression (Hauge2007Characterization). Additionally, FAM110A has been implicated in cancer, where its altered expression is associated with poor prognosis and immune response modulation, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhong2023Pancancer).

## Function
FAM110A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in cell cycle regulation and mitotic spindle organization. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, prostate, thymus, and lymphoid tissues, and its expression is notably induced in CD4+ lymphocytes upon stimulation, indicating a role in the expansion of naive T cells (Hauge2007Characterization). FAM110A expression is cell cycle-regulated, with increased levels observed during the S and G2/M phases, suggesting its involvement in cell cycle commitment and progression (Hauge2007Characterization).

The FAM110A protein localizes to the centrosome and microtubule organizing center (MTOC) during interphase and accumulates at spindle poles during mitosis, highlighting its potential role in cell division (Hauge2007Characterization). This localization pattern supports its involvement in maintaining proper mitotic spindle structure, which is crucial for chromosome segregation and genomic stability (Hauge2007Characterization). FAM110A interacts with CSPP, a protein associated with microtubule organization, further suggesting its role in ensuring accurate cell division (Hauge2007Characterization). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with specific accumulation at the centrosome and spindle poles, underscoring its importance in regulating the cell cycle and mitosis (Hauge2007Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
FAM110A has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. Elevated expression of FAM110A is observed in several tumor types, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), where it is associated with poor prognosis and immune response modulation (Zhong2023Pancancer). The gene's expression is linked to immune checkpoint genes such as PD-1 and PD-L1, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment and potential impact on immunotherapy efficacy (Zhong2023Pancancer). 

In bladder cancer, a fusion transcript involving FAM110A and the Ctnnbl1 promoter has been identified, potentially leading to increased FAM110A expression, which may contribute to cancer development (Nordentoft2014Mutational). 

FAM110A expression is also correlated with DNA methylation changes and copy number variations in various cancers, influencing prognosis and survival outcomes (Zhong2023Pancancer). These findings highlight FAM110A's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target, although further research is needed to fully understand its role in cancer progression and immune regulation (Zhong2023Pancancer).

## Interactions
FAM110A is known to interact with the centrosome and microtubule-associated protein CSPP. This interaction was initially identified through a yeast two-hybrid assay, which suggested a potential binding relationship between FAM110A and CSPP, although a direct physical interaction has not been biochemically confirmed (Hauge2007Characterization). FAM110A colocalizes with CSPP at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) during interphase and at aberrant mitotic spindles during mitosis, indicating a possible functional interaction that may influence microtubule dynamics (Hauge2007Characterization).

FAM110A is also associated with cell cycle regulation, with its expression peaking during the G2 phase, similar to other mitotic process-related genes such as cyclin F and Aurora kinases (Hauge2007Characterization). While specific protein interactions remain to be clarified, the localization and expression patterns of FAM110A suggest its involvement in cell cycle-related functions. The protein's role in centrosome and spindle pole localization during cell division further supports its potential interactions with other cell cycle and mitotic proteins (Hauge2007Characterization).
