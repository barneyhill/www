# SLC25A37

## Overview
SLC25A37 is a gene that encodes the protein mitoferrin-1, a member of the solute carrier family 25 (SLC25), which is part of the mitochondrial carrier family. Mitoferrin-1 is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in mitochondrial iron transport, essential for heme and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. This protein is particularly significant in erythroid cells, where it supports hemoglobin production by facilitating iron import into the mitochondrial matrix. The interaction of mitoferrin-1 with the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB10 enhances its stability and function, underscoring the importance of protein-protein interactions in its activity. Mutations or dysregulation of SLC25A37 can lead to various pathological conditions, including sideroblastic anemia and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Ali2022Mitoferrin; Chen2009Abcb10).

## Structure
The SLC25A37 gene encodes the protein mitoferrin-1, a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, specifically the solute carrier family 25 (SLC25). Mitoferrin-1 is characterized by a tripartite structure with six transmembrane alpha-helices, forming a funnel-shaped structure that facilitates the transport of iron across the mitochondrial inner membrane (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). Each of the three homologous domains within the protein contains two hydrophobic regions separated by a hydrophilic sequence, contributing to its unique structural configuration (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational).

The protein's structure is stabilized by salt bridges formed by conserved motifs, which are crucial for its transport mechanism involving conformational changes between different states (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). The interaction domain of mitoferrin-1 with the ABC transporter Abcb10 is located at the N-terminal amino acids 26-50, which is essential for its stability and function in erythroid mitochondria (Chen2009Abcb10).

Mitoferrin-1 is highly expressed in hematopoietic tissues and plays a critical role in erythropoiesis by facilitating iron import necessary for heme and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological; Chen2009Abcb10). The protein's interaction with Abcb10 enhances its stability and function, highlighting the importance of protein-protein interactions in its activity (Chen2009Abcb10).

## Function
SLC25A37, also known as mitoferrin-1, is a mitochondrial iron transporter protein that plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis and heme biosynthesis in human cells. It is primarily active in the inner membrane of mitochondria, where it facilitates the import of ferrous iron (Fe2+) into the mitochondrial matrix. This iron is essential for the synthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters and heme, both of which are vital for the function of various mitochondrial enzymes and proteins (Ali2022Mitoferrin; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

Mitoferrin-1 is particularly important in erythroid cells, where it supports erythroid differentiation and hemoglobin production by ensuring adequate iron supply for heme synthesis. The protein's function is enhanced by its interaction with the ATP-binding cassette transporter Abcb10, which stabilizes mitoferrin-1 and increases its half-life, thereby promoting efficient iron import into mitochondria (Chen2009Abcb10). This interaction is specific to mitoferrin-1 and does not occur with its paralog, mitoferrin-2 (Chen2009Abcb10).

The proper functioning of SLC25A37 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial and cytosolic iron balance, preventing the pathological consequences of iron dysregulation, such as increased reactive oxygen species production and cell death (Ali2022Mitoferrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC25A37 gene, which encodes mitoferrin-1, are linked to several diseases and conditions. Mutations in SLC25A37 are associated with severe anemia, particularly sideroblastic anemia, characterized by defective hemoglobin production and iron accumulation in mitochondria (Ali2022Mitoferrin; Chen2009Abcb10). Dysregulated expression of mitoferrin-1 can lead to defective iron homeostasis, resulting in conditions such as protoporphyria and hepatotoxicity (Ali2022Mitoferrin).

In the context of neurological disorders, downregulation of SLC25A37 has been observed in the hippocampus and peripheral blood of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), suggesting its role as a risk gene for MDD (Huo2016Identification). The gene's expression is significantly associated with the SNP rs6983724, which has been identified as a risk allele for MDD in both European and Chinese populations (Huo2016Identification).

Alterations in SLC25A37 expression are also linked to mitochondrial damage in aging skeletal muscle and have been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (Ali2022Mitoferrin). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLC25A37 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SLC25A37, also known as mitoferrin-1, is a mitochondrial iron transporter that plays a crucial role in iron import into mitochondria, essential for heme and iron-sulfur cluster synthesis. It physically interacts with the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB10, which enhances the stability and function of SLC25A37 in erythroid mitochondria. This interaction is specific and does not occur with mitoferrin-2 (Mfrn2) or another mitochondrial ABC transporter, Abcb6. The binding domain for this interaction is located at the N-terminus of SLC25A37, specifically amino acid residues 26-50 (Chen2009Abcb10).

The interaction between SLC25A37 and ABCB10 is significant for mitochondrial iron importation, as it stabilizes SLC25A37, increasing its half-life and concentration, thereby facilitating iron transport into mitochondria. This process is crucial for erythroid differentiation and heme synthesis in differentiated erythrocytes (Chen2009Abcb10).

SLC25A37 also interacts with SLC25A39, a mitochondrial transporter involved in glutathione uptake. This interaction supports mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by linking iron homeostasis to glutathione transport, which is essential for OXPHOS complex assembly (Shi2022Combinatorial).
