# ZNF12

## Overview
ZNF12 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 12, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for its role in transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its binding to DNA, allowing it to function as a transcription factor. This binding capability enables ZNF12 to regulate gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as differentiation and development (Seite1991Two). Located on chromosome 7p22-21, ZNF12 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcriptional landscape of the cell (Seite1991Two). The gene's mRNA exhibits unique characteristics, including nuclear retention and short poly(A) tails, which are influenced by sequences encoding its zinc finger motifs (Russo2018Sequences). While the specific functions of ZNF12 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its role as a transcription factor suggests it may be crucial for time-specific and stage-specific gene expression, essential for normal cellular function and development (Seite1991Two).

## Function
ZNF12, also known as zinc finger protein 12, is a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to DNA. These proteins typically function as transcription factors, regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences (Seite1991Two). ZNF12 is located on chromosome 7p22-21 and is thought to play a role in the regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level, potentially influencing various cellular processes such as cell differentiation and development (Seite1991Two).

The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcriptional landscape of the cell by interacting with DNA and/or RNA (Seite1991Two). Although specific functions of ZNF12 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its role as a transcription factor suggests it may be involved in regulating time-specific and/or stage-specific gene expression, which is crucial for proper cellular function and development (Seite1991Two). The potential association of zinc finger proteins like ZNF12 with developmental anomalies and neoplasia highlights their importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal outcomes (Seite1991Two).

## Interactions
ZNF12, a member of the zinc finger protein family, is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation through its interactions with nucleic acids. The protein is characterized by its C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which are known for their DNA-binding capabilities. These motifs allow ZNF12 to potentially interact with specific DNA sequences, suggesting a role in gene expression regulation (Seite1991Two). 

The mRNA of ZNF12 exhibits unique characteristics, such as nuclear retention and short poly(A) tails, which are influenced by sequences encoding C2H2 zinc finger motifs. These sequences can inhibit polyadenylation and lead to nuclear retention, indicating a complex interaction with the nuclear export machinery (Russo2018Sequences). Despite these interactions, the study found that hnRNP K, a protein known to interact with C-rich sequences, does not significantly affect the localization of ZNF12 mRNA, suggesting that hnRNP K is not a major component in the nuclear retention pathway for ZNF12 (Russo2018Sequences).

While ZNF12 is implicated in transcriptional regulation, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its mRNA characteristics have not been detailed in the available context.
