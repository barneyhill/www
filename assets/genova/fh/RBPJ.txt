# RBPJ

## Overview
RBPJ is a gene that encodes the recombination signal binding protein for the immunoglobulin kappa J region, a pivotal transcription factor within the Notch signaling pathway. This protein, often referred to as CSL (CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, Lag-1), plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by acting as a molecular switch between transcriptional repression and activation. Structurally, the RBPJ protein is characterized by its three domains: the N-terminal domain, the beta-trefoil domain, and the C-terminal domain, which facilitate its interactions with various coactivators and corepressors (Xu2017RBPJ; Hall2022The). These interactions are essential for its function in diverse biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Xu2017RBPJ; Giaimo2020Transcription). RBPJ's involvement in the Notch signaling pathway underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its implications in various diseases when dysregulated (Ehm2010RBPJκ-Dependent; Giaimo2020Transcription).

## Structure
The RBPJ protein, a key component of the Notch signaling pathway, is composed of three structural domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), the beta-trefoil domain (BTD), and the C-terminal domain (CTD) (Xu2017RBPJ; Hall2022The). These domains are connected in a three-dimensional fold by a single beta-strand that spans all three domains (Hall2022The). The BTD is crucial for interactions with other proteins, such as the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and corepressors like L3MBTL3, which bind through a hydrophobic pocket (Xu2017RBPJ; Hall2022The). 

RBPJ can form quaternary structures by interacting with various coregulators, including coactivators and corepressors, which influence its role as a transcription factor (Giaimo2020Transcription). The interaction with L3MBTL3 involves specific residues in the BTD, and mutations in these residues can significantly affect binding affinity (Hall2022The). The protein's ability to switch between repressor and activator roles is facilitated by its interactions with different protein complexes, which may involve post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context (Giaimo2020Transcription).

## Function
RBPJ is a critical transcription factor in the Notch signaling pathway, acting as a molecular switch that regulates gene expression by toggling between repression and activation states. In the absence of Notch signaling, RBPJ associates with corepressor complexes, including histone demethylases like KDM1A/LSD1, to repress transcription of Notch target genes (Xu2017RBPJ; Giaimo2020Transcription). Upon activation of the Notch pathway, the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) translocates to the nucleus and forms a complex with RBPJ and coactivators such as Mastermind-like (MAML) proteins, converting RBPJ into a transcriptional activator (Giaimo2020Transcription).

RBPJ's dynamic binding to DNA is influenced by the presence of Notch signaling, with inducible binding sites showing increased RBPJ association upon pathway activation (Castel2013Dynamic). This dynamic interaction allows RBPJ to modulate chromatin structure and gene expression in a context-dependent manner, impacting processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Xu2017RBPJ; Giaimo2020Transcription). RBPJ is active in the nucleus and plays a significant role in maintaining normal cellular functions, including T-cell development, angiogenesis, and neural stem cell maintenance (Ehm2010RBPJκ-Dependent; Giaimo2020Transcription).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RBPJ gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), the inactivation of RBPJ in brain pericytes leads to vascular lesions characterized by dilated, hemorrhagic venules and increased inflammation, mimicking defects seen in CCMs (DiéguezHurtado2019Loss). RBPJ deficiency in pericytes also results in significant vascular abnormalities, such as aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, due to impaired brain vascular morphogenesis (DiéguezHurtado2019Loss).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), lower RBPJ expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells correlates with disease severity, suggesting its role in immune response regulation (Chen2024The). RBPJ mutations are linked to Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS), where they disrupt Notch signaling, affecting skeletal and vascular development (Hassed2012RBPJ).

In regulatory T cells, RBPJ deletion leads to a lymphoproliferative disease with a type-2 effector polarized immune response, highlighting its role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Delacher2019Rbpj). In paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), increased RBPJ expression is associated with clonal proliferation, suggesting its involvement in disease pathogenesis (Li2019Abnormal).

## Interactions
RBPJ, also known as CSL, is a key transcription factor in the Notch signaling pathway, engaging in various protein-protein interactions that modulate its function. RBPJ interacts with SHARP, a novel protein identified to bind with RBPJ through a yeast two-hybrid screen. This interaction is crucial for the displacement of RBPJ from the Notch-1 intracellular domain, indicating exclusive binding (Oswald2002SHARP).

RBPJ also interacts with L3MBTL3, an epigenetic reader protein, to repress Notch signaling. This interaction is sensitive to specific mutations in RBPJ, such as F261R, V263R, and A284R, which reduce binding affinity. L3MBTL3 competes with the Notch intracellular domain for RBPJ binding and recruits the histone demethylase KDM1A to repress Notch target genes (Xu2017RBPJ; Hall2022The).

In the context of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, RBPJ interacts with the viral protein EBNA3C, which is essential for the repression of certain genes. This interaction may stabilize RBPJ/EBNA3C complexes on chromatin, enhancing RBPJ's binding to regulatory elements (Kalchschmidt2016EBNA3C).

RBPJ's interaction with the histone demethylase KDM5A is part of the core Notch-RBPJ repressor complex, modulating histone methylation and gene expression (Liefke2010Histone). These interactions highlight RBPJ's versatile role in transcriptional regulation within the Notch signaling pathway.
