# TLE7

## Overview
TLE7, or Transducin-Like Enhancer of Split 7, is a gene that encodes a member of the TLE protein family, which are transcriptional co-repressors involved in various cellular processes. The TLE family member 7 protein is characterized by its role in modulating transcriptional activity by interacting with other transcription factors, thereby influencing gene expression patterns. This protein is part of the broader Groucho/TLE family, which is known for its involvement in the regulation of developmental pathways and cellular differentiation. TLE7, like other members of its family, lacks intrinsic DNA-binding ability and instead exerts its effects through protein-protein interactions, serving as a crucial component in the repression of target genes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
