# SCAMP5

## Overview
SCAMP5 (secretory carrier membrane protein 5) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in membrane trafficking, particularly within the nervous system. The SCAMP5 protein is integral to synaptic vesicle endocytosis, playing a crucial role in maintaining synaptic vesicle recycling during high neuronal activity. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it facilitates the rapid recycling of synaptic vesicles, ensuring efficient neurotransmission (FernándezChacón2000Novel; Zhao2014SCAMP5). SCAMP5 interacts with various proteins, including the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE6, to regulate synaptic vesicle pH and neurotransmitter release, highlighting its importance in synaptic plasticity and function (Lee2021SCAMP5). Mutations in the SCAMP5 gene have been associated with neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy, underscoring its clinical significance (Jiao2020Identification; Zhang2020Deficiency).

## Structure
SCAMP5 (secretory carrier membrane protein 5) is a member of the SCAMP family, characterized by its involvement in membrane trafficking. The protein structure typically includes a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini. SCAMP5, like other SCAMP proteins, contains multiple transmembrane helices, which are integral to its function in vesicle transport. A notable feature of SCAMP5 is the presence of a cytoplasmic loop that includes a conserved E-peptide motif, which is a common characteristic within the SCAMP family. 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to influence the function of SCAMP5, potentially affecting its role in vesicle transport. These modifications can alter the protein's activity and interactions, although specific phosphorylation sites and their functional implications in SCAMP5 are not detailed in the provided context. The structural details regarding the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SCAMP5 are not specified in the available information. Additionally, there is no mention of splice variant isoforms or specific domains beyond the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. The lack of detailed structural data suggests that further research may be necessary to fully elucidate the molecular architecture of SCAMP5.

## Function
SCAMP5 (secretory carrier membrane protein 5) is primarily involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis during high neuronal activity. It plays a critical role in maintaining efficient synaptic vesicle recycling, which is essential for sustained neurotransmission. In neurons, SCAMP5 is highly enriched in synaptic vesicles and is specifically expressed in the brain, indicating its specialized function in synaptic activity (FernándezChacón2000Novel; Zhao2014SCAMP5).

SCAMP5 functions by facilitating the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles, ensuring that exocytosed vesicles are rapidly recycled back into the presynaptic terminal. This process is crucial during periods of high neuronal activity, where the demand for neurotransmitter release is elevated. Knockdown of SCAMP5 results in a significant slowdown of endocytosis, leading to a reduced ratio of endocytosis to exocytosis, particularly during prolonged stimulation (Zhao2014SCAMP5).

SCAMP5 also interacts with NHE6, a Na+/H+ exchanger, to regulate the luminal pH of synaptic vesicles, which influences the amount of neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses. This interaction is vital for presynaptic regulation of glutamate quantal size, both at rest and during synaptic plasticity (Lee2021SCAMP5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SCAMP5 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, and severe neurodevelopmental delay. A de novo missense variant, p.Gly180Trp, has been identified in multiple patients with seizures, severe developmental delay, and ASD-like symptoms. This variant is associated with a regressive course in motor and language abilities and is considered pathogenic due to its absence in major genetic databases and its predicted damaging effect on protein function (Jiao2020Identification; Hubert2019De).

The SCAMP5 R91W mutation has been implicated in pediatric epilepsy and juvenile Parkinson's disease. This mutation disrupts synaptic transmission by increasing excitatory synaptic responses, leading to an imbalance in neuronal network excitability. It affects the interaction between SCAMP5 and synaptotagmin 1, a key protein in the SNARE complex, which is crucial for neurotransmitter release (Zhang2020Deficiency).

In autism, SCAMP5 is considered a candidate gene due to its role in regulating the secretion of large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), which are essential for neuronal communication. Disruptions in SCAMP5 expression, such as those caused by chromosomal translocations, may contribute to the pathogenesis of autism by affecting vesicle trafficking (Castermans2010SCAMP5).

## Interactions
SCAMP5 interacts with several proteins involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. It directly interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6) on synaptic vesicles, a crucial interaction for the recruitment of NHE6 to synaptic vesicles during synaptic plasticity. This interaction is essential for regulating the luminal pH and the quantal size of glutamate release at glutamatergic synapses (Lee2021SCAMP5). SCAMP5 also interacts with synaptotagmin via its cytosolic C-terminal tail, playing a role in calcium-regulated exocytosis of signal-peptide-containing cytokines (Zhao2014SCAMP5). 

In addition to its role in synaptic function, SCAMP5 is involved in the trafficking machinery associated with the IFN-I export pathway, colocalizing with clathrin in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This suggests its involvement in the secretion of IFN-I, a key component in immune response (Ghanem2021Investigations). SCAMP5 also interacts with the organellar Na+/K+/H+ exchanger NHE7, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and yeast two-hybrid screening, indicating its role in regulating trafficking of NHE7 (Lin2005Secretory).
