# FARP2

## Overview
FARP2, or FERM, ARH/RhoGEF and pleckstrin domain protein 2, is a gene that encodes a multi-domain protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neuronal development and bone homeostasis. The protein encoded by FARP2 functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RhoGTPases, which are pivotal in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, thereby influencing cell shape and motility. It is characterized by a conserved domain architecture, including a FERM domain, a Dbl-homology (DH) domain, and two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which facilitate its role in axon guidance and dendritic spine formation through interactions with PlexinA family members. FARP2's involvement extends to the regulation of bone homeostasis via Plexin-mediated pathways, and it is active in both the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane. The gene's mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and developmental disorders, underscoring its significance in both health and disease (Gavril2023Genotype–Phenotype; Khoruddin2021Pathogenic; Kuo2018Structural).

## Structure


## Function
FARP2 (FERM, ARH/RhoGEF and pleckstrin domain protein 2) is a multi-domain protein that plays a significant role in neuronal development. It functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RhoGTPases, which are critical in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, influencing cell shape and motility (Kuo2018Structural). FARP2 is involved in axon guidance and dendritic spine formation by interacting with PlexinA family members, contributing to Plexin-mediated repulsive axon guidance and dendritic development (Kuo2018Structural). 

The protein contains a conserved domain architecture, including a N-terminal FERM domain, a Dbl-homology (DH) domain, and two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. The FERM domain is crucial for membrane localization and protein interactions, while the DH-PH tandem is characteristic of Dbl-family GEFs for RhoGTPases (Kuo2018Structural). FARP2 may act as a 'pseudo-GEF,' potentially regulating RhoGTPases through indirect mechanisms due to an autoinhibited conformation that blocks the RhoGTPase-binding site (Kuo2018Structural).

In addition to its role in neuronal development, FARP2 is implicated in the regulation of bone homeostasis through Plexin-mediated pathways (Kuo2018Structural). It is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it influences cell shape and motility (Kuo2018Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FARP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in FARP2 are associated with increased cancer risks, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These mutations may disrupt the activity of the MYC protein, a proto-oncogene involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis, potentially contributing to cancer development (Cho2010Recent; Khoruddin2021Pathogenic). FARP2 is also involved in the Sema3A-Nrp1/PlxnA4 signaling pathway, and mutations may affect axonal and dendritic morphologies, further linking it to cancer risks (Khoruddin2021Pathogenic).

In 2q37-deletion syndrome, FARP2 is considered a candidate gene for facial dysmorphism, brachydactyly, and behavioral disorders. Haploinsufficiency of FARP2 has been suggested as a potential cause of autism in some cases of this syndrome (Gavril2023Genotype–Phenotype). Additionally, FARP2 mutations are associated with abnormal bone trabecular morphology due to altered osteoclast function, contributing to skeletal malformations observed in 2q37-deletion syndrome (Leroy2012The). These findings highlight the gene's role in both oncological and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
FARP2 (FERM, ARH/RhoGEF, and pleckstrin domain protein 2) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the Plexin-A family, including Plexin-A1, Plexin-A2, Plexin-A3, and Plexin-A4, which are important for axon guidance and dendritic development (Khoruddin2021Pathogenic; Kuo2018Structural). FARP2 also interacts with the small GTPase Rac1, acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to regulate dendrite morphogenesis in cortical neurons (Danelon2020Modular).

In the Sema3A-Nrp1/PlxnA4 signaling pathway, FARP2 interacts with neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and semaphorin-3A (SEMA3A), which are essential for controlling dendritic morphogenesis (Khoruddin2021Pathogenic). The interaction with the KRK motif in the PlxnA4 receptor is crucial for Sema3A-mediated dendritic elaboration (Danelon2020Modular).

FARP2 also interacts with the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (SRC), with molecular docking analysis showing differences in binding affinities between native and mutant forms of FARP2. The native form has a binding affinity of -8.2 kcal/mol, while the mutant form has a reduced affinity of -7.8 kcal/mol, indicating a potential disruption in protein interaction (Khoruddin2021Pathogenic).
