# ARHGAP10

## Overview
ARHGAP10 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase activating protein 10, a crucial regulator of Rho family GTPases. This protein is categorized as a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) and is involved in the inactivation of Rho GTPases by catalyzing the conversion of their active GTP-bound form to an inactive GDP-bound state. The ARHGAP10 protein is composed of several conserved domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a RhoGAP domain, and a PDZ domain, which facilitate its role in cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and migration (Rosa2018ARHGAP21; Sanchez2002ARHGAP10). It is widely expressed in human tissues, with particularly high levels in the brain and muscle, indicating its significant role in cell differentiation and neural function (Sanchez2002ARHGAP10). The protein's interactions and activity are modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which further influence its involvement in various cellular processes (Aspenström2018BAR).

## Structure
The ARHGAP10 protein, encoded by the ARHGAP10 gene, is a Rho GTPase-activating protein involved in the regulation of Rho family GTPases. It is composed of 1957 amino acids and contains several conserved domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a RhoGAP domain, and a PDZ domain (Rosa2018ARHGAP21; Sanchez2002ARHGAP10). The PH domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and may interact with filamentous actin, although it does not bind phosphoinositides (Rosa2018ARHGAP21; Ménétrey2007Structural). The RhoGAP domain is responsible for the protein's primary function of regulating Rho GTPases, specifically RhoA, RhoC, and Cdc42 (Rosa2018ARHGAP21). The PDZ domain is known for mediating protein-protein interactions and contains a unique P-loop motif that allows it to bind GTP and ATP directly (Rosa2018ARHGAP21).

ARHGAP10 also includes a SH3 domain, which interacts with proline-rich regions in other proteins, such as the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (Aspenström2018BAR). The protein's structure and domain organization suggest its involvement in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and migration (Liu2019&lt; ARHGAP10; Aspenström2018BAR; p&gt). The protein's activity and interactions can be modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation (Aspenström2018BAR). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific folds, or splice variant isoforms of ARHGAP10 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ARHGAP10 gene encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein that plays a crucial role in cellular processes by catalyzing the conversion of active GTP-bound Rho GTPases to their inactive GDP-bound form. This action suppresses various Rho GTPase-mediated cellular processes, including cell cytoskeleton organization, migration, gene transcription, adhesion, cellular proliferation, and survival (Sekiguchi2020ARHGAP10; Luo2016ARHGAP10). ARHGAP10 is widely expressed in human tissues, with particularly high expression levels in the brain and muscle, which are highly differentiated tissues, suggesting its significant role in cell differentiation (Sanchez2002ARHGAP10).

In healthy cells, ARHGAP10 is involved in the regulation of RhoA, a small GTPase, which is crucial for various cellular processes. It functions to inactivate RhoA, maintaining its proper regulation, which is important for maintaining normal cellular functions (Sekiguchi2020ARHGAP10). The protein contains several conserved domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a Rho-GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP) domain, and a PDZ domain, which suggest its involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell signaling (Sanchez2002ARHGAP10). ARHGAP10's role in regulating Rho GTPases is essential for maintaining normal cellular and neural functions (Sekiguchi2020ARHGAP10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARHGAP10 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions. In schizophrenia, exonic copy number variations (CNVs) in ARHGAP10 have been significantly associated with the disorder, particularly in Japanese patients. These CNVs often involve deletions that affect functional domains of the ARHGAP10 protein, such as the RhoGAP domain, leading to decreased mRNA levels and impaired interaction with RhoA, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Sekiguchi2020ARHGAP10). A specific missense variant, p.S490P, has been identified in patients with schizophrenia, although its allele frequency is low and not significantly associated with the disorder (Sekiguchi2020ARHGAP10).

In animal models, mice carrying the ARHGAP10 S490P mutation exhibit increased neuronal complexity and spine density, as well as cognitive impairments when exposed to methamphetamine, suggesting a link between ARHGAP10 mutations and cognitive vulnerability (Hada2021Mice). Additionally, ARHGAP10 has been identified as a novel autoantibody target in autoimmune encephalitis, with specific autoantibodies against ARHGAP10 found in patients, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for this condition (Jarius2022Rho). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ARHGAP10 in various neurological disorders.

## Interactions
ARHGAP10, a Rho GTPase-activating protein, participates in several interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with α-catenin at cell-cell junctions, and its knockdown disrupts the recruitment of α-catenin to these junctions, affecting cell adhesion (Aspenström2018BAR). ARHGAP10 also interacts with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2 through its SH3 domain, binding to a proline-rich stretch in Pyk2. This interaction results in the phosphorylation of ARHGAP10 by Pyk2, which decreases its Cdc42-GAP activity (Aspenström2018BAR).

ARHGAP10 is known to bind with Cdc42, a Rho GTPase, inhibiting its activity. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, as ARHGAP10 overexpression in ovarian cancer cells leads to reduced Cdc42 activity, which is associated with decreased cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion (Luo2016ARHGAP10). Additionally, ARHGAP10 interacts with the activated fragment of PAK2, known as PAK2p34, leading to decreased kinase activity and a reduced apoptotic response (Aspenström2018BAR). These interactions highlight ARHGAP10's role in modulating signaling pathways and cellular dynamics through its interactions with key proteins.
