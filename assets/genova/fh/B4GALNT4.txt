# B4GALNT4

## Overview
B4GALNT4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase 4, which is a member of the β4-galactosyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in glycosylation processes, where it facilitates the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to specific substrates, playing a crucial role in the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. These glycosylation activities are essential for various cellular functions, including cell-cell communication, signaling, and maintaining cell membrane stability, with the enzyme being predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus (Nakane2019Identification; Shaoqin2022Pancancer). B4GALNT4 is expressed in a limited number of tissues, such as the brain, colon, and ovaries, indicating its specialized roles in these areas (Nakane2019Identification). The gene's expression and activity are critical for the proper functioning of glycoproteins, which are involved in numerous biological processes, including immune response and cellular interactions. Additionally, B4GALNT4 has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression and genetic mutations are associated with poor prognosis and immune modulation, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Zhang2023Identification; Shaoqin2022Pancancer).

## Function
The B4GALNT4 gene encodes the enzyme beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase 4, which is involved in glycosylation processes. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to specific substrates, contributing to the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. It plays a role in cell-cell communication, signaling, and maintaining cell membrane stability, primarily active in the Golgi apparatus. B4GALNT4 is responsible for synthesizing type-II LacdiNAc structures on extracellular glycoproteins, which are important for various cellular functions (Nakane2019Identification). The enzyme is part of the β4-galactosyltransferase family and is involved in glycan metabolism, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes (Shaoqin2022Pancancer). In healthy human cells, B4GALNT4 is expressed in a limited number of tissues, such as the brain, colon, and ovaries, indicating its specialized roles in these areas (Nakane2019Identification). The gene's expression and activity are essential for the proper functioning of glycoproteins, which are involved in various biological processes, including immune response and cellular interactions.

## Clinical Significance
The B4GALNT4 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and genetic mutations. High expression of B4GALNT4 is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and prostate cancer (PRAD), where it correlates with poor overall survival and disease-free survival (Shaoqin2022Pancancer). In prostate cancer, B4GALNT4 is linked to cuproptosis, a form of cell death induced by copper ions, and its knockdown affects cancer-related pathways such as PI3K-Akt and Wnt signaling, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene (Zhang2023Identification).

B4GALNT4 expression is also associated with immune modulation, as it negatively correlates with immune infiltration in cancers like glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (Shaoqin2022Pancancer). Genetic alterations, including loss-of-function mutations and copy number deletions, are common in cancers such as uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), further highlighting its clinical significance (Shaoqin2022Pancancer). These findings suggest that B4GALNT4 may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer.
