# TRIM55

## Overview
TRIM55, also known as muscle-specific RING finger protein 2 (MuRF2), is a gene that encodes the tripartite motif containing 55 protein, a member of the TRIM family characterized by a RING zinc finger domain. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of target proteins, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis in muscle tissues (Luo2024TRIM55; Heliste2020Genetic). TRIM55 is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles, where it plays a vital role in sarcomere assembly and the transduction of mechanical stress, contributing to muscle integrity and function (Prestes2016Tripartite; Heliste2020Genetic). The protein's interactions with various cellular components, including its involvement in autophagy and calcium ion regulation, underscore its importance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions such as heart failure and cancer (Hatakeyama2017TRIM; Heliste2020Genetic).

## Structure
TRIM55, also known as MURF2, is a protein encoded by the TRIM55 gene and is part of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. This protein is characterized by a RING zinc finger domain, which is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of target proteins (Luo2024TRIM55; Heliste2020Genetic). TRIM55 is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle tissues and plays a significant role in muscle sarcomere assembly and the transduction of mechanical stress (Prestes2016Tripartite; Heliste2020Genetic).

The protein structure includes a B2 domain, which is involved in dimerization. The E140K variant, located on the surface of the protein, affects the dimer interface and alters the surface charge, potentially disrupting oligomer formation and heterodimeric interactions (Heliste2020Genetic). This variant is associated with a loss of ionic interactions, which are crucial for the protein's structural integrity and function (Heliste2020Genetic).

TRIM55 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. The presence of splice variant isoforms could also affect its functional properties, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
TRIM55, also known as MURF2, is a protein highly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle, where it plays a critical role in muscle sarcomere assembly and function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Heliste2020Genetic). It is involved in the regulation of sarcomeric protein turnover, which is essential for maintaining muscle integrity and function (Prestes2016Tripartite). TRIM55 interacts with proteins such as SRF, p62, and cardiac troponin I, suggesting its involvement in a complex regulatory network that maintains proper protein expression and organization in sarcomeres (Heliste2020Genetic).

In healthy cells, TRIM55 is implicated in the regulation of calcium ion handling, contributing to normal cardiac function by maintaining proper calcium transient amplitudes (Heliste2020Genetic). It also plays a role in modulating the susceptibility and phenotype of heart failure, as its deletion or mutation can lead to hypertrophic responses and affect cell cycle progression (Heliste2020Genetic). TRIM55's function in autophagy is highlighted by its interaction with the autophagy receptor p62, indicating its role in the turnover and maintenance of muscle proteins (Hatakeyama2017TRIM).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRIM55 gene, particularly the E140K variant, have been implicated in heart failure. This variant is associated with reduced cellular viability, impaired cardiac contractility, and a significant hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes, suggesting a potential role in predisposing individuals to heart failure (Heliste2020Genetic). Functional studies indicate that the E140K variant may act as a dominant negative, disrupting normal TRIM55 functions and affecting the organization of myofibrils, which could contribute to heart failure pathology (Heliste2020Genetic). The variant also appears to alter the subcellular localization of the serum response factor (SRF), impacting SRF-related signaling pathways (Heliste2020Genetic).

In colorectal cancer, TRIM55 interacts with β-catenin, where it functions as a K48-specific ubiquitin ligase, promoting β-catenin degradation. Alterations in TRIM55 expression can influence cancer progression by affecting β-catenin stability and ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. CRYAB, a chaperone protein, can inhibit TRIM55-mediated β-catenin degradation, thereby promoting cancer cell survival and progression (Xia2024CRYAB). These findings suggest that TRIM55 plays a significant role in both cardiac and cancer-related pathologies.

## Interactions
TRIM55, also known as muscle-specific RING finger protein 2 (MuRF2), is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It forms complexes with other TRIM proteins, such as TRIM23, TRIM27, TRIM55 itself, and TRIM63, which may influence its role in cellular processes (Hatakeyama2017TRIM). The E140K variant of TRIM55 affects its ability to form higher-order oligomers and heterodimeric complexes, which are essential for its function, particularly in the context of heart failure (Heliste2020Genetic).

TRIM55 interacts with several proteins involved in cardiac and cancer-related pathways. In heart failure, the E140K variant impacts the interaction with serum response factor (SRF), reducing its nuclear localization and affecting cardiac function (Heliste2020Genetic). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TRIM55 interacts with NF90, promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction affects the stability of mRNAs for HIF1α and TGF-β2, thereby modulating the HIF1α/VEGF and TGFβ/Smad signaling pathways (Luo2024TRIM55). In colorectal cancer, TRIM55 targets β-catenin for degradation via K48-linked ubiquitination, a process inhibited by CRYAB, which blocks TRIM55's binding to β-catenin (Xia2024CRYAB). These interactions highlight TRIM55's role in regulating protein stability and signaling pathways across different tissues.
