# SEC16A

## Overview
SEC16A is a gene that encodes the protein SEC16 homolog A, an endoplasmic reticulum export factor that plays a pivotal role in the cellular process of protein trafficking. This protein is integral to the organization of endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES) and acts as a scaffold for the assembly of COPII coat components, which are essential for the budding of vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. As a key player in vesicle formation and protein trafficking, SEC16A is involved in various cellular processes, including the insulin-stimulated trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in adipocytes, where it functions as a RAB10 effector. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as TANGO1 and ubiquitin ligases, further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular secretion processes. Alterations in the SEC16A gene have been linked to several diseases, including familial axial spondyloarthritis and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Budnik2011Characterization; Bruno2016SEC16A; O’Rielly2015Private).

## Function
The SEC16A gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the trafficking of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus by organizing the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES). SEC16A acts as a scaffold for the assembly of COPII coat components, which are essential for the budding of vesicles from the ER. This process is crucial for the transport of newly synthesized proteins and lipids to the Golgi apparatus, facilitating efficient ER-to-Golgi transport (Budnik2011Characterization; Sprangers2015SEC16).

In adipocytes, SEC16A is specifically involved in the insulin-stimulated trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT4. It functions as a RAB10 effector, promoting the formation of GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs) necessary for GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation. This process is vital for glucose uptake in adipocytes and muscle cells, contributing to whole-body glucose homeostasis (Bruno2016SEC16A). SEC16A's role in GLUT4 trafficking is independent of its function in ER exit site formation, indicating specialized roles in different cellular contexts (Bruno2016SEC16A). The protein is localized near GLUT4 in the perinuclear recycling endosome/trans-Golgi network compartment, highlighting its involvement in the biogenesis of GSVs (Bruno2016SEC16A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SEC16A gene have been implicated in several diseases. In familial axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), rare deletions in SEC16A have been identified, which may interfere with the protein's secondary structure and its interaction with other proteins involved in COPII vesicle assembly. These deletions, particularly when combined with the HLA-B*27 allele, may increase susceptibility to AxSpA (O’Rielly2015Private). SEC16A variants have also been associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (O’Rielly2015Private).

In cancer, SEC16A is involved in the regulation of growth factor signaling and cell proliferation. Alterations in SEC16A expression levels can influence the number of endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES), affecting cell proliferation. Increased expression of SEC16A is linked to enhanced proliferation, while decreased expression reduces it, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Robinson2024ER). SEC16A's involvement in secretion pathways is also significant in cystic fibrosis, where it is crucial for the unconventional secretion of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Disruption of SEC16A can impair CFTR trafficking, which is relevant for therapeutic strategies targeting cystic fibrosis (Piao2017Sec16A).

## Interactions
SEC16A is involved in various protein interactions essential for its role in vesicle formation and trafficking. It interacts with RAB10, a small GTPase, to regulate GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes. This interaction is crucial for the biogenesis of GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs) and their translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation (Bruno2016SEC16A). SEC16A also interacts with components of the COPII vesicle coat, such as SEC23A and SEC13, to facilitate protein export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Bruno2016SEC16A).

In the context of ER exit site organization, SEC16A is recruited by TANGO1, a membrane-spanning protein, to scaffold other COPII components at these sites. This interaction is mediated through the ELD domain of SEC16A and the PRD domain of TANGO1, highlighting its role in efficient secretion processes (Maeda2017TANGO1). SEC16A also interacts with ubiquitin ligases like RNF183 and RNF152, playing a role in their stability and localization, which is crucial for their transport from the ER (Wu2018Sec16A).

These interactions underscore SEC16A's multifaceted role in vesicle formation, protein trafficking, and cellular secretion processes.
