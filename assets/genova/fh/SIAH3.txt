# SIAH3

## Overview
SIAH3 is a gene that encodes the protein siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 3, which is part of the SIAH family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Unlike other members of this family, such as SIAH1 and SIAH2, the SIAH3 protein is characterized by the absence of a functional RING domain, rendering it enzymatically inactive as an E3 ligase (Pepper2017Phylogenetic). Despite this, SIAH3 may play a regulatory role by acting as an endogenous inhibitor of its paralogs, potentially influencing pathways involved in cell proliferation and cancer progression (Pepper2017Phylogenetic). The protein is primarily localized to mitochondria, where it is implicated in the regulation of mitophagy, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial quality and cellular energy balance (Zhang2017The). SIAH3's unique structural features, including a single zinc finger in the SZF domain, suggest distinct interaction capabilities that may contribute to its specialized functions in tumor biology and other cellular processes (Pepper2017Phylogenetic).

## Structure
The SIAH3 protein is a member of the vertebrate SIAH family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, characterized by its divergence from other family members like SIAH1 and SIAH2. Unlike these proteins, SIAH3 lacks a functional RING domain, which is typically crucial for E3 ligase activity, suggesting that SIAH3 is enzymatically inactive (Pepper2017Phylogenetic). The protein contains a single zinc finger in the SZF domain, compared to the double zinc finger motif found in SIAH1 and SIAH2 (Pepper2017Phylogenetic). 

SIAH3 has a compact substrate binding domain (SBD) structure, with a root mean square deviation of 0.38 Å for 118 Cα atoms compared to SIAH1, indicating a similar conformation but with differences in charge and residue composition (Zhang2017The). The protein includes four distinct functional motifs: S3UNS, SZF, SBS, and DIMER domains (Pepper2017Phylogenetic). The DIMER domain may allow SIAH3 to function as an inhibitor of SIAH1 and SIAH2 by binding to them (Pepper2017Phylogenetic). SIAH3 also contains a histidine-rich region within the SZF domain (Pepper2017Phylogenetic). The protein's structure and motifs suggest potential roles in tumor biology, although its exact biochemical functions remain under investigation (Pepper2017Phylogenetic).

## Function
SIAH3 is a member of the SIAH family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which are involved in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Unlike its paralogs SIAH1 and SIAH2, SIAH3 lacks a functional RING domain, rendering it enzymatically inactive as an E3 ligase (Pepper2017Phylogenetic). Despite this, SIAH3 may function as an endogenous inhibitor of SIAH1 and SIAH2, potentially regulating their activities in the RAS signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and cancer progression (Pepper2017Phylogenetic).

SIAH3 is expressed in a limited subset of human tumor cell lines, suggesting a unique role in tumor biology distinct from the universally expressed SIAH1 and SIAH2 (Pepper2017Phylogenetic). It is primarily localized on mitochondria, where it is involved in regulating mitophagy, a process critical for mitochondrial quality control and cellular energy regulation (Zhang2017The). The protein's DIMER domain is conserved, which may facilitate its role as a specific inhibitor of SIAH1 and SIAH2, offering potential therapeutic avenues for targeting oncogenic K-RAS-driven cancers (Pepper2017Phylogenetic).

## Clinical Significance
The SIAH3 gene, part of the SIAH E3 ubiquitin ligase family, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in protein degradation. In Huntington's Disease (HD), SIAH3 is significantly up-regulated in a transgenic sheep model, suggesting its involvement in the formation of protein aggregates characteristic of HD. This up-regulation indicates a potential alteration in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein homeostasis in the brain (Handley2017Brain).

In cancer, SIAH3 has been associated with structural rearrangements and gene fusions. In retinoblastoma, a fusion between RB1 and SIAH3 results in a chimeric protein that truncates RB1, leading to the loss of its tumor suppressor function. This fusion is implicated in the pathogenesis of retinoblastoma by contributing to the inactivation of RB1, a critical event in tumor development (Schieffer2021Molecular).

In metastatic prostate cancer, SIAH3 is located in a region of chromosomal deletion, although its specific clinical significance in this context remains unclear. The deletion suggests a potential role in tumorigenesis, but further research is needed to elucidate its exact impact (Robbins2010Copy).

## Interactions
SIAH3, a member of the SIAH family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, participates in several interactions that influence its function and regulation. In the context of renal fibrosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD), SIAH3 interacts with PINK1, a protein involved in mitophagy. SIAH3 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that marks PINK1 for degradation, thereby inhibiting its accumulation on damaged mitochondria and affecting the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway. This interaction is modulated by miR-4516, which suppresses SIAH3 expression, leading to increased PINK1 stability and enhanced mitophagy (Yoon2021Melatonin).

SIAH3 is also suggested to interact with other members of the SIAH family, such as SIAH1 and SIAH2. Although SIAH3 lacks functional E3 ligase activity, it may act as an endogenous inhibitor of SIAH1 and SIAH2 through its DIMER domain, potentially regulating their biological activity and impacting cell proliferation and tissue growth (Pepper2017Phylogenetic). Despite its lack of a functional RING domain, SIAH3's unique structural features, such as a single Zinc finger in the SZF domain, suggest it may have distinct interaction capabilities compared to SIAH1 and SIAH2 (Pepper2017Phylogenetic).
