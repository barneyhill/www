# MIX23

## Overview
MIX23 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial matrix import factor 23, a protein integral to mitochondrial function. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial import factor, playing a pivotal role in the import and proper localization of proteins within the mitochondria. It is particularly involved in the Mia40 import pathway, which is essential for the translocation of cysteine-rich proteins into the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The mitochondrial matrix import factor 23 interacts with various proteins, including AFG3L2, AIFM1, SCO1, and cytochrome c, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial biogenesis and proteostasis. The protein's function is dependent on the formation of disulfide bonds, facilitated by Mia40, and its activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial protein translocation efficiency (Zöller2020The).

## Interactions
Mix23, also known as mitochondrial matrix import factor 23, is involved in several interactions within the mitochondrial intermembrane space. It is a substrate of the Mia40 import pathway, which is crucial for importing cysteine-containing proteins into the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Mix23 interacts with proteins such as AFG3L2, AIFM1, SCO1, and cytochrome c, as identified in high-throughput interaction studies, suggesting its role in mitochondrial biogenesis and proteostasis (Zöller2020The).

Mix23 is suggested to facilitate the import of presequence-containing proteins, potentially through interactions with the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) or the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM23) subunits. These interactions may involve the IMS-exposed regions of these translocases, affecting the local distribution and interaction of translocases with proteins and lipids of the mitochondrial membranes (Zöller2020The).

The protein's import into mitochondria is dependent on the formation of disulfide bonds catalyzed by Mia40, and its cysteine residues are crucial for this process. High levels of Mix23 can lead to a severe growth defect in yeast cells, likely due to clogging of the import machinery, indicating its significant role in mitochondrial protein translocation (Zöller2020The).
