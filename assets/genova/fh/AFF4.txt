# AFF4

## Overview
AFF4 is a gene that encodes the ALF transcription elongation factor 4, a scaffold protein integral to the super elongation complex (SEC), which is pivotal in the regulation of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II. The AFF4 protein is characterized by its intrinsically disordered structure, which facilitates interactions with various transcription factors and components of the SEC, such as P-TEFb, ELL2, and ENL/AF9. These interactions are crucial for the release of RNA polymerase II from promoter-proximal pausing, thereby enhancing the transcription of protein-coding genes. AFF4 is involved in diverse biological processes, including adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, and plays a significant role in the transactivation of HIV-1 transcription. Clinically, mutations in the AFF4 gene are linked to CHOPS syndrome, and its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, including leukemia and colorectal cancer, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Fang2022AFF4; Chen2019Structure; Izumi2015Germline).

## Structure
The AFF4 protein is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, lacking a defined secondary or tertiary structure. It consists of nearly 1,200 amino acids, with the majority of its sequence being disordered, particularly in the first 900 residues (Chou2012HIV-1). This disordered region is rich in hydrophilic residues and glycine, contributing to its flexible, unfolded structure (Chou2012HIV-1). Despite its lack of a stable structure, AFF4 contains specific short hydrophobic segments that facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as CycT1, ELL2, and ENL/AF9 (Chou2012HIV-1).

The protein's structure includes a CHD domain that forms a homodimer through interactions involving hydrophobic residues like His1090 and Tyr1096 (Li2021Structure). AFF4 also contains an ALF (AF4/LAF4/FMR2) homology domain, which is crucial for its function and is affected by mutations linked to CHOPS syndrome (Izumi2015Germline).

AFF4's quaternary structure involves its role as a scaffold in the Super Elongation Complex (SEC), where it coordinates multiple transcription elongation factors. It binds to P-TEFb, ELL2, and ENL/AF9 through distinct segments, facilitating the assembly of these complexes (Chou2012HIV-1). The interaction with P-TEFb is enhanced by the presence of HIV-1 Tat, which increases the binding affinity (Alber2013The).

## Function
The AFF4 gene encodes a scaffold protein that is a critical component of the super elongation complex (SEC), which plays a vital role in transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II. This process is essential for the efficient transcription of protein-coding genes, as AFF4 facilitates the release of RNA polymerase II from promoter-proximal pausing, a crucial step in gene expression (Chen2019Structure). AFF4 is involved in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation by targeting autophagy, a cellular degradation process important for adipogenesis. It influences the transcription of autophagy-related genes such as ATG5 and ATG16L1, which are essential for autophagosome formation, thereby promoting adipocyte development (Chen2022AFF4).

In addition to its role in adipogenesis, AFF4 is implicated in osteogenic differentiation. It regulates the expression of ALKBH1, a critical epigenetic factor, enhancing osteogenic potential in human dental follicle cells (Xiao2020AFF4). AFF4 is also involved in the transactivation of HIV-1 transcription and interacts with various SEC components, including P-TEFb, ELL2, and ENL/AF9, through its N-terminal domain (Chen2019Structure). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, impacting various cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Melko2011Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AFF4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. Germline gain-of-function mutations in AFF4 are associated with CHOPS syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by cognitive impairment, coarse facial features, heart defects, obesity, pulmonary involvement, short stature, and skeletal dysplasia. These mutations lead to increased levels of the AFF4 protein, resulting in the upregulation of genes such as MYC and JUN, which are involved in transcriptional regulation during embryogenesis (Izumi2015Germline).

In the context of cancer, AFF4 plays a role in leukemia, particularly in association with MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) translocations. AFF4 is a component of the super elongation complex (SEC) and is involved in the transcriptional regulation of MLL target genes like HOXA9 and HOXA10. Its involvement in these processes suggests a critical role in leukemogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in leukemia (Lin2010AFF4).

AFF4 is also implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC), where it is significantly downregulated in CRC tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential, suggesting that AFF4 may act as a tumor suppressor in CRC (Fang2022AFF4). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), AFF4 is upregulated and promotes tumor progression by regulating the expression of the SOX2 gene, enhancing cancer cell proliferation and stemness (Deng2018AFF4).

## Interactions
AFF4 (ALF transcription elongation factor 4) is a scaffold protein within the super elongation complex (SEC), playing a crucial role in transcriptional elongation by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. AFF4 interacts with the Cyclin-dependent kinase CDK9 and Cyclin T (CycT1 or T2), collectively known as P-TEFb, as well as RNA polymerase elongation factors ELL1 or ELL2 (Qi2017Structural). It serves as a scaffold for the assembly of SEC subunits, including CycT1, ELL2, ENL, and AF9, facilitating the recruitment of these components to the HIV-1 promoter (SchulzeGahmen2014AFF4; Chou2012HIV-1).

AFF4's interactions are mediated through its intrinsically disordered regions, which contain short hydrophobic clusters that recruit SEC components (Chou2012HIV-1). The C-terminal homology domain (CHD) of AFF4 is involved in forming homodimers and heterodimers with AFF1, and it interacts with nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA, with a preference for RNA (Chen2019Structure). The CHD also serves as a substrate for phosphorylation by P-TEFb, which influences its interactions with nucleic acids (Chen2019Structure).

AFF4's interactions with Tat and CycT1 enhance the binding affinity of Tat-P-TEFb for TAR RNA, which is crucial for HIV transcription (SchulzeGahmen2014AFF4). These interactions are essential for the function of the SEC in promoting HIV-1 transcription elongation (Qi2017Structural).
