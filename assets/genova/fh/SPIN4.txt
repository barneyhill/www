# SPIN4

## Overview
SPIN4 is a gene that encodes the protein spindlin family member 4, which is part of the spindlin family characterized by the presence of Tudor domains. These domains are known for their ability to bind methylated lysine residues on histones, specifically trimethylated histone H3K4 (H3K4me3), suggesting a role in chromatin interactions and gene regulation (Zhang2021SPIN4). The SPIN4 protein is a key substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF16, which mediates its polyubiquitination and degradation, thus playing a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis (Zhang2021SPIN4). Despite its binding capabilities, the precise biological functions of SPIN4 remain to be fully elucidated, although it has been implicated in growth regulation and cancer prognosis (Lui2024Growth; Lin2019Identification).

## Structure
SPIN4 is a protein that belongs to the spindlin family, characterized by the presence of Tudor domains, which are known for binding methylated lysine residues on histones. The molecular structure of SPIN4 includes three Tudor domains, which function as methyl reader domains, allowing SPIN4 to specifically bind to trimethylated histone H3K4 (H3K4me3) (Zhang2021SPIN4). The structure of SPIN4 bound to H3K4me3 has been determined and is available in the Protein Data Bank under the entry 4UY4. This structure reveals that a key lysine residue, K70, is surface-exposed and located on the opposite face of SPIN4 from the H3K4me3 binding site (Zhang2021SPIN4).

SPIN4 is identified as a principal endogenous substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF16, which mediates its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Specific lysine residues, particularly K70, are crucial for the interaction with DCAF16. A triple mutant of SPIN4 (K70N/K81F/K93E) fails to interact with DCAF16, and mutation of K70 to N disrupts this interaction, highlighting the importance of these residues in SPIN4's function and regulation (Zhang2021SPIN4).

## Function
SPIN4 is a member of the spindlin family of proteins, which are characterized by the presence of Tudor domains that facilitate interactions with methylated histones. SPIN4 specifically binds to trimethylated lysine-4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), suggesting a role in chromatin interactions and gene regulation (Zhang2021SPIN4). This binding indicates that SPIN4 may influence chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation, although its precise biological roles remain to be fully elucidated.

SPIN4 is a principal endogenous substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF16, which mediates its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This interaction is crucial for regulating SPIN4 turnover in human cells, highlighting its involvement in maintaining protein homeostasis (Zhang2021SPIN4). The interaction between SPIN4 and DCAF16 is mediated by specific lysine residues, particularly K70, which is essential for binding (Zhang2021SPIN4).

Despite its ability to bind H3K4me3 in vitro, genetic disruption of SPIN4 does not lead to significant changes in protein expression, suggesting that its role in gene regulation or chromatin dynamics may be more nuanced and not solely dependent on its presence or absence (Zhang2021SPIN4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPIN4 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. A truncating variant in SPIN4 has been linked to X-linked overgrowth syndrome. In a reported family, a hemizygous male with this variant exhibited extreme tall stature, while female carriers were also taller than average. This phenotype is mirrored in mice with similar Spin4 mutations, which show increased bone length and overgrowth, suggesting a role for SPIN4 in regulating growth through WNT signaling pathways (Lui2024Growth).

In pediatric Wilms tumor, high expression levels of SPIN4 have been associated with a higher risk of mortality. A study identified SPIN4 as part of a five-mRNA signature with prognostic significance, indicating that elevated SPIN4 expression could be a marker for poor prognosis in these patients (Lin2019Identification).

SPIN4 is also a principal substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF16, which regulates its degradation. Mutations disrupting this interaction, such as at lysine residue K70, can affect SPIN4's stability and function, potentially impacting cellular processes like gene transcription regulation (Zhang2021SPIN4). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SPIN4 in growth disorders and cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
SPIN4, a member of the spindlin family, interacts specifically with the E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF16. This interaction is crucial for the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of SPIN4, as DCAF16 acts as a substrate recognition component of Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) (Zhang2021SPIN4). The interaction between SPIN4 and DCAF16 is mediated by a critical lysine residue, K70, in SPIN4, and mutations at this site disrupt the interaction (Zhang2021SPIN4). SPIN4 forms a dedicated complex with DCAF16 and DDB1, which regulates its turnover in human cells (Zhang2021SPIN4).

SPIN4 also binds to methylated histones, specifically showing a preference for trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3) and H4K20me3 peptides. This suggests a potential role in gene transcription regulation, although genetic disruption of SPIN4 does not lead to significant changes in protein expression levels, indicating a complex role in transcription regulation (Zhang2021SPIN4; Shanle2017Histone). Despite sharing 75% sequence identity with SPIN1, SPIN4 does not interact with DCAF16, highlighting the specificity of its interactions (Zhang2021SPIN4).
