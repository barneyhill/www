# INTU

## Overview
The INTU gene encodes the inturned planar cell polarity protein, a crucial component in the regulation of ciliogenesis and planar cell polarity (PCP) in vertebrates. This protein is categorized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and is integral to the CPLANE complex, which is essential for the formation and function of cilia. INTU's role extends to the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating processes such as basal body docking and ciliary vesicle exocytosis, which are vital for proper cilia formation. The protein's interactions within the PCP pathway, particularly with other effector proteins like Fuzzy and WDPCP, underscore its importance in cellular signaling pathways, including the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Disruptions in INTU function can lead to developmental abnormalities and have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Adler2017From; Gerondopoulos2019Planar; Chan2022Multifaceted).

## Structure
The INTU protein, also known as inturned planar cell polarity protein, is characterized by its involvement in cilium formation and planar cell polarity. The primary structure of INTU includes a sequence of 942 amino acids, with specific domains that facilitate its function. Notably, the protein contains a PDZ domain located between residues 198 and 268, which is highly conserved across species, showing significant homology with Xenopus and Drosophila Inturned proteins (Zeng2010PCP). 

The molecular structure of INTU also includes three longin domains, which are part of its C-terminal portion. These domains are homologous to those found in proteins like Ccz1 and Hps4, suggesting a functional similarity to other Rab GEF complexes (Gerondopoulos2019Planar). The presence of these longin domains indicates that INTU may form dimeric platforms, contributing to its role in the Rab23 GEF complex (Gerondopoulos2019Planar).

INTU is also subject to post-translational modifications, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and domains are crucial for its role in cilia formation and its interaction with other proteins, such as Fuz, within the CPLANE complex (Gerondopoulos2019Planar).

## Function
The INTU gene encodes the inturned planar cell polarity protein, which plays a critical role in ciliogenesis and planar cell polarity (PCP) in vertebrates. INTU is part of the CPLANE complex, which is essential for the formation and function of cilia, cellular structures that are crucial for signaling pathways such as Hedgehog signaling. In healthy human cells, INTU localizes to the basal body and proximal region of cilia, where it functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab23, a member of the Rab7 subfamily of GTPases. This activity is vital for the activation of Rab23, which is necessary for cilium formation and maintenance (Gerondopoulos2019Planar).

INTU's role in ciliogenesis involves regulating the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with small GTPases like RhoA and the formin Daam1, which are important for actin filament polymerization. This regulation is crucial for basal body docking and ciliary vesicle exocytosis, processes essential for proper cilia formation (Adler2017From). Disruption of INTU function can lead to defects in cilia formation, impacting cellular signaling and leading to developmental abnormalities (Zeng2010PCP). INTU's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue organization.

## Clinical Significance
The INTU gene, encoding the inturned planar cell polarity protein, plays a significant role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for embryonic development and cellular processes. Alterations in INTU expression have been linked to various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). In these cancers, INTU is significantly downregulated, which is associated with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival probabilities (Chan2022Multifaceted). The downregulation of INTU in LUAD and UCEC is partly attributed to hypermethylation of its promoter CpG islands and the influence of transcription factor TCF4, which is also downregulated in these cancers (Chan2022Multifaceted).

The regulatory network involving MALAT1 and hsa-miR-212-3p further contributes to the downregulation of INTU, with MALAT1 acting as an upstream regulator and hsa-miR-212-3p negatively regulating INTU expression (Chan2022Multifaceted). These interactions suggest that targeting these regulatory pathways could offer therapeutic benefits in treating LUAD and UCEC. The disruption of INTU and its associated pathways may also contribute to defects in ciliogenesis, which can favor oncogenesis in these tissues (Chan2022Multifaceted).

## Interactions
The INTU gene, encoding the inturned planar cell polarity protein, is involved in several critical interactions within the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. In Drosophila, INTU interacts physically with the protein Multiple Wing Hairs (Mwh). This interaction is crucial for the proximal localization of Mwh in wing cells, which is essential for proper wing hair formation and polarity. The interaction between INTU and Mwh has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays, indicating that these proteins form a complex in wing disc cells. This interaction is independent of the upstream PCP gene frizzled (fz), as Mwh and INTU still co-immunoprecipitate in fz mutant cells (Lu2010The).

In mammals, INTU is part of a multiprotein complex that includes other PCP effector proteins such as Fuzzy and WDPCP. These interactions are essential for the regulation of ciliogenesis and the proper functioning of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for various developmental processes (Dai2012Planar). The disruption of INTU leads to defects in cilia formation and Hh signaling, highlighting its role in these protein interactions (Zeng2010PCP).
