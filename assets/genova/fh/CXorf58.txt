# CXorf58

## Overview
The CXorf58 gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes the protein known as chromosome X open reading frame 58. This protein has been implicated in various biological processes, although its precise functions remain to be fully characterized. Notably, CXorf58 has been associated with the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its expression levels are significantly elevated, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Ranjpour2021Elevated). Additionally, genetic studies have linked CXorf58 to male infertility, with deleterious variants identified in patients with azoospermia and severe oligospermia (Chen2020Wholeexome). These associations underscore the gene's potential clinical significance and highlight the need for further research to elucidate its biological roles and mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
The CXorf58 gene, located on the X chromosome, has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have shown that the expression of a putative CXorf58 homolog is significantly elevated during the initiation and progression of HCC. This elevated expression is associated with the disease's development, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Ranjpour2021Elevated). Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated a dramatic increase in mRNA expression levels of the CXorf58 homolog, with a 57-fold increase at one month and further increases at later stages post-carcinogen treatment, indicating a strong correlation with HCC progression (Ranjpour2021Elevated).

In addition to its role in cancer, CXorf58 has been identified in studies of male infertility. Whole-exome sequencing in a cohort of Chinese patients with azoospermia and severe oligospermia revealed deleterious variants in CXorf58 among other genes. These findings suggest that mutations in CXorf58 may contribute to infertility, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Chen2020Wholeexome). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential clinical significance and the need for further research to understand its role in disease.
