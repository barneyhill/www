# ALPK2

## Overview
Alpha kinase 2 (ALPK2) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cardiac development and cancer progression. The ALPK2 protein is categorized as an atypical kinase due to its unique substrate specificity and regulatory mechanisms (Bogomolovas2020Atypical). In human embryonic stem cells, ALPK2 is crucial for cardiomyocyte differentiation by modulating the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, a key regulator of cardiogenesis (Hofsteen2018ALPK2). Although its role in cardiac development is significant in certain species, studies in mice suggest that ALPK2 may not be essential for cardiac function in mammals (Bogomolovas2020Atypical). Beyond its developmental functions, ALPK2 is implicated in cancer biology, where it interacts with proteins such as DEPDC1A to influence tumor growth and progression (Wang2021ALPK2). Additionally, genetic variants of ALPK2 have been associated with diseases like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Wei2024WholeExome).

## Function
ALPK2 (alpha kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in several cellular processes, particularly in cardiac development and differentiation. In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), ALPK2 plays a crucial role in the differentiation into cardiomyocytes by regulating the WNT/b-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for cardiogenesis (Hofsteen2018ALPK2). ALPK2 acts as a negative regulator of this pathway, ensuring proper cardiac development by repressing WNT/b-catenin signaling following cardiac commitment (Hofsteen2018ALPK2).

The gene is expressed in a stage-dependent manner during cardiogenesis, with its expression increasing significantly during the transition from mesoderm to cardiac progenitor cells (Hofsteen2018ALPK2). ALPK2 influences the expression of key cardiac developmental proteins, such as TNNT2 and GATA4, and modulates the expression of WNT signaling components, including the antagonist sFRP1 and the transducer b-catenin (CTNNB1) (Hofsteen2018ALPK2).

Despite its significant role in cardiac development in hESCs and zebrafish, studies in mice suggest that ALPK2 may not be essential for cardiac development and function in mammals, as knockout mice exhibit normal cardiac morphology and function (Bogomolovas2020Atypical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ALPK2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (MASH), a novel variant, rs3809983, has been associated with the disease in female liver samples. This variant is linked to defective canonical Wnt signal transduction, suggesting that ALPK2 polymorphisms may disrupt β-catenin levels, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway in female MASH patients (Wei2024WholeExome). Another variant, rs3809973, is associated with an increased risk of liver fibrosis in women coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). This variant is linked to higher APRI and FIB-4 scores, which are indicators of liver fibrosis, and may interfere with enteric immunity, potentially through increased microbial translocation (McIntosh2021A).

In cancer, ALPK2 has been identified as a polymorphic gene. Its knockdown has been shown to inhibit the development and progression of ovarian and renal cancer cells in mouse models (Wei2024WholeExome). In ovarian cancer, ALPK2 expression is higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth, indicating its role in cancer progression (Zhu2020Knockdown).

## Interactions
ALPK2 (alpha kinase 2) is involved in several interactions that play a role in cellular processes, particularly in cancer progression. In bladder cancer, ALPK2 interacts with DEPDC1A, a potential downstream target. This interaction is crucial for the tumor-promoting role of ALPK2, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation assays that confirmed a protein-protein interaction between ALPK2 and DEPDC1A. Knockdown of DEPDC1A in bladder cancer cells results in reduced cell growth and increased apoptosis, effects similar to those observed with ALPK2 knockdown, indicating that DEPDC1A may mediate some of ALPK2's effects in cancer progression (Wang2021ALPK2).

In the context of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (MASH), ALPK2 is suggested to act as a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that Wnt gene signatures were negatively enriched in ALPK2-high samples compared to ALPK2-low samples, suggesting an interaction that influences this signaling pathway (Wei2024WholeExome). However, specific details on the physical interactions of ALPK2 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not provided.
