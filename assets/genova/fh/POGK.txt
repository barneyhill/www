# POGK

## Overview
POGK is a gene that encodes the pogo transposable element derived with KRAB domain protein, a unique chimeric protein that has evolved through the fusion of pogo transposase genes with additional functional domains. This protein is characterized by its structural components, including a partially conserved DDE domain and a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which are indicative of its potential roles in DNA binding and transcriptional repression (Gao2020Evolution). The presence of DNA-binding motifs such as BrkDBD and HTH_Tnp_Tc5 further suggests its involvement in chromatin modification or regulation of gene expression (Gao2020Evolution). Originating from the Passer transposase family and classified within Group III, the POGK protein reflects a complex evolutionary history that underscores its functional diversity (Gao2020Evolution). The protein is composed of 609 amino acids, although detailed structural and functional analyses remain limited (Casola2007Convergent).

## Structure
The POGK protein is a chimeric gene product that emerged from the fusion of pogo transposase genes with additional functional domains. It retains structural elements typical of pogo transposases, including the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the DDE domain, which is crucial for transposase activity, although the DDE domain is only partially conserved in POGK (Gao2020Evolution). The protein features a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain near the N-terminus, which is typically involved in transcriptional repression (Gao2020Evolution). 

In terms of DNA-binding motifs, POGK contains two types: BrkDBD and HTH_Tnp_Tc5, located in the N-terminal region (Gao2020Evolution). These motifs suggest a role in DNA binding or chromatin modification. The protein is derived from the Passer transposase family and is part of Group III, indicating its evolutionary origin and structural lineage (Gao2020Evolution). 

The POGK protein is 609 amino acids in length, as identified in phylogenetic reconstructions (Casola2007Convergent). However, specific details about its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.
