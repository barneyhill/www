# RHAG

## Overview
The RHAG gene encodes the Rh associated glycoprotein, a critical component of the Rh blood group system, primarily expressed in erythrocytes. This protein is an integral membrane protein that belongs to the Amt/Mep/Rh superfamily, which is known for its role in ammonium transport (Callebaut2006Hydrophobic). Structurally, the Rh associated glycoprotein is characterized by 12 transmembrane α-helices, contributing to its function as an ammonium transporter and its involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of red blood cells (Van2006Rh). The protein's interactions with other components of the erythrocyte membrane, such as ankyrin-R and Rh proteins, are essential for the proper expression of Rh antigens and the mechanical stability of red blood cells (MouroChanteloup2002Cellsurface; Nicolas2003RhRhAGAnkyrinR). Mutations in the RHAG gene can lead to various hematological disorders, including the Rh null phenotype and overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, underscoring its importance in red blood cell physiology and systemic homeostasis (Genetet2012Human; Ripoche2004Human).

## Structure
The RHAG protein is an integral membrane protein involved in the Rh blood group system. It is composed of 409 amino acid residues and features a predicted structure with 12 transmembrane α-helices (Van2006Rh). The protein is part of the Amt/Mep/Rh superfamily, which includes ammonium/methylammonium permeases, and shares structural similarities with the bacterial ammonia transporter AmtB (Callebaut2006Hydrophobic). 

The secondary structure of RHAG includes these transmembrane domains, which are primarily α-helices, contributing to its stability and function in the membrane (Floch2024Molecular). The tertiary structure is characterized by a specific N-terminal helix and critical residues that may play roles in channel function and structural stability (Callebaut2006Hydrophobic). 

In terms of quaternary structure, RHAG is suggested to form part of a heterotetrameric complex with Rh proteins, although trimeric assemblies have also been proposed, such as (RhAG)3 and (RhAG)2RhD (Callebaut2006Hydrophobic). RHAG is highly glycosylated, with an N-glycan at position N37, which carries ABO and Ii specificities (Van2006Rh). This glycosylation is a common post-translational modification that may influence its function and interactions.

## Function
The RHAG protein is a critical component of the Rh complex in red blood cells, playing a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these cells. It is involved in the interaction between the red cell membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton, particularly through its binding with ankyrin-R, which is essential for the attachment of the membrane to the spectrin-based skeleton. This interaction is crucial for the mechanical properties of red blood cells, and disruptions can lead to conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis and hemolytic anemia (Nicolas2003RhRhAGAnkyrinR).

RHAG also functions as an ammonium transporter, facilitating the transport of ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+) across the erythrocyte membrane. This role is vital for the detoxification of ammonia, a byproduct of protein catabolism, and for maintaining systemic acid-base balance. The protein's activity in transporting ammonium is supported by its structural similarity to the Mep/Amt family of ammonium transporters (Marini2000The; Van2006Rh; Benjelloun2005Expression). RHAG's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in red blood cell function and overall human physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RHAG gene can lead to several clinical conditions, primarily affecting red blood cell morphology and function. One such condition is the Rh null phenotype, which results from mutations in the RHAG or RH loci. This phenotype is characterized by a complete lack of Rh antigens on red blood cells, leading to hemolytic anemia and morphological abnormalities such as stomato-spherocytosis (Ripoche2004Human). The Rh mod phenotype, a variant of Rh deficiency, is caused by mutations in the RHAG gene that result in weakened Rh antigen expression. This condition can lead to hemolytic anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and spherocytosis (Mufarrege2020Extensive; Xia2019A).

The RHAG gene is also implicated in overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (OHSt), a rare form of hemolytic anemia. Mutations such as Phe65Ser in RHAG impair its function as an ammonia channel, leading to increased red blood cell permeability to cations, resulting in cell swelling and hemolysis (Genetet2012Human). Additionally, a mutation in RHAG, c.490A>C, is associated with the expression of the Kg-antigen, which can cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (Tanaka2020The). These conditions highlight the critical role of RHAG in maintaining red blood cell integrity and function.

## Interactions
The RHAG protein, also known as Rh associated glycoprotein, is involved in several critical interactions within red blood cells. It interacts with ankyrin-R, a key component of the red cell skeleton, through its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. This interaction is essential for the structural integrity of red blood cells and is independent of the presence of band 3 (Nicolas2003RhRhAGAnkyrinR). Mutations in RHAG, such as the Asp-399 mutation, can disrupt this interaction, leading to conditions like hereditary spherocytosis (Nicolas2003RhRhAGAnkyrinR).

RHAG also forms a complex with the RhD and RhCE proteins, which is crucial for the expression of Rh antigens on the cell surface. The presence of RHAG is necessary for the proper membrane expression of RhD, as demonstrated in studies using K562 cells (MouroChanteloup2002Cellsurface). Additionally, RHAG interacts with the anion exchanger 1 (AE1, also known as band 3) to facilitate ammonium transport, which is vital for maintaining the pH balance within erythrocytes (Sudnitsyna2016Human). These interactions underscore RHAG's role in maintaining erythrocyte membrane stability and function.
