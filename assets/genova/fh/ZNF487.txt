# ZNF487

## Overview
ZNF487 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 487, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate interactions with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes. The zinc finger protein 487, encoded by ZNF487, is implicated in various biological functions and disease contexts, including its involvement in major depressive disorder and cancer. Research suggests that alterations in the expression of ZNF487 may affect synaptic activity and neuronal plasticity, as well as immune cell infiltration in cancer, highlighting its potential significance in both neurological and oncological research (Yan2021Identifying; Zhu2019Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF487 has been implicated in several health conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of major depressive disorder (MDD), ZNF487 is identified as a differentially expressed gene in monozygotic twins discordant for MDD. This suggests that changes in the expression of ZNF487 may be associated with depression, potentially through mechanisms involving zinc dysregulation, which is known to affect synaptic activity and neuronal plasticity (Zhu2019Genomewide).

In cancer research, ZNF487 is identified as a 'positive dark gene' in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC). Although it is not differentially expressed, a higher Immune Cell Infiltration (ICI) score for ZNF487 is associated with a better prognosis in CESC, indicating its potential role in influencing cancer outcomes (Yan2021Identifying).

Additionally, ZNF487 is a predicted target of hsa-miR-181a-5p, a microRNA involved in regulating cancer-related genes. This suggests that ZNF487 may play a role in cancer development and progression, although specific clinical implications in this context are not detailed (Zhou2015HsamicroRNA181a).
