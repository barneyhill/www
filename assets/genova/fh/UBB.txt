# UBB

## Overview
The UBB gene encodes ubiquitin B, a small regulatory protein that plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. Ubiquitin B is a highly conserved polypeptide that functions by attaching to substrate proteins, marking them for degradation by the 26S proteasome, thus maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes (Jiang2004Human). The UBB gene is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with significant activity in neurons and germ cells, where it is essential for maintaining adequate levels of free ubiquitin necessary for cell viability and function (Park2014Cellular). Additionally, the UBB gene has a frameshift mutant variant, UBB+1, which is implicated in neurotoxicity and proteasome inhibition, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases (Ko2010Structural). The clinical significance of UBB extends to its involvement in neurodegenerative disorders and certain cancers, where its expression and mutations can influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Tan2007Mutant; Kedves2017Recurrent).

## Structure
The UBB gene encodes the ubiquitin B protein, which is involved in tagging proteins for degradation. The primary structure of ubiquitin B consists of a 76-amino acid sequence. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its compact globular tertiary structure (Baker1987The). Ubiquitin B forms polyubiquitin chains as its quaternary structure, which are crucial for its function in protein degradation pathways (Baker1987The).

The UBB protein can undergo post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination itself, which is essential for its role in tagging proteins for degradation (Baker1987The). The UBB gene also has a frameshift mutant variant known as UBB+1, characterized by a 19-residue C-terminal extension. This variant is implicated in neurotoxicity and proteasome inhibition, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases (Ko2010Structural).

The interaction between UBB+1 and the E2-25K enzyme has been structurally analyzed, revealing that UBB+1 binds to E2-25K through specific residues, which is crucial for the synthesis of neurotoxic UBB+1-anchored polyubiquitin (Ko2010Structural). This interaction highlights the structural and functional significance of the UBB protein and its variants in cellular processes.

## Function
The UBB gene encodes ubiquitin B, a protein that plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP), which is essential for protein degradation in cells. This pathway involves tagging proteins with ubiquitin molecules, marking them for degradation by the 26S proteasome complex. Ubiquitin B is a conserved polypeptide that attaches to proteins, facilitating their selective and regulated degradation, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes (Jiang2004Human).

In healthy human cells, the UBB gene is vital for normal cellular functions. Its deletion in mice has been shown to lead to infertility, adult-onset hypothalamic neurodegeneration, and metabolic and sleep abnormalities, indicating its importance in maintaining adequate levels of free ubiquitin for survival. UBB is highly expressed in germ cells and hypothalamic neurons, and its disruption significantly reduces ubiquitin levels in these cell types, affecting neuronal function and survival (Park2014Cellular).

The UBB gene is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing protein turnover and cellular stress responses. It is particularly important in neurons and germ cells, where it helps maintain free ubiquitin levels critical for cell viability and function (Park2014Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UBB (ubiquitin B) gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers. The UBB+1 mutation, a frameshift variant, is associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. This mutation disrupts the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, leading to proteasome dysfunction and the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, which are resistant to degradation. This accumulation contributes to neuronal cell death and is linked to mitochondrial stress and activation of cell death pathways (Banasiak2021The; Tan2007Mutant).

In gynecological cancers, particularly high-grade serous ovarian cancer, UBB expression is often silenced, leading to a dependency on the UBC gene to maintain cellular ubiquitin levels. This silencing is associated with poor patient outcomes and presents a potential therapeutic target, as cancer cells with low UBB expression are sensitive to UBC knockdown (Kedves2017Recurrent). The silencing of UBB in these cancers is linked to DNA methylation and is considered a cancer-specific event (Kedves2017Recurrent). These findings highlight the dual role of UBB in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, emphasizing its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Interactions
UBB (ubiquitin B) interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. One notable interaction is with the E2-25K enzyme, which facilitates the formation of UBB+1-anchored polyubiquitin chains. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting proteasome activity, potentially leading to neurotoxicity and neuronal cell death. The E2-25K enzyme contains a UBA domain that interacts with UBB+1, and specific mutations in this domain can disrupt the binding, highlighting the importance of hydrophobic interactions in this process (Ko2010Structural).

UBB+1 also interacts with the conjugating enzyme UBE2K and E3 ligases such as TRIP12 and HUWE1. These interactions allow UBB+1 to be incorporated into polyubiquitin chains, although its C-terminal extension can hinder full processing by the proteasome (Banasiak2021The). Additionally, UBB+1 is recognized by proteasomal receptors like HHR23A, UBQLN1, and Rpn10, but its accumulation can impair proteasomal capacity and deubiquitylation enzyme activity, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases (Banasiak2021The).

These interactions underscore UBB's role in cellular processes related to protein degradation and its potential impact on neurodegenerative conditions.
