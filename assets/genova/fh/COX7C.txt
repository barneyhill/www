# COX7C

## Overview
COX7C is a gene that encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7C, a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain's Complex IV. This protein is integral to the process of oxidative phosphorylation, where it facilitates the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, ultimately contributing to ATP synthesis. As a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, COX7C is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a crucial role in cellular energy production and maintaining mitochondrial function. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of mitochondrial respiration and angiogenesis, and is expressed predominantly in mitochondria. Its expression is regulated by transcription factors such as specificity protein 4 (Sp4), particularly in neuronal cells (Johar2013Neuron‐specific; Jia2023Effect).

## Function
COX7C encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This enzyme complex is crucial for cellular respiration, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, which contributes to the proton gradient used for ATP synthesis. COX7C is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, playing a vital role in energy production (Jia2023Effect).

In healthy human cells, COX7C is involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and membrane potential, which is essential for ATP generation during oxidative phosphorylation. This process is critical for cellular energy production and overall cell viability (Jia2023Effect). The protein is primarily expressed in mitochondria and influences vascular endothelial cells by regulating mitochondrial function and oxidative stress (Jia2023Effect).

COX7C also plays a role in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration, enhancing ATP production and promoting angiogenesis through pathways such as HIF-1α/VEGF. This regulation is important for maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis in endothelial cells (Jia2023Effect). The expression of COX7C is regulated by specificity protein 4 (Sp4), which binds to the promoters of nucleus-encoded COX subunit genes, including COX7C, in neurons (Johar2013Neuron‐specific).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the COX7C gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In models of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, upregulation of COX7C by dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) has been shown to protect mitochondrial function, reduce cerebral infarction, and maintain blood-brain barrier integrity. This suggests a potential therapeutic role for COX7C in ischemic stroke treatment (Jia2023Effect).

In colon cancer patients, increased expression of COX7C has been linked to a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), indicating that COX7C could serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for VTE in this population (Wu2020The). The gene's expression level is a significant predictor of VTE, highlighting its potential role in cancer-related complications (Wu2020The).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), COX7C is significantly upregulated, and novel variants have been identified, although their clinical significance remains unexplored. This upregulation suggests a possible involvement of COX7C in the pathophysiology of CML, warranting further investigation into its role in myeloid leukemogenesis (ElMasry2023Gene).

## Interactions
COX7C, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), participates in several interactions within the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It interacts with COX1 and COX8 within the COX monomer, playing a role in the structural organization of the complex (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial). COX7C is also involved in the formation of the respirasome, a supercomplex that includes complexes I, III, and IV. It interacts with subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase complex, such as ND5, NDUFB7, NDUFB8, NDUFB3, and NDUFB2, indicating its role in the assembly and stability of these supercomplexes (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial).

In the assembly process of cytochrome c oxidase, COX7C is part of the intermediate assembly group, interacting with subunits like MT-CO1, MT-CO2, COX5B, COX6C, and COX8A. This suggests that COX7C is incorporated into the complex before MT-CO3, forming a module with COX6C, COX8A, and COX5B (Vidoni2017MR1S). Additionally, COX7C interacts with MT-CO1, and mutations in MT-CO1 can affect its interaction with COX7C, potentially destabilizing the complex (Lloyd2013Structural).
