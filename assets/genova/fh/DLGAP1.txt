# DLGAP1

## Overview
DLGAP1, or Discs Large Homolog Associated Protein 1, is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein primarily located in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses in the brain. The protein, DLG associated protein 1, is integral to synaptic organization and signaling, interacting with key proteins such as DLG4 (PSD-95), SHANK, and Homer to facilitate the assembly of protein complexes at synaptic junctions. This interaction is crucial for synaptic plasticity, which underlies learning and memory (Rasmussen2017The). DLGAP1 is expressed in multiple isoforms, with its expression being tissue-dependent, and it plays a significant role in synaptic scaling and the regulation of neurotransmitter receptors (Rasmussen2017The; Kwiatkowski2019DLGAP1). Alterations in the DLGAP1 gene have been linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Coba2018Dlgap1).

## Structure
DLGAP1, a member of the DLGAP family, is a scaffold protein primarily located in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses. It contains three main domains: a 14-amino acid repeat domain, a dynein light chain (DLC) domain, and a GKAP homology domain 1 (GH1) (Rasmussen2017The). The 14-amino acid repeat domain facilitates binding to the GK domain of DLG proteins such as DLG1, DLG2, and DLG4. In DLGAP1, these repeats are positioned differently depending on the isoform, with long isoforms having them in the middle and short isoforms near the N-terminal (Rasmussen2017The). The DLC domain interacts with dynein, a motor protein subunit, while the GH1 domain, located at the C-terminal, is composed of four alpha helices and shows high sequence homology among DLGAP proteins, although its specific role remains unclear (Rasmussen2017The).

DLGAP1 has multiple isoforms, with nine human transcript variants identified, and its expression is tissue-dependent (Rasmussen2017The; Kwiatkowski2019DLGAP1). The protein is involved in synaptic signaling and interacts with other scaffold proteins like SHANK and Homer, playing a crucial role in the organization of PSD protein complexes (Rasmussen2017The; Coba2018Dlgap1).

## Function
DLGAP1, a member of the DLGAP family, functions as a scaffold protein in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons, playing a critical role in synaptic organization and signaling. It interacts with key proteins such as DLG4 (also known as PSD-95), SHANK, and Homer, facilitating the assembly of protein complexes at synaptic junctions. This interaction is essential for synaptic plasticity, which underlies learning and memory (Rasmussen2017The).

DLGAP1 is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the dendrites and postsynapse of excitatory synapses. It contributes to synaptic scaling, a form of homeostatic synaptic plasticity that adjusts the postsynaptic response by altering neurotransmitter receptor levels, such as AMPA and NMDA receptors, in response to synaptic activity (Rasmussen2017The). The protein's interaction with DLG4 is crucial for NMDA receptor scaling, as phosphorylation by CaMKII leads to dissociation from DLG4, resulting in ubiquitination and degradation, which is vital for synaptic scaling and receptor activity regulation (Rasmussen2017The).

DLGAP1 also plays a role in inhibiting endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic depression, maintaining synaptic stability (Rasmussen2017The). Its involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function and its potential implications in various neurological disorders (Rasmussen2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DLGAP1 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Variants of DLGAP1 are associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and schizophrenia. Gain-of-function variants are linked to OCD, while haploinsufficient variants are associated with ASD and schizophrenia (Coba2018Dlgap1). In particular, genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within DLGAP1 associated with OCD, and a 63 kb duplication in DLGAP1 was observed in a sib-pair with pediatric OCD (Coba2018Dlgap1). Conversely, deletions and rare protein-altering variants in DLGAP1 have been found in individuals with schizophrenia, and ASD patients show an increased incidence of non-synonymous variants of DLGAP1 (Coba2018Dlgap1).

In Dlgap1 knockout mice, which serve as a model for studying these disorders, there are disruptions in postsynaptic density (PSD) protein interactions and reduced sociability, aligning with the effects of haploinsufficient variants in humans (Coba2018Dlgap1). These mice also exhibit OCD-like phenotypes, such as excessive self-grooming and anxiety-like behaviors, which develop with age and can be alleviated by treatment with fluvoxamine, a serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (Minagawa2024Late). These findings suggest that DLGAP1 plays a crucial role in maintaining synaptic function and that its dysfunction can contribute to the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
DLGAP1, a scaffold protein located in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons, is involved in multiple protein interactions crucial for synaptic function. It forms the middle layer of the PSD, connecting the DLG family of scaffolding proteins to the SHANK family. DLGAP1 binds directly to the GK domain of the DLG family through multiple 14 amino acid repeats at its N-terminal region and interacts with the PDZ domain of SHANKs via its PDZ ligand motif, effectively linking the top and bottom layers of the PSD (Rasmussen2017The; Wilkinson2020Molecular).

DLGAP1 also interacts with the motor protein dynein light chain (DLC) in association with Dlg4 and Myosin-V, which is proposed to regulate transport (Wilkinson2020Molecular). It indirectly interacts with AMPA receptors through Stargazin, modulating AMPA receptor properties (Rasmussen2017The). The interaction between DLGAP1 and DLG4 is regulated by phosphorylation, which disrupts the interaction of DLGAP1 with DLG4 and SHANK, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (Rasmussen2017The).

DLGAP1 is part of supramolecular protein complexes organized by PSD95, linking Dlg family scaffolds to SHANK family proteins, forming part of 1.5 MDa supercomplexes that include Dlg1-4, Shank1-3, NMDA receptors, ion channels, and signaling proteins (Coba2018Dlgap1). These interactions are essential for the assembly of postsynaptic complexes and are enriched in proteins considered risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders.
