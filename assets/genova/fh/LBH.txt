# LBH

## Overview
The LBH gene encodes the LBH regulator of the WNT signaling pathway, a protein that functions as a transcriptional co-regulator. This protein is intrinsically disordered, lacking a defined secondary or tertiary structure, and is involved in various cellular processes, including embryonic development, cell differentiation, and cell cycle regulation (Ai2007A; AlAli2010Biophysical). As a transcription cofactor, LBH modulates the activity of WNT target genes, playing a crucial role in limb and heart development, as well as in maintaining genomic integrity during the cell cycle (Matsuda2017Regulation; Ekwall2015The). LBH's interactions with other proteins and its involvement in the WNT and Integrin signaling pathways underscore its significance in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases (Deng2010Synergistic; Young2023Multi-cancer).

## Structure
The LBH protein is characterized by its intrinsic disorder, lacking discernible secondary or tertiary structure, and exhibits rod-like properties in solution (AlAli2010Biophysical). Hydrodynamic analysis using size-exclusion chromatography and analytical laser scattering suggests that LBH behaves as a structurally disordered polymer, existing as a monomer with a molecular mass of approximately 12.3 kD and a radius of gyration of 234 Å (AlAli2010Biophysical). Spectroscopic studies, including circular dichroism, confirm the absence of secondary structure, while nuclear magnetic resonance analysis reveals poor chemical shift dispersion, indicating structural disorder and conformational flexibility (AlAli2010Biophysical).

In silico analysis shows that LBH is enriched with disorder-promoting residues and lacks hydrophobic residues typical of globular proteins. The PONDR® VL-XT software predicts that a significant portion of LBH is disordered, with specific regions identified as disordered or ordered. The predicted nuclear localization signal overlaps with the most ordered region, while the glutamic acid-rich transcriptional activation domain is in the longest disordered region (AlAli2010Biophysical). LBH acts as a transcription cofactor, functioning as both a transcription co-activator and co-repressor, influencing the transcriptional activities of various transcription factors (AlAli2010Biophysical).

## Function
The LBH gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional co-regulator involved in the WNT signaling pathway, which is crucial for embryonic development and cell differentiation. In healthy human cells, LBH is active in the nucleus, where it modulates the activity of WNT target genes, influencing processes such as limb and heart development (Ai2007A). The protein plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), where it acts as a transcriptional regulator of the cell cycle, influencing cell growth and proliferation (Ekwall2015The). LBH is necessary for efficient progression through the S phase of the cell cycle, as its deficiency leads to S phase arrest and increased DNA damage, indicating its role in maintaining genomic integrity (Matsuda2017Regulation).

LBH's involvement in the WNT signaling pathway is also linked to its role in the regulation of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions, as seen in lung adenocarcinoma cells, where it affects integrin expression and cell adhesion pathways (Deng2018LimbBud). This highlights LBH's broader role in cellular processes that are essential for normal tissue formation and function.

## Clinical Significance
The LBH gene plays a significant role in various cancers and autoimmune diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In multiple cancer types, such as colon, rectal, esophageal, stomach, bladder, and kidney cancers, LBH overexpression is linked to advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. This overexpression is often associated with DNA hypomethylation and activation of the WNT and Integrin signaling pathways, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Young2023Multi-cancer). In contrast, LBH underexpression is observed in lung, skin, and cervical cancers, correlating with advanced disease stages (Young2023Multi-cancer).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), LBH is identified as a cancer stem cell- and metastasis-promoting oncogene. High LBH expression is associated with aggressive disease, high tumor grade, and poor prognosis, serving as a potential biomarker for TNBC (Garikapati2021LBH). LBH also plays a role in gliomas, where its overexpression promotes angiogenesis and is linked to poor survival outcomes (Jiang2019Overexpression).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, LBH functions as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation associated with tumor progression. Re-expression of LBH in these cells inhibits proliferation and tumor growth (Liu2015Limbbud). Additionally, LBH is implicated in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, where its deficiency exacerbates inflammation and DNA damage (Matsuda2017Regulation).

## Interactions
The LBH protein is involved in several interactions that influence its role in the WNT signaling pathway. It acts as a transcription co-factor and is a direct target of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for its function in cancer and development (Young2023Multi-cancer). LBH interacts with αB-crystallin, a small heat shock protein, forming a complex that synergistically inhibits the transcriptional activities of p53 and p21. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, as well as mammalian two-hybrid assays, indicating a direct physical interaction between LBH and αB-crystallin (Deng2010Synergistic).

LBH is also associated with the WNT and Integrin signaling pathways, where it is co-expressed with genes such as WNT2, WNT5A, and ITGBL1. These interactions suggest that LBH plays a role in modulating these pathways, contributing to its oncogenic potential in various cancers (Young2023Multi-cancer). The interaction with these pathways is further supported by the observation that LBH expression is WNT-dependent, as demonstrated by reduced LBH expression following β-catenin knockdown in gastrointestinal tumor lines (Young2023Multi-cancer).
