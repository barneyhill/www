# GPN2

## Overview
GPN2 is a gene that encodes the protein GPN-loop GTPase 2, which is a member of the GTPase family. This protein plays a critical role in the biogenesis and nuclear import of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), a key enzyme in the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA. GPN-loop GTPase 2 functions by facilitating the energy-dependent assembly of RNAPII subunits, interacting with other GPN-loop GTPases such as GPN1 and GPN3 to form essential complexes. These interactions are crucial for the formation of the Rpb3 subassembly, a necessary precursor for the complete assembly of the RNAPII holoenzyme. The activity of GPN-loop GTPase 2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it ensures the proper assembly and function of RNAPII, thereby maintaining genome stability and regulating transcriptional processes (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based; Minaker2013Biogenesis; Zeng2018Gpn2).

## Function
GPN2 is a crucial component in the assembly and nuclear import of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in human cells. It functions as a GTPase, facilitating the energy-dependent processes required for the proper assembly of RNAPII subunits. GPN2 interacts with other GPN-loop GTPases, such as Gpn1 and Gpn3, to form complexes that are essential for the biogenesis of RNAPII. This interaction is necessary for the formation of the Rpb3 subassembly, which includes subunits Rpb3, Rpb10, Rpb11, and Rpb12, and is a critical step in assembling the complete 12-subunit RNAPII holoenzyme (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based; Zeng2018Gpn2).

GPN2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it assists in the assembly of RNAPII before its import into the nucleus. It plays a pivotal role in the association of Rpb1 and Rpb2 with the Rpb3 subcomplex, ensuring the proper assembly and function of RNAPII (Zeng2018Gpn2). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining genome stability and proper transcriptional regulation, highlighting its importance in cellular growth and gene expression (Minaker2013Biogenesis).

## Interactions
GPN2 is involved in the assembly and nuclear import of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) through its interactions with various proteins. It plays a critical role in the formation of the Rpb3 subcomplex, which is essential for RNAPII biogenesis. GPN2 interacts specifically with the Rpb3 and Rpb12 subunits of RNAPII, facilitating the recruitment of other subunits such as Rpb10 and Rpb11 to form the complete RNAPII complex (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based; Zeng2018Gpn2).

GPN2 also associates with Rba50, a partner in the assembly of the Rpb3 subcomplex, indicating a coordinated role in RNAPII biogenesis. This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays (Zeng2018Gpn2). The interactions between GPN2 and these proteins are crucial for the proper assembly and nuclear transport of RNAPII, as defects in GPN2 lead to impaired assembly and cytoplasmic accumulation of RNAPII subunits (Minaker2013Biogenesis; Zeng2018Gpn2).

GPN2's interactions with other GPN proteins, such as GPN1 and GPN3, are also significant. These interactions are necessary for the assembly of RNAPII and its subsequent nuclear import, highlighting the importance of GPN2 in maintaining RNA polymerase subunit levels and genome integrity (Minaker2013Biogenesis).
