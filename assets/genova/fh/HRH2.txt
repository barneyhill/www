# HRH2

## Overview
The HRH2 gene encodes the histamine receptor H2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes. The histamine receptor H2 is primarily recognized for its function in regulating gastric acid secretion in the stomach, where it is predominantly expressed in gastric parietal cells. Upon activation by histamine, the receptor couples with Gs proteins, leading to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which stimulate acid secretion (Janikowska2023Histaminergic; Panula2015International). Beyond its gastric functions, the H2 receptor is involved in modulating immune responses and influencing neuronal physiology and plasticity in the central nervous system (Panula2015International). The receptor's structure is characterized by seven transmembrane domains, typical of GPCRs, and it undergoes post-translational modifications that influence its activity and desensitization (Kobayashi1996Cloning). The HRH2 gene and its encoded receptor are of clinical interest due to their involvement in conditions such as gastric cancer and potential roles in neurological disorders and immune modulation (Wright2017Altered; Nomura2013Influence).

## Structure
The HRH2 gene encodes the histamine receptor H2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. The primary structure of the H2 receptor consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a 358-amino-acid protein, characterized by seven transmembrane domains (TM1-TM7) composed of hydrophobic residues, which are highly conserved across species (Kobayashi1996Cloning). These transmembrane domains are interspersed with hydrophilic loops, typical of GPCRs, contributing to the receptor's secondary structure.

The tertiary structure of the H2 receptor involves the arrangement of these helices within the cell membrane, forming a binding pocket for ligands. Specific amino acids, such as Asp117 in TM3, play a crucial role in ligand binding and receptor activation (Panula2015International). The receptor also contains three putative N-linked glycosylation motifs near the amino-terminal end, which may influence ligand binding or receptor trafficking (Kobayashi1996Cloning).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at specific protein kinase C sites, are suggested to be involved in receptor desensitization (Kobayashi1996Cloning). The H2 receptor does not have reported splice variant isoforms, and its quaternary structure, if any, is not detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The HRH2 gene encodes the histamine receptor H2, a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion. In healthy human cells, the H2 receptor is predominantly expressed in gastric parietal cells, where it stimulates the production of gastric acid, playing a crucial role in digestion (Janikowska2023Histaminergic; Panula2015International). The receptor functions by coupling with Gs proteins to activate adenylyl cyclase, leading to increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which in turn stimulate acid secretion (Esbenshade2003Differential; Panula2015International).

Beyond its role in the stomach, the H2 receptor is also involved in various signaling pathways in other tissues. It can couple with Gq/11 proteins, leading to inositol phosphate formation and increased intracellular calcium levels, which are important for cellular signaling (Panula2015International). In the central nervous system, H2 receptor activation influences neuronal physiology and plasticity by stimulating cAMP production and protein kinase A activity, which can potentiate excitation in the brain (Panula2015International). The receptor is also expressed in immune cells, where it modulates immune responses by downregulating cytokine production (Panula2015International).

## Clinical Significance
The HRH2 gene, encoding the histamine receptor H2, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in gastric inflammation and immune response modulation. Polymorphisms in the HRH2 gene, such as the rs2607474 variant, have been associated with increased risk of DNA methylation of DAPK and CDH1 in the gastric epithelium. This methylation is linked to gastric mucosal atrophy and potentially to gastric cancer development, particularly in individuals over 60 years of age and those with the GG homozygote genotype (Nomura2013Influence).

In the context of neurological disorders, alterations in HRH2 expression have been studied in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although no significant differential expression of HRH2 was found in ASD subjects, the histaminergic system, including HRH2, may contribute to shared abnormalities in neuroinflammation and connectivity in ASD and related conditions (Wright2017Altered).

In endometrioid endometrial cancer, HRH2 expression changes have been observed, suggesting a potential role in cancer pathogenesis, although specific diseases or conditions associated with HRH2 mutations in this context are not detailed (Czerwiński2021Variances).

## Interactions
The histamine receptor H2 (HRH2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that primarily interacts with G proteins to mediate its effects. Upon activation by histamine, HRH2 couples with adenylate cyclase via G proteins, leading to the production of cAMP and the activation of protein kinase A, which are key components in the signaling pathways that regulate gastric acid secretion and other physiological processes (Singh2017New). 

HRH2 also plays a role in modulating immune responses and inflammation. It has been shown to counteract the pro-inflammatory signaling mediated by the histamine H1 receptor (H1R) in colonic tumorigenesis. Specifically, HRH2 signaling can suppress H1R-mediated MAPK activation, which is associated with chronic inflammation and cancer development (Shi2019Distinct). 

In terms of ligand interactions, HRH2 has specific binding sites for histamine and various antagonists. Key amino acids involved in these interactions include D98, D186, and T190, which are critical for histamine binding and receptor activation. Mutations at these sites can significantly alter receptor function, as demonstrated in studies using molecular docking and mutagenesis (Patel2023Insight). However, specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these signaling pathways are not detailed in the provided context.
