# ZBTB46

## Overview
ZBTB46 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 46, a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and immune cell differentiation. The protein is characterized by a BTB domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and zinc finger domains that enable DNA binding, categorizing it within the POK/ZBTB family of transcription factors (Wang2018Characterisation). ZBTB46 plays a crucial role in maintaining endothelial cell quiescence and regulating classical dendritic cell development by acting as a transcriptional repressor (Wang2019ZBTB46; Satpathy2012Zbtb46). Clinically, ZBTB46 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, where it influences tumor growth and metastasis (Liu2020Zinc; Chen2017Inhibition). The gene's expression and function are modulated by various signaling pathways, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Chen2017Inhibition).

## Structure
The ZBTB46 protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal BTB (Bric-à-brac, Tramtrack, and Broad Complex) domain and three C2H2 krüppel-like Zinc Finger (ZF) domains. The BTB domain is primarily involved in protein-protein interactions, while the C2H2 ZF domains facilitate DNA binding (Wang2018Characterisation). These domains are highly conserved across species, although the hinge and C-terminal regions exhibit significant sequence variations (Wang2018Characterisation).

The gene encoding ZBTB46 is organized into six exons and five introns, with the open reading frames spanning from exon 2 to exon 6 (Wang2018Characterisation). The penultimate exon is notably conserved across different species, including humans, mice, and zebrafish (Wang2018Characterisation).

ZBTB46 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and interactions. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing for functional diversity (Wang2018Characterisation). While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of ZBTB46 are not provided, the presence of conserved domains suggests a structured and functionally significant conformation.

## Function
ZBTB46 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and maintaining quiescence in response to mechanical stimuli such as shear stress. It is expressed in quiescent endothelial cells and is downregulated in proliferating cells and those exposed to oscillatory shear stress. ZBTB46 overexpression in human aortic endothelial cells suppresses cell proliferation by increasing the number of cells in the G0/G1 phase and reducing those in the S phase, indicating a role in cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis or senescence (Wang2019ZBTB46).

ZBTB46 functions by regulating the expression of cell cycle proteins, including the downregulation of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and increasing the expression of the CDK inhibitor CDKN1A (p21). This leads to reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, affecting cell cycle progression (Wang2019ZBTB46). ZBTB46 also decreases angiogenic capacity, as shown by reduced tube formation in a Matrigel assay (Wang2019ZBTB46).

In addition to its role in endothelial cells, ZBTB46 is involved in the development and function of classical dendritic cells (cDCs), distinguishing them from other immune lineages. It acts as a transcriptional repressor, enforcing cDC lineage restriction by suppressing the expression of alternate myeloid growth factor receptors (Satpathy2012Zbtb46).

## Clinical Significance
ZBTB46 is implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In prostate cancer, ZBTB46 acts as a tumor promoter, contributing to androgen-independent proliferation and metastasis. Its overexpression is associated with resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and is linked to the progression of prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with neuroendocrine differentiation (CRPC-NE) (Liu2019Leukemia; Chen2017Inhibition). ZBTB46 enhances the expression of SNAI1, a key driver of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting metastasis (Chen2017Inhibition). It is negatively regulated by androgen receptor (AR) signaling through microRNA-1 (miR-1), and its expression increases when AR signaling is inhibited (Chen2017Inhibition).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ZBTB46 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. It is essential for the survival and proliferation of AML cells, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Liu2020Zinc). The circular RNA derived from ZBTB46, circZBTB46, is also upregulated in AML and may serve as a diagnostic indicator due to its high expression in AML patients compared to healthy controls (Long2023CircZBTB46).

## Interactions
ZBTB46 is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and cellular functions. It is known to bind to specific DNA motifs, such as the 46RE motif near the transcription start site of the SNAI1 gene, regulating its expression. This interaction is modulated by androgen receptor (AR) signaling, where dihydrotestosterone (DHT) reduces ZBTB46 binding, and enzalutamide enhances it (Chen2017Inhibition).

ZBTB46 also interacts with the Cebpb promoter, a transcription factor involved in myeloid gene regulation, suggesting a role in modulating immune cell differentiation (Kabir2024ZBTB46). In endothelial cells, ZBTB46 regulates the expression of cell cycle proteins, including cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and increases the expression of the CDK inhibitor CDKN1A (p21), affecting cell proliferation (Wang2019ZBTB46).

The protein is part of the POK/ZBTB family, characterized by a POZ domain for protein-protein interactions and zinc finger domains for DNA binding, although specific protein interactions involving ZBTB46 are not detailed in the available context (Chen2017Inhibition). These interactions highlight ZBTB46's role in transcriptional regulation and its impact on cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and immune response.
