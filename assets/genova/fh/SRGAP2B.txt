# SRGAP2B

## Overview
SRGAP2B is a human-specific gene that encodes the protein SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 2B, which is a truncated version of the ancestral SRGAP2A protein. This protein is characterized by the presence of an F-BAR domain, which is involved in membrane deformation and cytoskeletal organization, but lacks the RhoGAP and SH3 domains found in the full-length SRGAP2A. The SRGAP2B protein is intrinsically unstable and subject to proteasome-mediated degradation, which suggests a limited functional role in healthy human cells. Despite this, SRGAP2B plays a significant role in the development and maturation of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, by modulating synaptic density and maturation. It interacts with its ancestral paralog, SRGAP2A, and other proteins such as SYNGAP1 and CTNND2, influencing synaptic development and potentially impacting neurodevelopmental disorders. Variability in SRGAP2B expression and its involvement in synaptic and microglial maturation underscore its importance in human brain development and its potential clinical significance (DiazSalazar2024Humanspecific; LibéPhilippot2023Human; Schmidt2019The).

## Structure
SRGAP2B is a human-specific paralog of the ancestral SRGAP2A gene, resulting from a partial duplication event. This duplication led to the formation of a truncated protein that includes the F-BAR domain but lacks the RhoGAP and SH3 domains present in the full-length SRGAP2A (UribeSalazar2024Zebrafish; Rincic2016Complex). The F-BAR domain is involved in membrane deformation and cytoskeletal organization, allowing SRGAP2B to participate in modulating actin dynamics and cell signaling (UribeSalazar2024Zebrafish).

The truncation in SRGAP2B results in a protein that is intrinsically unstable and subject to proteasome-mediated degradation (Schmidt2019The). Unlike SRGAP2C, SRGAP2B does not have additional mutations that enhance its interaction with SRGAP2A, which suggests different functional roles and evolutionary pressures (Schmidt2019The). SRGAP2B exhibits significant copy number variation in the human population, indicating variability in its expression and potential functional impact (Schmidt2019The).

The protein's structure is primarily defined by the F-BAR domain, which facilitates dimerization and interaction with other proteins, although the specific quaternary structure details are not fully elucidated (UribeSalazar2024Zebrafish).

## Function
SRGAP2B is a human-specific paralog of the SRGAP2 gene, which plays a role in the development and maturation of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. SRGAP2B, along with SRGAP2C, is involved in inducing neotenic features in microglia, characterized by a slower maturation trajectory compared to other species. This delayed maturation is crucial for synaptic development in cortical neurons, allowing for extended periods of synaptic plasticity and development, which are thought to contribute to higher cognitive abilities in humans (DiazSalazar2024Humanspecific).

SRGAP2B is expressed in human microglia and is necessary for the structural and functional maturation of these cells. It acts as a genetic modifier, coordinating the emergence of neotenic features by inhibiting the ancestral SRGAP2A gene, which leads to increased synaptic density and prolonged synaptic maturation (DiazSalazar2024Humanspecific; Schmidt2019The). Despite its role in microglial development, SRGAP2B is subject to nonsense-mediated decay due to splicing patterns that lead to premature truncation, suggesting it may not have a significant functional role in healthy human cells (Dougherty2018Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SRGAP2B gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. SRGAP2B, along with its paralog SRGAP2C, plays a crucial role in synaptic development and maturation. Alterations in SRGAP2B expression can disrupt the balance between SRGAP2A and SYNGAP1, which is essential for proper synaptic development. This disruption has been associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as SYNGAP1 mutations are frequently linked to these conditions (LibéPhilippot2023Human).

SRGAP2B is also involved in the morphological and functional maturation of microglia, a type of glial cell in the brain. Alterations in SRGAP2B expression can lead to changes in microglial morphology, potentially impacting conditions related to microglial dysfunction (DiazSalazar2024Humanspecific).

Additionally, SRGAP2B has been identified as one of the human-specific genes potentially involved in brain development and microcephaly, although specific clinical conditions directly linked to SRGAP2B mutations are not well-documented (Heide2021HumanSpecific). The gene's splicing differences and its susceptibility to nonsense-mediated decay may also have clinical significance, particularly in the context of genetic disorders related to gene expression regulation (Dougherty2018Transcriptional).

## Interactions
SRGAP2B is involved in several interactions that influence synaptic development and maturation. It interacts with its ancestral paralog, SRGAP2A, by forming insoluble complexes that are targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation. This interaction results in the downregulation of SRGAP2A, which is crucial for modulating synaptic density and maturation in cortical neurons (Schmidt2019The; LibéPhilippot2023Human). SRGAP2B, along with SRGAP2C, modulates the balance between SRGAP2A and SYNGAP1, a key regulator of synaptic formation. This modulation is essential for maintaining a neotenic pace of synaptic development in humans, as SRGAP2B/C promotes SYNGAP1, counteracting the effects of SRGAP2A (LibéPhilippot2023Human).

SRGAP2B also influences the levels of CTNND2, a protein necessary for synaptic neoteny. Knockdown of SRGAP2B/C decreases CTNND2 levels, which in turn affects the synaptic recruitment of SYNGAP1. This interaction highlights the complex interplay between SRGAP2B, CTNND2, and SYNGAP1 in synaptic maturation (Assendorp2022CTNND2). These interactions underscore the role of SRGAP2B in the regulation of synaptic development and its potential impact on neurodevelopmental disorders.
