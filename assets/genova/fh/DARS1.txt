# DARS1

## Overview
DARS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme aspartyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (AspRS), which is a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family. This enzyme plays a critical role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid aspartate to its corresponding tRNA, a process essential for accurate translation of genetic information into proteins. AspRS is categorized as a cytoplasmic enzyme and is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with particularly high expression in neuronal regions such as the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex, indicating its importance in neuronal function and synaptic plasticity (Fröhlich2017In; Fröhlich2021A). The enzyme's proper function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and disruptions can lead to severe developmental and neurological disorders. DARS1 is also a component of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex, interacting with other synthetases and auxiliary proteins to facilitate tRNA binding and support protein biosynthesis (Kong2020Cell‐based; Hahn2019The).

## Function
The DARS1 gene encodes the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS), an enzyme essential for protein synthesis in human cells. AspRS catalyzes the aminoacylation reaction, which involves attaching the amino acid aspartate to its corresponding tRNA, a process known as tRNA charging. This reaction is crucial for the accurate translation of genetic information into proteins, ensuring that proteins are synthesized correctly and efficiently (Fröhlich2017In; Fröhlich2021A).

AspRS functions as a homodimer and is ubiquitously expressed in all cells and tissues, with particularly high expression in neurons of the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex. This suggests a significant role in neuronal function and protein synthesis at synapses, which is important for processes like synaptic plasticity (Fröhlich2017In; Fröhlich2021A). The enzyme is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it associates with the translation machinery, and is also present at synapses, indicating its involvement in local protein synthesis (Fröhlich2017In).

Proper AspRS function is critical for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Disruptions in its activity can lead to severe developmental and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in normal physiological processes (Klugmann2022Developmental; Fröhlich2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DARS1 gene, which encodes the cytoplasmic aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, are associated with a rare neurological disorder known as Hypomyelination with Brainstem and Spinal Cord Involvement and Leg Spasticity (HBSL). This condition is characterized by early-onset motor impairment, spasticity, ataxia, and nystagmus, with symptoms often appearing in infancy. The disease is linked to recessive missense mutations in the DARS1 gene, leading to a deficiency in the enzyme crucial for protein translation (Zhu2023Leukoencephalopathy; Fröhlich2021A).

HBSL is marked by hypomyelination in the central nervous system, affecting the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles, and spinal cord. The severity and onset of the disease can vary, with some cases presenting as early as four months of age (Fröhlich2021A). Neuroimaging typically shows symmetrical high signals in T2-weighted images of the supratentorial white matter, brainstem, and cerebellar region (Liu2022Case).

The mutations in DARS1 result in non-synonymous amino acid substitutions in highly conserved residues, impairing the enzyme's function and leading to white matter disorders (Zhu2023Leukoencephalopathy). The specific mechanism by which these mutations cause HBSL is not fully understood, but they are believed to affect the multi-synthetase complex function, crucial for protein translation (Zhu2023Leukoencephalopathy).

## Interactions
Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (DARS1) is a component of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) in mammals, which includes eight cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and three auxiliary proteins. DARS1 forms part of a tertiary subcomplex with the C-terminus of QARS1 and the N-terminus of AIMP1, facilitating tRNA binding through rigid-body rotational motion (Kong2020Cell‐based). Within the MSC, DARS1 interacts with AIMP2 and EPRS, forming a ternary subcomplex. This interaction is characterized by strong hydrogen bonding, particularly between the 7-9 loop of DARS1 and the 2-2 loop of AIMP2 GST, with Ser156 of AIMP2 GST playing a crucial role (Hahn2019The). The DARS1 protein maintains its structure in the DA2E subcomplex, centered around a homodimer with twofold rotational symmetry, and interacts with AIMP2 GST primarily through residues in the 7-9 loop and the C-terminus of helix 9 (Hahn2019The).

DARS1 is also involved in binary or tertiary GST-homology domain complexes, such as EPRS1 GST :AIMP2 GST :DARS1, which support subcellular translocations for non-translational roles (Kong2020Cell‐based). These interactions are essential for the MSC's role in protein biosynthesis and other cellular processes (Hahn2019The).
