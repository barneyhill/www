# MAP2K6

## Overview
MAP2K6, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, is a gene that encodes a dual-specificity kinase involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The protein product of MAP2K6, MKK6, plays a critical role in cellular responses to stress and inflammation by specifically activating p38 MAPK isoforms through phosphorylation. This kinase is integral to various cellular processes, including differentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses, by mediating stress-induced signaling pathways (Li2018MAP2K6; Rasmussen2016miR6253p). Structurally, MKK6 exhibits a typical kinase fold with distinct N-terminal and C-terminal lobes, and its activity is regulated through interactions with other proteins such as MAP3K3 and scaffold proteins like JIP3 (Han1996Characterization; Matsumoto2012Crystal). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various diseases, including cancer and obesity, where alterations in MAP2K6 expression or function can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Schulz2018Lossoffunction; Lee2021RMRRelated).

## Structure
The MAP2K6 protein, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, exhibits a typical kinase fold characterized by a smaller N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe connected by a flexible hinge (Matsumoto2012Crystal). The structure of non-phosphorylated MAP2K6 (npMAP2K6) reveals a unique auto-inhibition mechanism involving three short α-helices in the activation loop region, termed activation helices (AH1, AH2, and AH3). These helices contribute to the conformational stability of the protein in its inactive state (Matsumoto2012Crystal).

The ATP binding site of npMAP2K6 is located between the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes, with AMP-PNP bound in a canonical state. The adenine moiety of AMP-PNP is anchored by hydrogen bonds with Met129, Glu130, and Met132, and is situated in a hydrophobic pocket (Matsumoto2012Crystal). The C-terminal DVD domain is crucial for binding with MAP3K3, facilitating specific interactions within the MAP kinase signaling pathway (Matsumoto2012Crystal).

MAP2K6 is involved in the phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAPK, and its structure is stabilized in an inactive conformation in the non-phosphorylated state, contrasting with the flexible active conformation seen in phosphorylated states (Matsumoto2012Crystal).

## Function
MAP2K6, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, is a dual-specificity kinase that plays a pivotal role in the MAPK signaling pathway. It specifically activates p38 MAPK, which is crucial for cellular responses to stress and inflammation. MAP2K6 is involved in the dual phosphorylation of the TGY motif in the activation loop of p38 MAPK isoforms, which is essential for conveying p38-mediated cellular stress signaling (Rasmussen2016miR6253p). This kinase is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as cell differentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses.

In healthy human cells, MAP2K6 is a key regulator of the p38 MAPK pathway, which is involved in stress-induced transcription, translation, cell cycle control, and apoptosis (Rasmussen2016miR6253p). It plays a significant role in transducing cellular and environmental stress signals, thereby contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Rasmussen2016miR6253p). MAP2K6's activity is crucial for the proper functioning of various physiological processes, including cell growth, development, and division, as well as inflammatory reactions (Li2018MAP2K6). Its regulatory functions make it a potential therapeutic target for conditions involving stress and inflammation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAP2K6 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In human malignancies, a specific mutation in MAP2K6, changing a uAUG to uACG, was identified in a colon adenocarcinoma sample. This germline variant is associated with a potential predisposition to tumor development, as it leads to a significant increase in translation, potentially contributing to malignant transformation through the overexpression of downstream oncoproteins (Schulz2018Lossoffunction).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), high MAP2K6 expression is linked to radiation resistance and poor prognosis. Patients with elevated MAP2K6 levels exhibit a higher rate of radioresistance, which adversely affects survival outcomes (Li2018MAP2K6).

MAP2K6 variations are also associated with obesity in children. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MAP2K6 gene correlate with increased risk of overweight and obesity, particularly in boys. These genetic variations influence resting metabolic rate and are affected by dietary factors, such as fat intake (Lee2021RMRRelated).

In colorectal cancer, miR-625-3p targets MAP2K6, contributing to oxaliplatin resistance by inactivating the MAP2K6-p38 signaling pathway, which is crucial for apoptosis and cell cycle control (Rasmussen2016miR6253p).

## Interactions
MAP2K6, also known as MKK6, is a dual-specificity kinase that plays a crucial role in the MAPK signaling pathway by specifically activating p38 MAPK isoforms. It interacts with MAPK14 (p38α), MAPK11 (p38β), and MAPK12 (p38γ), facilitating their activation through phosphorylation (Han1996Characterization). MAP2K6 is activated by MAP3K3 through dual phosphorylation events, which is essential for its role in stress-induced responses (Matsumoto2012Crystal). The interaction with MAP3K3 is mediated by the DVD domain at the C-terminus and the D domain at the N-terminus of MAP2K6 (Matsumoto2012Crystal).

MAP2K6 also forms part of a signaling complex with scaffold proteins such as JIP3, which aid in the transduction of signals within the cell (Han1996Characterization). In the context of colorectal cancer, MAP2K6 is targeted by miR-625-3p, which downregulates its expression and impairs the p38 MAPK stress signaling pathway, contributing to oxaliplatin resistance (Rasmussen2016miR6253p). This interaction highlights the regulatory role of MAP2K6 in cellular stress responses and its involvement in cancer drug resistance mechanisms.
