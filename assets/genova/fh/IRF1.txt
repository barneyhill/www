# IRF1

## Overview
IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the interferon regulatory factor family, which plays a critical role in the regulation of immune responses, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. The IRF1 protein is characterized by a unique DNA-binding domain with a helix-turn-helix motif, enabling it to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. As a transcription factor, IRF1 is pivotal in the induction of interferon-stimulated genes and the establishment of an antiviral state, contributing to host defense mechanisms against viral infections. It also collaborates with tumor suppressor proteins to mediate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, thereby preventing the accumulation of genetic mutations. Furthermore, IRF1 is essential for the development and function of immune cells, such as natural killer cells, and plays a role in the regulation of major histocompatibility complex molecules, which are crucial for antigen presentation and T cell activation (Taniguchi2001IRF).

## Structure
The IRF1 protein is characterized by a unique DNA-binding domain with a helix-turn-helix motif, which is part of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. This domain includes a 'tryptophan cluster' that interacts with DNA, involving three of the five conserved tryptophans (Trp 11, Trp 38, and Trp 58) that form hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts with the DNA backbone (Escalante1998Structure). The DNA-binding region of IRF1 has an α/β architecture, consisting of three α-helices (α1-α3) and a mixed four-stranded β-sheet (β1-β4) (Escalante1998Structure).

The tertiary structure of IRF1 is stabilized by hydrophobic contacts with conserved phenylalanines (Phe 55 and Phe 81) within the protein's interior (Escalante1998Structure). The protein can form part of a nucleoprotein complex called the enhanceosome, indicating a potential quaternary structure involving interactions with other transcriptional activators (Escalante1998Structure).

IRF1 also contains several functional domains, including a nuclear location signal (NLS) and a transcriptional activation domain, which are crucial for its role as a transcriptional activator (SCHAPER1998Functional). The protein's activity can be modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in regulating the immune response, cell cycle, and apoptosis in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate the expression of various genes involved in these processes (Tanaka1993Recognition; Taniguchi2001IRF).

IRF1 is crucial for the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and the establishment of an antiviral state in cells. It is involved in the transcriptional activation of the IFN-β gene and other IFN-inducible genes, contributing to the host defense against viral infections (Feng2021Interferon; Taniguchi2001IRF). IRF1 also plays a significant role in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. It cooperates with the tumor suppressor p53 to activate the CDK inhibitor p21 WAF1/CIP1, which is crucial for DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest, thereby preventing mutation accumulation (Taniguchi2001IRF).

In the immune system, IRF1 is essential for the development and function of natural killer (NK) cells and the induction of the IL-12p40 gene, which is vital for Th1 cell differentiation (Taniguchi2001IRF). It also regulates the expression of MHC class I and II molecules, which are critical for antigen presentation and the activation of CD8+ T cells (Taniguchi2001IRF).

## Clinical Significance
IRF1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) plays a significant role in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In cancer, IRF1 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its loss or reduced function is linked to increased tumor incidence. Mutations such as K75E and E222K in IRF1 are associated with leukemia, affecting the protein's DNA-binding ability and contributing to disease pathogenesis (Kamaraj2020Effect). In breast cancer, loss of IRF1 is linked to higher recurrence and mortality risk (Yanai2012The).

IRF1 expression is also implicated in asthma, where its down-regulation following glucocorticoid treatment may serve as a biomarker for treatment response (Chapin2015Peripheral). In glioma, increased IRF1 expression correlates with tumor progression and poorer survival outcomes, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis (Lei2021Interferon).

IRF1 is involved in immune responses, and its altered expression is linked to conditions like chronic hepatitis and tuberculosis. In these diseases, IRF1's role in regulating immune cell differentiation and apoptosis is crucial (Antonczyk2019Direct). In prostate cancer, IRF1 repression by proteins like DTX3L and ARTD9 contributes to cancer cell survival and proliferation (Bachmann2014DTX3L).

## Interactions
IRF1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) is involved in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. IRF1 interacts with nucleophosmin (NPM) through its intrinsically disordered Mf2 domain, specifically within a core motif that includes Lys 134 -Ser 139, with Arg 137 being critical for stable binding. This interaction is significant as NPM can stimulate the nuclear import of its client proteins (Narayan2011A).

IRF1 also forms complexes with Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) and tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28). YB-1 binds to the Mf2 domain and can repress IRF1-dependent transcription, suggesting a regulatory role in modulating IRF1's transcriptional activity (Narayan2011A). TRIM28, a transcriptional corepressor, also interacts with the Mf2 region, forming a complex interface with IRF1 (Narayan2011A).

In terms of DNA interactions, IRF1 binds to DNA through its N-terminal DNA-binding domain, which contains tryptophan residues crucial for recognizing specific DNA sequences, such as the 'GAAA' sequence within the IFNβ promoter. This interaction is essential for IRF1's role in transcriptional regulation (Feng2021Interferon; Escalante1998Structure).
