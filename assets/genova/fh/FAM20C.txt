# FAM20C

## Overview
FAM20C is a gene that encodes a protein kinase known as FAM20C Golgi-associated secretory pathway kinase, which is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus. This kinase is integral to the phosphorylation of secreted proteins, playing a pivotal role in biomineralization processes essential for bone and tooth formation. The FAM20C protein is characterized by its ability to phosphorylate proteins with the S-x-E/pS motif, influencing the activity of key proteins involved in mineralization, such as dentin matrix protein 1 and osteopontin. Additionally, FAM20C regulates phosphate homeostasis by modulating fibroblast growth factor 23 activity. Mutations in the FAM20C gene are linked to Raine syndrome, a condition marked by osteosclerotic bone dysplasia and craniofacial anomalies. Beyond its role in biomineralization, FAM20C is implicated in various cellular processes and signaling pathways, including interactions with proteins like Periostin and involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway (Xu2021Fam20C; Wang2012Inactivation; Ishikawa2012The).

## Structure
The FAM20C protein, encoded by the FAM20C gene, is a Golgi-localized kinase involved in phosphorylating secreted proteins. It consists of 584 amino acids and includes a signal peptide at the N-terminal, directing it to the secretory pathway (PalmaLara2021FAM20C). The kinase domain of FAM20C spans 222 amino acids and is characterized by a two-lobe structure typical of protein kinases, with a conserved C-terminal domain (PalmaLara2021FAM20C; Xu2021Fam20C).

The tertiary structure of FAM20C forms a specific three-dimensional shape crucial for its function, with a protein kinase-like fold contained in a shell-like structure formed by an N-terminal segment and a novel insertion domain (Xu2021Fam20C). The quaternary structure of FAM20C involves homodimerization, which is critical for its kinase activity. This dimerization is evolutionarily conserved and involves a face-to-face configuration with another FAM20C molecule or its pseudokinase paralog Fam20A (Zhang2018Structure).

FAM20C undergoes post-translational modifications, including autophosphorylation, which is essential for its function as a kinase (Ishikawa2012The). The protein is responsible for generating the majority of the secreted phosphoproteome, with over 100 genuine substrates (PalmaLara2021FAM20C).

## Function
The FAM20C gene encodes a protein kinase that is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a critical role in the phosphorylation of secreted proteins involved in biomineralization processes. This kinase is responsible for phosphorylating proteins with the S-x-E/pS motif, which includes several key proteins such as dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), osteopontin (OPN), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) (Xu2021Fam20C; Ishikawa2012The). These phosphorylated proteins are essential for the proper formation and mineralization of bone and teeth, contributing to the differentiation and maturation of osteoblasts and odontoblasts (Wang2012Inactivation; Ishikawa2012The).

FAM20C also regulates phosphate homeostasis by influencing the activity of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a hormone that controls phosphate metabolism. Inactivation of FAM20C leads to elevated levels of FGF23, resulting in hypophosphatemic conditions (Wang2012Inactivation). The kinase activity of FAM20C is characterized by its ability to phosphorylate casein and other secreted proteins, with a preference for Mn2+ as a cofactor (Tagliabracci2012Secreted; Ishikawa2012The). This activity is crucial for maintaining normal bone density and structure, as evidenced by its association with conditions like Raine syndrome when mutated (Ishikawa2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM20C gene are primarily associated with Raine syndrome (RS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by osteosclerotic bone dysplasia, distinctive facial features, and often severe respiratory insufficiency. RS can be classified into lethal and non-lethal forms, with the lethal form typically resulting in death during the neonatal period or early infancy, while the non-lethal form presents with milder symptoms and a longer lifespan (Bajaj2021Recurrent; Chirteș2023Compound; HernándezZavala2020Two). 

The FAM20C gene encodes a kinase that plays a crucial role in biomineralization by phosphorylating secreted proteins. Mutations in this gene can lead to a loss of function, resulting in truncated proteins that lack the kinase domain, which is essential for its function. This loss of function is linked to the severe phenotypes observed in RS, including generalized osteosclerosis and craniofacial anomalies (Xu2021Fam20C; HernándezZavala2020Two). 

Alterations in FAM20C expression have also been implicated in various cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, where high expression levels correlate with poor prognosis. FAM20C affects tumor cell migration, immune cell infiltration, and resistance to therapies (Xu2021Fam20C).

## Interactions
FAM20C interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It directly binds to and phosphorylates Periostin, a protein involved in periodontal tissue development. This interaction occurs independently of FAM20C's kinase activity, with the binding domain located within the Fas I domain of Periostin. FAM20C phosphorylates Periostin in vitro, which is essential for its function in cell proliferation and migration (Lin2020FAM20C).

FAM20C also interacts with FAM20A, forming a protein complex that regulates FAM20C's localization and secretion. FAM20A enhances the secretion of FAM20C, which is crucial for its extracellular function in mineralized tissues. This interaction is independent of FAM20C's kinase activity and is necessary for proper biomineralization (Ohyama2016FAM20A).

Additionally, FAM20C is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, interacting with components such as β-catenin and TCF4. The knockout of Fam20c in osteoblasts affects the expression of these proteins, indicating a regulatory role in this pathway (Liu2023Fam20c). These interactions highlight FAM20C's significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating signaling pathways.
