# MAFF

## Overview
MAFF (MAF bZIP transcription factor F) is a gene that encodes a small basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein involved in transcriptional regulation. The MAFF protein is a member of the small Maf family, characterized by its ability to form dimers, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. Unlike larger Maf proteins, MAFF lacks a transactivation domain, which allows it to act primarily as a transcriptional repressor when forming homodimers. However, it can also function as a transcriptional activator when heterodimerized with other bZIP proteins, such as NF-E2 p45, influencing gene expression related to erythroid differentiation and hematopoietic processes (Motohashi1997The; Kataoka1995Small). MAFF's interactions with other proteins, such as Fos and BACH1, play significant roles in cellular processes, including oxidative stress response and cancer progression, particularly through pathways like IL11-STAT3 signaling (Moon2021The).

## Structure
MAFF (MAF bZIP transcription factor F) is a small basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein that plays a role in transcription regulation. The primary structure of MAFF consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain, which includes a bZIP domain essential for DNA binding and dimerization (Motohashi1997The; Kataoka1995Small). This domain facilitates the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other bZIP proteins, such as Fos, but not with Jun (Kataoka1995Small).

The secondary structure of MAFF includes alpha helices, which are part of the leucine zipper motif crucial for dimerization and DNA binding (Kataoka1995Small). The tertiary structure involves the folding of the protein into a three-dimensional shape, which is vital for its function as a transcription factor. The quaternary structure of MAFF is characterized by its ability to form dimers, which are necessary for its role in transcription regulation (Kataoka1995Small).

MAFF lacks a trans-activator domain, distinguishing it from larger Maf proteins, and acts as a negative regulator of transcription when forming homodimers. However, it can act as a transcriptional activator when heterodimerized with NF-E2 p45 (Kataoka1995Small). Common post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect its activity and stability, although specific modifications for MAFF are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
MAFF (MAF bZIP transcription factor F) is a member of the small Maf family of transcription factors, which play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by forming heterodimers with other bZIP proteins. In healthy human cells, MAFF is involved in regulating gene expression related to erythroid cell-specific gene expression and hematopoietic cell differentiation. It can form heterodimers with proteins such as NF-E2 p45 and Ech, which are essential for recognizing DNA-binding sequences related to the AP-1 site, thereby influencing erythroid differentiation and hematopoietic processes (Motohashi1997The; Kataoka1995Small).

MAFF lacks a transactivation domain and functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor when forming homodimers. However, when it heterodimerizes with larger subunits like CNC family members, it can activate transcription, playing a role in the precise control of gene expression during cell differentiation (Motohashi1997The). MAFF is also involved in modulating transcriptional activity by forming heterodimers with proteins such as Fos, influencing DNA-binding specificity and potentially acting as a competitive repressor of the NF-E2 transcription factor (Kataoka1995Small). These interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating processes like oxidative stress response and detoxification.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAFF gene have been implicated in various cancers, including liver and breast cancer. In liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MAFF is highly expressed in tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and is crucial for their self-renewal and metastasis. The circular RNA cia-MAF promotes MAFF expression by recruiting the TIP60 chromatin remodeling complex to the MAFF promoter, enhancing its transcription. This interaction is vital for liver TIC self-renewal and metastasis, suggesting that targeting MAFF could be a therapeutic strategy for HCC, especially in cases without MAFA/MAFG gene copy number alterations (Chen2021Circular).

In breast cancer, MAFF is identified as a hypoxia-induced gene that regulates tumor invasion and metastasis through the IL11/STAT3 signaling pathway. Its expression is higher in metastatic tissues compared to primary tumors and correlates with poor patient survival. MAFF interacts with BACH1 to enhance IL11 expression, promoting tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis. Knockdown of MAFF reduces tumor cell invasion and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in breast cancer (Moon2021The).

## Interactions
MAFF, a small Maf protein, participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It can form homodimers and heterodimers with other small Maf proteins such as MafK and MafG, which are crucial for binding to Maf recognition elements (MAREs) on DNA. The integrity of the leucine zipper structure is essential for these DNA-binding activities (Kataoka1995Small). MAFF also forms heterodimers with the Fos protein, but not with Jun, indicating selective interaction with certain nuclear oncoproteins (Kataoka1995Small).

In the context of cancer, MAFF interacts with the BACH1 protein, particularly under hypoxic conditions. This interaction enhances the transcriptional activation of IL11, which subsequently activates the STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting tumor invasion and metastasis (Moon2021The). MAFF's role in tumor progression is further highlighted by its involvement in the IL11-STAT3 signaling pathway, where it binds to the IL11 promoter in conjunction with BACH1 (Moon2021The).

Additionally, MAFF is involved in the regulation of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) permeability through its interaction with the lncRNA LINC00673, which affects the stability of MAFF mRNA and its subsequent binding to promoters of tight junction proteins (Shen2020RBFOX1).
