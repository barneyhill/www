# ANKRD53

## Overview
ANKRD53 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 53 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, making ANKRD53 a crucial scaffold protein involved in mitotic processes. The protein plays a significant role in maintaining spindle stability and microtubule polymerization during cell division, primarily through its interactions with mitotic kinases such as Aurora B, Aurora A, and Cdk1. These interactions are essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation. ANKRD53's function is further modulated by its phosphorylation status, which influences its role in different stages of mitosis, including metaphase and cytokinesis. The protein's interaction with DDA3, a regulator of spindle dynamics, underscores its importance in ensuring successful cell division and maintaining nuclear integrity. Alterations in the ANKRD53 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and neuromuscular disorders, highlighting its potential significance in human health and disease (Kim2016ANKRD53; Wong2022Association).

## Structure
ANKRD53 is a protein characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs, which are common structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These motifs typically form a helix-loop-helix structure, contributing to the protein's secondary structure (Kim2016ANKRD53; Mosavi2004The). ANKRD53 contains three ankyrin repeats, each consisting of approximately 33 residues that form antiparallel alpha-helices linked by beta-hairpin motifs (Kim2016ANKRD53). This structural arrangement allows ANKRD53 to function as a scaffold for facilitating protein interactions, particularly during mitosis.

The protein undergoes phosphorylation by mitotic kinases such as Aurora B, Aurora A, and Cdk1, which is crucial for its role in spindle stability and microtubule polymerization during cell division (Kim2016ANKRD53). This post-translational modification suggests that ANKRD53 may have different functional states depending on its phosphorylation status.

While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of ANKRD53 are not provided, its interaction with DDA3 and localization to spindle microtubules indicate its involvement in maintaining chromosome integrity and nuclear morphology during mitosis (Kim2016ANKRD53).

## Function
ANKRD53 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes during mitosis. The protein localizes to the spindle microtubules and is essential for maintaining spindle morphology and stability, which are crucial for proper chromosome alignment and segregation (Kim2016ANKRD53). ANKRD53 is phosphorylated by mitotic kinases such as Aurora B, Aurora A, and Cdk1 during early mitosis, indicating its role in regulating chromosome alignment in metaphase. Its dephosphorylated form is involved in cleavage furrow ingression and abscission during cytokinesis (Kim2016ANKRD53).

The protein interacts with DDA3, a known regulator of spindle dynamics, and counteracts its activity to ensure proper spindle microtubule polymerization and dynamics (Kim2016ANKRD53). ANKRD53's depletion leads to decreased microtubule density, mitotic delay, and defects such as binuclei and polylobed nuclei, highlighting its role in maintaining nuclear integrity and ensuring successful cell division (Kim2016ANKRD53). These functions underscore ANKRD53's importance in maintaining chromosome integrity and stability during cell division, which is vital for normal cellular function and organismal development (Kim2016ANKRD53).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANKRD53 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. Promoter mutations of ANKRD53 have been associated with the upregulation of gene expression, similar to TERT gain-of-function promoter mutations, suggesting a potential regulatory impact on gene expression that may contribute to tumorigenesis (Wong2022Association). This highlights the role of ANKRD53 in cancer, particularly through its involvement in non-coding regions that affect gene expression.

In the context of neuromuscular disorders, a wide heterozygous duplication at 2p13.3, which includes the ANKRD53 gene, was detected in a patient with severe limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) phenotype. This suggests a possible link between ANKRD53 and neuromuscular disorders, although the specific clinical significance of ANKRD53 mutations in this context remains unclear (Piluso2011Motor).

Additionally, ANKRD53 has been identified as one of the hypomethylated regions in studies of Cockayne syndrome and physiological aging, indicating potential implications in neuromuscular alterations and cancer, although specific disease associations are not detailed (Crochemore2021Epigenomic). These findings suggest that ANKRD53 may play a role in various pathological conditions, but further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance.

## Interactions
ANKRD53 interacts with DDA3, a microtubule-destabilizing factor, to regulate spindle dynamics during mitosis. This interaction was identified through proteomic analysis and confirmed by immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis, showing that GFP-DDA3 and endogenous ANKRD53 interact after prometaphase (Kim2016ANKRD53). ANKRD53 is recruited to the spindle by DDA3, and its localization is crucial for proper spindle function during cell division. In DDA3-depleted cells, the level of ANKRD53 on the mitotic spindle is reduced, indicating a physical interaction where DDA3 influences ANKRD53's localization (Kim2016ANKRD53).

ANKRD53 is involved in regulating microtubule polymerization, with its depletion leading to decreased microtubule density and altered nuclear morphology. This suggests that ANKRD53 plays a role in chromosome alignment and cytokinesis by regulating microtubule polymerization (Kim2016ANKRD53). ANKRD53 and DDA3 have opposing roles in spindle microtubule polymerization, with ANKRD53 counteracting DDA3's activity (Kim2016ANKRD53). The phosphorylation of ANKRD53 by mitotic kinases during early mitosis suggests that its phosphorylated form is involved in chromosome alignment during metaphase, while its dephosphorylated form may regulate cytokinesis (Kim2016ANKRD53).
