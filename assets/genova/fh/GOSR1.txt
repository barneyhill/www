# GOSR1

## Overview
GOSR1 is a gene that encodes the protein Golgi SNAP receptor complex member 1, also known as GS28, which is a Qb-SNARE protein. This protein is integral to the vesicular transport system within the Golgi apparatus, playing a pivotal role in the fusion of vesicles with target membranes, a process essential for intra-Golgi protein trafficking (Isali2019Gene; Miličić2023The). As a component of the STX5/GOSR1/BET1L/YKT6 SNARE complex, GOSR1 is crucial for the trafficking of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, thereby maintaining cellular organization and function (D’Souza2022STX5’s; Khakurel2022GARP). The gene's expression is linked to various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix organization, underscoring its importance in cellular architecture and communication (Isali2019Gene).

## Structure


## Function
GOSR1, a member of the Golgi SNAP receptor complex, plays a critical role in vesicular transport within cells. It is involved in the fusion of cargo-carrying vesicles with target membranes, a process essential for intra-Golgi protein trafficking. This function is facilitated by its capabilities as a soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE), which is crucial for the proper transmission of neurotransmitters within the SNARE complex (Isali2019Gene; Miličić2023The).

In healthy human cells, GOSR1 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it impacts cellular organization and function by ensuring the efficient transport and secretion of proteins. This activity is vital for maintaining the structural integrity and functionality of the Golgi apparatus, which is central to processing and packaging proteins and lipids (Isali2019Gene).

The gene's expression has been linked to various cellular processes, including intermediate filament cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix organization, highlighting its broader role in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating communication between cells (Isali2019Gene). These functions underscore the importance of GOSR1 in maintaining normal cellular operations and its potential implications in conditions where these processes are disrupted.

## Interactions
GOSR1, also known as GS28, is a Qb-SNARE protein that plays a critical role in vesicular transport processes within the Golgi apparatus. It is a component of the STX5/GOSR1/BET1L/YKT6 SNARE complex, which is essential for the fusion of intra-Golgi recycling vesicles. This complex facilitates the trafficking of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (D’Souza2022STX5’s; Khakurel2022GARP).

In GARP-deficient cells, GOSR1 is significantly depleted, indicating its dependency on the GARP complex for proper localization and stability within the Golgi. This depletion is associated with Golgi defects, as GOSR1 is primarily localized in the Golgi in control cells but is displaced in GARP-KO cells (Khakurel2022GARP). The GARP complex is involved in regulating the localization and stability of GOSR1, as well as other SNARE proteins like BET1L, which are crucial for Golgi function (Khakurel2023Role).

GOSR1 also interacts with other SNARE proteins such as STX5 and YKT6, forming a fusogenic SNARE complex that is involved in vesicle fusion at the Golgi. These interactions are vital for maintaining Golgi integrity and function (D’Souza2022STX5’s).
