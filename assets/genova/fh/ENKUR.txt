# ENKUR

## Overview
ENKUR is a gene that encodes the protein enkurin, which functions as a TRPC channel interacting protein. Enkurin is primarily involved in calcium signaling pathways, playing a critical role in ciliary and flagellar function. It acts as an adaptor protein, linking membrane calcium influx to intracellular signaling pathways, which is essential for processes such as sperm motility and fertilization. Enkurin's interaction with transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels is crucial for its role in calcium signaling, influencing sperm motility and embryonic development, particularly in the patterning of the left-right body axis (Sigg2017Evolutionary; Jungnickel2018The). Additionally, enkurin is implicated in various cellular signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Ma2019ENKURa; Ma2019ENKUR).

## Function
ENKUR, or enkurin, is a protein that plays a significant role in ciliary and flagellar function, particularly in calcium signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, ENKUR is involved in the regulation of calcium ion transport, acting as an adaptor protein that links membrane calcium influx to intracellular signaling pathways. This function is crucial for processes such as sperm motility and fertilization, where ENKUR is active in the flagella of sperm cells. It interacts with TRPC channels, which are essential for calcium signaling, thereby influencing sperm motility and the ability to navigate the female reproductive tract (Jungnickel2018The).

ENKUR is also implicated in the patterning of the left-right body axis during embryonic development. It is expressed in motile ciliated cells and localizes to cilia, where it is involved in generating or sensing nodal flow, a process critical for proper left-right axis specification. This role is linked to its interaction with TRP channels and calcium signaling proteins, suggesting that ENKUR may bridge these channels with downstream signaling components (Sigg2017Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ENKUR gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. In humans, mutations in ENKUR are associated with situs inversus totalis, a condition where the left-right body axis is completely reversed. A specific homozygous mutation, c.224-1delG, affects the splice acceptor site of the second ENKUR intron, leading to a lack of ENKUR expression in cilia. Despite this mutation, affected individuals do not exhibit respiratory symptoms typical of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), indicating that ENKUR is crucial for left-right axis determination but not necessary for ciliary motility in the respiratory tract (Sigg2017Evolutionary).

In cancer, ENKUR expression is significantly downregulated in various types, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). In CRC, reduced ENKUR expression is linked to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Ma2019ENKUR). Similarly, in LAD, ENKUR acts as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation associated with enhanced tumorigenic behaviors and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Ma2019ENKURa). These findings highlight ENKUR's potential involvement in cancer pathogenesis and its impact on cellular behaviors through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Ma2019ENKUR).

## Interactions
ENKUR, also known as enkurin, is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular signaling pathways. ENKUR is known to interact directly with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a key component of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. This interaction has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation analysis, indicating a physical association between ENKUR and PI3K in both colorectal cancer (CRC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) cells (Ma2019ENKURa; Ma2019ENKUR). 

In addition to its interaction with PI3K, ENKUR is involved in the regulation of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels. It interacts with several TRPC proteins, including TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5, modulating their activity and potentially serving as a bridge connecting PI3K signaling and TRPC channels (Ma2019ENKUR). 

ENKUR's interactions extend to its involvement in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, where it influences the phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK1/2, further highlighting its role in cellular signaling and cancer progression (Ma2019ENKURa). These interactions underscore ENKUR's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
