# C2CD2L

## Overview
C2CD2L is a gene that encodes the protein C2CD2-like, also known as TMEM24, which is primarily expressed in neurons and pancreatic β-cells. This protein functions as a transmembrane lipid transporter and plays a critical role in maintaining lipid homeostasis at the endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact sites. TMEM24 is characterized by its SMP domain, which facilitates lipid transport, and a C2 domain that is involved in membrane binding. The protein's interaction with the plasma membrane is regulated by calcium and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation, which modulates its dissociation in response to changes in cytosolic calcium levels (Johnson2023A; Sun2019Lipid). Additionally, TMEM24 interacts with band 4.1 proteins, linking it to cell adhesion molecules and supporting signaling at cell-cell contact sites, which is crucial for neuronal signaling and lipid exchange (Johnson2023A; Sun2019Lipid).

## Structure
The C2CD2L protein, also known as TMEM24, is primarily expressed in neurons and pancreatic β-cells. It is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane via an N-terminal transmembrane region. The protein features an SMP domain, a C2 domain, and a C-terminal region that is predicted to be primarily unstructured but contains stretches of high conservation, including a polybasic sequence (Johnson2023A; Sun2019Lipid). The SMP domain is involved in lipid transport and harbors glycerolipids, with a preference for inositol phospholipids (Sun2019Lipid).

TMEM24 dimerizes via the SMP domain, which serves as the lipid transport module (Johnson2023A). The protein binds to the plasma membrane through a charge-based association between its polybasic motif and negatively charged lipids on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This interaction is negatively regulated by Ca2+ and PKC-dependent phosphorylation of serine residues within the polybasic motif (Johnson2023A; Sun2019Lipid). TMEM24 interacts with band 4.1 proteins, linking it to cell adhesion molecules and potentially supporting signaling reactions at cell-cell contact sites (Johnson2023A). The protein's localization and function are closely tied to Ca2+ signaling in neurons (Sun2019Lipid).

## Function
The C2CD2L gene encodes the protein TMEM24, which functions as both an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/plasma membrane (PM) tether and a lipid transporter. TMEM24 is primarily expressed in neurons and pancreatic β-cells, where it plays a crucial role in lipid transport between the ER and PM at ER-PM contact sites. These sites are important for maintaining the lipid composition of cellular membranes, which is essential for cellular signaling and homeostasis (Johnson2023A; Sun2019Lipid).

TMEM24 is anchored in the ER membrane and contains an SMP domain responsible for lipid transport, specifically glycerolipids. It binds to the plasma membrane through a charge-based association with negatively charged lipids, a process regulated by calcium (Ca2+) and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation (Johnson2023A). The protein's dissociation from the PM in response to elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels is a key regulatory mechanism, suggesting a feedback loop between neuronal excitability and lipid exchange (Sun2019Lipid).

TMEM24 also interacts with band 4.1 proteins, linking it to cell adhesion molecules, which may support signaling reactions at cell-cell contact sites (Johnson2023A). This interaction is significant for intercellular signaling and lipid transport, particularly in synapses with post-synaptic cisterns (Johnson2023A).

## Interactions
C2CD2L, also known as TMEM24, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly at the endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact sites. It interacts with band 4.1 family proteins, which serve as adaptors linking C2CD2L to cell adhesion proteins at cell-cell contact sites. This interaction is facilitated by a β-sheet motif that forms a continuous chimeric β-sheet with band 4.1 proteins, allowing C2CD2L to co-cluster with proteins like SynCAM 1 at these sites (Johnson2023A).

C2CD2L also forms heterodimers with its paralog C2CD2 through their SMP domains, as demonstrated by co-expression and purification in bacterial systems (Sun2019Lipid). This dimerization is crucial for its function in lipid transport at ER-PM junctions.

The interaction of C2CD2L with the plasma membrane is regulated by calcium and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation, which influences its dissociation from the membrane in response to calcium elevations (Sun2019Lipid). These interactions suggest a role for C2CD2L in supporting signaling reactions and maintaining homeostatic responses to lipid perturbations at cell-cell contact sites (Johnson2023A).
