# CCNYL1

## Overview
CCNYL1 (cyclin Y-like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and development. The protein encoded by CCNYL1 is a regulatory component that interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), playing a pivotal role in spermatogenesis by influencing sperm motility and structural integrity (Zi2015CCNYL1). Additionally, CCNYL1 is crucial for the regulation of Wnt signaling pathways, particularly in the phosphorylation of LRP6, which affects the proliferation of mammary stem/progenitor cells (Zeng2016Essential). The protein is also implicated in primary cilia formation, acting as a regulator of the WNT/GSK3 signaling pathway, which is essential for ciliogenesis and the development of neural progenitor and kidney cells (Zhang2022Primary). The multifaceted roles of CCNYL1 highlight its importance in reproductive and developmental biology, with significant implications for understanding male infertility and ciliopathies.

## Structure


## Function
CCNYL1 (cyclin Y-like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in cell cycle regulation and development. In mammalian cells, CCNYL1 plays a significant role in the regulation of Wnt signaling, which is crucial for the maintenance and proliferation of mammary stem/progenitor cells. It is involved in the phosphorylation of LRP6, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby influencing β-catenin activity and promoting the expansion of these cells (Zeng2016Essential).

CCNYL1 is also essential for spermatogenesis in mice, where it interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16) to regulate sperm motility and structural integrity. This interaction enhances the stability and kinase activity of CDK16, which is necessary for proper sperm development and male fertility (Zi2015CCNYL1).

Additionally, CCNYL1 is implicated in primary cilia formation, acting as a regulator of the WNT/GSK3 signaling pathway. This function is crucial for ciliogenesis, affecting the development of neural progenitor cells and kidney cells in mouse embryos (Zhang2022Primary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CCNYL1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in male fertility and ciliopathies. In mice, the absence of CCNYL1 leads to male infertility due to impaired sperm motility and structural defects, highlighting its critical role in spermatogenesis. This infertility is linked to the reduced stability and activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), with which CCNYL1 interacts to maintain normal sperm function (Zi2015CCNYL1).

CCNYL1 is also implicated in ciliopathies, as it plays a role in primary cilia formation through WNT/GSK3 signaling pathways. Deficiencies in CCNYL1, along with its homolog CCNY, result in significant ciliary defects, such as reduced cilia number and length, which are associated with conditions like exencephaly and lipodystrophy in mice. These findings suggest that CCNYL1 is essential for proper cilia biogenesis and function, and its deficiency can lead to severe developmental and metabolic disorders (Zhang2022Primary; Seidl2023Mucociliary).

The specific involvement of CCNYL1 in these processes underscores its potential clinical significance in understanding and treating male infertility and ciliopathies, as well as its broader implications in reproductive and developmental health.

## Interactions
CCNYL1 interacts specifically with cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), forming a complex that plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis in mice. This interaction is stronger than that between CDK16 and its homologue, cyclin Y (CCNY) (Zi2015CCNYL1). CCNYL1 is localized on the membrane, while CDK16 is found both on the membrane and in the cytoplasm. The interaction between CCNYL1 and CDK16 is essential for maintaining the stability and kinase activity of CDK16, which is necessary for the late stages of spermatogenesis (Zi2015CCNYL1).

The binding of CCNYL1 to CDK16 requires the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of both proteins, while the protein kinase domain of CDK16 alone is insufficient for recruiting CCNYL1 (Zi2015CCNYL1). Phosphorylation of CDK16 is necessary for its interaction with CCNYL1, with specific phosphorylation sites, such as S146, being crucial for binding (Zi2015CCNYL1). The interaction between CCNYL1 and CDK16 also affects the phosphorylation status of CDK16, enhancing its kinase activity and stability (Zi2015CCNYL1). This complex may be involved in processes such as the shedding of the residual body and membrane separation during spermatogenesis (Zi2015CCNYL1).
