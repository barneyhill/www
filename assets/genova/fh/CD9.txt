# CD9

## Overview
CD9 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tetraspanin family, which is characterized by its four transmembrane domains. The CD9 protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. It is involved in the organization of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains within the plasma membrane, which are crucial for cellular communication and the regulation of immune responses (Oosterheert2020Implications; Umeda2020Structural). CD9 is expressed in a wide range of cell types, including hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, and is essential for processes such as leukocyte migration, hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, and sperm-egg fusion (Brosseau2018CD9). The protein's interactions with other cellular proteins, such as integrins and glycoproteins, further underscore its importance in modulating cell adhesion and signaling pathways (MachadoPineda2018CD9; Brosseau2018CD9). Additionally, CD9 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Liu2021CD9; P.C.2022Tetraspanin).

## Structure
The CD9 protein is a member of the tetraspanin family, characterized by its four transmembrane domains (h1-h4) and two extracellular loops: a small extracellular loop (SEL) and a large extracellular loop (LEL) (Oosterheert2020Implications; Umeda2020Structural). The transmembrane domains form a tightly bundled structure at the intracellular ends and a loosely packed arrangement at the extracellular ends, creating a large central cavity (Umeda2020Structural). The LEL is stabilized by disulfide bonds between conserved cysteine residues, contributing to the protein's structural integrity (Umeda2020Structural).

The tertiary structure of CD9 reveals a reversed cone-like shape, which is significant for inducing membrane curvature and localizing the protein in areas with high membrane curvature (Umeda2020Structural). The EC2 domain of CD9, which includes the LEL, has a fold with five helical regions (A-E), where A, B, and E form a 'stalk' domain and C and D form a 'head' domain (Oosterheert2020Implications).

In terms of quaternary structure, CD9 can form homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes. It interacts with partner proteins like EWI-2 and EWI-F through its transmembrane helices, particularly h3 and h4, forming hetero-tetrameric structures (Oosterheert2020Implications; Umeda2020Structural). These interactions are crucial for the formation of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains in the plasma membrane (Oosterheert2020Implications). CD9 is also involved in exosome production and vesicular cargo sorting, facilitated by its ability to induce membrane curvature (Umeda2020Structural).

## Function
The CD9 protein, a member of the tetraspanin family, is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. It plays a crucial role in the immune system by regulating leukocyte migration across the endothelial cell layer, which is essential for immune surveillance and response to inflammation. CD9 organizes adhesive molecules like ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 into endothelial adhesive platforms, facilitating firm leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, a critical step in the leukocyte extravasation cascade (Reyes2018Tetraspanin).

CD9 is expressed on a wide range of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, including B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells. It is involved in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, particularly in the bone marrow, and is essential for sperm-egg fusion, as it organizes multiprotein complexes necessary for fertilization (Brosseau2018CD9).

In T cells, CD9 provides a co-stimulatory signal, enhancing T cell activation and signaling. It is associated with several T cell surface proteins and plays a role in T cell activation pathways (Brosseau2018CD9). CD9 also influences platelet aggregation and granule release, and in macrophages, it is involved in phagocytosis and inflammatory responses (Brosseau2018CD9).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the CD9 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), elevated CD9 expression is associated with favorable clinical outcomes, as it stabilizes vascular membranes and inhibits endothelial cell migration, serving as a predictor of overall and disease-free survival (P.C.2022Tetraspanin). Conversely, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, reduced CD9 expression correlates with lymph node metastasis and poorer prognosis (P.C.2022Tetraspanin). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CD9 is highly expressed in leukemia stem cells, contributing to drug resistance and leukemia progression (Liu2021CD9).

CD9 also plays a role in primary myelofibrosis (PMF), where its deregulation affects megakaryocyte maturation and stromal interactions, contributing to the disease's pathophysiology (Desterke2015Tetraspanin). In breast cancer, CD9 downregulation is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis, while high expression is associated with better outcomes (Ondruššek2023Prognostic). In colon and rectal adenocarcinoma, CD9 may function as a tumor suppressor gene, with its knockdown promoting cell proliferation (Ke2020Genetic). These findings highlight the complex role of CD9 in cancer, where its expression can either suppress or promote tumor progression depending on the context.

## Interactions
CD9, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It forms complexes with EWI-F and EWI-2 proteins, primarily through its transmembrane domain. The CD9-EWI-F complex is a hetero-tetrameric structure, with CD9 interacting with EWI-F through helices h3 and h4, while the extracellular Ig6 domains of EWI-F facilitate dimerization (Oosterheert2020Implications; Umeda2020Structural).

CD9 also interacts with the platelet glycoprotein complex GPIIb-IIIa, a major component of the platelet surface, through specific associations induced by monoclonal antibodies against CD9. This interaction is significant for platelet activation and is independent of traditional activation pathways (Slupsky1989Evidence).

In immune cells, CD9 is associated with integrins and other proteins, influencing processes like degranulation and phagocytosis. It interacts with integrin α5β1 and ADAM17, modulating cell adhesion and migration by altering the distribution and organization of these proteins on the cell surface (MachadoPineda2018CD9; Brosseau2018CD9).

CD9's interaction with ALCAM on leukocytic and tumor cells is mediated by its large extracellular loop, which is crucial for cell adhesion and signaling (Gilsanz2012ALCAMCD166). These interactions highlight CD9's role in regulating cellular communication and immune responses.
