# PPP2R2A

## Overview
The PPP2R2A gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit Balpha, a crucial component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme. PP2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and signal transduction. The regulatory subunit Balpha, encoded by PPP2R2A, is integral to the specificity and function of PP2A, influencing its interaction with target proteins and cellular localization. This protein is involved in critical pathways such as the DNA damage response and cell signaling cascades, including the MAPK and Hippo pathways, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (Verbinnen2021Protein; Kalev2012Loss). Alterations in PPP2R2A expression or function have been linked to various pathological conditions, notably cancer and metabolic disorders, underscoring its significance in human health (Beca2015Altered; Goldsworthy2016Haploinsufficiency).

## Function
PPP2R2A encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PPP2R2A plays a critical role in DNA repair, particularly in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, which is essential for repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. It modulates the phosphorylation state of proteins involved in the DNA damage response, ensuring proper DNA repair and cell-cycle regulation (Kalev2012Loss). PPP2R2A-containing complexes dephosphorylate ATM, a key protein in the DNA damage response, which is crucial for ATM's retention at DSB sites and the regulation of downstream effectors like CHK2 (Kalev2012Loss).

PPP2R2A also influences cell-cycle progression by affecting the G1-S checkpoint, which is linked to its role in DNA repair. The loss of PPP2R2A impairs HR repair and facilitates non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), another DNA repair pathway, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Kalev2012Loss). In the context of cell signaling, PPP2R2A is involved in the regulation of the MAPK cascade and Hippo signaling, which are important for neuronal differentiation and brain development (Verbinnen2021Protein). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cellular homeostasis and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPP2R2A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and metabolic disorders. In cancer, PPP2R2A acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation is associated with impaired DNA repair mechanisms, such as homologous recombination (HR). This downregulation is often observed in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and breast cancer, where it is linked to poor survival outcomes and increased tumor aggressiveness (Beca2015Altered; Kalev2012Loss). In breast cancer, low PPP2R2A expression, often due to deletions, correlates with higher tumor grade and worse disease-free and overall survival (Beca2015Altered).

In metabolic disorders, a splice-site mutation in PPP2R2A has been studied in a digenic mouse model of type 2 diabetes. This mutation, combined with insulin receptor haploinsufficiency, leads to insulin resistance and diabetes, characterized by hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance. The mutation results in reduced PPP2R2A protein levels, affecting insulin signaling pathways, particularly the dephosphorylation of AKT, a key protein in glucose metabolism (Goldsworthy2016Haploinsufficiency). These findings suggest that PPP2R2A plays a significant role in both cancer progression and metabolic regulation.

## Interactions
PPP2R2A, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms complexes with the catalytic and scaffolding subunits of PP2A, contributing to the holoenzyme's function in dephosphorylating target proteins. PPP2R2A interacts with AMOTL2, a protein that regulates the phosphorylation of JUN at Thr239 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. This interaction inhibits JUN dephosphorylation by preventing PPP2R2A from entering the nucleus, thereby suppressing cell proliferation (Cui2021AMOTL2).

In breast cancer, PPP2R2A is involved in the dephosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser317 and Ser345, which is crucial for cell cycle progression. It forms a complex with Chk1, affecting its stability and phosphorylation state. The interaction between PPP2R2A and Chk1 is modulated by valproic acid (VPA), which influences cell cycle progression through the PPP2R2A-Chk1 signaling axis (Su2023VPA).

PPP2R2A also plays a role in DNA repair mechanisms by interacting with ATM, a key protein in the homologous recombination repair pathway. It dephosphorylates ATM at specific sites, regulating its activity and influencing the expression of DNA repair proteins such as BRCA1 and RAD51 (Kalev2012Loss).
