# PRPF40B

## Overview
PRPF40B is a gene that encodes the protein pre-mRNA processing factor 40 homolog B, which plays a critical role in the regulation of alternative splicing. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor and is a component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex, essential for recognizing the 5' splice site during the early stages of pre-mRNA splicing (Lorenzini2019Human). PRPF40B is characterized by its structural domains, including two WW domains and five FF repeat motifs, which facilitate its interactions with other splicing factors and its localization to nuclear speckles (Becerra2015Prp40a). These interactions are crucial for modulating splice site selection, particularly in genes involved in apoptosis, such as Fas (Lorenzini2019Human). The gene's expression and mutations have been implicated in various diseases, including myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential role in disease pathogenesis (Becerra2015Prp40; Lorenzini2019Human).

## Structure
The PRPF40B protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, which include two WW domains in the amino-terminal half and five FF repeat motifs in the carboxyl-terminal half (Becerra2015Prp40a). These domains are crucial for its function in pre-mRNA splicing and localization within the cell. The WW domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, while the FF domains play a significant role in targeting the protein to nuclear speckles, which are compartments rich in splicing factors (Becerra2015Prp40a; Becerra2015Prp40).

The nuclear localization of PRPF40B is facilitated by a consensus nuclear localization signal (NLS) identified as KRRRR at amino acid residues 732-736 (Becerra2015Prp40a). The FF domains, particularly FF4, are essential for the protein's localization to nuclear speckles, and deletions in these domains can disrupt this localization (Becerra2015Prp40).

PRPF40B does not possess an RNA recognition motif (RRM) but regulates alternative splicing by bridging interactions between U1 snRNP and SF1 (Lorenzini2019Human). The protein is involved in modulating alternative splice site selection, particularly in apoptotic genes like Fas (Becerra2015Prp40a; Lorenzini2019Human). The protein's structure and function are further diversified by its splice variant isoforms, which result from alternative splicing events affecting the 5′ region of the mRNA (Tan2024Splicing).

## Function
PRPF40B is a splicing factor involved in the regulation of alternative splicing (AS) in human cells. It is part of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex, which is crucial for recognizing the 5' splice site early in the splicing process (Lorenzini2019Human). PRPF40B primarily acts as a repressor of exon inclusion, particularly affecting exons with A-rich downstream intronic motifs and weak splice sites (Lorenzini2019Human). Despite lacking an RNA recognition motif, PRPF40B influences AS by interacting with other splicing factors such as U1 and SF1, and it binds to SF1 through its WW domain (Lorenzini2019Human).

PRPF40B is localized to nuclear speckles, which are compartments enriched with pre-mRNA splicing factors, and this localization is mediated by its FF domains (Becerra2015Prp40a; Becerra2015Prp40). It interacts with SF1 and U2AF65, modulating the selection of alternative splice sites in apoptotic genes like Fas (Becerra2015Prp40a). The protein's role in splicing is significant in maintaining normal splicing patterns and repressing hypoxia-related gene expression, which is crucial for proper cellular function and prevention of leukemogenesis (Lorenzini2019Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PRPF40B gene have been implicated in several diseases, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and certain neurological disorders. In MDS, mutations in PRPF40B are often missense mutations that may lead to a loss of function, potentially contributing to the progression to myeloid leukemia (Becerra2015Prp40a). Although these mutations appear to have mild effects, they might act as 'passengers' rather than 'drivers' in MDS pathogenesis (Lorenzini2019Human).

In AML, PRPF40B expression is notably low, which correlates with the upregulation of hypoxia-related pathways, suggesting a role in leukemogenesis (Lorenzini2019Human; Lorenzini2024Global). The gene's downregulation is associated with increased expression of HIF1A, a major hypoxia regulator, potentially contributing to chemoresistance in AML (Lorenzini2024Global).

PRPF40B is also linked to neurological disorders such as Huntington's disease and Rett syndrome. In these conditions, mutations in PRPF40B, along with other spliceosome components, may disrupt normal splicing processes, affecting neuronal function (Becerra2015Prp40). The gene's involvement in alternative splicing of apoptotic genes like Fas further underscores its potential impact on cell survival and disease progression (Becerra2015Prp40a).

## Interactions
PRPF40B is a protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing and interacts with several key splicing factors. It associates with SF1 and U2AF65, which are crucial components in the early stages of spliceosome assembly. These interactions are both in vivo and in vitro, with PRPF40B binding to SF1 through its WW domain and having a weaker interaction with U2AF65, modulated by its FF domain (Becerra2015Prp40a; Lorenzini2019Human). The interaction with SF1 is particularly strong, as demonstrated by GST-binding assays, and is stable even under high salt conditions (Becerra2015Prp40a).

PRPF40B is enriched in nuclear speckles, where it colocalizes with splicing factors, and its localization is influenced by its FF domains and a nuclear localization signal (Becerra2015Prp40a). The FF4 domain is crucial for its speckle localization, while other FF domains contribute to nucleolar exclusion (Becerra2015Prp40a). PRPF40B's association with nuclear speckles is not primarily mediated by RNA interactions, as RNase treatment does not alter its localization (Becerra2015Prp40a).

PRPF40B also plays a role in modulating alternative splice site selection, particularly in apoptotic genes like Fas, by interacting with specific exonic and intronic sequences (Becerra2015Prp40a). These interactions highlight PRPF40B's significant role in the regulation of splicing and its potential implications in splicing-related disorders.
