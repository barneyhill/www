# CCDC122

## Overview
CCDC122, or coiled-coil domain containing 122, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil domain. This structural motif is often involved in facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC122 protein may play a role in various cellular processes. While the precise biological functions of the CCDC122 protein remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in several disease pathways, including those related to immune response and inflammation. Notably, genetic studies have linked CCDC122 to susceptibility to leprosy and Crohn's disease, highlighting its potential involvement in immune system regulation (Zhang2012Genomewide; Langlais2017Genetics). Additionally, its overexpression in prostate cancer tissues suggests a possible role in oncogenesis, although further research is required to clarify its function in cancer progression (Ongaba2023ENOX1).

## Clinical Significance
CCDC122 has been implicated in several diseases due to its genetic variations and altered expression levels. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified CCDC122 as a susceptibility gene for leprosy, a chronic infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium leprae*. This association was notably observed in the Chinese Han population, where CCDC122, along with other genes, was linked to leprosy susceptibility through its potential involvement in the NOD2-mediated signaling pathway (Jia2023Integrating; Zhang2012Genomewide). 

CCDC122 has also been associated with Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. Studies suggest that similar genetic pathways may be involved in both leprosy and Crohn's disease, indicating overlapping genetic risk factors (Langlais2017Genetics). 

In the context of prostate cancer, CCDC122 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to healthy prostate tissue. Although direct links between CCDC122 and prostate cancer are limited, its overexpression suggests a potential role in disease progression. Further research is needed to explore its differential expression and mutation during prostate cancer progression (Ongaba2023ENOX1). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCDC122 in various diseases, warranting further investigation into its role in disease mechanisms.
