# TMEM170B

## Overview
TMEM170B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 170B, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a critical pathway for cell differentiation, stem cell self-renewal, and cytoskeletal rearrangement (Li2018Transmembrane). TMEM170B functions as an endogenous inhibitor of this pathway, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining normal cellular functions and acting as a tumor suppressor in various cancers (Li2018Transmembrane). The protein is localized on the cell membrane and interacts with key components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, such as β-catenin, to modulate gene expression and cellular processes (Li2018Transmembrane). Additionally, TMEM170B is implicated in immune-related pathways and is associated with immune cell infiltration in certain cancer types, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhang2022Transmembrane).

## Structure


## Function
TMEM170B is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for cell differentiation, stem cell self-renewal, and cytoskeletal rearrangement, which are essential for normal cellular function and development (Li2018Transmembrane). TMEM170B is primarily localized on the cell membrane and acts as an endogenous inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by reducing the expression of Wnt target genes such as TCF4, CD44, c-myc, and cyclin D1 (Li2018Transmembrane). 

In healthy cells, TMEM170B is implicated in maintaining normal cellular functions by regulating this pathway, although its specific roles in non-cancerous cells are not fully elucidated (Li2018Transmembrane). TMEM170B is also part of the TMEM170 family, with its paralog TMEM170A involved in endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope morphogenesis, suggesting a potential role in membrane dynamics and structure (Li2018Transmembrane). The protein's activity in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane may influence ER stress responses and lipid metabolism, contributing to cellular homeostasis and potentially affecting broader physiological outcomes (Li2018Transmembrane).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM170B is implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. In breast cancer, TMEM170B inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression. Its expression is significantly downregulated in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and this downregulation is associated with poor overall survival. The gene is targeted by miR-27a, a microRNA that promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by downregulating TMEM170B (Li2018Transmembrane).

In PAAD, TMEM170B expression is also significantly reduced, correlating with poor prognosis, poor differentiation, and TP53 mutations. Low TMEM170B expression is linked to worse overall survival and disease-free survival, making it a potential prognostic biomarker. The gene's expression levels are associated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting its involvement in immune-related pathways (Zhang2022Transmembrane).

TMEM170B is also downregulated in other cancers, such as ovarian and thyroid cancer, indicating its broader role in tumor suppression across different cancer types (Herrera-Quiterio2023The).

## Interactions
TMEM170B is known to interact with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for TMEM170B's role as a tumor suppressor. TMEM170B overexpression leads to increased phosphorylation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, inhibiting its nuclear translocation and thereby reducing the expression of Wnt pathway target genes such as TCF4, CD44, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 (Li2018Transmembrane). This regulatory mechanism occurs independently of GSK-3β, as TMEM170B does not alter GSK-3β activity (Li2018Transmembrane).

TMEM170B is also a direct target of miR-27a, a microRNA that downregulates TMEM170B expression by targeting its 3′-UTR. This interaction has been validated through luciferase reporter assays and other experimental methods (Li2018Transmembrane). The miR-27a/TMEM170B axis plays a significant role in breast cancer progression, with miR-27a promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by downregulating TMEM170B (Li2018Transmembrane).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, TMEM170B expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, suggesting potential interactions with immune-related pathways, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Zhang2022Transmembrane).
