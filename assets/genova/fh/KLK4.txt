# KLK4

## Overview
KLK4, or kallikrein-related peptidase 4, is a gene that encodes a serine protease enzyme involved in various physiological processes, most notably in dental enamel formation and cancer progression. The protein product of KLK4, kallikrein-related peptidase 4, is categorized as a serine protease due to its enzymatic activity, which involves cleaving peptide bonds in proteins. This protease is crucial for the biomineralization of enamel during tooth development, where it processes enamel matrix proteins to facilitate proper enamel maturation (Clements2013The; Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). Beyond its role in dental health, KLK4 is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in prostate and ovarian cancers, where it influences tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance (Gong2019Characterization; Kryza2016The). The gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in both dental and oncological contexts (Kryza2016The; Lee2022Novel).

## Structure
KLK4 is a serine protease with a typical serine protease catalytic domain, lacking additional domains such as growth factor-like or kringle domains (Debela2008Structures). The primary structure of KLK4 includes a full-length isoform of 254 amino acids and an N-terminal truncated isoform of 205 amino acids (Lai2011KLK4). The full-length isoform contains a secretion signal peptide, an activation peptide, and a mature chain with one potential N-linked glycosylation site (Lai2011KLK4).

The secondary structure of KLK4 features a 3_10-helix between residues 55 and 59, two alpha-helices in segments 164-172 and 234-244, and another short 3_10-helix between residues 74 and 77 (Debela2008Structures). The tertiary structure includes an internal salt bridge crucial for zymogen activation and six disulfide bridges that stabilize the protein (Debela2008Structures). KLK4 shares structural features with other trypsin-like proteases, such as the presence of cis-Pro219 and Pro225, which prevent sodium binding (Debela2008Structures).

The truncated isoform of KLK4, which lacks the pre-pro-region and nine amino acids from the mature protein, is not glycosylated despite having a potential glycosylation site (Lai2011KLK4). This isoform is predominantly nuclear when labeled with GFP (Lai2011KLK4).

## Function
KLK4, or kallikrein-related peptidase 4, is a serine protease primarily involved in the process of enamel biomineralization during tooth development. It is active in ameloblasts, the cells responsible for enamel secretion, where it cleaves amelogenin and other enamel matrix proteins, which are essential for proper tooth formation (Clements2013The; Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). The absence of KLK4 activity leads to hypomaturation amelogenesis imperfecta, a condition affecting tooth enamel (Debela2008Structures).

KLK4 is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and activated extracellularly, exhibiting trypsin-like specificity with a preference for basic P1 residues (Debela2008Structures). It also plays a role in the activation of other kallikreins, suggesting its involvement in broader proteolytic cascades (Debela2008Structures). KLK4 can activate components of the thrombostasis axis, such as urokinase-type and tissue plasminogen activators, indicating its role in tissue remodeling and cellular processes like cell migration and proliferation (Sotiropoulou2009Functional; Clements2013The).

In addition to its role in dental health, KLK4 is implicated in the regulation of growth factors by hydrolyzing members of the matricellular CCN family, potentially affecting the bioavailability of factors like FGF-2 and TGFβ1 (Clements2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KLK4 gene have significant clinical implications. Mutations in KLK4 are linked to hypomaturation amelogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder affecting dental enamel. This condition is characterized by less mineralized enamel, leading to yellow to brown discoloration. Specifically, a homozygous missense mutation in the KLK4 gene, involving a thymine to cytosine substitution at cDNA position 637, results in an amino acid change from cysteine to arginine at position 213. This mutation disrupts a crucial disulfide bond, causing protein misfolding and loss of function, which impairs enamel formation (Lee2022Novel).

In cancer, KLK4 expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Elevated KLK4 mRNA levels are linked to reduced overall survival in ovarian cancer patients, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker. KLK4 is also implicated in drug resistance, particularly in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, where it contributes to paclitaxel resistance (Gong2019Characterization; Kryza2016The). In prostate cancer, KLK4 influences cancer cell proliferation and migration, potentially facilitating bone metastasis (Kryza2016The). These findings highlight KLK4's involvement in both dental and oncological conditions, underscoring its clinical significance.

## Interactions
Kallikrein-related peptidase 4 (KLK4) is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in prostate cancer progression and cellular signaling. KLK4 activates protease-activated receptors (PARs), specifically PAR-1 and PAR-2, initiating intracellular signaling pathways. It has a greater efficacy in signaling through PAR-2, which is associated with calcium mobilization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells (Ramsay2008Kallikreinrelated). KLK4 also interacts with matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), activating it in prostate cancer bone metastases, which promotes tumor growth and metastasis. This interaction is crucial for cancer cell migration and invasion (FuhrmanLuck2016Prostate).

KLK4 can cleave thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), a matricellular protein, into bioactive products that may influence angiogenesis, a key process in cancer progression (FuhrmanLuck2016Prostate). Additionally, KLK4's interaction with PAR1 has been explored through structural modeling and mutagenesis studies, aiming to design inhibitors that block this interaction. A catalytically inactive KLK4 mutant has been engineered to act as a decoy, capturing PAR1 and preventing its activation (Rabinovitch2021A). These interactions highlight KLK4's multifaceted role in modulating cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
