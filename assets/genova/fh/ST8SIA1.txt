# ST8SIA1

## Overview
ST8SIA1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 1, commonly referred to as GD3 synthase. This enzyme is a type II transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of gangliosides, specifically by catalyzing the conversion of GM3 to GD3. The enzyme is characterized by its presence in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates glycosylation processes essential for cellular communication and immune response regulation (Kasprowicz2022Role; HarduinLepers2012Sialyltransferases). ST8SIA1 is highly expressed during embryonic development and in the adult nervous system, and its dysregulation has been linked to various cancers, including breast and renal cell carcinomas, where it influences cancer cell signaling and progression (Hu2022Identifying; Kasprowicz2022Role). The gene's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target underscore its clinical significance in oncology (Wan2020ST8SIA1; Kan2020Comprehensive).

## Structure
The ST8SIA1 gene encodes the enzyme ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 1, which is involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides. This enzyme is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a large catalytic domain located within the Golgi lumen (Kasprowicz2022Role; HarduinLepers2023The). The catalytic domain includes conserved sialyl motifs essential for substrate binding and sialic acid transfer (Kasprowicz2022Role). 

ST8SIA1 is responsible for synthesizing GD3 by transferring a sialic acid residue in α2,8-linkage from CMP-sialic acid to GM3 (Kasprowicz2022Role). The enzyme's structure is less compact compared to other family members due to the presence of a single pair of disulfide bonds and the absence of anti-parallel β-sheets, which are common in other sialyltransferases (Huang2017The). 

The ST8SIA1 gene produces two protein isoforms, differing in their 5' ends, with the shorter isoform being preferentially expressed in vivo (Kasprowicz2022Role). The enzyme is highly expressed during embryonic development and in the adult nervous system, and its overexpression is linked to various cancers (Kasprowicz2022Role).

## Function
The ST8SIA1 gene encodes the enzyme GD3 synthase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides, specifically converting GM3 to GD3. This enzyme is a type II Golgi enzyme, characterized by a cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a large catalytic domain (Kasprowicz2022Role). In healthy human cells, ST8SIA1 is highly expressed during early embryonic development, where it plays a crucial role in cell differentiation and proliferation. In adult tissues, its expression is mainly found in the nervous system, contributing to normal developmental processes and nervous system function (Kasprowicz2022Role).

ST8SIA1 is involved in glycosylation processes, which are essential for the modification of proteins and lipids in cells. It is associated with the Golgi apparatus, where glycosylation typically occurs, and is linked to the molecular function of sialyltransferase activity, transferring sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids (Kan2020Comprehensive). This activity contributes to the formation of oligo- and polysialylated glycan chains, which are important for cell-to-cell communication and immune response regulation (Kan2020Comprehensive). The enzyme's function in synthesizing GD3 suggests its involvement in cellular processes related to ganglioside metabolism (HarduinLepers2012Sialyltransferases).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ST8SIA1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (KIRC), ST8SIA1 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor overall survival. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression, suggesting a role in modulating the immune response in the tumor microenvironment (Hu2022Identifying).

In breast cancer, high ST8SIA1 expression is linked to aggressive cancer phenotypes and poor patient outcomes, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). It is associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Kan2020Comprehensive). The gene's expression is also linked to the regulation of glycosylation processes, which are crucial in cancer progression (Kan2020Comprehensive).

In bladder cancer, ST8SIA1 expression is decreased in tumor tissues, and its overexpression inhibits cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by blocking the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This suggests a tumor-suppressive role in bladder cancer (Yu2021ST8SIA1).

## Interactions
ST8SIA1, also known as GD3 synthase, is involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides GD3 and GD2, which play significant roles in cancer cell signaling and progression. The protein encoded by ST8SIA1 interacts with several signaling pathways that are crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ST8SIA1 is associated with the FAK/Akt/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. Inhibition of ST8SIA1 leads to decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Akt, and mTOR, and increased phosphorylation of β-catenin, which destabilizes it, thereby reducing the expression of Wnt-targeted genes such as MYC, LEF1, and CYCLIN D (Wan2020ST8SIA1).

ST8SIA1 is also linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell properties, with its expression being regulated by transcription factors like NF-κB. Inhibitors such as triptolide have been shown to suppress ST8SIA1 expression by inhibiting NF-κB signaling, highlighting the interaction between NF-κB and ST8SIA1 as a key regulatory mechanism (Kwon2010Triptolide; Kasprowicz2022Role). These interactions suggest that ST8SIA1 plays a critical role in cancer progression and chemoresistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
