# ZNF114

## Overview
ZNF114 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 114, a member of the KRAB zinc-finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding, and a KRAB domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression. Zinc finger protein 114 plays a crucial role in gene regulation, particularly in maintaining the pluripotency of human pluripotent stem cells through its interaction with the transcriptional co-repressor TRIM28. This interaction is essential for the repression of pro-differentiation genes, thereby preserving stem cell identity. ZNF114's involvement in transcriptional regulation extends to its potential role in various cancers, where it may act as a transcription suppressor, influencing tumor progression and serving as a potential biomarker (Rydzanicz2013Genomics; Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28; Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF114 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in transcriptional regulation. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ZNF114 is suggested to function as a transcription suppressor, potentially influencing cancer progression through its DNA binding capabilities and KRAB domain-mediated transcription repression (Umeyama2014TINAGL1). Although specific mutations in ZNF114 have not been directly linked to NSCLC, its involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests a possible role in tumorigenesis.

In oligodendrogliomas, ZNF114 is located on chromosome 19q13.2 and has been identified as a gene with higher expression levels in WHO grade II oligodendrogliomas compared to anaplastic tumors. This suggests that downregulation of ZNF114 may be important for the malignant progression of these tumors (Tews2006Identification).

ZNF114 is also among the most upregulated genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), indicating its potential as a biomarker for this type of cancer. The upregulation of ZNF114 in ccRCC correlates with tumor behavior and patient outcomes, although specific mutations or expression alterations have not been detailed (Rydzanicz2013Genomics). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF114 in cancer pathology.

## Interactions
ZNF114 is a KRAB zinc-finger protein that interacts with TRIM28, a transcriptional co-repressor, in human pluripotent stem cells. This interaction is facilitated by the KRAB domain of ZNF114, which recruits TRIM28 to induce epigenetic changes through chromatin modification. ZNF114, along with other KRAB-ZNFs such as ZFP57, ZNF483, and ZNF589, physically interacts with TRIM28, as confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies. These interactions are crucial for the repression of pro-differentiation genes, maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).

The study also identified that ZNF114 binds to specific DNA motifs, suggesting its role in gene regulation. Genome-wide binding profiles showed that ZNF114 is enriched near transcription start sites and the 3' end of gene bodies, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).

In the context of TRIM28's acetylation, the interaction between ZNF114 and TRIM28 can be affected by posttranslational modifications. The acetylation-mimic mutation TRIM28-K304Q reduces its binding affinity with KRAB-ZNFs, including ZNF114, which can lead to changes in gene expression and cellular differentiation (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).
