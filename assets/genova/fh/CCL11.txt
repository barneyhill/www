# CCL11

## Overview
CCL11, also known as eotaxin-1, is a gene that encodes the protein C-C motif chemokine ligand 11, a member of the CC chemokine family. This chemokine is primarily involved in the immune system, where it plays a pivotal role in the recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation, particularly in allergic reactions and asthma (Stevenson2008CCL11). The protein is characterized by a canonical chemokine fold, consisting of three antiparallel β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix, which are stabilized by disulfide bonds (Millard2014Structural). CCL11 interacts predominantly with the CCR3 receptor, facilitating eosinophil chemotaxis and contributing to immune responses (Millard2014Structural). Beyond its role in inflammation, CCL11 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory bowel diseases and certain cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Polosukhina2021CCL11; Chen2024Exploring).

## Structure
CCL11, also known as eotaxin, is a chemokine with a canonical chemokine fold. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain with conserved cysteines forming disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its structure (Millard2014Structural). The secondary structure includes three antiparallel β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix, with a flexible N-terminal region (Dykstra2013Structural; Millard2014Structural). The tertiary structure is characterized by the packing of these β-strands against the α-helix, forming a stable hydrophobic core (Crump1998Solution).

CCL11 typically exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, with the monomer being the active form under physiological conditions (Crump1998Solution; Dykstra2013Structural). However, in the presence of glycosaminoglycans like Arixtra, CCL11 can form a tetrameric assembly, suggesting a role for glycosaminoglycans in modulating its oligomeric state (Dykstra2013Structural).

The N-terminal region of CCL11 is highly flexible and plays a critical role in receptor binding and activation, particularly with the CCR3 receptor (Millard2014Structural). This flexibility is a common feature among CC chemokines and is essential for their function in immune responses (Crump1998Solution).

## Function
CCL11, also known as eotaxin-1, is a chemokine that plays a significant role in the immune system by mediating the recruitment of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, to sites of inflammation. This recruitment is crucial in allergic reactions and asthma, where eosinophils accumulate in affected tissues, contributing to the inflammatory response (Stevenson2008CCL11).

In healthy human cells, CCL11 is involved in regulating the immune response by influencing the proportion and function of regulatory T cells (Treg cells). It increases the proportion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells through the STAT5 signaling pathway, which is important for maintaining immune tolerance and modulating immune responses (Wang2020CCL11). CCL11 also enhances the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β1) by CD4+ T cells, further contributing to its regulatory role in the immune system (Wang2020CCL11).

CCL11's activity is mediated through its interaction with the CCR3 receptor, which is expressed on eosinophils and other immune cells. This interaction is essential for the chemotactic migration of eosinophils, facilitating their movement to sites of inflammation and playing a role in the body's defense mechanisms (Stevenson2008CCL11).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL11 gene, also known as eotaxin-1, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) show increased CCL11 expression, which exacerbates colitis and inflammation-associated colon tumorigenesis. Studies in mice have demonstrated that the loss of CCL11 leads to decreased tumorigenesis and reduced tumor burden, suggesting its role in promoting a tumor-permissive microenvironment in the colon (Polosukhina2021CCL11).

In asthma, CCL11 is crucial for eosinophil recruitment to the lungs, contributing to allergic inflammation and tissue remodeling. It is associated with lung fibrosis and is upregulated in elderly individuals, linking it to aging processes (Lavandoski2023Eotaxin1CCL11; Fourtounis2012Gene). The NRF2/KEAP1 pathway regulates CCL11 expression, with NRF2 activation inhibiting its expression, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for conditions involving CCL11 dysregulation (Fourtounis2012Gene).

In breast cancer, elevated CCL11 expression is associated with better recurrence-free survival and is linked to immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. It may inhibit cancer cell proliferation and migration by blocking the AKT/S6 signaling pathway, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Chen2024Exploring).

## Interactions
CCL11, also known as eotaxin-1, primarily interacts with the CCR3 receptor, which is crucial for its role in eosinophil recruitment. The interaction involves the N-terminal region of CCR3, which includes sulfotyrosine residues that form hydrophobic, salt bridge, and cation-π interactions with conserved residues on CCL11. This binding significantly enhances the affinity of CCL11 for CCR3, influencing receptor activation and signaling pathways (Millard2014Structural).

CCL11 also interacts with other chemokine receptors, such as CCR2b, albeit with lower affinity. It acts as a partial agonist for CCR2b, capable of inducing chemotaxis at high concentrations and inhibiting MCP-1-induced chemotaxis at lower concentrations. This interaction highlights CCL11's ability to modulate signaling pathways through multiple receptors (Martinelli2001The).

In addition to receptor interactions, CCL11 can form tetramers, which may represent a biologically active form. The presence of glycosaminoglycans like Arixtra can influence the oligomeric state of CCL11, promoting dimerization and tetramerization, which may stabilize its binding sites and affect signaling (Dykstra2013Structural).
