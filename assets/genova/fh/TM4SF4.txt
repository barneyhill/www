# TM4SF4

## Overview
TM4SF4, or transmembrane 4 L six family member 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tetraspanin superfamily, characterized by its four transmembrane domains. The TM4SF4 protein plays a crucial role in cellular processes by forming tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins such as integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases. These interactions are essential for various biological functions, including cell adhesion, signal transduction, and cellular motility (Wong2024Multiomics). TM4SF4 is notably involved in oncogenic processes, with its overexpression linked to several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer, where it contributes to tumor growth, metastasis, and poor prognosis (Rahim2023Three; Rahimenyakin2023Three). The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in cancer research (Rahim2023Three).

## Structure
TM4SF4, also known as transmembrane 4 L six family member 4, is a protein that belongs to the tetraspanin superfamily. It is characterized by having four transmembrane domains, which are hydrophobic in nature, and two extracellular loops. The protein also features short intracellular amino and carboxy tails and a small intracellular loop (Wong2024Multiomics; Rahim2023Three). 

The molecular structure of TM4SF4 includes two extracellular regions located at amino acids 31-45 and 113-158, and four transmembrane regions at amino acids 10-30, 46-66, 90-112, and 159-179. Additionally, it has three intracellular regions at amino acids 1-9 (Wong2024Multiomics). Unlike other members of its family, TM4SF4 lacks the characteristic cysteine residue motifs in the EC2 extracellular domain (Rahim2023Three).

TM4SF4 is involved in forming tetraspanin-enriched microdomains by associating with other proteins such as integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases, which facilitates diverse biological functions including cell adhesion and signal transduction (Wong2024Multiomics). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common among tetraspanins.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The TM4SF4 gene is implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and lung cancer. In HCC, TM4SF4 is overexpressed, promoting cell proliferation and tumor growth, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis (Tang2024Integrated; Rahimenyakin2023Three). In CRC, TM4SF4 is linked to metastasis and poor outcomes, with high expression levels correlating with advanced disease stages (Rahim2023Three). 

In lung cancer, TM4SF4 is associated with increased cell proliferation and metastasis, and its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis (Rahim2023Three). TM4SF4 is also implicated in chemoresistance, particularly in ovarian cancer, where it is associated with resistance to chemotherapy (Rahim2023Three). 

In addition to cancer, TM4SF4 is involved in other diseases. It is implicated in various cellular processes, including migration and invasion, and its dysregulation can contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Rahim2023Three). The gene's role in these processes makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions, and its expression levels are often used as a prognostic marker in cancer (Rahim2023Three).

## Interactions
TM4SF4, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms tetraspanin-enriched microdomains by associating with other proteins such as integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases. These interactions facilitate biological functions like cell adhesion, motility, invasion, and signal transduction (Wong2024Multiomics). In lung adenocarcinoma, TM4SF4 overexpression activates pathways involving PI3K, AKT, NF-κB, PTEN, and IGF1R, enhancing growth, migration, and invasion. It also increases osteopontin (OPN) secretion, which activates CD44 or integrin signaling, maintaining epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated cancer stem cell properties via the FAK/STAT3 signaling pathway (Rahim2023Three).

In colorectal cancer, TM4SF4 interacts with signaling pathways like TGFβ/Snail and TNFα/NFκB, contributing to EMT, migration, invasion, and cancer stem cell maintenance (Wong2024Multiomics). TM4SF4 also interacts with mitochondrial components and oxidative phosphorylation gene ontologies in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, suggesting a role in energy production processes (Wong2024Multiomics). These interactions highlight TM4SF4's potential as a therapeutic target across multiple solid tumors due to its involvement in oncogenic processes and cancer progression.
