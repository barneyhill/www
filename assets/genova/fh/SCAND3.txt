# SCAND3

## Overview
SCAND3 is a gene that encodes the SCAN domain containing 3 protein, also known as ZNF452, which is a member of the SCAN family of proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of a SCAN domain at its N-terminus, a motif known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and playing a role in transcriptional regulation. Additionally, SCAND3 contains an integrase/transposase domain and a TPase-derived hATd dimerization module, suggesting its involvement in DNA binding and modification processes. These structural features indicate that SCAND3 may have evolved through transposon domestication, contributing to its unique functional properties. While the precise biological roles of SCAND3 in human cells are not fully elucidated, it is believed to be active in the nucleus, influencing processes related to cell survival, metabolism, and differentiation (Llorens2012On; Collins2005The; Xu2020Hypermethylation).

## Structure
The SCAND3 protein, also known as ZNF452, is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its molecular structure. At the N-terminus, it features a SCAN zinc-finger domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and is structurally similar to retroviral gag capsid domains (Llorens2012On; Emerson2011Gypsy). This domain is approximately 80 amino acids long and has a leucine-rich, α-helical structure (Emerson2011Gypsy). The SCAN domain is implicated in transcriptional regulation, suggesting a role in gene expression (Llorens2012On).

The C-terminus of SCAND3 contains a TPase-derived hATd dimerization module, which is similar to the hobo-Activator-Tam3 (hAT) superfamily, indicating a potential role in dimerization (Llorens2012On). The integrase domain of SCAND3 is derived from the GINGER2 superfamily of cut-and-paste transposons, which are common in insects but absent in vertebrates (Llorens2012On).

SCAND3 also includes an internal coding exon derived from a retroviral integrase (INT) domain, reflecting its complex evolutionary history involving retrotransposon sequences (Emerson2011Gypsy). The presence of these domains suggests that SCAND3 has undergone transposon domestication, contributing to its unique structural and functional properties (Llorens2012On).

## Function
The SCAND3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the SCAN family, which is associated with transcriptional regulation. The SCAND3 protein contains a SCAN domain at the N-terminus, which is a protein interaction motif that facilitates the formation of protein complexes involved in modulating gene expression (Collins2005The). This domain is known to mediate self-association or selective association with other proteins, suggesting that SCAND3 may play a role in assembling regulatory protein networks (Collins2005The).

The SCAND3 protein also features an integrase/transposase domain, indicating a potential role in transcriptional regulation, as these domains are typically involved in DNA binding and modification processes (Llorens2012On). The presence of a TPase-derived hATd dimerization module at the C-terminus further supports its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Llorens2012On).

While the specific cellular roles and biological mechanisms of SCAND3 in healthy human cells are not fully understood, it is suggested that the SCAN domain is involved in cell survival, metabolism, and differentiation (Xu2020Hypermethylation). The SCAND3 protein is active in the nucleus, where it likely influences cellular processes related to differentiation and development.

## Clinical Significance
The SCAND3 gene has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. Over-expression of SCAND3 has been associated with poor prognosis in certain cancer subtypes. A study using the HOPES method identified SCAND3 as over-expressed in a subgroup of cancer patients with poor outcomes, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker. The study also found that SCAND3, among other genes, showed significant partition ability in survival analysis, indicating its association with poor prognosis (Xu2019Simultaneous).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DNA methylation studies have identified CpG sites near SCAND3 that are linked to recurrence risk. These sites were used to create a risk score for recurrence, highlighting SCAND3's potential role in HCC prognosis (Erstad2018Molecular).

SCAND3 has also been studied in the context of esophageal and lung cancers, where promoter methylation of SCAND3 was noted as a significant epigenetic event. This suggests its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker across various cancer types (Zhang2023Exposing).

In atopic dermatitis, SCAND3 has been associated with the condition in a single study, although its clinical significance in this context remains unclear (Martin2020Genetics).
