# EMC1

## Overview
EMC1 is a gene that encodes the ER membrane protein complex subunit 1, a critical component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC). This protein is integral to the biogenesis and homeostasis of membrane proteins, functioning as both an insertase and a chaperone. It facilitates the insertion and stabilization of transmembrane domains (TMDs) within the lipid bilayer, ensuring proper folding and assembly of multipass membrane proteins (Hegde2022The; Shurtleff2018The). Structurally, EMC1 is characterized by an eight-bladed β-propeller and a single transmembrane domain, contributing to the formation of a hydrophobic groove essential for protein interactions (Hegde2022The). Mutations in EMC1 are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal health (Chung2022De; Cabet2020Novel).

## Structure
The human EMC1 protein is a crucial component of the ER membrane protein complex (EMC), characterized by a distinctive eight-bladed β-propeller structure. This β-propeller is a conserved feature in both yeast and humans and is associated with a second eight-bladed β-propeller in a perpendicular orientation. However, in yeast, this second propeller is partially lost, retaining only about three and a half blades (Hegde2022The). The periphery of EMC1's β-propeller interacts with β-sandwich domains from the lumenal domains of EMC7 and EMC10, which are typically involved in protein interactions, although specific partners for EMC's lumenal domain have not been identified (Hegde2022The).

EMC1 is part of the stable subdomain of the EMC, which includes a nine-transmembrane domain (TMD) subdomain. It has a single TMD that associates with EMC3, contributing to a large horseshoe-shaped hydrophobic groove spanning the membrane. This groove is crossed by a peripheral amphipathic helix, known as the crossbar or horizontal helix, located on the lumenal end (Hegde2022The). The EMC1 subunit, along with EMC2, EMC3, EMC5, and EMC6, forms the core of the EMC, essential for maintaining the complex's integrity (Chitwood2019The).

## Function
EMC1 is a critical component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC), which plays a significant role in the biogenesis and homeostasis of membrane proteins. EMC1 is involved in the insertion and stabilization of transmembrane domains (TMDs) within the lipid bilayer, facilitating the proper folding and assembly of multipass membrane proteins (Hegde2022The; Shurtleff2018The). It acts as both an insertase and a chaperone, ensuring that TMDs are correctly positioned and stabilized until they can interact with their partners (Wu2023EMC).

EMC1 is part of a subcomplex that includes EMC3 and EMC6, forming a structural unit that assists in the translocation of polypeptides across the membrane (Hegde2022The). This subcomplex is crucial for the insertion of tail-anchored proteins and multipass membrane proteins, particularly those with destabilizing features such as charged residues (Hegde2022The; Shurtleff2018The).

In healthy human cells, EMC1 contributes to maintaining ER homeostasis by preventing premature degradation of nascent polypeptides and ensuring their proper folding and function (Shurtleff2018The). Its activity is essential for the normal expression and function of various membrane proteins, impacting cellular health and organismal development (Hegde2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EMC1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. De novo variants in EMC1 have been linked to severe childhood syndromes characterized by neurodevelopmental delay and cerebellar degeneration. These mutations, such as p.(His583Arg) and p.(Pro584Thr), are located in a critical region of the EMC1 protein and may disrupt its conformation or interactions, leading to loss-of-function effects (Chung2022De). In Drosophila models, both wild-type and mutant EMC1 overexpression is toxic, but the variants are less toxic compared to the wild-type, indicating a functional difference in vivo (Chung2022De).

Clinical presentations associated with EMC1 mutations include global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and visual impairment. For instance, a case study identified a ten-year-old boy with severe developmental delay and autism, linked to novel truncating and missense variants in EMC1 (Cabet2020Novel). Similarly, compound heterozygous variants in EMC1 were found in siblings with global developmental delay and severe hypotonia, highlighting the gene's role in neurological symptoms (Wang2023Novel).

EMC1 mutations have also been associated with cerebellar atrophy and scoliosis, as observed in individuals with both monoallelic and biallelic variants (Harel2016Monoallelic). These findings underscore the gene's significance in neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
EMC1, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC), plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of transmembrane proteins through its interactions with other EMC subunits. EMC1 forms part of a lipid-filled cavity that stabilizes various client proteins, with subunits such as EMC4, EMC5, and EMC6 lining this cavity (MillerVedam2020Structural). The lumenal domain of EMC1, along with EMC7 and EMC10, is essential for the biogenesis of multi-pass transmembrane proteins and interacts with lumenal chaperones. EMC1 acts as a scaffold for EMC7 and EMC10, facilitating protein-protein interactions (MillerVedam2020Structural).

Mutations in EMC1 can disrupt its interactions with other proteins, such as the transmembrane gate helix of hEMC4 and the binding of hEMC7, leading to conditions like cerebellar atrophy and psychomotor retardation (MillerVedam2020Structural). The absence of EMC7 results in the loss of EMC10 from the complex, indicating a coupling between these subunits (MillerVedam2020Structural). EMC1's structural role within the EMC involves a single transmembrane domain that associates with EMC3, and it features an amphipathic helix that interacts with the EMC3-EMC6 subcomplex (Hegde2022The).
