# TC2N

## Overview
The TC2N gene encodes the protein known as tandem C2 domains, nuclear (TC2N), which is a member of the carboxyl-terminal type (C-type) tandem C2 protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of tandem C2 domains, specifically C2A and C2B, which are involved in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding and play a crucial role in cellular signal transduction and protein-protein interactions (Hao2018TC2N; Li2021TC2N:). TC2N is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of fatty acid synthesis and tumor metastasis, particularly in breast cancer, where it functions as a tumor suppressor (Hao2024TC2N). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as PTEN and FASN, and its involvement in post-translational modifications like ubiquitination and neddylation, underscore its significance in cancer biology (Hao2024TC2N). TC2N's role in different cancers varies, acting as an oncogene in some contexts, such as lung and gastric cancers, while serving as a tumor suppressor in others, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Hao2018TC2N; Xu2021Overexpression).

## Structure
The TC2N protein is characterized by the presence of tandem C2 domains, specifically C2A and C2B, located at the C-terminal end of the protein. These domains are part of the carboxyl-terminal type (C-type) tandem C2 protein family and are involved in cellular signal transduction and protein-protein interactions (Hao2018TC2N; Li2021TC2N:). The C2 domains are known for their role in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of TC2N are not provided in the available context (Li2021TC2N:).

The C2B domain is crucial for the nuclear localization of TC2N, which is important for its function in inhibiting fatty acid synthesis and tumor metastasis in breast cancer (Hao2024TC2N). The protein interacts with other molecules such as PTEN and FASN, and its function involves blocking neddylated PTEN-mediated FASN stabilization (Hao2024TC2N). Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and neddylation, play a role in TC2N's function, particularly in the context of cancer suppression (Hao2024TC2N). However, specific splice variant isoforms or additional structural details are not mentioned in the context.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TC2N gene have been implicated in various cancers, demonstrating its clinical significance. In gastric cancer, high TC2N expression is associated with a poorer prognosis and lower 5-year overall survival rates. It acts as an independent prognostic predictor for poor survival, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene (Xu2021Overexpression).

In lung cancer, TC2N is identified as an oncogene that accelerates tumor progression by suppressing the p53 signaling pathway. High TC2N expression is linked to poor outcomes, as it inhibits p53 phosphorylation, crucial for tumor suppression, and contributes to chemoresistance. Knockdown of TC2N induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, reducing proliferation and tumorigenicity (Hao2018TC2N).

Conversely, in breast cancer, TC2N appears to act as a tumor suppressor. It inhibits the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which is vital for cell proliferation and survival, and is associated with better outcomes. High TC2N expression correlates with less advanced clinical stages and longer survival times, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Hao2019Identification).

## Interactions
The TC2N protein is involved in several significant interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cancer. In breast cancer cells, TC2N interacts with fatty acid synthase (FASN) and promotes its degradation by enhancing ubiquitination and tyrosine phosphorylation, a process facilitated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. This interaction is particularly notable under high glucose conditions, where TC2N competes with PTEN for binding to FASN, thereby strengthening the interaction between TRIM21 and FASN. The C2B domain of TC2N is crucial for this interaction, as its deletion reduces the interaction with FASN (Hao2024TC2N).

In lung cancer, TC2N interacts with the p53 protein, inhibiting its interaction with Cdk5, which affects p53 phosphorylation and function. TC2N overexpression increases the ubiquitination and degradation of Cdk5, thereby suppressing the p53 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Hao2018TC2N). TC2N also interacts with the NF-κB signaling pathway by promoting the degradation of IκB, leading to increased NF-κB activity and tumor metastasis (Hao2019Tac2N). These interactions highlight TC2N's role in regulating key signaling pathways in cancer.
