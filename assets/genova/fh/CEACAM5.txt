# CEACAM5

## Overview
CEACAM5, or carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5, is a gene that encodes a glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. The protein product, CEA cell adhesion molecule 5, is primarily involved in mediating cell-cell adhesion and communication, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue architecture and cellular signaling. It is expressed on the apical surface of various epithelial cells and participates in both homophilic and heterophilic interactions, which are essential for regulating cell growth and differentiation (Gebauer2014Carcinoembryonic; Blumenthal2007Expression). CEACAM5 is also implicated in immune modulation and has been extensively studied for its role in cancer progression, particularly as a tumor marker in colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers (Huskey2021CEACAM; Macia2020Molecular). Its involvement in these processes underscores its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions.

## Structure


## Function
CEACAM5, also known as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), is a glycoprotein primarily involved in cell adhesion processes. In healthy human cells, CEACAM5 is associated with the cell membrane and plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue architecture and cellular communication. It participates in both homophilic (CEA to CEA) and heterophilic (CEA binding to non-CEA molecules) interactions, functioning as an intercellular adhesion molecule (Blumenthal2007Expression; Zheng2011A). These interactions are essential for cell-cell contact and communication, contributing to the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (Singer2010Deregulation).

CEACAM5 is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules and is expressed on the apical surface of various epithelial cells (Gebauer2014Carcinoembryonic). It is involved in cell-cell contact through its N-terminal IgV-like domain, which is conserved among CEACAM family members (Zheng2011A). This protein also plays a role in immune modulation and cellular signaling pathways, contributing to the maintenance of normal cell growth patterns and preventing uncontrolled proliferation (Singer2010Deregulation). CEACAM5's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues.

## Clinical Significance
CEACAM5, also known as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), is a clinically significant tumor marker, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In CRC, aberrant expression of CEACAM5 has been linked to tumorigenesis and cancer development. Although no protein-truncating variants of CEACAM5 were associated with CRC risk, certain missense variants have been identified, suggesting a potential role in inherited cancer risk (Huskey2022An). In NSCLC, CEACAM5 is overexpressed in primary tumors and lymph nodes, and its expression has been paradoxically associated with better clinical outcomes, despite its known association with worse prognosis in other contexts (Macia2020Molecular).

In breast cancer, CEACAM5 is overexpressed and associated with enhanced tumor invasiveness and metastasis, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Huskey2021CEACAM). The CEACAM gene family, including CEACAM5, is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in cell adhesion, signaling, and immunity, which are critical in cancer development and metastasis (Huskey2021CEACAM). These findings underscore the importance of CEACAM5 in cancer diagnostics and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
CEACAM5, also known as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in immune modulation and cancer progression. CEACAM5 interacts with CD8α, a protein expressed on T cells, through its N domain. This interaction is glycosylation-dependent and leads to the activation of the CD8-associated kinase Lck, which is important for T cell signaling (Roda2014Characterizing). The binding affinity between CEACAM5 and CD8α is comparable to that of CD8α with MHC I, with an affinity constant of 2.20E-08 M (Roda2014Characterizing).

CEACAM5 also binds to CD1d through its B3 domain, facilitating antigen presentation and the activation of CD8+ suppressor T cells (Roda2014Characterizing). This interaction is unique to CEACAM5 among the CEACAM family members (Roda2014Characterizing).

In the context of cancer, CEACAM5 interacts with CEACAM1, which aids in immune evasion by cancer cells. This interaction is significant in preventing anoikis, a form of apoptosis, thereby promoting metastasis (Thomas2023CEACAMS). CEACAM5 also binds to the TGF-β type I receptor, inhibiting the tumor suppressive properties of TGF-β signaling (Thomas2023CEACAMS).
