# ZFP36L2

## Overview
ZFP36L2 is a gene that encodes the ZFP36 ring finger protein like 2, a member of the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its tandem zinc finger (TZF) domain, which is crucial for binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs, thereby regulating their stability and degradation. ZFP36L2 plays a significant role in post-transcriptional regulation, influencing processes such as inflammation, cell proliferation, and immune response modulation. It is particularly important in maintaining the function of regulatory T cells and ensuring cellular homeostasis by promoting mRNA decay (Makita2020RNA-Binding). The protein's activity is essential for the differentiation and function of Tregs, which are crucial for maintaining immunological self-tolerance and preventing autoimmune diseases (Makita2020RNA-Binding). Additionally, ZFP36L2 is involved in regulating mTORC1 activity through a p53-dependent pathway, highlighting its broader physiological impact (Kouzu2022ZFP36L2).

## Structure
The ZFP36L2 protein is a member of the tristetraprolin (TTP) family and features a tandem zinc finger (TZF) domain crucial for its function. This domain is characterized by a Cys-Cys-Cys-His (CCCH) motif, which is essential for binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) in mRNA. The molecular structure of the TZF domain is stabilized by zinc binding, involving cysteines and histidines, and is folded in the presence of zinc (Lai2019The). The NMR structure of ZFP36L2's TZF domain, with PDB code 1RGO, shows that aromatic side chains intercalate with RNA bases to stabilize binding (Lai2019The).

The protein's RNA binding surface is positively charged, facilitating interaction with the negatively charged RNA backbone phosphates. Zinc finger 1 (ZF1) and zinc finger 2 (ZF2) bind to different sub-sites of the AU-rich element (ARE) 9-mer (Lai2019The). Specific residues, such as R1, T4, E5, L6, K39, T42, E43, and L44, are conserved and crucial for forming binding pockets for RNA bases (Lai2019The). The protein's structure is maintained by hydrophobic clusters and specific sidechain interactions (Lai2019The).

Mutations in the zinc-coordinating cysteine residues can mimic a knockout phenotype, highlighting the critical role of the TZF domain in the protein's physiological activities (Lai2019The).

## Function
ZFP36L2 is a member of the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of RNA-binding proteins, which are involved in the regulation of mRNA stability by binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs, leading to their degradation. This process is crucial for controlling the expression of genes involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, and differentiation (Makita2020RNA-Binding). In healthy human cells, ZFP36L2 plays a significant role in modulating immune responses by affecting the function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). It downregulates the expression of Helios, a transcription factor encoded by the Ikzf2 gene, which is important for Treg function. This regulation is achieved through the destabilization of Ikzf2 mRNA, thereby influencing Helios levels and Treg activity (Makita2020RNA-Binding).

ZFP36L2 is also involved in maintaining cell quiescence, particularly in lymphocytes, by regulating the cell cycle and ensuring proper immune function and development (Galloway2016RNAbinding). It is active in the cytoplasm, where it binds to target mRNAs, promoting their degradation and thus maintaining cellular homeostasis (Makita2020RNA-Binding). The protein's activity is essential for the differentiation and function of Tregs, which are crucial for maintaining immunological self-tolerance and preventing autoimmune diseases (Makita2020RNA-Binding).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZFP36L2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), lower-grade glioma (LGG), and peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM). In PDAC, ZFP36L2 is overexpressed and associated with increased cancer cell aggressiveness, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. It is regulated by the antitumor microRNA miR-375, which is downregulated in PDAC, suggesting a role for ZFP36L2 as an oncogene in this cancer type (Yonemori2017ZFP36L2). In LGG, ZFP36L2 is also overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. Its expression is associated with hypomethylation and immune response modulation, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker and a predictor of immunotherapy response (Zhou2022High).

In PPCM, ZFP36L2 plays a crucial role in regulating mTORC1 activity through a p53-dependent pathway. Its downregulation leads to increased mTORC1 activity, contributing to cardiac dysfunction during pregnancy. This suggests that ZFP36L2 is essential for maintaining cardiac health during pregnancy, and its dysregulation can lead to PPCM (Kouzu2022ZFP36L2). Additionally, mutations in ZFP36L2, such as the I373fsX91 mutation, have been associated with acute leukemia, affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis pathways (Iwanaga2010Mutation).

## Interactions
ZFP36L2 is a protein that interacts with both nucleic acids and other proteins, playing a significant role in mRNA decay. It specifically binds to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, leading to their degradation. This interaction is facilitated by the zinc finger domain of ZFP36L2, which is crucial for binding to the ARE sequence UAUUUAU within the mRNA (Ball2017Impact; Redmon2022Sequence). The binding affinity is influenced by the RNA secondary structure, particularly the flexibility of hairpin loops containing the AREs (Ball2017Impact).

ZFP36L2 also interacts with proteins involved in mRNA decay pathways. It recruits decay factors such as the exosome, decapping enzymes, and CCR4 deadenylase to accelerate mRNA degradation (Redmon2022Sequence). Additionally, ZFP36L2 is involved in regulating mTORC1 activity through a p53-dependent pathway. It binds to and degrades Mdm2 mRNA, stabilizing p53 protein levels, which in turn affects the expression of REDD1 and SESN2, both involved in mTORC1 regulation (Kouzu2022ZFP36L2). These interactions highlight ZFP36L2's role in post-transcriptional regulation and its broader physiological impact.
