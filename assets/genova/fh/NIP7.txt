# NIP7

## Overview
NIP7 is a gene that encodes the nucleolar pre-rRNA processing protein NIP7, which plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. This protein is involved in the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) and the assembly of ribosomal subunits, particularly the 60S subunit. Structurally, the NIP7 protein is characterized by its two alpha-beta domains, including a conserved PUA domain that facilitates RNA interactions, specifically binding to polyuridine sequences (Coltri2007Structural). Functionally, NIP7 is essential for the maturation of 18S rRNA and the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit, with its downregulation leading to disruptions in ribosomal subunit balance and cell cycle progression (Morello2010The). NIP7 interacts with various proteins involved in ribosome synthesis, such as FTSJ3 and SBDS, highlighting its integral role in nucleolar processes and pre-rRNA processing (Hesling2007The; Morello2011The).

## Structure
The NIP7 protein is a conserved component involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the processing of 27S pre-rRNA and assembly of the 60S ribosome subunit. The protein is composed of two alpha-beta domains. The N-terminal domain consists of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by three α-helices and a 3_10 helix. The C-terminal domain corresponds to the conserved PUA domain, which is a mixed β-sheet domain composed of strands β8 to β12, one α-helix, and a 3_10 helix. This PUA domain is involved in RNA interactions, particularly binding to polyuridine sequences (Coltri2007Structural).

The PUA domain of NIP7 features a positively charged path formed by arginine and lysine residues, which facilitates RNA interaction. This differs from human and yeast counterparts, where the corresponding region is more hydrophobic (Coltri2007Structural). The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, maintaining a similar three-dimensional configuration despite low sequence similarity (Coltri2007Structural).

NIP7 can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions. The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially influencing its structural and functional properties.

## Function
The NIP7 protein is essential for accurate pre-rRNA processing in human cells, particularly in the maturation of 18S rRNA and the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. It is involved in the processing of pre-rRNA at specific sites, and its downregulation leads to an imbalance in the 40S/60S subunit ratio, decreased concentration of 34S pre-rRNA, and increased concentrations of 26S and 21S pre-rRNAs, indicating slower processing at site 2 (Morello2010The). NIP7 is a nuclear protein that co-sediments with complexes in the 40S-80S range, indicating its association with nucleolar pre-ribosomal particles (Morello2010The). It interacts with other proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, such as Nop132 and SBDS, and is found in complexes with the 40S subunit protein RPS19, which is essential for 40S subunit biosynthesis (Morello2010The).

NIP7 also plays a critical role in cell cycle progression, as its downregulation leads to reduced cell proliferation and accumulation in the G1 phase (Morello2010The). The protein's interaction with FTSJ3, another nucleolar protein, suggests a close functional relationship in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome synthesis (Morello2011The). NIP7 is primarily required for processing pre-rRNA intermediates leading to 18S rRNA and 40S subunit synthesis (Morello2010The).

## Interactions
NIP7 is a nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the synthesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. It interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids during this process. NIP7 forms a transient interaction with the human nucleolar protein FTSJ3, which is mediated by RNA. This interaction is crucial for pre-rRNA processing and ribosome synthesis, with FTSJ3 affecting early processing steps and NIP7 being required for late processing steps leading to 18S rRNA synthesis (Morello2011The). The interaction between NIP7 and FTSJ3 is RNA-dependent, as RNase treatment abolishes their coimmunoprecipitation (Morello2011The).

NIP7 also interacts with the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS) associated protein. This interaction is part of a ribonucleoprotein complex necessary for 60S subunit maturation in eukaryotes (Hesling2007The). NIP7 binds to pre-ribosome particles in the nucleolus and interacts with poly-U and poly-AU RNAs, with a higher affinity for poly-AU (Morello2010The). The PUA domain of NIP7 is responsible for its RNA-binding activity, and it shows a preference for polyuridine sequences (Coltri2007Structural). These interactions highlight NIP7's role in ribosome biogenesis and its involvement in pre-rRNA processing.
