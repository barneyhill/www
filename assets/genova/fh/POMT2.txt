# POMT2

## Overview
POMT2, or protein O-mannosyltransferase 2, is a gene that encodes an enzyme integral to the process of O-mannosylation, a specific type of glycosylation critical for the proper function and stability of various proteins. The POMT2 protein is a member of the PMT family and is characterized as a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. It forms a functional heterodimeric complex with POMT1, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This complex facilitates the transfer of mannose residues to serine or threonine residues on target proteins, a modification crucial for cellular processes such as adhesion, signaling, and extracellular matrix stability. POMT2 is predominantly expressed in the testis, but its activity is vital in multiple tissues, including muscle and brain, where it plays a significant role in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. Mutations in the POMT2 gene are linked to several muscular dystrophies, including Walker-Warburg syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Willer2002Characterization; Lommel2008POMT2; AkasakaManya2006Physical).

## Structure
The POMT2 protein is characterized by a seven-transmembrane helical structure with a large central hydrophilic domain, flanked by five amino-terminal and two carboxyl-terminal transmembrane spans, typical of the PMT family proteins (Willer2002Characterization). It is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, with a molecular weight of approximately 83 kDa, which reduces to 77 kDa upon removal of N-linked carbohydrate chains, indicating the presence of at least two N-glycosylation sites (Willer2002Characterization). The protein's hydrophobic nature contributes to the discrepancy between its detected and calculated molecular weights (Willer2002Characterization).

POMT2 forms a heterocomplex with POMT1, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (AkasakaManya2006Physical). The protein is involved in the initial step of O-mannosyl glycan synthesis, transferring a mannosyl residue from dolichyl phosphate mannose to serine/threonine residues of proteins (AkasakaManya2011Different). The human POMT2 gene produces two distinct mRNA species due to differential transcription initiation, resulting in a testis-specific isoform with an extended N-terminal region (Willer2002Characterization). The protein is predominantly expressed in the testis, with a sevenfold higher expression level compared to other tissues (Willer2002Characterization).

## Function
POMT2 (protein O-mannosyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the O-mannosylation process, a type of glycosylation where mannose residues are added to serine or threonine residues on proteins. This modification is essential for the proper folding and function of proteins, particularly in muscle, brain, and eye tissues (Lommel2008POMT2). POMT2, in conjunction with POMT1, forms a heterodimeric complex that catalyzes the transfer of mannose from dolichyl phosphate mannose to target proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (AkasakaManya2011Different; Manya2003Demonstration).

The POMT2-POMT1 complex is necessary for the biosynthesis of O-mannosyl glycans, which are crucial for cell adhesion, signaling, and the stability of the extracellular matrix (Lommel2008POMT2; AkasakaManya2006Physical). In healthy human cells, this complex is active in various tissues, including muscle and brain, although its expression is notably high in the testis (Lommel2008POMT2). The enzymatic activity of POMT2 is vital for the development and function of tissues affected by congenital muscular dystrophies, such as Walker-Warburg syndrome, due to its role in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (Lommel2008POMT2; AkasakaManya2006Physical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POMT2 gene are associated with a range of muscular dystrophies, primarily due to defects in the glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG). Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) is one of the most severe conditions linked to POMT2 mutations, characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy, brain malformations, and eye abnormalities, often leading to early death (van2005POMT2; Chen2021Phenotype). Muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) and congenital muscular dystrophy with intellectual disability (CMD-ID) are also associated with POMT2 mutations, presenting with varying degrees of brain and muscle involvement (Chen2021Phenotype).

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2N (LGMD2N) and type R14 (LGMDR14) are milder forms of muscular dystrophy linked to POMT2 mutations. These conditions are characterized by progressive muscle weakness, particularly affecting the shoulder and hip regions, with LGMD2N showing selective muscle involvement and LGMD2R14 displaying phenotypic variability (Yang2024Clinical; Østergaard2017Limb). The presence of missense mutations often results in milder phenotypes due to residual enzyme activity, while null mutations lead to more severe outcomes (Yang2024Clinical). The variability in clinical manifestations underscores the complexity of genotype-phenotype correlations in POMT2-related disorders (Yang2024Clinical).

## Interactions
POMT2 interacts physically with POMT1 to form a heteromeric complex essential for protein O-mannosyltransferase activity. This interaction is crucial for the enzymatic function, as neither POMT1 nor POMT2 exhibits activity when expressed alone. The coexpression and colocalization of POMT1 and POMT2 in the endoplasmic reticulum are necessary for their function, indicating that they must form a complex to catalyze the transfer of mannose to serine or threonine residues on target proteins (Manya2003Demonstration; AkasakaManya2006Physical).

Mutations in POMT1 can abolish enzymatic activity while still allowing complex formation with POMT2, suggesting that the physical interaction is maintained even when enzymatic function is compromised (AkasakaManya2006Physical). In Drosophila, the orthologs of POMT1 and POMT2 also interact genetically and function synergistically, further supporting the necessity of their interaction for enzymatic activity (Ichimiya2004The).

POMT2 has different isoforms, such as sPOMT2 and tPOMT2, with sPOMT2 forming complexes with POMT1 that are crucial for mannosyltransferase activity in tissues affected by Walker-Warburg syndrome. In contrast, tPOMT2, which is testis-specific, may have functions independent of mannosyltransferase activity (Lommel2008POMT2).
