# FDXACB1

## Overview
FDXACB1 is a gene that encodes the protein ferredoxin-fold anticodon binding domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its ferredoxin-fold structure, which is typically associated with electron transfer and binding activities. Although the precise biological functions of the FDXACB1-encoded protein are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in phenylalanyl-tRNA aminoacylation, a critical process in protein synthesis. The gene has garnered attention due to its potential role in cancer biology, particularly in colorectal and breast cancer, where it may influence microsatellite instability and cancer development pathways (Cui2018Bioinformatic; Chen2018Gene). Additionally, variations in FDXACB1 expression have been observed in relation to genetic ancestry, suggesting a complex interplay between genetic background and disease susceptibility (SerranoGómez2017Ancestry).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
FDXACB1 has been implicated in various cancer types, particularly colorectal and breast cancer. In colorectal cancer, FDXACB1 is considered a potential indicator for distinguishing between microsatellite stable and instable subtypes. Its expression profiles vary with different microsatellite statuses, suggesting a role in microsatellite instability (MSI). Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, it is speculated that FDXACB1 may interfere with DNA mismatch repair and involve the PD-1/PD-1L pathways, contributing to MSI (Chen2018Gene).

In breast cancer, FDXACB1 has been identified as a down-regulated gene in early-onset cases. Its role in breast cancer is not well understood, but it is involved in phenylalanyl-tRNA aminoacylation, which may influence cancer development. The study suggests that understanding the function of FDXACB1 could aid in screening drug candidates and prognostic factors for early-onset breast cancer (Cui2018Bioinformatic).

FDXACB1 has also been noted in the context of genetic ancestry and breast cancer subtypes. In Colombian women, FDXACB1 was identified as a gene with expression changes influenced by European ancestry, although specific disease associations were not detailed (SerranoGómez2017Ancestry). Further research is needed to elucidate the clinical significance of FDXACB1 in these contexts.
