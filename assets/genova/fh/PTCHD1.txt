# PTCHD1

## Overview
PTCHD1 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein patched domain containing 1, a member of the Patched domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by its structural homology to other family members, such as PTCH1 and NPC1, and is notable for its role in cholesterol transport and regulation within cells. PTCHD1 is a transmembrane protein with 12 transmembrane domains and a sterol-sensing domain, which facilitates its interaction with cholesterol (Hiltunen2023PTCHD1). Unlike PTCH1, PTCHD1 does not participate in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, indicating a distinct functional role (Hiltunen2023PTCHD1). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it is involved in synaptic function and the regulation of neuronal excitatory/inhibitory balance (Hiltunen2023PTCHD1; Tora2017Cellular). Mutations in the PTCHD1 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities, underscoring its clinical significance (Tora2017Cellular; Noor2010Disruption).

## Structure
The PTCHD1 protein is a member of the Patched domain-containing protein family and is characterized by its structural homology to other family members like PTCH1 and NPC1. It is an 888-amino acid protein with 12 transmembrane domains (TM) and includes a sterol sensing domain (SSD) composed of TM2-6 and a sterol sensing-like domain consisting of TM7-12 (Hiltunen2023PTCHD1). PTCHD1 also features two large extracellular domains (ECDs) located between TM1 and 2 and TM7 and 8 (Hiltunen2023PTCHD1).

The protein contains a C-terminal tail with a PDZ-binding motif (ITTV), which allows it to interact with postsynaptic scaffold proteins such as PSD95 and DLG3 (SAP102) (Halewa2021Novel). PTCHD1 is known to bind cholesterol, as demonstrated by docking analysis and cholesterol click-reaction assays, suggesting a role in cholesterol transport (Hiltunen2023PTCHD1).

PTCHD1 lacks the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) motifs found in other family members, indicating a distinct functional role (Hiltunen2023PTCHD1). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, which is crucial for its stability (Xie2022Nonsynonymous). Missense mutations in PTCHD1 can affect its stability and localization, impacting its function in neurodevelopmental disorders (Halewa2021Novel).

## Function
The PTCHD1 gene encodes a protein that is structurally similar to members of the Patched domain-containing family, such as PTCH1 and NPC1, which are involved in cholesterol transport. PTCHD1 contains a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) and can bind cholesterol, suggesting a role in cholesterol transport or regulation within cells (Hiltunen2023PTCHD1). Unlike PTCH1, PTCHD1 does not bind Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and does not modulate the Hedgehog signaling pathway, indicating a distinct cellular function (Hiltunen2023PTCHD1).

PTCHD1 is expressed throughout the brain and other tissues, with its expression profile changing during development. It is synaptically localized in neurons, where it may play a role in synaptic function and the regulation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain (Hiltunen2023PTCHD1; Tora2017Cellular). PTCHD1 has been linked to cellular stress responses and RNA stress granule formation, suggesting it may influence RNA-binding processes and stress granule assembly, which are important for neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration (Hiltunen2023PTCHD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTCHD1 gene are associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID), particularly in males. These mutations include microdeletions and missense mutations, which lead to a loss of PTCHD1 protein function and are linked to a range of phenotypic outcomes, such as intellectual disability, behavioral alterations, and ASD-like behaviors in over 40% of individuals with PTCHD1 mutations (Tora2017Cellular). Common phenotypes also include mild motor incoordination and ADHD-like behaviors (Tora2017Cellular).

The PTCHD1 gene is located on the X-chromosome, and its mutations are highly penetrant, affecting approximately 1.1% of individuals with ASD and 1.3% with ID (Noor2010Disruption). Specific missense mutations, such as p.(Ser51Asn) and p.(Lys181Thr), have been identified, which alter the subcellular localization of the PTCHD1 protein, affecting its stability and expression (Halewa2021Novel). These mutations can disrupt normal neuronal signaling pathways, potentially through impaired synaptic function and excitatory/inhibitory balance in the dentate gyrus (Tora2017Cellular).

Alterations in PTCHD1 expression, such as a 27-bp duplication in the promoter region, have been associated with ASD, potentially affecting transcription factor binding and gene expression (Torrico2015Contribution). These genetic variations highlight the clinical significance of PTCHD1 in neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
PTCHD1 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. This motif allows PTCHD1 to bind to postsynaptic density proteins such as DLG4 (PSD95) and SAP102, which are involved in synaptic transmission (Xie2022Nonsynonymous; Tora2017Cellular). The interaction with DLG4 is dependent on the PDZ-binding motif, while the binding to VPS35, a component of the retromer complex, is not (Tora2017Cellular; tora2018functional).

PTCHD1 also interacts with other components of the retromer complex, including Sorting-nexin 27 (SNX27) and VPS26B. These interactions suggest a role for PTCHD1 in membrane protein trafficking, particularly in postsynaptic compartments (Tora2017Cellular; tora2018functional). SNX27's interaction with PTCHD1 is dependent on the PDZ-binding motif (tora2018functional).

Additionally, PTCHD1 has been shown to interact with SNAPIN, a SNARE-associated protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. This interaction occurs through PTCHD1's first lumenal loop and is not disrupted by certain missense variants, although these variants may impair subcellular trafficking (Pastore2024Autismassociated).
