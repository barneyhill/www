# DAOA

## Overview
The DAOA gene, also known as G72, encodes the protein D-amino acid oxidase activator (pLG72), which is primarily involved in the regulation of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) activity. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in modulating enzyme activity. pLG72 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining D-serine levels, a coagonist of the NMDA receptor, thereby influencing synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Murtas2022Biochemical; Sacchi2011Evidence). The interaction between pLG72 and DAAO is significant in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, due to its impact on NMDA receptor function and oxidative stress (Jagannath2017Controversial). Despite its low expression levels, pLG72 has been investigated as a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease progression, although further research is needed to establish its clinical utility (Murtas2022Biochemical).

## Function
The DAOA gene, also known as G72, encodes the protein pLG72, which plays a significant role in modulating the activity of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) in healthy human cells. pLG72 binds to and inactivates DAAO, an enzyme responsible for the catabolism of D-serine, a coagonist of the NMDA receptor. This interaction helps maintain D-serine levels, which are crucial for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory by modulating NMDA receptor activity (Murtas2022Biochemical; Sacchi2011Evidence).

pLG72 is primarily active in the central nervous system, where it influences cognitive functions and neurodevelopment. By inactivating DAAO, pLG72 also protects cells from oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of the DAAO reaction (Murtas2022Biochemical). Additionally, pLG72 may affect mitochondrial functions, potentially altering mitochondrial morphology and increasing reactive oxygen species production, although its exact role in these processes is not fully understood (Murtas2022Biochemical).

Despite its low expression and challenging detection, pLG72's level in the blood has been hypothesized as a potential marker for Alzheimer's disease progression, although this is not yet well-established (Murtas2022Biochemical).

## Clinical Significance
The DAOA gene, also known as G72, has been implicated in the genetic susceptibility to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Mutations and alterations in the expression of DAOA can influence disease susceptibility through their impact on D-serine levels and NMDA receptor activation. Elevated levels of D-serine, a potent activator of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, have been observed in schizophrenic patients, suggesting a potential mechanism by which DAOA may influence these conditions (Bass2009Evidence). 

The DAOA gene interacts with the enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), modulating its activity and affecting D-serine metabolism. This interaction is significant because NMDA receptor dysfunction is associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders (Chang2013The). Genetic studies have shown allelic associations between certain SNPs in the DAOA gene and both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with specific markers like rs3918342 showing significant association with these conditions (Bass2009Evidence). 

Despite these associations, some studies have not found significant links between DAOA polymorphisms and the risk of psychiatric disorders, suggesting that these genetic variations may not have a strong clinical significance in all contexts (Tan2014Association).

## Interactions
The DAOA protein, also known as G72, is known for its interaction with D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), influencing its activity. This interaction is significant in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. DAOA has been shown to bind to DAO, and this interaction can either increase or decrease DAO activity depending on the cellular context. For instance, in HEK293 cells, DAOA increases DAO activity, while in other cell types like neuron-like SH-SY5Y and astrocyte-like 1321N1 cells, it does not have the same effect (Jagannath2017Controversial). 

The interaction between DAOA and DAO is complex, involving structural changes in the DAO enzyme. DAOA affects the flexibility and folding of DAO, particularly when DAO is in its holoenzyme form with FAD, suggesting that DAOA can inactivate the DAO holoenzyme by making it more flexible and misfolded (Jagannath2017Controversial). 

In addition to its interaction with DAO, DAOA is implicated in the modulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which is linked to the glutamatergic hypothesis of schizophrenia. However, studies have shown that DAOA does not directly affect NMDA receptor activity in certain cell models (Jagannath2017Controversial).
