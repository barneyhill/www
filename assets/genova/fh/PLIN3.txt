# PLIN3

## Overview
PLIN3, or perilipin 3, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the PAT family of proteins. This protein is primarily associated with lipid droplets, which are cellular organelles involved in lipid storage and energy homeostasis. As a lipid droplet-associated protein, perilipin 3 plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, including the regulation of lipid droplet dynamics and interactions with other proteins involved in lipid breakdown and synthesis. The protein's structure includes a conserved PAT domain, which is essential for its membrane-binding capabilities, and it undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation that influence its function. PLIN3 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including energy balance, inflammatory responses, and diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders (Khaddaj2023Perilipin; Rowe2016Conserved; Zhu2018Phosphorylation).

## Structure
PLIN3, also known as perilipin 3, is a protein associated with lipid droplets and is part of the PAT family. The primary structure of PLIN3 includes an N-terminal PAT domain, a central region composed of seven-fold 11-mer repeats, and a C-terminal 4-helix bundle domain (Khaddaj2023Perilipin; Rowe2016Conserved). The PAT domain is highly conserved and is crucial for membrane binding, particularly to diacylglycerol (DAG)-enriched membranes (Choi2023Structural). This domain undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon membrane binding, forming a folded but dynamic structure (Choi2023Structural).

The secondary structure of PLIN3 involves the formation of amphipathic alpha helices in the 11-mer repeat regions, which are initially unstructured but stabilize in a helix-promoting environment (Rowe2016Conserved). These helices are essential for lipid droplet targeting and membrane association (Rowe2016Conserved).

The tertiary structure of the PAT domain is predicted to adopt a triangular alpha-helical configuration, which is supported by experimental data (Choi2023Structural). The C-terminal 4-helix bundle domain contributes to membrane targeting and is more stable in PLIN3 compared to other perilipins (Rowe2016Conserved).

PLIN3 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interaction with lipid droplets. These structural features and modifications are critical for PLIN3's role in lipid metabolism and its association with lipid droplets.

## Function
PLIN3, or perilipin 3, is a protein that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism within human cells. It is primarily associated with lipid droplets (LDs), which are essential organelles for lipid storage and energy homeostasis. PLIN3 is involved in the regulation of lipid droplet dynamics, particularly under conditions of energy stress such as glucose starvation. During such conditions, PLIN3 is phosphorylated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) at specific residues, S31 and T216, which promotes the dispersion of lipid droplets throughout the cytoplasm. This process is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis and preventing lipid accumulation in cells (Zhu2018Phosphorylation).

In addition to its role in lipid droplet dynamics, PLIN3 is involved in the formation of lipid droplets and the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. This function is particularly relevant in the context of inflammatory responses, where PLIN3-associated lipid droplets are induced by stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides (Nose2013Crucial). PLIN3's activity in these processes underscores its importance in cellular lipid metabolism and energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
PLIN3 (perilipin 3) is implicated in various cancers and metabolic diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In prostate cancer, PLIN3 protects cells from apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress. Its knockdown decreases intratumoral androgen synthesis and restores sensitivity to androgen deprivation therapy in enzalutamide-resistant cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (Luo2022Adding; Zhou2021ACSS3). In colorectal and lung cancers, PLIN3 expression correlates with tumor size, grade, and stage, while in cervical cancer, elevated PLIN3 levels are linked to invasive tumors and recurrence (Luo2022Adding).

In gliomas, PLIN3 expression is associated with tumor grade and recurrence, with higher levels indicating poorer prognosis in low-grade glioma patients (Li2023Integrative). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, PLIN3 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and is linked to higher tumor stage and grade (Wang2018PLIN3).

PLIN3 also plays a role in metabolic diseases. It is involved in the pathophysiology of hepatic steatosis and regulates Hepatitis C Virus RNA replication, affecting viral release (Zhang2018Roles). In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, PLIN3 is associated with lipid accumulation (Xu2018Lipid). These findings highlight PLIN3's significance in both cancer progression and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
PLIN3, also known as perilipin 3, is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in lipid metabolism. In skeletal muscle, PLIN3 interacts with adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), which are crucial for the regulation of intramuscular triglyceride breakdown during exercise. These interactions are maintained both at rest and following lipolytic stimulation, suggesting a role in lipid droplet dynamics and triglyceride synthesis rather than in stimulated lipolysis (MacPherson2013Skeletala).

PLIN3 also interacts with CGI-58, a co-activator of ATGL, in skeletal muscle, indicating its involvement in the regulation of lipolysis (MacPherson2013Skeletal). In the context of alcoholic liver disease, PLIN3 interacts with the dynein subunit Dync1i1, facilitating the colocalization of lipid droplets with microtubules, which is essential for lipid export from the endoplasmic reticulum (Gu2019Plin3).

PLIN3's interactions with microtubules are disrupted by high ethanol concentrations, leading to changes in lipid droplet size and distribution, which highlights its role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis (Gu2019Plin3). These interactions underscore PLIN3's multifaceted role in lipid metabolism across different tissues.
