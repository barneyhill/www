# SPIN1

## Overview
SPIN1 is a gene that encodes the spindlin 1 protein, a member of the histone reader family characterized by its Tudor-like domains. The spindlin 1 protein plays a critical role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation by recognizing specific histone methylation marks, such as H3K4me3 and H3R8me2a. These interactions facilitate its function as a transcriptional co-activator, influencing various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell cycle regulation. Spindlin 1 is involved in several signaling pathways, such as Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt, and is implicated in cancer progression due to its ability to modulate key pathways and gene expression. The overexpression of SPIN1 is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Fang2018SPIN1; Li2021Histone; Su2014Molecular).

## Structure
The SPIN1 protein, encoded by the human SPIN1 gene, is characterized by its unique molecular structure, which includes three Tudor-like Spin/Ssty repeats. These repeats form a triangular architecture, with each domain adopting a Tudor-like β-barrel fold. This structural organization is distinct from other histone readers, such as L3MBTL1, which have different repeat orientations (Su2014Molecular). The SPIN1 protein features two aromatic pockets within its tandem Spin/Ssty repeats, which are crucial for recognizing specific histone methylation patterns, particularly H3K4me3 and H3R8me2a. The K4me3 pocket is formed by residues in repeat 2, while the R8me2a pocket involves residues from repeats 1 and 3 (Su2014Molecular).

SPIN1's structure is further defined by its ability to bind methylated histones, facilitated by a negatively charged H3-binding surface that interacts with the basic histone H3 tail (Su2014Molecular). The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by cation-π and methyl-π interactions, which are essential for its function as a histone reader (Su2014Molecular). The SPIN1 protein also interacts with other proteins, such as SPINDOC, through its Tudor domains, which can modulate its transcriptional co-activator activities (Zhao2021Molecular).

## Function
The SPIN1 gene encodes the spindlin1 protein, which functions as a histone methylation reader involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In healthy human cells, SPIN1 plays a crucial role in interpreting specific histone methylation patterns, such as trimethylated lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and asymmetrically dimethylated arginine 8 (H3R8me2a) on histone H3. This recognition is facilitated by its three Tudor-like domains, which allow SPIN1 to bind to these methylation marks and influence transcriptional activation (Fagan2019A; Su2014Molecular).

SPIN1 is involved in the activation of several signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt, and GDNF-RET-MAZ pathways, which are essential for various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell cycle regulation (Fagan2019A; Li2021Histone). It acts as a transcriptional co-activator, accumulating at promoter regions to promote gene transcription (Li2021Histone). SPIN1 is active in the nucleus, where it maintains spindle stability and chromosome segregation during cell division, contributing to normal cell cycle progression and cellular function (Zhao2021Molecular; Li2021Histone).

## Clinical Significance
SPIN1 (spindlin 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in modulating key signaling pathways and gene expression. Overexpression of SPIN1 is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapies in cancers such as breast, colorectal, gastric, and liver cancer (Fang2018SPIN1; Li2021Histone). In breast cancer, SPIN1 is linked to chemoresistance, particularly in triple-negative and Adriamycin-resistant cell lines, correlating with poor survival outcomes (Chen2018SPIN1). 

SPIN1 promotes tumorigenesis by interacting with the uL18-MDM2-p53 pathway, leading to p53 inactivation, which is crucial for tumor suppression (Fang2018SPIN1). Its overexpression results in p53 degradation, facilitating cancer cell proliferation and survival (Fang2018SPIN1). SPIN1 also enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling, contributing to cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis (Su2014Molecular).

In liver cancer, SPIN1 affects lipid metabolism by co-activating SREBP1c, increasing triglycerides and cholesterol, which supports tumor growth (Zhao2020SPIN1). These findings suggest that SPIN1 is a potential target for cancer therapy, as its knockdown can inhibit tumorigenesis and restore p53 function (Fang2018SPIN1; Li2021Histone).

## Interactions
SPIN1 (spindlin 1) is a protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. SPIN1 is known to bind to methylated histones, specifically recognizing trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) and asymmetrically dimethylated arginine on histone H3 (H3R8me2a) through its Tudor domains. This binding is crucial for its role in gene expression regulation and is implicated in cancer progression (Li2021Histone; Su2014Molecular).

SPIN1 interacts with WDR76, forming a complex that is mobile within the nucleus. This interaction is confirmed through imaging techniques and suggests that the complex may bind to histones, as histone H3 is enriched in both SPIN1 and WDR76 purifications (Liu2023Serial). SPIN1 also interacts with SPINDOC, which modulates its transcriptional coactivator activity by engaging with its Tudor domains, thereby inhibiting SPIN1's ability to bind to histones or other ligands (Zhao2021Molecular).

SPIN1 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway by interacting with TCF4, promoting the transcription of Wnt target genes. This interaction is essential for the activation of Wnt signaling, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation (Su2014Molecular).
