# PLD3

## Overview
Phospholipase D3 (PLD3) is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein, which is part of the phospholipase D family. The protein, also referred to as PLD3, is primarily localized in lysosomes and plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis, particularly within neuronal cells. It functions as a 5'-3' exonuclease, targeting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and influencing nucleotide turnover within lysosomes. This activity is crucial for preventing lysosomal leakage and the subsequent activation of inflammatory pathways. PLD3 is also involved in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, with its dysfunction linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Mutations in the PLD3 gene, such as the V232M variant, have been associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Van2023Phospholipase; Demirev2019V232M; Cruchaga2013Rare).

## Structure
PLD3 is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by an N-terminal cytosolic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a luminal domain. The luminal domain of mouse PLD3 (mPLD3), which shares 94% amino-acid sequence identity with human PLD3, has been structurally analyzed. The crystal structure reveals that PLD3 consists of two structurally similar domains, A and B, related by a pseudo-2-fold symmetry axis. Each domain comprises approximately 200 amino acids forming a seven- or eight-stranded β-sheet flanked by seven helices. These domains create an extensive interface crucial for the enzyme's catalytic function (Yuan2023Structural).

The active site of PLD3 is located at the dimer interface, where a pair of histidines and lysines form a basic pocket to accommodate the phosphate group of nucleic acid substrates. The HxK(x)4D/E consensus sequence is present in both domains, with specific residues forming the active site and stabilizing the protein conformation (Yuan2023Structural). PLD3 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which is linked to its enzymatic activity (Yuan2023Structural). The protein's structure and function are influenced by disease-associated mutations, which can impact its stability and activity (Yuan2023Structural).

## Function
Phospholipase D3 (PLD3) is a lysosomal protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in neurons. It functions as a 5'-3' exonuclease, primarily targeting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) within lysosomes. This activity is essential for regulating lysosomal nucleotide turnover and preventing the accumulation of mtDNA, which can lead to lysosomal leakage and activation of inflammatory pathways such as cGAS-STING signaling (Van2023Phospholipase). PLD3 is also involved in mitophagy, the process of degrading damaged mitochondria, thereby maintaining mitochondrial health and function (Van2023Phospholipase).

In healthy cells, PLD3 helps regulate the turnover of proteins and lipids within endosomal and lysosomal compartments, which is critical for cellular homeostasis. It influences amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, with its dysfunction linked to increased amyloid-β levels, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (Van2023Phospholipase). PLD3 also regulates lysosomal biogenesis through the degradation of TFEB/TFE3 proteins, preventing excessive nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of these factors, which is vital for maintaining normal lysosomal size and function (Wang2024Phospholipase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PLD3 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD). The V232M variant in PLD3 is associated with an increased risk of AD, with carriers exhibiting extensive amyloid plaque and tangle pathology, which are characteristic of the disease (Cruchaga2013Rare). This variant is linked to a lower age at onset of AD and is independent of the APOE genotype, another known risk factor for AD (Cruchaga2013Rare). The V232M substitution affects PLD3's neuroprotective function by impairing glycosylation, leading to altered lysosomal structures and functions, which are crucial in neuronal health (Demirev2019V232M).

PLD3 is also involved in the endosomal-lysosomal system, and its impairment could contribute to AD development. Epigenetic changes, such as increased DNA methylation in the PLD3 gene, have been observed in the hippocampus of AD patients, correlating with downregulated PLD3 expression and increased β-amyloid burden (Blanco-Luquin2018PLD3). Additionally, rare variants like p.I163M and p.R356H have been associated with increased risk of late-onset AD, potentially affecting amyloid-β levels through an autophagy-dependent mTOR signaling pathway (Tan2019PLD3). These findings suggest that PLD3 may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.

## Interactions
PLD3 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in various cellular processes. It has been shown to co-localize with amyloid precursor protein (APP) in endosomes, suggesting a potential interaction or functional relationship between PLD3 and APP (Mukadam2018Analysis). PLD3 also interacts with sortilin-like 1 (SorL1), a protein that associates with APP to regulate its localization and processing. Knockdown of PLD3 results in a marked reduction in the association of SorL1 with APP, indicating that PLD3 is crucial for this interaction (Mukadam2018Analysis).

PLD3 has been identified as a lysosomal exonuclease, interacting with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and influencing nucleotide signaling pathways. Its dysfunction is linked to increased TLR9 levels and activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, which is associated with lysosomal leakage of mtDNA (Van2023Phospholipase).

Additionally, PLD3 interacts with progranulin (PGRN), as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is observed in cytoplasmic granular structures, although PLD3 does not directly regulate PGRN expression levels (Satoh2014PLD3). These interactions highlight PLD3's involvement in endosomal protein sorting, APP processing, and Alzheimer's disease pathology.
