# SERPINE3

## Overview
SERPINE3 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family E member 3, a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of protease activity in the extracellular space, playing a significant role in processes such as extracellular matrix remodeling, cellular migration, and tissue homeostasis. The SERPINE3 protein is characterized by its typical serpin structure, which includes a central β-sheet and surrounding α-helices, allowing for the necessary conformational changes to inhibit proteases effectively (Indrischek2022Visionrelated). It is expressed in various tissues, including the retinal pigment epithelium and neural tissues, suggesting its involvement in eye health and neural function (Badola2006Correlation; Indrischek2022Visionrelated). The gene's expression is also associated with certain pathological conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration and various cancers, indicating its potential clinical significance (Liu2024Pancancer; Indrischek2022Visionrelated).

## Structure
The SERPINE3 protein is a member of the serpin family, characterized by its role as a serine protease inhibitor. It is secreted into the extracellular space, facilitated by an N-terminal signal peptide that directs its secretion (Indrischek2022Visionrelated). The protein structure of SERPINE3 includes features typical of inhibitory serpins, such as conserved substrate-determining residues and a hinge region, which are crucial for its inhibitory function (Indrischek2022Visionrelated). The three-dimensional structure of human SERPINE3, predicted by AlphaFold2, shows a similarity to other native serpins, with a mean root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.6 Å, indicating a conserved structural framework (Indrischek2022Visionrelated).

The protein's tertiary structure is likely to include a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, a common feature among serpins, which allows for conformational changes necessary for protease inhibition. The reactive center loop of SERPINE3 is exposed and disordered, facilitating substrate binding (Indrischek2022Visionrelated). While specific post-translational modifications or splice variants are not detailed in the provided context, such modifications are common in serpins and may influence SERPINE3's activity and interactions.

## Function
SERPINE3 is a member of the serpin family, which functions as a serine protease inhibitor. It is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it plays a role in modulating extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular migration, influencing tissue homeostasis and wound healing (Indrischek2022Visionrelated). In humans, SERPINE3 is expressed in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, suggesting a role in eye health, particularly in processes related to inflammation and retinal survival (Indrischek2022Visionrelated). The gene is upregulated in conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, indicating its potential involvement in anti-inflammatory processes (Indrischek2022Visionrelated).

SERPINE3 is also expressed in neural tissues, including the brain, pituitary, and spinal cord, where it may act as an inhibitor of the proprotein convertase PCSK4, given the similarity in their expression patterns (Badola2006Correlation). Although the specific target of SERPINE3 remains unknown, its expression in these tissues suggests a role in regulating protease activity, which could be crucial for maintaining neural tissue function (Badola2006Correlation). Despite these insights, the precise function of SERPINE3 in healthy human cells remains largely speculative, as it has not been extensively studied in animal or cellular models (Indrischek2022Visionrelated).

## Clinical Significance
SERPINE3 has been implicated in several eye-related conditions due to its role in retinal survival and anti-inflammatory processes. It is upregulated in patients with age-related macular degeneration, a condition associated with chronic inflammation and wound healing, suggesting its involvement in retinal health (Indrischek2022Visionrelated). In zebrafish, knockout experiments of SERPINE3 result in abnormal eye shape and retinal lamination, indicating its importance in eye development and structure (Indrischek2022Visionrelated).

In the context of cancer, SERPINE3 expression levels have been linked to prognosis in various cancer types. It is associated with a worse prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, while it appears to have a protective role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Liu2024Pancancer). The gene's expression is also correlated with the tumor microenvironment and immune infiltration, suggesting a role in tumor immunity regulation (Liu2024Pancancer).

The evolutionary loss of SERPINE3 in certain mammals with poor vision, such as echolocating bats and subterranean mammals, further supports its potential vision-related function, although it is not directly linked to specific diseases in these species (Indrischek2022Visionrelated).
