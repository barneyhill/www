# TTYH3

## Overview
TTYH3 is a gene that encodes the protein tweety family member 3, which is part of the tweety homolog family. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein with five transmembrane segments and an extended extracellular domain, forming a dimeric structure (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM; Li2021Structures). TTYH3 is primarily involved in ion transport and cell volume regulation, functioning as a component of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC swell) in the plasma membrane of cells, particularly astrocytes (Han2019Tweetyhomolog; Attwood2021Characterization). The protein plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating chloride ion efflux in response to cell swelling, which is essential for the regulatory volume decrease mechanism (Han2019Tweetyhomolog). TTYH3 is also implicated in various cellular interactions and signaling pathways, influencing processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor progression (Wang2022The). Its expression and interactions have clinical significance, particularly in the context of cancer, where it is associated with poor clinical outcomes and tumor progression (Saha2019High; Nalamalapu2021The).

## Structure
The TTYH3 protein is a member of the Tweety homolog family, characterized by a unique molecular structure. It consists of five transmembrane segments and an extended extracellular domain, forming a dimeric organization (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM; Li2021Structures). The extracellular domain includes a large cavity lined with polar and charged residues, suggesting potential interactions with ligands or substrates (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM). The protein's structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds and contains N-linked glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications (Li2021Structures).

The tertiary structure of TTYH3 reveals a Y-shaped molecular architecture due to the arrangement of its helices, contributing to its stability and function (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which can occur as cis-dimers within a single membrane or trans-dimers spanning opposing membranes, influenced by the presence of calcium ions (Li2021Structures). The protein also features a conserved hydrophobic pocket, which may interact with lipids or lipid-like molecules, indicating a potential role in lipid transport or signaling (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM; Li2021Structures).

## Function
The TTYH3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the tweety family, which is involved in ion transport and cell volume regulation. TTYH3 is primarily active in the plasma membrane of cells, particularly in astrocytes, where it functions as a component of the swelling-dependent volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC swell) (Han2019Tweetyhomolog; Attwood2021Characterization). This channel is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating the efflux of chloride ions in response to cell swelling, a process essential for the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) mechanism (Han2019Tweetyhomolog).

TTYH3, along with its family members TTYH1 and TTYH2, forms pore-forming subunits of VRAC swell, contributing to chloride ion conductance in astrocytes (Han2019Tweetyhomolog). These proteins exhibit properties such as outward rectification and sensitivity to specific inhibitors, indicating their role in ion transport and regulation (Han2019Tweetyhomolog). The activity of TTYH3 is independent of calcium and is modulated by tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which are important for its function in ion transport and cellular signaling (Han2019Tweetyhomolog).

## Clinical Significance
TTYH3 (tweety family member 3) is implicated in various cancers and other diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In gastric and stomach cancers, high TTYH3 expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival and post-progression survival. This upregulation is linked to genetic and epigenetic changes, such as copy number amplifications and decreased methylation in cancer cells (Saha2019High). TTYH3 is also upregulated in breast, osteosarcoma, kidney, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inhibiting apoptosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma, TTYH3 interacts with MK5, activating the GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor progression (Wang2022The; Nalamalapu2021The).

In bladder cancer, TTYH3 is involved in the FGFR1/H-Ras/A-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Its expression is associated with low promoter methylation, suggesting epigenetic regulation (Biswas2022TTYH3). In lung cancer, TTYH3 expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and poor survival after immunotherapy, indicating its role in tumor immune escape (Wei2022TTYH3).

## Interactions
TTYH3, a member of the Tweety family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with several proteins, including CDKAL1, LMAN2, DHRS9, P2RY12, LPAR1, CD70, FAM189A2, FAM134C, GPR141, TMEM206, ASGR2, CD27, PTGIR, S1PR1, SLCD6A1, TNFRSF1A, GYPB, TMEM171, IPPK, and FTR2, as identified through high-throughput affinity purification mass-spectrometry in HEK293T cells (Nalamalapu2021The). The precise nature of these interactions remains to be fully understood.

TTYH3 also plays a role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells through its interaction with MK5. This interaction is mediated by non-covalent bonds, and mutations in TTYH3 that affect its interface with MK5 reduce this interaction. The TTYH3-MK5 interaction activates the GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor progression (Wang2022The).

Additionally, TTYH3 is suggested to interact with proteins such as BEST1, BEST2, BEST3, BEST4, ZnF467, CLCC1, GLRB, ANO1, IQCE, and ANO2, which may play roles in various cellular processes (Gui2021High). These interactions highlight TTYH3's potential involvement in complex cellular signaling networks.
