# LENEP

## Overview
The LENEP gene encodes the lens epithelial protein, which plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of lens epithelial cells. This protein is categorized as a structural protein, contributing to the integrity and function of the lens epithelium. The lens epithelial protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and response to oxidative stress, which are essential for maintaining lens transparency and preventing cataract formation. Mutations or dysregulation of the LENEP gene can lead to lens-related disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in ocular health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
