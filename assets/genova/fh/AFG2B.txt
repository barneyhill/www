# AFG2B

## Overview
AFG2B is a gene that encodes the AFG2 AAA ATPase homolog B protein, which is a member of the AAA ATPase family. This family of proteins is integral to mitochondrial function, particularly in protein quality control and maintenance of mitochondrial integrity. The AFG2 AAA ATPase homolog B protein is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in the assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, thereby ensuring proper mitochondrial protein homeostasis. This protein is also a key component of the AIRIM complex, which is crucial for ribosome biogenesis, particularly in neural progenitor cells. Disruptions in the function of AFG2B can lead to significant neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its importance in cellular energy production and early cell fate specification (Ni2024An).

## Structure


## Function
AFG2B, also known as AFG2 AAA ATPase homolog B, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in mitochondrial function. This protein is part of the AAA ATPase family, which plays a crucial role in protein quality control and mitochondrial maintenance. AFG2B is active in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it contributes to cellular energy production and overall cellular health. It is involved in the assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, ensuring proper mitochondrial protein homeostasis and function.

In the context of ribosome biogenesis, AFG2B is a component of the AIRIM complex, which includes AFG2A and CINP. This complex is essential for the recycling of RSL24D1 from cytoplasmic pre-60S ribosomal subunits back to the nucleolus, a process critical for ribosome production. Disruption of this complex can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the importance of AFG2B in maintaining ribosome levels, particularly in neural progenitor cells. Proper ribosome availability is crucial for the translation of specific mRNAs, affecting early cell fate specification and the transition from neuroepithelial to radial glial cells (Ni2024An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AFG2B gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including intellectual disabilities, seizures, hearing loss, and microcephaly. These mutations disrupt ribosome biogenesis, leading to brain-specific abnormalities that distinguish them from other ribosomopathies such as Diamond Blackfan Anemia (Ni2024An). Patients with AFG2B variants often exhibit neuroimaging features similar to those with AFG2A variants, such as extensive brain atrophy, which is linked to widespread cell death and delays in radial glial cell specification, potentially due to mitochondrial dysfunction (Ni2024An).

The study of human iPSC-derived brain organoids has shown that variants in AFG2B affect neuroepithelial differentiation and the translation of specific mRNAs, leading to delays in cell fate transitions. These effects can be mitigated by increasing mTOR signaling, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach (Ni2024An). The research highlights that reductions in protein synthesis capacity affect the translation of specific mRNAs, which may be linked to the observed phenotypes in patients with AFG2B mutations (Ni2024An). These findings underscore the critical role of ribosome regulation in early neurodevelopment and the specific neurological phenotypes associated with AFG2B mutations.
