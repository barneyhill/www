# TPTE

## Overview
The TPTE gene encodes the transmembrane phosphatase with tensin homology, a protein that is part of the PTEN-C2 superfamily. This protein is characterized by its structural similarity to the tumor suppressor PTEN, particularly in its phosphatase domain, and is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its four potential transmembrane domains (Guipponi2001The; Mishra2011A). These domains suggest its localization to cellular membranes, such as the Golgi apparatus, where it may interact with lipid bilayers through its conserved C2 domain (Mishra2011A). TPTE is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with some variants playing roles in cell proliferation regulation (Pulido2013PTPs). The gene is present in multiple copies on human chromosomes, with active loci likely on chromosomes 13, 15q, and 21p (Guipponi2001The). While TPTE is often described as an inactive phosphatase, it may possess phosphatase activity toward unknown substrates, and its expression is implicated in various diseases, including prostate cancer and infertility (Ceyhan2022Expression; Zainodini2024Overexpression; Pulido2013PTPs).

## Structure
The TPTE protein is characterized by its structural similarity to the tumor suppressor PTEN, particularly in its phosphatase domain. It contains four potential transmembrane domains, which suggest its localization to cellular membranes, such as the Golgi apparatus (Guipponi2001The). The protein is part of the PTEN-C2 superfamily and includes a C2 domain, which is crucial for membrane interaction and function (Mishra2011A). This domain is conserved and contains hydrophobic residues that facilitate interaction with lipid bilayers, similar to PTEN (Mishra2011A).

TPTE is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with some variants like TPIP-C2 lacking most of the catalytic domain but retaining the C2 domain (Pulido2013PTPs). The TPIP-C2 variant, a splice form of the TPTE gene, has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in HeLa cells, indicating a potential role in cell proliferation regulation (Mishra2011A). The TPTE gene is present in multiple copies on human chromosomes, with complete and non-mutated copies on chromosomes 13, 15q, and 21p, which are likely the active loci (Guipponi2001The).

## Clinical Significance
The TPTE gene is implicated in various diseases, primarily due to its altered expression levels and potential mutations. In prostate cancer (PCa), TPTE is significantly overexpressed, correlating with disease progression indicators such as the Gleason score and PSA levels. This overexpression is associated with increased disease severity and progression, suggesting TPTE's potential as a biomarker for PCa (Zainodini2024Overexpression). The anti-TPTE-p2 antibody has shown promise in inhibiting the proliferation of prostate and breast cancer cell lines, indicating potential therapeutic applications (Zainodini2024Overexpression).

TPTE is also expressed in testicular tissues, where it plays a role in spermatogenesis. Alterations in TPTE expression can lead to infertility, as evidenced by studies showing reduced sperm motility and lower fertilization rates in knockout mice lacking TPTE (Ceyhan2022Expression). In humans, TPTE expression is higher in healthy and infertile men with spermatocytes and spermatids compared to those with severe infertility, suggesting its importance in male fertility (Ceyhan2022Expression).

While TPTE is described as an inactive phosphatase, it may have phosphatase activity toward unknown substrates, and several tumor-associated mutations have been identified, though their causative role in disease remains unclear (Pulido2013PTPs).
