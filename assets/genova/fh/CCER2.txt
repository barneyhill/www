# CCER2

## Overview
The CCER2 gene encodes the coiled-coil glutamate rich protein 2, a protein characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which is known to facilitate protein-protein interactions. This protein is implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including Moyamoya disease and certain cancers. The coiled-coil domain, located at the C-terminal, plays a crucial role in the protein's structural integrity and function, potentially influencing its oligomerization and aggregation properties (Mukawa2017Exome). Mutations within this domain, such as p.E242K, have been associated with altered protein behavior and disease pathogenesis (Mukawa2017Exome). The CCER2 protein's expression levels have been linked to clinical outcomes in cancer and atopic dermatitis, highlighting its significance in medical research (Lee2022Association; Hu2023An).

## Structure
The CCER2 gene encodes a protein consisting of 266 amino acids, featuring an N-terminal secretory signal peptide and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (Mukawa2017Exome). The coiled-coil domain is a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions and may influence the protein's secondary and tertiary structures. The protein's secondary structure is altered by the p.T76_G80delinsPS mutation, which does not align with any known functional domains or sequence motifs in public databases (Mukawa2017Exome). Another mutation, p.E242K, located within the coiled-coil domain, increases the potential for protein oligomerization, suggesting a role in the protein's quaternary structure (Mukawa2017Exome).

The protein structure of CCER2 is based on the UniProt database entry I3L3R5 (CCER2_HUMAN), although detailed information on its primary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific domains, prominent folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms is not provided in the available context (Mukawa2017Exome). The study suggests that CCER2 mutations may promote protein aggregation or oligomerization, as predicted by in silico analysis (Mukawa2017Exome).

## Clinical Significance
The CCER2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression levels. Notably, CCER2 has been identified as a novel candidate gene for Moyamoya disease (MMD), a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive stenosis of cerebral arteries. Studies have found several rare deleterious variants in CCER2, such as p.T76_G80delinsPS and p.E242K, which are associated with MMD, particularly in patients without the RNF213-susceptibility variants. These variants are more frequent in MMD patients compared to controls, suggesting a significant role in the disease's pathogenesis (Mukawa2017Exome).

In cancer research, CCER2 has been associated with cancer survival disparities. A study found that CCER2 is upregulated in individuals of African ancestry with breast cancer, correlating with an increased risk of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and a higher relative risk of death. This suggests that CCER2 expression levels may influence cancer outcomes and treatment side effects (Lee2022Association).

Additionally, CCER2 has been noted in the context of atopic dermatitis, where its downregulation in high genetic risk patients is associated with changes in the extracellular matrix, potentially contributing to disease severity (Hu2023An).
