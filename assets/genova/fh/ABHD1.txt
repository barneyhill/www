# ABHD1

## Overview
ABHD1 is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 1, which is a member of the α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily. This protein is characterized by its enzymatic activity as a lysolipid lipase, playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism and lipid droplet formation. Structurally, ABHD1 is predicted to be a single-pass type II membrane protein, featuring a catalytic triad essential for its function. The protein's involvement in lipid droplet dynamics suggests a significant role in cellular lipid homeostasis and energy balance. While the gene's precise physiological roles are still being elucidated, its enzymatic activity and structural features indicate potential implications in metabolic processes and signaling pathways (Lord2013Mammalian; TorresRomero2023The).

## Structure
The ABHD1 protein is a member of the α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily, characterized by a core structure consisting of an eight-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices and loops (Lord2013Mammalian). The protein is composed of 405 amino acids and includes a catalytic triad formed by Ser203, Asp329, and His358, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Edgar2003The). This triad is conserved across the UPF0017 family, to which ABHD1 belongs (Edgar2003The).

ABHD1 is predicted to be a single-pass type II membrane protein, although this has not been experimentally confirmed (Lord2013Mammalian). It contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain, a central α/β-hydrolase fold-containing domain, and an intrinsically disordered domain at its C-terminus (TorresRomero2023The). The C-terminus also features a hydrophobic helix that may anchor the protein to lipid droplets (TorresRomero2023The).

The protein's hydrophobicity is similar to MLDP, with a Gravy index of 0.05 (TorresRomero2023The). ABHD1 does not contain the major hairpin hydrophobic domain present in oleosins, indicating a unique structural adaptation (TorresRomero2023The). The protein's role in lipid droplet formation and its enzymatic activity as a lysolipid lipase are facilitated by its structural features (TorresRomero2023The). The human ABHD1 gene overlaps with the Sec12 gene in an antisense manner, sharing overlapping polyadenylation signal sequences in their 3'UTRs (Edgar2003The).

## Function
The ABHD1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a lysolipid lipase, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism and lipid droplet formation. It exhibits lyso-DGTS lipase activity, reducing lyso-DGTS species in lipid extracts and converting pure lyso-DGTS into palmitic acid and GTS. ABHD1 also acts on other lysolipids such as lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), lyso-PE, lyso-PG, and MAG, but not on lipids with two acyl-groups (TorresRomero2023The). The protein contains a catalytic triad, with His356 being crucial for its enzymatic activity, as mutation of this residue significantly reduces its function (TorresRomero2023The).

ABHD1 is involved in lipid droplet (LD) formation, influencing the geometry of LDs by promoting a transition from a flattened to a budded shape, even in the absence of its enzymatic activity. This suggests that ABHD1's binding to LD surfaces contributes to droplet budding (TorresRomero2023The). In cellular models, ABHD1 is associated with LDs and can induce LD formation under certain conditions, indicating its role in lipid metabolism and storage (TorresRomero2023The). These activities highlight ABHD1's involvement in maintaining lipid homeostasis and its potential impact on cellular energy balance and signaling pathways.
