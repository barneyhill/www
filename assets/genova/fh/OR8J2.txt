# OR8J2

## Overview
The OR8J2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily J member 2, which is involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, characterized by their seven transmembrane domain structure, which is crucial for signal transduction across cell membranes. Olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR8J2, play a pivotal role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorant molecules and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. The OR8J2 gene is located on chromosome 11 and is part of a large gene family responsible for the diversity of olfactory receptors in humans (Qiu2020aarFDC).
