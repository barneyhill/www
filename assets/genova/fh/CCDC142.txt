# CCDC142

## Overview
CCDC142 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 142, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC142 protein may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. Although the specific biological functions of the CCDC142 protein are not fully understood, it has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and alternative splicing. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases and type 2 diabetes, where it may influence disease pathogenesis through its regulatory roles (Lin2023Intestinal; Liu2024Identification). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the precise functions and mechanisms of CCDC142 in health and disease.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
CCDC142 has been implicated in various diseases through its involvement in alternative splicing and gene regulation. In the context of acute colitis, a study identified CCDC142 as one of the top differential skipped exon (SE) events, with a significant change in splicing observed during dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in intestinal epithelial cells. This suggests that alterations in CCDC142 splicing may play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (Lin2023Intestinal).

In type 2 diabetes (T2D), CCDC142 has been identified as a potential regulatory target. It is one of the top insulin resistance-related differentially expressed genes (IR-DEGs) modulated by 122 transcription factors, indicating its potential significance in the regulation of metabolic processes associated with T2D. This highlights CCDC142's possible role in the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance and its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in T2D (Liu2024Identification).

While these studies suggest a role for CCDC142 in specific conditions, its precise clinical significance and the full extent of its involvement in disease processes remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify its contributions to these and potentially other conditions.
