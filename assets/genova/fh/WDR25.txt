# WDR25

## Overview
WDR25 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 25 protein, which is characterized by the presence of seven WD40 repeats. These repeats are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, forming a seven-bladed β-propeller structure. The WDR25 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA processing, signal transduction, and cell cycle control, by participating in the formation of multiprotein complexes. It is expressed in multiple human tissues, with particularly high levels in the heart, muscle, and reproductive organs, suggesting its role in essential cellular functions. The protein's similarity to the human pre-mRNA splicing factor 17 indicates a potential involvement in RNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression regulation (Hu2021Abstract; Jin2004A).

## Structure
The WDR25 protein is characterized by the presence of seven WD40 repeats, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions. These repeats are defined by a conserved sequence that begins with Gly-His (GH) and ends with Trp-Asp (WD), although these sequences are not absolutely conserved. The WD40 repeats form a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, which provides three potential interacting surfaces at its top, bottom, and circumference, serving as sites for protein binding (Jin2004A). The protein is 544 amino acids long and has a predicted molecular mass of 60 kDa (Jin2004A).

The WD40 repeat proteins, including WDR25, are known for their circular seven-bladed β-propeller structure, with each blade containing approximately 40 amino acids ending in a WD sequence. These proteins have interaction sites on the top, bottom, and side, which can be simultaneously occupied, and a center pore suitable for small molecule binding (Hu2021Abstract). The WDR25 protein shows high similarity with the human pre-mRNA splicing factor 17 and its homologues in other species, suggesting a role in RNA processing and possibly other cellular functions (Jin2004A).

## Function
The WDR25 gene encodes a protein characterized by the presence of seven WD40 repeats, which are structural motifs involved in a variety of cellular processes. These processes include RNA processing, signal transduction, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, and cell cycle control (Jin2004A). The WD40 repeats facilitate protein-protein interactions, often forming a seven-bladed β-propeller structure that is crucial for these interactions. This structural feature allows WDR25 to participate in the formation of multiprotein complexes, which are essential for its role in cellular pathways (Jin2004A).

WDR25 is expressed widely across human tissues, with particularly high expression levels in the heart, muscle, testis, ovary, uterus, and prostate, indicating its involvement in fundamental cellular functions (Jin2004A). The protein shows significant similarity to the human pre-mRNA splicing factor 17, suggesting a potential role in RNA splicing, which is a critical process in gene expression and regulation (Jin2004A). The activity of WDR25 is primarily located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell cycle regulation and development, contributing to the maintenance of cellular and organismal homeostasis (Jin2004A).
