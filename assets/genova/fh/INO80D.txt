# INO80D

## Overview
The INO80D gene encodes the INO80 complex subunit D, a critical component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex. This complex is involved in essential cellular processes such as transcription, DNA replication, and repair, primarily through its role in modifying chromatin structure to facilitate access to DNA. The INO80D protein, characterized by its DNA-binding domains and low-complexity regions, plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. It is expressed in various human tissues, notably within the cardiovascular system, underscoring its importance in cardiovascular function and development (Shameer2014Whole; Chang2018Genomewide). The protein's interactions with other components of the INO80 complex, such as ACTL6A and RUVBL2, are vital for its function in chromatin dynamics and cellular homeostasis (Shameer2014Whole).

## Function
The INO80D gene encodes a subunit of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including transcription, DNA replication, and repair. The INO80D protein is involved in chromatin remodeling, a process that modifies chromatin architecture to allow access to genomic DNA for regulatory transcription machinery, thereby controlling gene expression (Shameer2014Whole; Chang2018Genomewide). This function is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression.

In healthy human cells, INO80D is expressed in various tissues, including the aorta, heart, coronary arteries, and myocardium, indicating its significant role in cardiovascular function (Shameer2014Whole). The protein contains DNA-binding domains that are important for its role in chromatin remodeling, and it interacts with other proteins within the INO80 complex to mediate these processes (Shameer2014Whole). The INO80D protein's involvement in chromatin dynamics suggests it plays a role in gene expression regulation, contributing to the fine-tuning of cell growth and division (Chang2018Genomewide). The presence of low-complexity regions in the protein indicates a flexible structure that might facilitate interactions with other proteins, further supporting its role in chromatin remodeling (Shameer2014Whole).

## Interactions
The INO80D protein is a metazoan-specific subunit of the human INO80 complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling, transcription, DNA replication, and repair. INO80D interacts with several proteins as part of this complex, playing a crucial role in cardiovascular development and physiology. The protein-protein interaction network mediated by INO80D includes interactions with proteins such as ACTL6A (actin-like 6A), ACTR8 (ARP8 actin-related protein 8 homolog), MCRSI (microspherule protein 1), NFRKB (nuclear factor related to kappaB binding protein), RUVBL2 (RuvB-like AAA ATPase 2), TFPT (TCF3 fusion partner), UCHL5 (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L5), and YY1 (YY1 transcription factor). These interactions are crucial for the formation of the hetero-oligomeric protein complex that mediates several important cellular processes (Shameer2014Whole).

The mutation Ser818Cys in INO80D may lead to the loss of a low-complexity region (LCR-7), which could affect these protein-protein interactions. This mutation may also induce a new disulfide bond, potentially leading to misfolding and affecting INO80D's function in protein binding or protein-DNA interactions (Shameer2014Whole).
