# ZNF558

## Overview
ZNF558 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 558, a member of the KRAB-ZFP (Kr√ºppel-associated box zinc finger protein) family, which functions as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are highly conserved and facilitate DNA binding, particularly to T-rich motifs within transposable elements such as LINE-1 elements. ZNF558 plays a crucial role in human forebrain development by regulating a network of genes, including SPATA18, which is involved in mitochondrial regulation and mitophagy. The expression of ZNF558 is modulated by a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) downstream of the gene, which is shorter in humans compared to non-human primates, allowing for the transcription of a long non-coding RNA that may influence its expression. This gene's regulatory functions are significant for mitochondrial homeostasis and have implications for cortical expansion in the human brain (Johansson2020A).

## Function
ZNF558 is a KRAB-ZFP transcription factor that plays a significant role in human forebrain development. It is involved in regulating a gene network during this process, particularly affecting the expression of the SPATA18 gene, which is crucial for mitochondrial regulation and mitophagy, a process important for mitochondrial quality control (Johansson2020A). ZNF558 binds to evolutionarily old LINE-1 elements and protein-coding genes, indicating its role in genomic regulation. Its zinc finger domains are highly conserved, and its DNA binding motif is T-rich, with binding sites predominantly located in transposable elements, particularly LINE-1 elements (Johansson2020A).

In humans, ZNF558 expression is regulated by a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) located downstream of the gene. This VNTR is shorter in humans compared to non-human primates, correlating with active transcription of ZNF558. The shorter VNTR allows for the transcription of a long non-coding RNA, which may influence ZNF558 expression (Johansson2020A). The gene's function in healthy human cells includes regulating SPATA18, which is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis during brain development (Johansson2020A). This regulation suggests a link between mitochondrial homeostasis and cortical expansion in the human brain (Johansson2020A).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF558 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In endometrial cancer (EC), ZNF558 is significantly downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal endometrial tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that ZNF558 expression levels may play a role in the progression and prognosis of EC (p&gt; Zou2020&lt; Decreased).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, ZNF558 is involved in a gene regulatory network during human forebrain development. A human-specific structural variation at the ZNF558 locus affects the expression of SPATA18, a gene involved in mitochondrial clearance through mitophagy. This regulation is crucial for neural stem cell fate decisions and neurogenesis, linking ZNF558 to conditions such as Williams Syndrome, Leigh Syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia (Johansson2020A).

Additionally, in Angelman syndrome, ZNF558 was found to be highly expressed in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients, but not in control iPSC neurons, indicating a potential role in the pathophysiology of the syndrome (Panov2022An). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF558 in various diseases, although specific mutations or interaction changes are not detailed.

## Interactions
ZNF558 is a zinc finger protein that primarily interacts with DNA to regulate gene expression. It contains a nine-membered zinc finger array that binds to DNA, with its binding residues being highly conserved among mammals (Johansson2020A). The protein's binding motif is T-rich, and its binding sites overlap with protein-coding genes, such as SPATA18, which is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis (Johansson2020A). ZNF558 has been shown to bind to evolutionarily old LINE-1 elements, although it does not affect their transcription, suggesting a role in repressing these elements in the past (Johansson2020A).

In humans, ZNF558 regulates the expression of the SPATA18 gene during forebrain development. This regulation is achieved through transcriptional repression, as demonstrated by CRISPRi-mediated transcriptional silencing experiments in human forebrain neural progenitor cells (fbNPCs) (Johansson2020A). The interaction between ZNF558 and SPATA18 is significant for mitochondrial regulation, as SPATA18 encodes MIEAP, a protein involved in mitophagy (Johansson2020A). The regulation of SPATA18 by ZNF558 is linked to mitochondrial homeostasis and may contribute to human-specific cortical expansion (Johansson2020A).
