# KLK15

## Overview
KLK15 is a gene that encodes the protein kallikrein-related peptidase 15, a member of the serine protease family known for its trypsin-like activity. This protein is involved in various physiological processes, including tissue remodeling and cellular signaling, and is primarily expressed in the thyroid gland, with lower levels in other tissues such as the prostate and kidney (Yousef2001Molecular). KLK15 is synthesized as an inactive precursor and undergoes proteolytic activation, which is a common feature of kallikrein-related peptidases (Kryza2016The). The protein plays a role in proteolytic cascades, including the activation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and is implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels and genetic variations have been associated with prognostic outcomes in cancers such as ovarian and breast cancer (Mavridis2010Prognostic; Yousef2003Prognostic). As a serine protease, KLK15's activity is regulated by factors such as pH, metal ions, and inhibitors, and it interacts with components of the extracellular matrix, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Filippou2018Biochemical).

## Structure
The KLK15 protein is a serine protease that exhibits trypsin-like activity, cleaving preferentially after arginine residues (Filippou2018Biochemical). It is synthesized as a pre-pro-enzyme with a signal peptide, which directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum for processing into an inactive zymogen. Activation occurs through specific proteolytic cleavage, allowing the enzyme to become active (Kryza2016The).

The primary structure of KLK15 includes a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, with a conserved serine-type catalytic triad consisting of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine residues, which is typical of the kallikrein family (Kryza2016The). The secondary structure likely includes beta-barrels and alpha-helices, as seen in other kallikrein-related peptidases, although specific details for KLK15 are not provided (Kryza2016The).

KLK15 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its function and stability (Kryza2016The). Several splice variants of KLK15 have been identified, including KLK15 v.11 and v.12, which encode truncated protein isoforms that retain the critical residues of the catalytic triad necessary for enzymatic activity (Adamopoulos2020Identification). These isoforms are expressed at higher levels in certain cancer types, suggesting potential roles in cancer biology (Adamopoulos2020Identification).

## Function
KLK15, a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family, is a serine protease involved in various physiological processes. It is primarily expressed in the thyroid gland, with lower levels in the prostate, salivary, and adrenal glands, colon, testis, and kidney (Yousef2001Molecular). KLK15 is part of a proteolytic cascade, playing a role in the activation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is significant for prostate function and semen liquefaction (Adamopoulos2020Identification; Mavridis2010Prognostic). 

The protein is predicted to be translated as an inactive preproenzyme precursor, which includes a signal peptide and a propeptide, indicating its involvement in regulated proteolytic processes (Yousef2001Molecular). KLK15 is also implicated in the activation of other kallikreins, such as hK3, suggesting its role in a cascade enzymatic pathway (Yousef2005Human). 

In healthy human cells, KLK15's trypsin-like activity contributes to tissue remodeling and cellular signaling, maintaining normal cellular and tissue homeostasis (Adamopoulos2020Identification). Its expression and activity are crucial for physiological processes, including potential roles in systemic inflammatory responses and immune-modulated disorders (Yousef2005Human).

## Clinical Significance
KLK15, a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family, has been implicated in the prognosis of several cancers, notably ovarian and breast cancer. In ovarian cancer, high KLK15 expression is associated with significantly reduced progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), making it an independent prognostic factor for unfavorable outcomes. This association is particularly evident in patients with optimal debulking, suggesting KLK15's potential as a prognostic biomarker in this context (Yousef2003Prognostic). Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in KLK15, rs266851, has been linked to poor survival outcomes in ovarian cancer, indicating that genetic variations in KLK15 may influence cancer prognosis (Batra2011A).

In breast cancer, KLK15 expression is considered a favorable prognostic marker. It is associated with longer PFS and OS, particularly in patients with lower-grade tumors and those negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors. The gene's expression is up-regulated by androgens, suggesting a hormonal regulation mechanism that may contribute to its role in breast cancer prognosis (Yousef2002The).

KLK15's expression and genetic variations highlight its potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, although its precise biological role in cancer progression remains to be fully elucidated (Adamopoulos2020Identification).

## Interactions
KLK15, a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family, exhibits several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the context of cancer. It has been shown to have trypsin-like serine protease activity, with a preference for cleaving after arginine residues, and is capable of activating other kallikreins, such as pro-KLK8, 12, and 14, suggesting its role in a broader kallikrein activation cascade (Yoon2008A). KLK15's enzymatic activity is influenced by various factors, including pH, metal ions, and serine protease inhibitors, with alpha-1 antitrypsin being a potent inhibitor (Filippou2018Biochemical).

In cancer, KLK15 interacts with the extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor group, which includes proteins like collagen and laminin, as well as components of the focal adhesion machinery such as integrins and fibronectin. These interactions suggest a role in tumorigenesis by promoting metastasis (Filippou2018Biochemical). KLK15's activity is also regulated by zinc ions, which are abundant in prostate epithelial cells and inhibit its activity, indicating a potential role in prostate cancer (Filippou2018Biochemical). Additionally, KLK15 is predicted to be a target of miR-224, a microRNA, although specific interactions have not been detailed (Chow2008Kallikreins).
