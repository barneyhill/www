# ZNF23

## Overview
ZNF23 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 23, a transcription factor characterized by a KRAB domain and multiple C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular homeostasis by inhibiting cell growth. The zinc finger protein 23 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is expressed in various human tissues, with significant expression in the lung and brain. Its growth-inhibitory function is primarily mediated through the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27^kip-1, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Notably, the protein's activity is independent of the p53 pathway, distinguishing its unique role in cell cycle control. ZNF23 is considered a potential tumor suppressor, as its downregulation is associated with several cancers, including endometrial and ovarian carcinomas, where it may contribute to tumorigenesis by allowing unchecked cell proliferation (Huang2007Characterization).

## Structure
ZNF23 encodes a polypeptide consisting of 643 amino acids, featuring a truncated KRAB domain at its N-terminus and 16 C2H2-type zinc fingers at its C-terminus (Huang2007Characterization). The KRAB domain, composed of A and B boxes, is typically involved in transcriptional repression by recruiting other proteins, although in ZNF23, its growth-inhibitory effects are independent of this domain (Huang2007Characterization). The zinc finger motifs are crucial for DNA recognition and are essential for the protein's function in inhibiting cell cycle progression (Huang2007Characterization).

ZNF23 exists in two splice variant isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing, which include insertions of amino acids without altering the coding sequence (Huang2007Characterization). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human embryonic tissues, with notable expression in the lung and brain, and is localized to the nucleus (Huang2007Characterization). The molecular weight of ZNF23 is approximately 73 kDa, as confirmed by Western blot analysis (Huang2007Characterization). The C-terminal zinc fingers are critical for its growth-inhibitory function, as deletion of the last four zinc fingers abolishes these effects (Huang2007Characterization).

## Function
ZNF23 (zinc finger protein 23) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is characterized by a KRAB domain at its N-terminus and 16 C2H2-type zinc fingers at its C-terminus, which are crucial for its function in inhibiting cell growth (Huang2007Characterization). ZNF23 is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues, with the strongest expression observed in the lung and brain, and is localized to the nucleus where it exerts its function (Huang2007Characterization).

In healthy cells, ZNF23 contributes to cell cycle regulation by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. This is achieved through the upregulation of p27 kip-1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which delays cell cycle progression (Huang2007Characterization). The growth-inhibitory effect of ZNF23 is independent of the p53 pathway, highlighting its unique role in cell cycle control (Huang2007Characterization). The C-terminal zinc fingers of ZNF23 are essential for its growth-inhibitory function, while the KRAB domain is not necessary for this activity (Huang2007Characterization). This protein's activity is crucial for preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation, which is a hallmark of cancerous growth.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF23 is implicated in various human cancers due to its role as a potential tumor suppressor. The gene is significantly downregulated in several tumor cell lines and primary tumors, including endometrial and ovarian carcinomas, suggesting that its reduced expression may contribute to tumorigenesis (Huang2007Characterization). In ovarian cancer cells, ZNF23 overexpression has been shown to inhibit cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This process involves the activation of caspase-3, nuclear condensation, and the formation of a sub-G1 peak, indicating apoptotic cell death. The apoptosis is partially mediated through the downregulation of Bcl-XL and involves the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 activation (Ding2008ZNF23).

The tumor-suppressive effects of ZNF23 are also linked to its ability to upregulate the cell cycle inhibitor p27 kip-1, which inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases and delays cell cycle progression in the G1 phase. Silencing p27 kip-1 reverses the growth-inhibitory effects of ZNF23, highlighting its critical role in mediating these effects (Huang2007Characterization). The downregulation of ZNF23 in cancers may thus contribute to increased cell proliferation and survival, underscoring its clinical significance in cancer biology (Huang2007Characterization).

## Interactions
ZNF23, a KRAB-containing zinc finger protein, interacts with cell cycle regulators to exert its tumor suppressive effects. One of the key interactions of ZNF23 is with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27^kip-1. ZNF23 upregulates p27^kip-1 expression, which inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. This interaction is crucial for ZNF23's ability to inhibit cell proliferation, as silencing p27^kip-1 expression reverses the growth inhibition and DNA synthesis suppression induced by ZNF23 (Huang2007Characterization).

ZNF23's inhibitory effects on cell growth are mediated through its C-terminal zinc fingers, which are essential for its function. The removal of these zinc fingers abolishes ZNF23's growth-inhibitory effects, while the expression of the C-terminal zinc fingers alone can still lead to growth inhibition, albeit less effectively than the full-length protein. This suggests that the zinc fingers play a critical role in ZNF23's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids necessary for its function (Huang2007Characterization).

ZNF23 does not interact with the p53 pathway, as it does not affect p53 protein levels or p53-dependent activities, indicating that its growth-inhibitory effects are independent of p53 (Huang2007Characterization).
