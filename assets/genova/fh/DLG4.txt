# DLG4

## Overview
DLG4 is a gene that encodes the protein discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 4, commonly referred to as Post Synaptic Density 95 (PSD95). This protein is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family and plays a crucial role in the organization and function of synapses in the brain. PSD95 is primarily located in the postsynaptic density of neurons, where it acts as a scaffold for protein complexes, facilitating interactions between membrane receptors and intracellular signaling pathways. It is integral to synaptic plasticity, particularly in processes related to learning and memory, by regulating the density and activity of glutamate receptors, such as NMDA receptors. The protein's involvement in synaptic signaling and neuroprotection underscores its importance in maintaining cognitive function and its potential implications in various neurological and psychiatric disorders (Gao2023Transcriptome; Zulissetiana2023Bioinformatics; Humbert2015The).

## Structure
The DLG4 gene encodes the protein known as Post Synaptic Density 95 (PSD95), a critical component in synaptic function and organization. PSD95 is composed of 764 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 80.47 kDa (Zulissetiana2023Bioinformatics). The protein structure includes three N-terminal PDZ domains, a Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a guanylate kinase-like C-terminal domain. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for synaptic signaling and organization (Zulissetiana2023Bioinformatics; Zhou2003Overlapping).

PSD95 is subject to post-translational modifications, including thioester-linked palmitoylation, which targets the protein to cell membranes and is crucial for its interaction with receptors (Zhou2003Overlapping). This modification is significant for the protein's role in synaptic junctions and signal transduction pathways. The protein's stability is indicated by a stability score of 48.61 and an aliphatic index of 85.42, reflecting its hydrophobic nature (Zulissetiana2023Bioinformatics).

The DLG4 protein is associated with the glutamatergic system in postsynaptic neurons, playing a vital role in neuroplasticity, particularly in learning and memory processes by maintaining long-term potentiation (LTP) and regulating synaptic signals (Zulissetiana2023Bioinformatics).

## Function
DLG4, also known as PSD-95, is a critical synaptic protein involved in the organization and function of synapses in the brain. It is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family and plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity, which is essential for learning and memory (Gao2023Transcriptome; Humbert2015The). DLG4 is primarily located in the postsynaptic density of neurons, where it aggregates glutamate receptors, such as NMDA receptors, and acts as a scaffold for protein complexes that mediate signaling between membrane receptors and intracellular pathways (Gao2023Transcriptome).

The protein is involved in regulating the density and activity of glutamate receptors, which is crucial for neurotransmission involving excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate and monoamines such as dopamine and serotonin (Gao2023Transcriptome). DLG4's role in synaptic plasticity includes its involvement in NMDA receptor signal transduction and the regulation of synaptic vesicle maturation, calcium ion-dependent exocytosis, and excitatory postsynaptic membrane potential (Gao2023Transcriptome).

DLG4 is also implicated in neuroprotection, with its hypomethylation in the cerebellum suggesting a protective role in the brain (Gao2023Transcriptome). Its function is conserved across evolution, highlighting its fundamental role in neuronal signaling (Humbert2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DLG4 gene, which encodes the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95, are associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. DLG4-related synaptopathy is a rare brain disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), hypotonia, and epilepsy. Approximately 50% of individuals with this condition develop epilepsy, with various seizure types reported, including focal, generalized tonic-clonic, and myoclonic seizures (Kassabian2024Developmental).

DLG4 has also been implicated in schizophrenia. Studies have identified specific haplotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the DLG4 gene that are associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia, particularly in certain populations. For example, the rs17203281 variant has been linked to schizophrenia in Japanese cohorts (Balan2013PopulationSpecific; Cheng2010Genetic).

Altered expression levels of DLG4 have been observed in patients with mood disorders and schizophrenia, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of these conditions. The gene's involvement in synaptic dynamics and plasticity at glutamatergic synapses is crucial for maintaining normal cognitive function, and disruptions can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders (Cheng2010Genetic; Ting2012Functional).

## Interactions
DLG4, also known as PSD-95, is a key component of the postsynaptic density in neurons, where it participates in various protein-protein interactions essential for synaptic function and plasticity. DLG4 interacts with GRIK1, a subunit of kainate receptors, and this interaction has been validated using proximity ligation assays (PLA) (Viard2019Chr21). It also binds to KCNJ6, a potassium channel, and SIPA1L1, a Rap-specific GTPase-activating protein, as well as DSCAM, a protein involved in dendrite arborization and spine formation (Viard2019Chr21).

The GK domain of DLG4 has evolved to function as a protein-protein interaction module, forming extensive interactions with phosphorylated ligands through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Key residues in the phospho-binding site and β5 sheet are crucial for these interactions (Li2020Characterizing). DLG4 also interacts with phosphorylated Lgl2 peptides, with phosphorylation facilitating binding to the GK domain through polar and hydrophobic interactions (Zhu2014Phosphorylationdependent).

DLG4 is involved in the regulation of NMDA receptor activity by binding to the C-terminal of NR2A and NR2B subunits, which is critical for synaptic organization and function (Cheng2010Genetic).
