# RNF128

## Overview
RNF128, also known as GRAIL, is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 128, a type I transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is a member of the PA-TM-RING family and is characterized by its distinct domain structure, which includes an N-terminal extracellular Protease Associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic RING-H2 finger domain. The RING finger protein 128 plays a crucial role in immune regulation by modulating T-cell activation and tolerance through its ubiquitination activity, which targets specific transmembrane proteins for degradation. This function is vital for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive T-cell activation. Additionally, RNF128 is involved in various cellular signaling pathways and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lebensohn2022Receptor; Lineberry2008The; Liu2023RNF128).

## Structure
RNF128, also known as GRAIL, is a member of the PA-TM-RING family of transmembrane RING finger proteins. It is characterized by a domain structure that includes an N-terminal extracellular Protease Associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane (TM) helix, and a cytoplasmic RING-H2 finger domain (Nakamura2011The; Lebensohn2022Receptor). The PA domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, facilitating the recognition and binding to substrate proteins, such as CD154/CD40L and CD83, which are crucial for its function in immune regulation (Nakamura2011The; Lebensohn2022Receptor).

The RING domain of RNF128 is responsible for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is essential for the ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of target proteins involved in T-cell activation (Lebensohn2022Receptor). Although the specific molecular structure of the RING domain has not been solved, it is similar to that of RNF12 (Lebensohn2022Receptor). RNF128 is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which may influence its activity and function (Liu2023RNF128). The protein may have splice variant isoforms, which could affect its functional properties (Liu2023RNF128).

## Function
RNF128, also known as GRAIL, is a type I transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in immune regulation by modulating T-cell activation and tolerance. It is involved in the ubiquitination of transmembrane proteins, a process that tags these proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This activity is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing overactivation of T-cells (Lebensohn2022Receptor; Lineberry2008The).

RNF128 contains a cytosolic RING finger domain responsible for its ubiquitination function and a luminal protease-associated (PA) domain that binds to the extracellular portions of transmembrane proteins, such as members of the tetraspanin family (CD151 and CD81). This binding facilitates their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Lineberry2008The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum, influencing cellular signaling pathways (Lineberry2008The).

In T cells, RNF128 expression is upregulated during anergy induction, inhibiting T cell proliferation and cytokine production by blocking co-stimulatory signaling. This involves the downregulation of cell-surface proteins such as CD154, CD83, CD81, CD151, RhoGDI, and CD3ζ, which are crucial for T cell activation and differentiation (Nakamura2011The). RNF128 also plays a role in antiviral responses by enhancing IFN-β production, which is critical for innate immunity (Cai2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNF128 gene, also known as Grail, have been implicated in various cancers and inflammatory conditions. In urothelial carcinoma (UC), particularly in the upper urinary tract (UTUC) and urinary bladder (UBUC), downregulation of RNF128 is associated with advanced tumor stages, high histological grades, and poor patient outcomes. This downregulation correlates with increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis, making RNF128 a potential prognostic marker for UC (Lee2016Downregulation).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RNF128 is overexpressed, promoting malignant behaviors such as increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. This overexpression is linked to the activation of the EGFR/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, contributing to HCC progression and poor prognosis (Bai2020&lt; RNF128; p&gt).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), RNF128 is also highly expressed, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This suggests that RNF128 may promote CRC progression by inhibiting the Hippo signaling pathway, contrary to previous reports suggesting its downregulation in CRC (Ning2022Ring).

RNF128 also plays a protective role in acute lung injury (ALI) by regulating neutrophil infiltration and myeloperoxidase functions, reducing inflammation and lung damage (Liu2023RNF128).

## Interactions
RNF128, also known as Grail, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing multiple signaling pathways. It interacts specifically with the IL-3 receptor alpha subunit (IL-3Rα), facilitating its K27-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the lysosomal pathway. This interaction is crucial for the negative regulation of the IL-3/STAT5 signaling pathway (Yu2024E3).

In melanoma, RNF128 interacts with CD44 and CTTN, promoting their degradation through ubiquitination. This interaction is significant in modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which affects cellular processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness (Wei2019Downregulation).

RNF128 also interacts with components of the Hippo signaling pathway in colorectal cancer, particularly with MST, promoting its degradation and thereby influencing the pathway's activity (Ning2022Ring).

In the context of acute lung injury, RNF128 interacts with TLR4, promoting its degradation and reducing NF-κB signaling. It also binds to myeloperoxidase (MPO), regulating its levels and activity, which is relevant for controlling inflammation and immune responses (Liu2023RNF128).
