# ZFYVE16

## Overview
ZFYVE16 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger FYVE-type containing 16, commonly referred to as endofin. Endofin is characterized by the presence of a FYVE domain, which is crucial for its role in binding phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) on endosomal membranes. This binding is integral to its function in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. As a phosphoprotein, endofin is involved in several cellular signaling pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway, where it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF stimulation (Chen2007Phosphoproteomics). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as ANKFY1 and HGS, further underscore its role in modulating receptor trafficking and signaling. Additionally, endofin is implicated in the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway, which is essential for iron homeostasis, highlighting its clinical significance in iron-related disorders (Goh2015Endofin).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the ZFYVE16 gene, which encodes the protein endofin, have been implicated in various diseases due to its role in the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for the regulation of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin, which is essential for maintaining iron homeostasis. Alterations in endofin can lead to mislocalization and impaired function, potentially affecting hepcidin expression and contributing to iron-related disorders (Goh2015Endofin).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FYVE domain of endofin can disrupt its localization to endosomes, leading to diffused cytoplasmic localization and impaired SMAD trafficking. This mislocalization can attenuate BMP signaling, which is central to iron regulation, and may act as a genetic modifier in conditions such as iron overload caused by HFE C282Y mutations (Goh2015Endofin).

Endofin is also involved in other signaling pathways, including MAPK and TGFβ-SMAD pathways. Mutations in endofin have been associated with diseases like psoriasis, although genome-wide association studies have not linked endofin SNPs to alterations in iron parameters (Goh2015Endofin). Understanding the role of endofin in these pathways could aid in managing iron-related disorders (Goh2015Endofin).

## Interactions
ZFYVE16, also known as endofin, is a protein that participates in various interactions crucial for cellular processes. It contains a FYVE domain, which allows it to bind phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) on endosomal membranes, playing a significant role in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. ZFYVE16 is involved in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, where it is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF stimulation. This phosphorylation is necessary for its regulation and suggests its involvement in EGF signaling pathways (Chen2007Phosphoproteomics).

ZFYVE16 interacts with other proteins such as ANKFY1, HGS, EEA1, ZFYVE9, and ZFYVE20 during EGFR endocytosis and endosomal sorting. These interactions are dynamic, with ZFYVE16 and associated proteins appearing and peaking shortly after EGF treatment, then dissociating from EGFR within two hours (Chen2019A). The protein's localization and function are influenced by EGFR activity, as demonstrated by its punctate cytosolic signals in the presence of EGF, which are disrupted by the EGFR inhibitor Iressa (Chen2007Phosphoproteomics).

These interactions highlight ZFYVE16's role in modulating receptor trafficking and signaling, contributing to its function in cellular signaling pathways.
