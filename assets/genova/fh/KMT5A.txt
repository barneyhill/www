# KMT5A

## Overview
KMT5A, also known as SETD8, is a gene that encodes the protein lysine methyltransferase 5A, a member of the lysine methyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily responsible for the monomethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me1), a post-translational modification critical for various cellular processes, including DNA repair, chromatin structure regulation, and cell cycle progression (Beck2012PRSet7; Kohi2022Biological). The protein's activity is tightly regulated throughout the cell cycle, with its expression peaking during the G2/M phases and being degraded at the G1/S transition, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Beck2012PRSet7; Milite2016The). KMT5A's interactions with other proteins, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and DDX21, further underscore its role in DNA replication and nucleolar functions (Qin2013Proteome). Dysregulation of KMT5A expression has been linked to the progression and metastasis of various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Yu2022KMT5Amethylated; Lin2019KMT5A).

## Structure
KMT5A, also known as SETD8, is a lysine methyltransferase that specifically monomethylates histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me1). The primary structure of KMT5A includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with significant sequence identity shared with other SET domain methyltransferases (Crain2022Distinct). The secondary structure of KMT5A features a SET domain composed of a 3_10 helix and 12 β-strands arranged into four antiparallel β-sheets and a single parallel β-sheet (Couture2005Structural). An α-helix, known as the iSET region, is inserted between two β-strands and plays a key role in substrate specificity (Couture2005Structural).

The tertiary structure of KMT5A involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, with the SET domain being crucial for its enzymatic activity. The active site contains two tyrosine residues, Tyr-245 and Tyr-334, which are essential for stabilizing the monomethylation state of Lys-20 (Couture2005Structural). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the context provided.

KMT5A may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which is significant for its function during the cell cycle (Couture2005Structural). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context provided.

## Function
KMT5A, also known as lysine methyltransferase 5A, is a crucial enzyme in healthy human cells responsible for the monomethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me1). This modification is essential for several cellular processes, including DNA repair, chromatin structure regulation, and cell cycle progression (Beck2012PRSet7; Kohi2022Biological). KMT5A plays a direct role in maintaining genome integrity by facilitating the DNA damage response (DDR) and recruiting DNA repair proteins such as 53BP1 and BRCA1, which are involved in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways, respectively (Beck2012PRSet7; Kohi2022Biological).

KMT5A's activity is regulated throughout the cell cycle, with its expression peaking during the G2/M phases and being degraded at the G1/S transition. This regulation is crucial for proper cell cycle progression and chromatin condensation (Beck2012PRSet7; Milite2016The). The enzyme also interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), facilitating its recruitment to DNA damage sites and replication, highlighting its role in DNA replication processes (Beck2012PRSet7; Oda2009Monomethylation). The absence of KMT5A leads to increased DNA double-strand breaks and defects in the G1-S transition, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis (Kohi2022Biological).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KMT5A gene have been implicated in the progression and metastasis of several cancers. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high levels of KMT5A expression are associated with shorter overall survival times. KMT5A promotes metastasis by downregulating cadherin-1 (CDH1), a key factor in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is linked to cancer metastasis. The combination of high KMT5A and low CDH1 expression serves as a prognostic indicator for poor outcomes in ccRCC patients (Lin2019KMT5A).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), KMT5A is involved in metastasis through the methylation of SNIP1, which activates the YAP signaling pathway. This activation promotes the formation of the c-MYC/KAT2A complex, enhancing MARK4 expression and inhibiting the Hippo kinase cascade, contributing to cancer progression and poor prognosis (Yu2022KMT5Amethylated).

KMT5A also plays a role in chemoresistance in breast cancer by inhibiting the expression of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) through the methylation of TWIST1, affecting glucose metabolism and cell cycle regulation (Peng2024Inhibition).

## Interactions
KMT5A, also known as SET8, is a lysine methyltransferase that interacts with various proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), KMT5A interacts with Smad nuclear-interacting protein 1 (SNIP1) and methylates it at lysine 301 (K301). This methylation event is crucial for promoting cancer cell growth and metastasis by facilitating the release of histone acetyltransferase KAT2A and forming a complex with c-MYC, which is recruited to the promoters of c-MYC target genes (Yu2022KMT5Amethylated). 

KMT5A also interacts with the androgen receptor in castration-resistant prostate cancer, regulating the cell cycle protein CDC20 through chromatin-level histone methylation and the methylation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Alebady2023CDC20). In diabetic nephropathy, KMT5A forms a complex with CREB to modulate PTP1B expression, affecting NF-κB activity and cytokine expression (Huang2021The). 

Additionally, KMT5A interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and DDX21, a nucleolar protein involved in RNA processing, suggesting roles in DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and nucleolar functions (Qin2013Proteome).
