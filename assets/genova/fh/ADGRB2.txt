# ADGRB2

## Overview
ADGRB2, also known as BAI2, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B2, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its large extracellular region, which includes several domains such as the CUB, thrombospondin, hormone receptor, and GPCR Autoproteolysis Inducing (GAIN) domains, the latter being crucial for receptor activation (Pohl2023Structural). ADGRB2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a vital role in synaptic function and neurodevelopmental processes. The receptor is involved in cell signaling, particularly through its interaction with G proteins, and has been implicated in various neurological conditions due to mutations that affect its signaling pathways (Purcell2017A; Morgan2019The). The study of ADGRB2 and its encoded protein provides insights into complex cellular processes and potential therapeutic targets for neurological and psychiatric disorders (Folts2019Adhesion).

## Structure
The ADGRB2 protein, also known as BAI2, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. It features a large extracellular region (ECR) that includes a CUB domain, four thrombospondin (TSP) domains, a hormone receptor (HormR) domain, and a GPCR Autoproteolysis Inducing (GAIN) domain (Pohl2023Structural). The GAIN domain is crucial for the activation of ADGRB2, containing an agonistic sequence known as Stachel, which interacts with the seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain (Pohl2023Structural).

The GAIN domain of ADGRB2 is resistant to autoproteolysis at the GPCR proteolysis site (GPS), despite having a canonical HLS sequence motif. This resistance is attributed to the absence of certain structural features that would otherwise facilitate autoproteolytic activity (Pohl2023Structural). The crystal structure of the HormR-GAIN domains reveals that the GPS is located at the bottom of a groove flanked by flexible flaps, with the S912 nucleophile and H910 base not positioned to initiate cleavage (Pohl2023Structural).

ADGRB2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at residues N560, N645, and N867 (Pohl2023Structural). The protein can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and localization (Kuhn2024The).

## Function
ADGRB2, also known as BAI2, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, primarily expressed in the brain. It plays a significant role in synaptic function and neurodevelopmental processes. ADGRB2 is involved in cell signaling, particularly through its interaction with G proteins. It preferentially couples with the Gα z protein, and a mutation in ADGRB2 can enhance its signaling activity by increasing coupling to both Gα z and Gα i proteins (Purcell2017A; Morgan2019The).

The receptor's signaling is regulated by its N-terminal fragment (NTF), which inhibits constitutive signaling activity. Removal of the NTF results in a constitutively active receptor, indicating its regulatory role in receptor activation (Purcell2017A). ADGRB2 also interacts with nuclear proteins, suggesting a role in gene regulation and transcriptional activities. It may act as a transcription factor in the nucleus, influencing pathways such as Wnt signaling by targeting β-catenin (Knapp2019Affinity).

In terms of cellular localization, ADGRB2 is associated with synaptic and intracellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-associated membranes, indicating its involvement in complex cellular processes beyond traditional signaling roles (Knapp2019Affinity).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADGRB2 gene, also known as BAI2, have been implicated in several neurological conditions. A notable mutation, p.R1465W, is associated with progressive spastic paraparesis, a condition characterized by gait difficulties, urinary urgency, optic nerve atrophy, nystagmus, and severe weakness and spasticity in the lower extremities, leading to total disability. This mutation increases the receptor's signaling activity and surface expression, disrupting its interaction with the endocytic protein endophilin A1, which may affect receptor internalization and signaling (Purcell2017A).

The p.R1465W mutation enhances coupling to Gα i/o-family proteins, altering the receptor's normal signaling pathways. This gain-of-function mutation is almost entirely dependent on Gβγ-mediated signaling, which may contribute to the observed pathology (Purcell2017A). Additionally, ADGRB2 is associated with chronic kidney disease, with expression level changes noted in various conditions (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion).

These findings suggest that ADGRB2 mutations and expression alterations can have significant clinical consequences, potentially offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention in related neurological and psychiatric disorders (Folts2019Adhesion; Morgan2019The).

## Interactions
ADGRB2, also known as BAI2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its signaling and regulatory functions. It interacts with β-arrestins, which are crucial for GPCR internalization and desensitization, although the R1465W mutation in ADGRB2 does not affect this interaction (Purcell2017A). ADGRB2 also interacts with endophilin A1, a protein involved in GPCR internalization. The wild-type ADGRB2 robustly interacts with the SH3 domain of endophilin A1, but this interaction is significantly reduced in the R1465W mutant. Despite this reduction, overexpression of endophilin A1 can inhibit the signaling activity of both wild-type and mutant ADGRB2, indicating that endophilin A1 is a significant regulator of ADGRB2 signaling (Purcell2017A).

ADGRB2 is noted for its preferential coupling to Gα z proteins, and the R1465W mutation enhances its coupling to Gα i/o-family proteins, particularly Gα z and Gα i (Morgan2019The; Purcell2017A). The mutation increases receptor signaling activity and surface expression, mediated by Gβγ subunits and involving Gαz, with RGS20 paradoxically increasing signaling (Purcell2017A). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of ADGRB2 and its role in cellular signaling pathways.
