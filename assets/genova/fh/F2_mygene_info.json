This protein is proteolytically cleaved in multiple steps to form the activated serine protease thrombin. The activated thrombin enzyme plays an important role in thrombosis and hemostasis by converting fibrinogen to fibrin during blood clot formation, by stimulating platelet aggregation, and by activating additional coagulation factors. Thrombin also plays a role in cell proliferation, tissue repair, and angiogenesis as well as maintaining vascular integrity during development and postnatal life. Peptides derived from the C-terminus of this protein have antimicrobial activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Mutations in this gene lead to various forms of thrombosis and dysprothrombinemia. Rapid increases in cytokine levels following coronavirus infections can dysregulate the coagulation cascade and produce thrombosis, compromised blood supply, and organ failure.
