# DEFB105A

## Overview
DEFB105A is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 105A, a member of the beta-defensin family known for its antimicrobial properties. This protein is categorized as a small cationic peptide and plays a significant role in the innate immune system by disrupting the membrane integrity of various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses (Semple2003Duplication). The DEFB105A gene is characterized by a unique genomic structure, differing from typical beta-defensin genes, and is predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a specialized function in the male reproductive tract (Pazgier2006Human; Semple2003Duplication). The protein's structure includes a conserved arrangement of cysteine residues, which are crucial for forming disulfide bonds that stabilize its configuration (Pazgier2006Human). DEFB105A's involvement in immune response modulation and its potential role in linking innate and adaptive immunity underscore its importance in both health and disease contexts (Semple2003Duplication).

## Structure
The DEFB105A gene encodes a protein that is part of the β-defensin family, known for their antimicrobial properties. The primary structure of DEFB105A includes a conserved arrangement of cysteine residues, which are crucial for forming disulfide bonds that stabilize the protein's structure (Pazgier2006Human). Unlike typical β-defensin genes, DEFB105A has a unique genomic structure with three exons and two introns, as opposed to the usual two exons and one intron (Pazgier2006Human).

The secondary structure of β-defensins, including DEFB105A, is characterized by three β-strands arranged in an antiparallel sheet, constrained by disulfide bridges, and flanked by an α-helical segment (Pazgier2006Human). This configuration contributes to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure features a 'defensin-like' topological fold, with a core consisting of three β-strands and an α-helix, stabilized by disulfide bridges (Pazgier2006Human).

DEFB105A is expressed predominantly in the testis, suggesting a specialized role in the male reproductive tract (Semple2003Duplication). The presence of an additional cysteine residue at the amino-terminal end of DEFB105A, compared to DEFB104, may have functional implications (Semple2003Duplication).

## Function
DEFB105A encodes a protein that is part of the beta-defensin family, which plays a crucial role in the innate immune system. These proteins are small cationic peptides known for their antimicrobial activity against a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They function primarily by disrupting the membrane integrity of these pathogens, thereby neutralizing them (Semple2003Duplication). DEFB105A, like other beta-defensins, is expressed in epithelial cells and is involved in the body's first line of defense against microbial infections (Semple2003Duplication).

The protein encoded by DEFB105A is noted for having an extra cysteine residue and an unusually long propiece peptide region, which may have important functional consequences (Semple2003Duplication). DEFB105A is expressed predominantly in the testes, suggesting a role in the male reproductive tract's innate defense mechanism (Semple2003Duplication). The gene's expression pattern and potential involvement in linking innate and adaptive immune responses indicate that DEFB105A may have roles beyond antimicrobial activity, although specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed (Semple2003Duplication).

## Clinical Significance
DEFB105A, a member of the beta-defensin family, is implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in immune response modulation. Alterations in DEFB105A, such as copy number variations and mutations, have been associated with cancer. Specifically, homozygous deletions of DEFB105A are observed in several cancer types, including lung cancer, where these deletions may contribute to tumor progression by affecting immune-related pathways and reducing patient survival (Ye2017Prevailing). The gene is located in a region frequently deleted in stage I squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, suggesting its potential involvement in early tumorigenesis (KANG2014Genomic).

In non-African populations, a variant in DEFB105 disrupts a cysteine essential for protein function, although the exact functional consequences remain unclear (Forni2015Determining). This variant may not be subject to strong negative selection, particularly in multicopy genes where variants with little or no function can persist (Forni2015Determining). The presence of such genetic variations highlights the potential role of DEFB105A in influencing susceptibility to diseases, particularly those involving immune system dysregulation.
