# HDAC5

## Overview
Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) is a gene that encodes the protein histone deacetylase 5, a member of the class IIa histone deacetylases. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its enzymatic activity, which removes acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression (Elmezayen2020Homology; RUIJTER2003Histone). HDAC5 is characterized by its complex structure, including a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal region that facilitates interactions with transcription factors and other proteins (Backs2008Histone). It plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis, hematopoietic stem cell regulation, and cancer progression, through its ability to modulate gene expression and interact with other proteins (Huang2018Neutralizing; Urbich2009HDAC5). The protein's activity and localization are regulated by phosphorylation, which influences its interactions and functional dynamics (Greco2011Nuclear; Guise2014Probing).

## Structure
Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) is a class IIa histone deacetylase with a complex molecular structure. The protein contains a C-terminal catalytic domain responsible for its deacetylase activity, which is crucial for chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Elmezayen2020Homology; RUIJTER2003Histone). The N-terminal region of HDAC5 includes binding domains for transcription factors such as myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and 14-3-3 proteins, which are involved in its regulatory functions (RUIJTER2003Histone).

HDAC5 features a nuclear localization signal (NLS) near the N-terminus and a nuclear export signal (NES) within the catalytic domain, facilitating its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (RUIJTER2003Histone). The protein also contains a coiled-coil domain that enables oligomerization with other HDACs, such as HDAC4, which is important for its function and regulation (Backs2008Histone).

Phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification of HDAC5, affecting its localization and interactions. Key phosphorylation sites include Ser611 and Ser1108, which are conserved among mammalian orthologues and influence HDAC5's interactions and structural conformation (Greco2011Nuclear; Guise2014Probing). These modifications are critical for HDAC5's regulatory mechanisms and its role in cellular processes (Greco2011Nuclear).

## Function
HDAC5 (histone deacetylase 5) is a class IIa histone deacetylase that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression by removing acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. In endothelial cells, HDAC5 acts as a repressor of angiogenesis by controlling the expression of proangiogenic factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and Slit2. Silencing HDAC5 results in increased expression and secretion of these factors, enhancing capillary-like sprout formation and endothelial cell migration (Urbich2009HDAC5). HDAC5's antiangiogenic activity is independent of its deacetylase activity and requires its nuclear localization, where it binds to the promoters of angiogenic genes to repress their expression (Urbich2009HDAC5).

In hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), HDAC5 negatively regulates the expression of the CXCR4 receptor, which is crucial for HSC homing and engraftment. Inhibition of HDAC5 enhances CXCR4 expression, promoting chemotaxis towards the chemokine SDF-1 and improving HSC migration and engraftment in the bone marrow (Huang2018Neutralizing). This regulation involves increased acetylation of histones at the CXCR4 promoter, facilitating transcription (Huang2018Neutralizing). HDAC5's activity is linked to the NF-κB signaling pathway, where it modulates CXCR4 expression through interactions with acetylated p65, a subunit of NF-κB (Huang2018Neutralizing).

## Clinical Significance
HDAC5 (histone deacetylase 5) is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In medulloblastoma, HDAC5 is overrepresented in high-risk patients, correlating with poor survival outcomes. Knockdown of HDAC5 in these cancer cells promotes cell death, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear (BarnedaZahonero2012Histone). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HDAC5 overexpression is linked to copy number gains, and treatment with the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat has shown effectiveness in preclinical models, highlighting its role in HCC progression (BarnedaZahonero2012Histone). In pancreatic cancer, HDAC5 regulates PTEN expression, which is crucial for cancer cell growth and proliferation (BarnedaZahonero2012Histone).

HDAC5 is also associated with the invasive and metastatic characteristics of gastric cancer, where it represses p14 in conjunction with TBX3, promoting cell proliferation (BarnedaZahonero2012Histone). In colorectal cancer, HDAC5 expression is upregulated compared to other cancers like renal, bladder, and breast cancer (Witt2009HDAC). These findings suggest that HDAC5 plays a significant role in cancer cell growth and proliferation across various cancer types.

## Interactions
Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its function and localization. HDAC5 interacts with HDAC3, forming a multiprotein complex essential for its enzymatic activity. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal domain of HDAC5 and is crucial for its association with the SMRT/N-CoR-HDAC3 complex, which is necessary for HDAC activity (Fischle2002Enzymatic).

HDAC5 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which sequester it in the cytoplasm through phosphorylation-dependent binding. This interaction prevents HDAC5 from repressing transcription in the nucleus. Upon dephosphorylation, HDAC5 translocates to the nucleus, where it can bind to HDAC3 and MEF2, repressing MEF2-dependent gene expression (Grozinger2000Regulation).

In the context of breast cancer, HDAC5 interacts with lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), stabilizing LSD1 protein and influencing chromatin modification. This interaction is mediated by the nuclear localization sequence of HDAC5 and is crucial for its role in promoting breast cancer progression (Cao2016Functional).

HDAC5 also forms oligomers with HDAC4, facilitating nuclear export in response to CaMKII signaling. This interaction is mediated by an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and is essential for the formation of a complex with CaMKII (Backs2008Histone).
