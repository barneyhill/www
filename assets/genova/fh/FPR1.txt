# FPR1

## Overview
The FPR1 gene encodes the formyl peptide receptor 1, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to the immune system's response to infection and cellular damage. This receptor is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, where it plays a pivotal role in detecting N-formylated peptides from bacterial sources and mitochondrial proteins from damaged cells. Upon activation, FPR1 mediates chemotaxis and initiates antimicrobial responses, such as phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species production, thereby contributing to the body's innate immune defense (Gemperle2012Regulation; Ye2009International). The receptor's function is modulated by its interaction with G proteins and is subject to regulation through phosphorylation, which influences its desensitization and internalization (Ye2009International). FPR1's involvement in immune responses and its clinical significance in inflammatory diseases and cancer underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Vacchelli2015Chemotherapyinduced; Bhattacharya2006Analysis).

## Structure
The human formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven transmembrane helix bundle, typical of GPCRs (Yuan2012The). The primary structure of FPR1 includes specific amino acid residues that form a well-defined binding pocket. This pocket is composed of positively charged residues such as Arg84, Lys85, Arg201, and Arg205, and negatively charged residues like Asp284 and Asp106, separated by hydrophobic residues (Yuan2012The; Minopoli2019Structurefunction).

The secondary structure of FPR1 features seven transmembrane helices and a cytosol helix H8, with a β-hairpin loop between TM4 and TM5 (Yuan2012The). The tertiary structure includes a disordered N-terminal segment, seven transmembrane helices with three extracellular and three cytoplasmic loops, and a C-terminal region with three short helices (Minopoli2019Structurefunction). The extracellular loop 2 contains two short β-strands (Minopoli2019Structurefunction).

FPR1's quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, as it is part of the GPCR family, which often forms dimers or higher-order oligomers. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are common in GPCRs, although specific modifications for FPR1 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
FPR1 (formyl peptide receptor 1) is a G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in differentiated myeloid cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. It plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by recognizing N-formylated peptides, which are characteristic of bacterial protein synthesis, and mitochondrial proteins from damaged cells (Gemperle2012Regulation; Ye2009International). Upon binding these peptides, FPR1 mediates chemotaxis, directing immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation, and activates antimicrobial mechanisms like phagocytosis and superoxide production (Ye2009International).

FPR1 is involved in the activation of signaling pathways crucial for the microbicidal functions of phagocytes, including NADPH oxidase activation, which is important for the production of reactive oxygen species used to kill pathogens (Ye2009International). The receptor's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its internalization and desensitization, modulating its interaction with β-arrestins and G proteins (Ye2009International). FPR1's ability to detect formyl peptides from both bacterial and mammalian origins highlights its role in immune responses and potential involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ye2009International).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FPR1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in inflammatory diseases and cancer. The p.I11T variant of FPR1 is associated with increased inflammatory responses, as indicated by elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other inflammatory markers. This variant leads to agonist-independent β-arrestin association, which may increase the risk of diseases linked to inflammation, such as cardiovascular conditions (Bhattacharya2006Analysis).

In cancer, FPR1 expression is crucial for effective chemotherapy-induced antitumor immunity. Loss-of-function mutations, such as the SNP rs867228, correlate with poor prognosis and reduced survival in breast and colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. This SNP affects FPR1 signaling, impairing immunosurveillance and leading to earlier cancer diagnosis (Weiß2018FormylPeptide; Sztupinszki2021A; Vacchelli2015Chemotherapyinduced).

FPR1 mutations are also linked to aggressive periodontitis, with specific polymorphisms associated with altered receptor function and increased disease susceptibility. These genetic variations can affect FPR1 expression levels and enhancer activity, contributing to the pathogenesis of periodontitis (Gunji2007Functional).

## Interactions
Formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with G proteins to mediate signal transduction. FPR1 can exist in different oligomerization states, with large oligomers forming the most stable complexes with G proteins upon ligand binding. These interactions are crucial for efficient signal transduction, as ligand-bound FPR1 exhibits a higher affinity for G proteins, leading to prolonged interaction durations (Nishiguchi2020Synergetic). The interaction between FPR1 and G proteins is transient, with ligand binding increasing the stability and duration of these interactions. This is particularly evident in the interaction with the Gαi3 protein, where ligand-bound large oligomers of FPR1 show the longest interaction durations, indicating their role as potent activators of Gαi3 (Nishiguchi2020Synergetic).

The oligomerization and interaction dynamics of FPR1 are influenced by cellular components such as actin filaments, dynamin-dependent endocytosis, and cholesterol, which help shift the equilibrium towards large oligomers. These interactions are essential for the receptor's high-affinity state and effective G protein coupling, integrating and modulating ligand signals within the cell (Nishiguchi2020Synergetic).
