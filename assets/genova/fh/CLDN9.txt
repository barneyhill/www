# CLDN9

## Overview
The CLDN9 gene encodes claudin 9, a tetraspan transmembrane protein that is a member of the claudin family, which plays a crucial role in the formation and function of tight junctions in epithelial cells. Claudin 9 is integral to maintaining ion permeability barriers, particularly in the cochlea, where it is essential for normal auditory function by regulating the movement of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions. This regulation is vital for preserving the ionic composition of the endolymph, a fluid necessary for hair cell function and hearing (Nakano2009A). Beyond its role in the auditory system, claudin 9 is also involved in the entry of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) into host cells, acting as a coreceptor in viral infection processes (Zheng2007Claudin6). Mutations in the CLDN9 gene have been linked to non-syndromic deafness and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Katoh2024Claudin; Seker2019Mouse).

## Structure
Claudin 9 (CLDN9) is a tetraspan membrane protein that is part of the PMP22/EMP/MP20/claudin superfamily. It typically ranges from 20 to 34 kDa, with most claudins being about 22 to 24 kDa. The protein is characterized by four transmembrane helices, with both the amino and carboxy terminal tails extending into the cytoplasm. The structure includes a short intracellular cytoplasmic amino-terminal sequence, a large extracellular loop (EL1), a short intracellular loop, another extracellular loop (EL2), and a carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The first and fourth transmembrane regions are highly conserved, while the second and third are more diverse. The first extracellular loop contains charged amino acids that influence paracellular charge selectivity and two conserved cysteine residues that may form a disulfide bond for stability. The second extracellular loop can form dimers with claudins on opposing cell membranes. The carboxy-terminal tail contains a PDZ-domain-binding motif for interaction with cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins and is subject to post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and palmitoylation, affecting localization and function (LalNag2009The). CLDN9 is expressed in the inner ear, liver, and kidney, and functions as a barrier to potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) (Seker2019Mouse).

## Function
Claudin-9, encoded by the CLDN9 gene, is a critical component of tight junctions in epithelial cells, playing a vital role in maintaining ion permeability barriers. In the cochlea, claudin-9 is essential for normal auditory function by forming a paracellular ion permeability barrier that regulates the movement of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions. This barrier is crucial for maintaining the ionic composition of the endolymph, a fluid necessary for hair cell function and hearing (Nakano2009A). 

Claudin-9 is localized to specific subdomains within tight junctions, indicating its role in forming ion barriers that protect the basolateral side of hair cells from the potassium-rich endolymph (Nakano2009A). The protein's function is particularly vital in the cochlea, where its deficiency leads to elevated potassium levels in the perilymph, resulting in hair-cell degeneration and impaired hearing (Nakano2009A). 

In addition to its role in the cochlea, claudin-9 is expressed in other tissues, including the vestibular system, liver, and kidney, although its ion barrier function is specifically critical in the cochlea (Nakano2009A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CLDN9 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. Germline mutations in CLDN9 are associated with non-syndromic deafness, a form of hearing loss that occurs without other associated symptoms. This condition is linked to a specific mutation, a truncated variant of claudin-9 (p.L29fs), which affects the ion composition in the inner ear, leading to hearing impairment (Katoh2024Claudin; Seker2019Mouse).

Altered expression levels of CLDN9 have been implicated in various cancers. Increased expression of CLDN9 is associated with gastric cancer, where it promotes cell proliferation and migration, contributing to lung metastasis. Conversely, decreased RNA expression levels of CLDN9 are observed in cervical carcinoma (Seker2019Mouse). In colon adenocarcinoma, CLDN9 expression is negatively correlated with immune signatures, suggesting a role in modulating the immune environment in this cancer type (Alghamdi2023Identification).

Additionally, a variant of CLDN9, p.S3L, has been identified in patients with neural tube defects (NTDs). Although this variant does not affect the protein's localization to tight junctions, it is predicted to potentially impact protein function (Baumholtz2020Functional).

## Interactions
Claudin 9 (CLDN9) is involved in the entry of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) into host cells, functioning as a coreceptor alongside other claudins. CLDN9 can mediate HCV entry in the absence of CLDN1, highlighting its role in viral infection processes (Zheng2007Claudin6). The protein's ability to facilitate HCV entry is linked to specific amino acid residues, notably N38 and V45, in its first extracellular loop, which are crucial for interaction with HCV particles (Zheng2007Claudin6). 

CLDN9 shares sequence homology with CLDN1 in the CD81-interacting region, suggesting a potential for similar interactions in the context of HCV entry (Colpitts2016Claudins). Despite its role in HCV infection, the expression of CLDN9 is primarily in non-hepatic tissues, and its low expression in primary human hepatocytes suggests it is not a major entry factor for HCV in most patients (Colpitts2016Claudins). 

While CLDN9's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its role in HCV entry are not detailed, its involvement in viral entry mechanisms indicates its participation in complex interactions with viral components and possibly other host cell factors (Zheng2007Claudin6).
