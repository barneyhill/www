# HNRNPUL2

## Overview
HNRNPUL2 is a gene that encodes the protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like 2, which is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family. These proteins are primarily involved in the processing of pre-mRNA in the nucleus, including mRNA transport, stability, and splicing. HNRNPUL2 has been implicated in various cellular processes, such as RNA processing and DNA repair, through its interactions with other molecules, including long noncoding RNAs and components of the DNA damage response machinery. The protein's role in stabilizing specific RNAs and its involvement in signaling pathways highlight its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease. Notably, HNRNPUL2 is associated with cancer progression and prognosis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Jiang2017Long; Alsagaby2019Transcriptomicsbased).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The HNRNPUL2 gene has significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. Increased expression of HNRNPUL2 is associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancer, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), liver hepatocellular carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, prostate adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and bladder urothelial carcinoma. In these cancers, elevated HNRNPUL2 expression correlates with shorter overall survival and early relapse, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Alsagaby2019Transcriptomicsbased).

In CLL, HNRNPUL2 is implicated in alternative splicing processes that favor the survival of malignant cells. Its increased expression is linked to aggressive disease forms, highlighting its potential as a marker for disease aggressiveness (Alsagaby2019Transcriptomicsbased).

In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), HNRNPUL2 interacts with the long noncoding RNA CRNDE, stabilizing it and promoting its cytoplasmic accumulation. This interaction activates the Ras/MAPK signaling pathways, contributing to CRC cell proliferation and migration. The CRNDE-HNRNPUL2 interaction forms a feedback loop that enhances CRNDE stability, suggesting a role in CRC tumorigenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Jiang2017Long).

## Interactions
HNRNPUL2, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family, is involved in various RNA processing activities, including mRNA transport and stability. In colorectal carcinoma cells, HNRNPUL2 physically interacts with the long noncoding RNA CRNDE. This interaction is confirmed through RNA pull-down assays, mass spectrometry, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. The binding of CRNDE to HNRNPUL2 does not alter the expression levels of HNRNPUL2 but affects its subcellular localization, leading to increased cytoplasmic accumulation of HNRNPUL2. This cytoplasmic presence of HNRNPUL2 stabilizes CRNDE RNA, reducing its degradation and thereby enhancing its stability (Jiang2017Long).

HNRNPUL2 is also known to interact with NBS1, a component of the DNA double-strand break sensor complex, indicating its involvement in DNA repair processes (Jiang2017Long). While the study primarily focuses on the interaction between HNRNPUL2 and CRNDE, it suggests that HNRNPUL2, like other hnRNP proteins, may participate in broader interactions with various lncRNAs, influencing their functions and stability (Jiang2017Long). However, specific details on other protein or nucleic acid interactions of HNRNPUL2 beyond CRNDE are not provided in the context.
