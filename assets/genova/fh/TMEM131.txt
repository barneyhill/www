# TMEM131

## Overview
TMEM131 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 131, which is a crucial component in the cellular processes of collagen secretion and intracellular transport. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its structural features, including two transmembrane segments and a PapD-like domain. The transmembrane protein 131 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a significant role in the assembly and secretion of type I collagen, a vital structural protein in connective tissues. It interacts with various proteins, such as TRAPPC8 and COL1A2, to facilitate the transport of collagen from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The evolutionary conservation of TMEM131 across species underscores its fundamental role in maintaining cellular function and structure. Additionally, alterations in the TMEM131 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including osteosarcoma and Down syndrome, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2020Broadly; Reimann2014Whole).

## Structure
The TMEM131 protein is part of the highly conserved Pfam12371 (TMEM131_like) protein family and features a complex molecular structure. It includes two transmembrane segments, with the first segment functioning as a signal peptide that directs the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Zhang2020Broadly). The second transmembrane segment spans a hydrophilic domain that faces the ER, endosomal lumen, or extracellular space, while the C-terminal part is predicted to localize in the cytosol (Zhang2020Broadly).

The protein contains a PapD-like domain (PapD-L domain) at the N terminus, which is located in the ER lumen and is involved in procollagen processing. This domain is structurally similar to bacterial PapD chaperone domains, which are involved in the assembly and secretion of extracellular pilus components. The PapD-L domain comprises a two-lobed immunoglobulin fold characteristic of canonical bacterial PapD domains (Zhang2020Broadly). The C-terminal domain of TMEM131 interacts with TRAPPC8, a component of the TRAPP complex, facilitating the ER-to-Golgi transport of collagen cargo (Zhang2020Broadly). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in collagen assembly and secretion.

## Function
TMEM131 is a protein that plays a crucial role in collagen secretion and intracellular transport in human cells. It is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in the assembly and secretion of type I collagen, a major component of connective tissues. TMEM131 interacts with the type I collagen protein COL1A2 through its highly conserved PapD-L domains, which are essential for recruiting premature collagen monomers and promoting their assembly in the ER (Zhang2020Broadly).

The protein also interacts with TRAPPC8, a component of the TRAPP III complex, which is vital for the ER-to-Golgi transport of collagen cargos. The C-terminal domain of TMEM131 binds to TRAPPC8, facilitating the secretion of collagen by promoting the activation of Rab GTPase, a key player in collagen transport (Zhang2020Broadly).

TMEM131's function is evolutionarily conserved across species, including C. elegans and Drosophila, highlighting its fundamental role in maintaining normal cellular function and structure. Its involvement in collagen secretion is critical for healthy tissue structure and function, and it may also have broader roles in the intracellular transport of other secreted proteins (Zhang2020Broadly).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TMEM131 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In osteosarcoma, a homozygous somatic mutation in TMEM131 has been identified in tumor tissue, accompanied by a substantial decrease in mRNA expression compared to normal tissue. This suggests a potential role for TMEM131 in the pathogenesis of this cancer, although further studies are needed to confirm these associations (Reimann2014Whole).

In the context of Down syndrome, TMEM131 is involved in differential methylation, which affects genes related to immune system development. This epigenetic alteration may contribute to the immunodeficiency and autoimmune components observed in Down syndrome, as TMEM131 is noted for marking lymphocyte precursor cells (Do2016TransActing).

TMEM131 is also considered a potential therapeutic target for tissue fibrosis, a condition characterized by excessive collagen deposition. Inhibiting TMEM131 or its interactions with collagen C-propeptide and TRAPPC8 could offer a novel approach to treating fibrosis-related conditions, including systemic sclerosis, chronic inflammatory diseases, and heart failure (Zhang2020Broadly; Zhang2019Broadly). These findings highlight the gene's significance in various pathological conditions, warranting further research into its clinical implications.

## Interactions
TMEM131 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in collagen secretion and intracellular trafficking. One significant interaction is with TRAPPC8, a component of the TRAPP III complex, which is essential for ER-to-Golgi transport of collagen cargos. This interaction occurs through the C-terminal domain of TMEM131, known as TRAPID, and is vital for collagen production in vivo (Zhang2020Broadly; Zhang2019Broadly). The interaction between TMEM131 and TRAPPC8 has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating the importance of specific residues in maintaining this interaction (Zhang2020Broadly).

TMEM131 also interacts with type I collagen protein COL1A2 via its N-terminal PapD-L domains. This interaction is conserved across species, including humans, C. elegans, and Drosophila, and is crucial for collagen recruitment and assembly (Zhang2020Broadly; Zhang2019Broadly). The PapD-L domain of TMEM131 facilitates the assembly of procollagen trimers, promoting their transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Zhang2020Broadly). These interactions highlight TMEM131's role in collagen secretion and its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions involving tissue fibrosis (Zhang2020Broadly).
