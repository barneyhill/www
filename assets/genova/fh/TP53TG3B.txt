# TP53TG3B

## Overview
TP53TG3B is a gene that encodes the protein TP53 target 3B, which is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those related to cancer biology. The protein is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, cell division, and cytoskeleton organization, processes that are frequently altered in cancerous cells (Liu2019Comprehensive). TP53 target 3B has been studied for its role in cancer prognosis, with its expression levels serving as a potential biomarker for patient outcomes in several types of cancer, including uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma (Frankel2014Genome‐wide; Liu2020Prognostic). Additionally, TP53TG3B is located in chromosomal regions with significant copy number aberrations, further linking it to cancer progression and therapeutic strategies (Frankel2014Genome‐wide; Ajore2024Genomewide).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TP53TG3B has been identified as a prognostic gene in various cancers, with its expression levels linked to patient outcomes. In uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), high expression of TP53TG3B is associated with poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression (Liu2020Prognostic; Liu2019Comprehensive). The gene is enriched for terms related to cell cycle, cell division, and cytoskeleton, indicating its involvement in these critical biological processes that are often dysregulated in cancer (Liu2019Comprehensive).

In esophageal adenocarcinoma, TP53TG3B is located in a chromosomal region identified as having significant copy number aberrations, which are correlated with prognosis. This suggests that alterations in TP53TG3B may contribute to the disease's progression and could serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis (Frankel2014Genome‐wide). Additionally, TP53TG3B has been implicated in the regulation of BCMA expression on multiple myeloma cells, which is crucial for the efficacy of certain immunotherapies. This highlights its potential role in therapeutic strategies targeting multiple myeloma (Ajore2024Genomewide).

Overall, TP53TG3B's expression and genetic alterations are significant in the context of cancer prognosis and treatment, warranting further investigation into its clinical applications.
