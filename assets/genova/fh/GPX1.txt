# GPX1

## Overview
The GPX1 gene encodes the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 1, a critical component of the cellular antioxidant defense system. This enzyme belongs to the family of selenoproteins, characterized by the presence of a selenocysteine residue at their active site, which is essential for their catalytic function. Glutathione peroxidase 1 plays a pivotal role in reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and corresponding alcohols, utilizing glutathione as a substrate. This activity is vital for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative damage (Lubos2011Glutathionea; Lei2007Metabolic). The GPX1 protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, making it the most abundant selenoperoxidase in humans. Its function extends beyond antioxidant defense, influencing apoptotic pathways and cellular signaling, thereby impacting processes such as cell proliferation and survival (Lubos2011Glutathionea). The gene's expression and activity are implicated in several diseases, including cardiovascular disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Lubos2011Glutathione; Zhao2022Glutathione).

## Structure
The human GPX1 protein is a tetramer composed of identical subunits, each approximately 202 to 204 amino acids in length, with a molecular mass of around 21,800-21,950 kDa (Lubos2011Glutathione). The primary structure includes a selenocysteine (Sec) residue at the active site, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This Sec is encoded by a UGA stop codon in the gene transcript, a unique feature that requires a specialized translational mechanism involving the SECIS element in mRNA (Lubos2011Glutathione; Lei2007Metabolic).

The secondary structure of GPX1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its compact, globular tertiary structure. The quaternary structure is a homotetramer, which is essential for its function in reducing hydrogen peroxide and other peroxides (Lubos2011Glutathione).

Post-translational modifications of GPX1 include phosphorylation, which can enhance its activity through interactions with tyrosine kinases such as c-Abl and Arg (Lubos2011Glutathione). These modifications and interactions are crucial for regulating GPX1 activity and maintaining cellular redox balance. The presence of splice variant isoforms that may affect its function and localization is not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
Glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1) is a crucial enzyme in the antioxidant defense system of human cells, primarily involved in reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and corresponding alcohols. This reduction process uses glutathione as a substrate, helping to maintain cellular redox balance and protect against oxidative stress (Lubos2011Glutathionea). GPX1 is ubiquitously expressed in almost all tissues, making it the most abundant selenoperoxidase (Lei2007Metabolic).

In healthy cells, GPX1 plays a significant role in modulating intracellular hydrogen peroxide levels, which are important for both protective and apoptotic pathways. By controlling hydrogen peroxide flux, GPX1 influences apoptotic and survival pathways, affecting cellular proliferation and survival (Lubos2011Glutathionea). The enzyme is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes, allowing it to regulate oxidants from multiple sources and influence signaling pathways activated by cytokines, growth factors, or vasoactive substances (Lubos2011Glutathionea).

GPX1 also plays a role in protecting against oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and membrane lipids, thereby preventing mutagenesis and reducing carcinogenic potential (Lubos2011Glutathionea). Its activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing diseases related to oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer (Lubos2011Glutathionea).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPX1 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cardiovascular health, GPX1 activity is inversely correlated with the extent of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular event rates. High GPX1 activity is protective against cardiovascular events, while genetic variations, such as the Pro198Leu polymorphism, are associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular conditions (Lubos2011Glutathione). In cancer, GPX1 plays a complex role, with its expression levels influencing cancer susceptibility and progression. The Pro198Leu polymorphism has been linked to increased breast cancer risk, particularly in postmenopausal women (RavnHaren2005Associations). In renal cell carcinoma, high GPX1 expression is associated with poorer overall survival in certain subtypes, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Chen2020Comprehensive). GPX1's role in cancer is dichotomous, as it can both inhibit apoptosis and promote tumor growth in some cancers, while its depletion can reduce metastasis and tumorigenicity (Zhao2022Glutathione). These findings underscore the importance of GPX1 in disease pathogenesis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence apoptosis and redox signaling pathways. GPX1 interacts with TRAF2, a protein involved in the apoptosis signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for regulating the ASK1-JNK-cFLIP-Caspase-8 pathway, a key apoptotic pathway. Upon TNF-α stimulation, GPX1 binds to the Zn finger domain of TRAF2, which is necessary for the activation of ASK1, leading to sustained JNK activation and the degradation of cFLIP, an inhibitor of caspase-8, thereby promoting apoptosis (Lee2021Glutathione).

GPX1 also plays a role in modulating NFκB activation through its influence on the IKK complex, specifically the IKKa subunit. GPX1 expression affects the serine phosphorylation of IκBα, a process crucial for NFκB activation. Overexpression of GPX1 was found to specifically inhibit the activity of IKKa, a subunit of the IKK complex, which is crucial for the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB, leading to the release and activation of NFκB (Li2001GPx1). This suggests that GPX1 may interact with IKKa in a way that modulates its activity, potentially through the regulation of intracellular H2O2 levels (Li2001GPx1).
