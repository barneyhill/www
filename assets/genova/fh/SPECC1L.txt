# SPECC1L

## Overview
SPECC1L is a gene that encodes the protein known as sperm antigen with calponin homology and coiled-coil domains 1 like. This protein is primarily involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as cell migration, division, and craniofacial development. SPECC1L is characterized by its structural domains, including coiled-coil domains and a calponin homology domain, which facilitate interactions with microtubules and actin filaments. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cytoskeletal stability and function, particularly in processes like spindle organization and cytokinesis. Mutations in the SPECC1L gene have been linked to various craniofacial disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental biology (Wilson2016SPECC1L; Mehta2022SPECC1L).

## Structure
SPECC1L is a protein characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function in cellular processes. The protein contains three coiled-coil domains (CCDs), a C-terminal calponin homology domain (CHD), and two putative WASP homology domain-2 (WH2) actin-binding domains (Mehta2022SPECC1L). The coiled-coil domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, while the calponin homology domain is typically involved in actin binding, which is consistent with SPECC1L's role in associating with actin filaments (Mehta2022SPECC1L).

The N-terminal half of SPECC1L (amino acids 1-461) is responsible for binding to microtubules, as demonstrated by a microtubule binding protein spin-down assay (Mehta2022SPECC1L). The C-terminal half, which includes the CH domain and WH2 domains, associates with actin filaments. This interaction is disrupted by latrunculin B, indicating the importance of these domains in actin binding (Mehta2022SPECC1L).

The minimal region of SPECC1L required for association with MYPT1 is identified as ΔNTΔCHD (amino acids 462-890), which includes the third CCD, highlighting the significance of the coiled-coil domain in protein interactions (Mehta2022SPECC1L). The protein's structure allows it to regulate the distribution of the MYPT1/PP1β complex between microtubules and filamentous actin, playing a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization (Mehta2022SPECC1L).

## Function
The SPECC1L protein plays a crucial role in cell biology, particularly in the organization of the cytoskeleton and the regulation of cell adhesion. It is involved in the stabilization of adherens junctions (AJs), which are essential for maintaining cell-cell adhesion and tissue integrity. SPECC1L localizes at cell boundaries and interacts with components of the actin cytoskeleton, such as β-catenin and E-cadherin, to modulate AJ stability (Wilson2016SPECC1L). This protein is also implicated in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which influences cell survival and migration. SPECC1L deficiency leads to reduced PI3K-AKT signaling, increased apoptosis, and defects in cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) delamination, highlighting its role in craniofacial development (Wilson2016SPECC1L).

SPECC1L is associated with microtubules and facilitates their acetylation, which is important for maintaining cytoskeletal stability and function. This association is crucial for processes such as spindle organization and cytokinesis (Bhoj2019Phenotypic; Hall2020SPECC1L). The protein's activity is observed in various cellular locations, including the microtubule organizing center, where it colocalizes with acetylated α-tubulin and F-actin (Bhoj2019Phenotypic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPECC1L gene are associated with several craniofacial disorders, including Teebi hypertelorism syndrome, Opitz G/BBB syndrome, and Tessier IV oblique facial cleft. These conditions are characterized by facial dysmorphisms such as hypertelorism, a broad nasal bridge, and other developmental anomalies (Bhoj2019Phenotypic; Zhang2020A). SPECC1L mutations can also lead to congenital anomalies like cleft lip and palate, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and central nervous system defects (Wild2020Congenital; Bhoj2019Phenotypic).

The gene plays a crucial role in craniofacial development, and its deficiency can result in increased adherens junction stability and reduced cranial neural crest cell delamination, leading to developmental issues such as neural tube defects and cleft palate (Wilson2016SPECC1L; Hall2020SPECC1L). SPECC1L is also involved in palate development, and mutations can cause palate elevation delays and cleft palate (Hall2020SPECC1L). The gene's role in cell adhesion and migration is critical, and its expression is regulated by the IRF6 transcription factor, which is associated with other syndromes like Van der Woude and Popliteal Pterygium syndromes (Hall2020SPECC1L).

## Interactions
SPECC1L is a protein that interacts with various components of the cytoskeleton, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to the MYPT1/PP1β complex, regulating its distribution between microtubules and filamentous actin. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the balance of cytoskeletal structure and motility during cell migration and division (Mehta2022SPECC1L). SPECC1L associates with MYPT1 through their respective C-terminal regions, a binding confirmed by in vitro co-precipitation and far Western blot assays (Mehta2022SPECC1L).

SPECC1L also interacts with microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP4, which is involved in microtubule stabilization, and actin-binding proteins like CAPZB and Coronin. These interactions are dynamic and change throughout the cell cycle, indicating SPECC1L's role in cytoskeletal dynamics (Mehta2022SPECC1L). The protein's N-terminal region binds to microtubules, while the C-terminal region associates with actin filaments, facilitated by a calponin homology domain and WH2 actin-binding domains (Mehta2022SPECC1L).

SPECC1L also interacts with non-muscle myosin II, independent of its microtubule and actin binding domains, suggesting its role as a cytoskeletal scaffolding protein (Goering2021Inframe). These interactions highlight SPECC1L's involvement in cytoskeletal organization and its potential impact on cell shape and motility.
