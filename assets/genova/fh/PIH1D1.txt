# PIH1D1

## Overview
The PIH1D1 gene encodes the PIH1 domain-containing 1 protein, a critical component of the R2TP co-chaperone complex involved in the assembly and stabilization of various multisubunit protein complexes. This protein is characterized by its phosphopeptide binding domain, which facilitates the recognition and assembly of phosphorylated substrates, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as transcription regulation and DNA damage response (Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent; von2015Substrate). PIH1D1 interacts with other proteins, including RPAP3, RUVBL1, and RUVBL2, forming part of the HSP90 co-chaperone system, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Henri2018Deep; Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent). The protein's function is regulated by post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, which are essential for its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent). PIH1D1's clinical significance is underscored by its overexpression in various cancers, including breast, colorectal, and brain cancers, where it may serve as a potential oncogenic factor and prognostic marker (Singh2023PIH1D1; Kumar2023Decoding).

## Structure
The PIH1D1 protein is a component of the R2TP co-chaperone complex and plays a crucial role in assembling multisubunit machines. It contains two distinct domains: the N-terminal PIH-N domain and the C-terminal CS domain. The PIH-N domain is responsible for phosphopeptide binding, specifically recognizing phosphorylated substrates with a highly acidic nature. This domain binds to the DpSDD motif, a CK2 phosphorylation site, with key interactions involving conserved residues Lys57, Lys64, and Arg168, which are essential for binding specificity and affinity (Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent).

The C-terminal CS domain of PIH1D1 interacts with other components of the R2TP complex, such as RPAP3, forming intermolecular beta sheets and hydrophobic contacts that stabilize the complex (Henri2018Deep; MuñozHernández2019Structural). PIH1D1 also acts as a nucleotide exchange factor for the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex, enhancing its ATPase activity by facilitating the opening of the nucleotide-binding site (MuñozHernández2019Structural).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are critical for PIH1D1's function, as they regulate its interactions with other proteins within the R2TP complex (Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent).

## Function
The PIH1D1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the R2TP co-chaperone complex, which is involved in the assembly and stabilization of various multisubunit protein complexes in healthy human cells. PIH1D1 contains a phosphopeptide binding domain (PIH-N) that specifically binds to phosphorylated proteins, facilitating the recognition and assembly of substrates by the R2TP complex (Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent; von2015Substrate). This interaction is essential for the assembly of complexes such as small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), RNA polymerase II, and PIKK complexes, which are involved in critical cellular processes like transcription regulation and DNA damage response (Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent; von2015Substrate).

PIH1D1, along with RPAP3, acts as an adaptor linking HSP90 to the RUVBL proteins, playing a role in the maturation of these complexes (Henri2018Deep). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to processes such as chromatin remodeling and ribosome biogenesis (Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent). The protein's phosphorylation-dependent interactions are crucial for its function, as they help stabilize and assemble protein complexes necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PIH1D1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer. PIH1D1 is overexpressed in several breast cancer cell lines and is notably high in ductal and lobular carcinoma, as well as in specific breast cancer cell lines like CAL-120 and HCC202 (Singh2023PIH1D1). This overexpression suggests a potential oncogenic role, with higher PIH1D1 expression linked to tumor stage and lymph node metastasis in breast cancer (Singh2023PIH1D1). The gene's expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and correlates with immune modulators, indicating a role in tumor-immune interactions (Singh2023PIH1D1).

In addition to breast cancer, PIH1D1 is significantly expressed in colorectal and brain cancers, suggesting its involvement in these malignancies as well (Singh2023PIH1D1). In pediatric brain cancers, elevated PIH1D1 expression levels have been observed, indicating its potential as an early detection marker and prognostic indicator (Kumar2023Decoding). The gene's interaction with the tumor suppressor p53, which is crucial for cell cycle control and apoptosis, further underscores its clinical significance in cancer biology (Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent).

## Interactions
PIH1D1 is a component of the R2TP complex, which is involved in the assembly and stabilization of various protein complexes. It interacts with RPAP3, RUVBL1, and RUVBL2, forming a crucial part of the HSP90 co-chaperone system. PIH1D1 contains an N-terminal PIH1 domain that binds to phosphorylated peptides, such as those found in TEL2, through a specific phosphopeptide binding motif (D[S/T]DD [D/E]) (Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent). This interaction is essential for the recruitment of substrates by the R2TP complex in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Hořejší2014PhosphorylationDependent).

The interaction between PIH1D1 and RPAP3 is critical for the stability of PIH1D1, as RPAP3 isoform 1 stabilizes PIH1D1, while isoform 2 does not (Yoshida2013RPAP3). The binding interface between PIH1D1 and RPAP3 involves residues 400-420 of RPAP3, which are necessary for the interaction (Martino2018RPAP3). PIH1D1 also interacts with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 heterohexamer, primarily through a specific binding site within its CS domain (Seraphim2022Assembly).

PIH1D1's interactions are crucial for the assembly of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) and the stabilization of RNA polymerase II, highlighting its role in cellular processes involving the R2TP complex (Zhao2008Molecular).
