# EVI2A

## Overview
The EVI2A gene encodes the ecotropic viral integration site 2A protein, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. Located within an intron of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, EVI2A is of particular interest due to its potential role in oncogenesis, especially in the context of viral integrations that may affect its expression. The protein encoded by EVI2A is implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and its expression is notably abundant in peripheral white blood cells. Although the precise biological functions of the EVI2A protein remain to be fully elucidated, its association with neurofibromatosis type 1 and its potential involvement in leukemogenesis highlight its clinical significance (Cawthon1991cDNA).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The EVI2A gene, located within an intron of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, has been implicated in various conditions, particularly in the context of viral integrations that may affect its expression. In murine models, EVI2A is situated near a common site of viral integration in myeloid tumors, suggesting it may function as a proto-oncogene. Viral integrations within the EVI2A locus have been observed in several tumors, potentially altering its expression and contributing to leukemogenesis (Cawthon1991cDNA). 

In humans, EVI2A is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors along nerves. Although screens for mutations in EVI2A in NF1 patients have been negative, the gene's location and expression patterns suggest a potential role in tumorigenesis (Cawthon1991cDNA). 

EVI2A and its neighboring gene, EVI2B, are abundant in peripheral white blood cells, and their expression may be linked to juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemias (JCMLs), which occur more frequently in NF1 patients. This suggests a possible link between NF1, EVI2A, and EVI2B in leukemogenesis, although no significant differences in transcript abundance have been found between NF1 individuals and controls (Cawthon1991cDNA).
