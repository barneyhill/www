# CCL14

## Overview
CCL14, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 14, is a gene that encodes a member of the CC chemokine family, which plays a crucial role in immune cell migration and activation. The protein product of CCL14 is characterized by a typical CC chemokine fold and is involved in the regulation of leukocyte trafficking through its interaction with chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 (Blain2007Structural; Wang2021Glycosylation). The full-length protein acts as a weak agonist, but upon proteolytic cleavage to its truncated form, it becomes a potent agonist, significantly enhancing its biological activity (Wang2021Glycosylation). CCL14 is constitutively expressed in various tissues and is found at high concentrations in human plasma, contributing to the body's immune response by recruiting immune cells to sites of inflammation (Blain2007Structural). Additionally, alterations in CCL14 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and acute kidney injury, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Chen2023Performance; Zhu2019CCL14).

## Structure
The CCL14 protein is characterized by a typical CC chemokine fold, which includes a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet in a Greek key motif, connected by loops, and followed by a C-terminal α-helix. The β-strands are composed of residues Ile 30 - Glu 35 (β1), Ile 45 - Thr 49 (β2), and Gly 52 - Thr 57 (β3). The C-terminal α-helix is formed by residues Lys 62 - Met 71. The structure is stabilized by two disulfide bridges between Cys 16 - Cys 40 and Cys 17 - Cys 56, linking the NH2-terminal region with β3 and the hairpin loop between β1 and β2 (Blain2007Structural).

CCL14 can exist in different oligomeric states, forming dimers, tetramers, and octamers. The dimer interface is stabilized by interactions between the NH2-terminal β-strands of each monomer, without a covalent bond. The truncated form, CCL14 [9-74], is monomeric at low concentrations, while the full-length CCL14 is stable as a dimer (Blain2007Structural).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, particularly O-glycosylation at Ser7, which is adjacent to the proteolytic activation site. This modification does not affect CCR1 binding affinity or activation potency but may influence the conversion to the truncated, activated form (Wang2021Glycosylation).

## Function
CCL14, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 14, is a chemokine involved in the regulation of immune cell migration and activation. It is constitutively expressed in various tissues and found at high concentrations in human plasma (Blain2007Structural; Wang2021Glycosylation). CCL14 primarily functions by interacting with chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5, facilitating the chemotaxis of immune cells such as eosinophils, monocytes, and T lymphoblasts (Blain2007Structural).

In its full-length form, CCL14 acts as a weak agonist for CCR1. However, upon proteolytic cleavage to its truncated form, CCL14(9-74), it becomes a potent agonist for CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5, significantly enhancing its biological activity (Wang2021Glycosylation). This proteolytic processing is crucial for its function, as it allows CCL14 to effectively recruit immune cells to sites of inflammation, contributing to the body's immune response (Wang2021Glycosylation).

The protein's activity is also influenced by glycosylation, particularly at Ser7, which is near the proteolytic activation site. While glycosylation does not significantly alter CCR1 binding affinity, it may regulate the conversion of CCL14 from its full-length to its active form, thereby modulating its biological activity (Wang2021Glycosylation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL14 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and kidney injury. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCL14 is downregulated in tumor tissues compared to peritumor tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, shorter overall survival, and is predictive in subgroups with high differentiation, liver cirrhosis, and absence of a tumor capsule. Overexpression of CCL14 in HCC cell lines has been shown to suppress cell proliferation and promote apoptosis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Zhu2019CCL14).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), CCL14 expression is also reduced, and its overexpression leads to decreased expression of proteins associated with malignancy, such as Bcl-2 and MMP9, while increasing levels of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax. This suggests that CCL14 acts as a tumor suppressor in CRC by negatively regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Yan2021Lysine).

CCL14 is also a promising biomarker for predicting persistent acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. Elevated urinary levels of CCL14 are associated with severe AKI and the need for renal replacement therapy, indicating its potential utility in clinical settings for early intervention (Massoth2023Comparison; Chen2023Performance).

## Interactions
CCL14 interacts with several chemokine receptors, including CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5, playing a role in leukocyte migration and activation. The full-length CCL14 is a weak agonist for CCR1, but its activity is enhanced upon proteolytic cleavage to the truncated form CCL14(9-74), which also acts on CCR5 and CCR3 (Wang2021Glycosylation). The truncated form, CCL14(9-74), is particularly effective in signaling through CCR5, as it induces calcium flux and inhibits HIV entry, unlike the dimeric full-length CCL14 (Blain2007Structural). 

CCL14 also forms higher-order oligomers, such as tetramers and octamers, in its crystal structure. A point mutation, E15A, alters the tetrameric arrangement, leading to increased HIV inhibition, suggesting that the oligomeric state of CCL14 influences its interaction with CCR5 (Blain2007Structural). The glycosylation of CCL14, particularly at Ser7, does not significantly affect its binding to CCR1 but influences its activity post-proteolysis, indicating that glycosylation can modulate its interactions and functional activity (Wang2021Glycosylation). These interactions highlight the role of CCL14 in immune response regulation and its potential therapeutic utility in targeting CCR5 to treat HIV-1/AIDS.
