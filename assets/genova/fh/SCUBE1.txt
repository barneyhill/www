# SCUBE1

## Overview
SCUBE1 is a gene that encodes the protein signal peptide, CUB domain, and EGF-like domain-containing 1, which is a member of the SCUBE protein family. This protein is characterized by its modular structure, including a signal peptide, multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, cysteine-rich motifs, and a CUB domain. SCUBE1 is primarily involved in cell signaling and adhesion, playing a significant role in vascular development, platelet function, and hematopoiesis. It is expressed in various tissues, including endothelial cells and platelets, and is involved in processes such as thrombus formation and BMP signaling modulation. SCUBE1's interactions with other proteins, such as PEAR1 and VEGFR2, underscore its importance in cellular communication and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disorders (Lin2023The; Tsao2021Zebrafish).

## Structure
SCUBE1 is a protein encoded by the SCUBE1 gene, characterized by a modular structure comprising several distinct domains. The primary structure of SCUBE1 consists of approximately 988 to 1000 amino acids, depending on the source, and includes a signal peptide, nine tandem epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a large spacer region, three cysteine-rich (CR) motifs, and a CUB domain at the C-terminus (Lin2023The; Kumar2022The). 

The EGF-like repeats are involved in calcium-dependent interactions and are crucial for protein-protein interactions, facilitating the formation of homomeric or heteromeric complexes (Lin2023The). These repeats are also essential for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, acting through trans-homophilic crosslinking on activated platelets (Liao2019Epidermal). 

The CUB domain, a 110-amino-acid module, is involved in protein-protein interactions and can bind to growth factors and receptors, modulating signaling pathways (Lin2023The). 

SCUBE1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, which is crucial for its cell-surface expression and regulatory activity (Lin2023The). The spacer region, containing a conserved N-linked glycosylation motif, is involved in tethering SCUBE1 to the plasma membrane and facilitating its secretion (Lin2023The). 

SCUBE1 can exist in both soluble and membrane-associated forms, with its CR motifs and spacer region playing a role in membrane tethering through electrostatic and lectin-glycan interactions (Liao2019Epidermal).

## Function
SCUBE1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in cell signaling and adhesion. The SCUBE1 protein contains a signal peptide, CUB domain, and EGF-like domain, which facilitate its role in intercellular communication. It is primarily active in endothelial cells and plays a role in vascular development and homeostasis (Lin2023The).

In healthy human cells, SCUBE1 is involved in platelet function and hematopoiesis. It is expressed in platelets at both mRNA and protein levels, stored in the membranes of α-granules, and found on the surface of activated platelets, indicating its role in thrombus formation. Soluble SCUBE1 enhances platelet agglutination, although it does not independently stimulate platelet activation (Lin2023The). SCUBE1 also acts as a BMP coreceptor, modulating BMP signaling, which is crucial for primitive hematopoiesis and brain development (Lin2023The).

SCUBE1 is expressed in various tissues during embryonic development, including the nervous system, somites, and limb buds, and is noted for its role in craniofacial development in mice (Xavier2008Scube1). In adult tissues, SCUBE1 is expressed in the endothelium of blood vessels and platelets, suggesting a role in vascular homeostasis (Xavier2008Scube1).

## Clinical Significance
The SCUBE1 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In cancer, SCUBE1 is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in several types, including prostate and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In HCC, high SCUBE1 expression is associated with poor survival, suggesting its role in cancer progression through pathways like SHH/GLI1 (Zhao2022CAFsderived). SCUBE1 is also linked to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is highly expressed in MLL-rearranged AML cells, promoting leukemic growth and survival through the FLT3-LYN signaling axis (Lin2023The).

In cardiovascular diseases, SCUBE1 is a potential biomarker for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS), with elevated plasma levels indicating platelet activation and stroke severity (Lin2023The). It is also involved in thrombosis, as its absence leads to abnormal platelet aggregation and reduced arterial thrombosis (Lin2023The).

SCUBE1 is implicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), where its downregulation is associated with BMPR2 mutations, affecting endothelial function and angiogenesis. Plasma SCUBE1 levels are decreased in PAH patients, serving as a potential diagnostic biomarker (Sun2020SCUBE1). Additionally, a specific mutation in SCUBE1 has been linked to premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), suggesting a role in ovarian health (Fu2021Protective).

## Interactions
SCUBE1, a member of the SCUBE protein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its biological functions. It interacts with itself through EGF-like domains to form homo-oligomeric complexes, facilitating platelet agglutination. SCUBE1 also interacts with PEAR1 via its EGF-like and CUB domains, potentially playing a role in platelet function (Lin2023The). Additionally, SCUBE1 forms complexes with caveolin-1 through its Spacer and CUB domains, which may be involved in its recruitment into lipid raft microdomains (Lin2023The).

SCUBE1 can bind to growth factors and their receptors, such as BMP2, FLT3, and the FLT3 ligand, modulating signaling strength. It acts as a BMP coreceptor, enhancing BMP signaling in signal-receiving cells (Lin2023The). In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SCUBE1 interacts with FLT3 and LYN, promoting leukemic growth and survival by enhancing FLT3-LYN signaling (Lin2023The).

SCUBE1 also interacts with VEGFR2, as demonstrated in studies involving zebrafish and human endothelial cells, indicating its role in VEGF signaling and vascular development (Tsao2021Zebrafish). These interactions highlight SCUBE1's involvement in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target.
