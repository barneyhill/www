# CELA1

## Overview
CELA1, or chymotrypsin-like elastase 1, is a gene that encodes a serine protease enzyme involved in the remodeling of lung tissue. The protein product of CELA1 plays a significant role in elastin degradation, particularly within the extracellular matrix of lung tissue, and is crucial for processes such as lung development and maintenance of lung elasticity. CELA1 is predominantly expressed in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and is activated in response to mechanical stress, facilitating the remodeling of elastin fibers by binding to exposed hydrophobic domains of tropoelastin. This serine protease is integral to reducing postnatal lung elastance and coordinating alveolar and microvascular growth, ensuring proper ventilation and perfusion during lung development (Liu2014Dynamic; Ojha2020AntiCELA1). The regulation of CELA1 activity is critical in preventing excessive lung tissue remodeling, which is implicated in diseases such as emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Ojha2024AntiCELA1; Joshi2018Role).

## Structure


## Function
Chymotrypsin-like elastase 1 (CELA1) is a serine protease involved in the remodeling of lung tissue, particularly in the context of elastin degradation and lung development. CELA1 is expressed in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and is associated with elastin fibers in the extracellular matrix. Its activity is linked to mechanical stress, as it binds to the hydrophobic domains of tropoelastin when these domains are exposed by stretch, facilitating elastin remodeling (Ojha2020AntiCELA1). 

CELA1 plays a crucial role in reducing postnatal lung elastance, which is important for maintaining the elastic properties of the lung necessary for passive exhalation (Ojha2020AntiCELA1). During lung development, CELA1 is involved in elastin remodeling and angiogenesis, processes essential for proper lung morphogenesis and microvascular growth (Liu2014Dynamic). The enzyme's activity is stretch-dependent, coordinating alveolar and microvascular growth in a manner that matches ventilation and perfusion (Liu2014Dynamic).

In healthy human cells, CELA1 contributes to the structural integrity and function of lung tissue by regulating elastin deposition and remodeling, which is vital for lung development and function (Joshi2018Role).

## Clinical Significance
CELA1 (chymotrypsin-like elastase 1) is implicated in several lung diseases, particularly those involving elastin degradation and remodeling. Alterations in CELA1 expression are associated with emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In these conditions, CELA1 expression is increased, correlating with heightened elastase and protease activity, which contributes to lung tissue remodeling and destruction (Ojha2024AntiCELA1; Ojha2020AntiCELA1). 

In the context of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, CELA1 is crucial for the development of emphysema. The absence of AAT, a natural inhibitor of proteases like CELA1, leads to excessive lung remodeling and emphysema progression. Cela1 knockout mice are protected from AAT-deficient emphysema, highlighting the gene's role in this disease model (Joshi2018Role).

CELA1's elastolytic activity is also implicated in the pathogenesis of emphysema through strain-induced remodeling of lung tissue. This activity is distinct from other proteases and is not reliant on inflammation, suggesting a unique role in lung matrix remodeling (Ojha2020AntiCELA1). The development of an anti-CELA1 monoclonal antibody (KF4) has shown potential in preventing emphysema by inhibiting this stretch-mediated remodeling (Ojha2024AntiCELA1).

## Interactions
CELA1, a serine protease, is known to interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of lung tissue remodeling. One significant interaction is with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a protease inhibitor. CELA1 forms a covalent complex with AAT, which is crucial in regulating its elastase activity. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, where the absence of AAT leads to excessive elastase activity and contributes to emphysema development (Ojha2024AntiCELA1; Joshi2018Role).

The KF4 antibody has been developed to target CELA1, specifically binding to its catalytic triad. This binding inhibits CELA1's elastase activity, preventing the stretch-induced remodeling of lung tissue that contributes to emphysema. The KF4 antibody's interaction with CELA1 highlights its potential as a therapeutic agent in conditions like emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Ojha2024AntiCELA1; Ojha2020AntiCELA1).

CELA1 also interacts with elastin fibers in the lung, binding to hydrophobic domains of tropoelastin exposed by mechanical strain. This interaction is essential for its role in elastin remodeling and lung tissue maintenance (Ojha2024AntiCELA1).
