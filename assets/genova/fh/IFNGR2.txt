# IFNGR2

## Overview
The IFNGR2 gene encodes the interferon gamma receptor 2, a transmembrane protein that is a critical component of the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) receptor complex. This receptor is integral to the immune system's response to pathogens, particularly in the activation of macrophages and the enhancement of antigen presentation. IFNGR2, in conjunction with IFNGR1, forms a heterodimeric receptor complex that facilitates the binding of IFN-γ, thereby initiating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is essential for immune regulation and gene expression (Hoyos-Bachiloglu2017A; Walter2020The). Mutations in the IFNGR2 gene can lead to immunodeficiencies, such as Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD), highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining immune function (Bustamante2014Mendelian; OleagaQuintas2018A).

## Structure
The IFNGR2 protein is a component of the interferon-gamma receptor complex, which plays a crucial role in immune response. Structurally, IFNGR2 features an extracellular domain that includes fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, which are important for its interaction with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and other receptor components (Bandari2019A; Walter2020The). A novel splice site mutation in the IFNGR2 gene can lead to an in-frame deletion of three amino acids (p.Thr70-Ser72) within these FN3 domains, affecting the protein's function and its role in immune signaling (Bandari2019A).

The IFNGR2 protein forms part of a heterodimeric complex with IFNGR1, creating a 1:2:2 IFNGR1/IFNGR2 complex upon binding with the IFN-γ dimer. This complex is essential for full STAT1 phosphorylation and the induction of IFN-γ-mediated activities (Walter2020The). The protein's structure also includes a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular domain involved in signal transduction, which associates with Janus kinases (JAKs) to activate downstream signaling pathways (Walter2020The). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are likely important for the stability and function of IFNGR2, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
IFNGR2 encodes the interferon gamma receptor 2, a critical component of the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) receptor complex. This protein plays a vital role in the immune response by facilitating the binding of IFN-γ, a cytokine that activates macrophages and enhances antigen presentation. IFNGR2 is primarily active on the cell surface, where it is involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, a crucial mechanism for transmitting signals from extracellular cytokines to the cell nucleus, thereby influencing gene expression and immune regulation (Hoyos-Bachiloglu2017A; de2012The).

In healthy human cells, IFNGR2 is essential for the activation of macrophages and the immune response to intracellular pathogens, such as mycobacteria and Salmonella. It is part of a receptor complex that includes IFNGR1, and together they are necessary for the full activity of IFN-γ. Upon ligand binding, IFNGR2 associates with JAK2, which is crucial for downstream signaling events that lead to the biological effects of IFN-γ in cells (Hoyos-Bachiloglu2017A; Platanias2005Mechanisms). This signaling pathway is vital for macrophage activation and host defense against intracellular organisms (Hoyos-Bachiloglu2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFNGR2 gene, which encodes a component of the interferon-gamma receptor complex, are associated with Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD). This condition predisposes individuals to severe infections by weakly virulent mycobacteria, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines and environmental mycobacteria (OleagaQuintas2018A). Autosomal recessive complete IFN-γR2 deficiency, caused by bi-allelic mutations, results in no detectable protein or nonfunctional receptor expression, leading to severe infections in early childhood and often fatal outcomes. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for this condition (Bustamante2014Mendelian).

Partial autosomal recessive IFN-γR2 deficiency results from specific mutations, such as c.1A>G and c.4delC, which impair but do not completely abolish the response to IFN-γ. These mutations lead to a quantitative deficiency characterized by reduced receptor expression on the cell surface, resulting in severe impairment of immune responses (OleagaQuintas2018A). Patients with partial deficiency may experience milder clinical presentations and can respond to antibiotics and recombinant IFN-γ treatment (OleagaQuintas2018A).

A novel splice site mutation in IFNGR2 has also been identified, leading to primary immunodeficiency and susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases. This mutation results in non-functional receptors, making patients reliant on antibiotics and potentially requiring HSCT (Bandari2019A).

## Interactions
IFNGR2, or interferon gamma receptor 2, is a critical component of the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) receptor complex. It forms a heterodimeric complex with IFNGR1, the high-affinity receptor chain, to facilitate the binding of IFN-γ. This interaction is essential for the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is pivotal in modulating immune responses (Bhat2018Comprehensive; Walter2020The).

Upon IFN-γ binding, IFNGR2, in conjunction with IFNGR1, recruits and activates Janus kinases (JAK1 and JAK2). This activation leads to the phosphorylation of STAT1, which then dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to regulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Pestka2004Interferons; Bhat2018Comprehensive). The IFNGR2 chain forms a D2-D2 site-3 interface with IFNGR1, positioning the C-termini of the receptors 22Å apart at the cell surface, which is crucial for effective cell signaling (Walter2020The).

IFNGR2 is also involved in the regulation of immune responses during early pregnancy in pigs, where its expression is influenced by estrogen and interleukin-1β (IL1B) (Yoo2019Analysis). This highlights its role in the immune environment and its interaction with other signaling molecules.
