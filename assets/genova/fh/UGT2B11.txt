# UGT2B11

## Overview
UGT2B11 is a gene that encodes the enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B11, which is part of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) superfamily. This enzyme is involved in the glucuronidation process, a critical biochemical pathway that enhances the solubility of various endogenous and exogenous compounds, facilitating their excretion from the body. UGT2B11 is particularly noted for its role in the metabolism of steroid hormones and fatty acid metabolites, contributing to the regulation of hormone levels and lipid metabolism (Turgeon2003Glucuronidation; Meech2019The). The protein is expressed in several human tissues, including the liver, kidney, and prostate, and is implicated in local metabolic processes and hormone modulation (Hu2021The; Beaulieu1998Isolation). Variations in the expression and function of UGT2B11 have been associated with clinical conditions, particularly hormone-dependent cancers, highlighting its significance in pharmacogenomics and cancer biology (Hu2022The; Sun2011SNP).

## Structure
UGT2B11 is a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, which plays a crucial role in the glucuronidation process. The protein structure of UGT2B11 includes a highly conserved C-terminal (CT) domain, which is essential for UDP-sugar binding. This domain is characterized by a structural fold that is consistent across the UGT family, with minimal deviations observed in homology models (nair2015insights). The CT domain's 3D structure, particularly in UGT2B7, provides insights into the selectivity mechanisms of UGT2B11 due to their high sequence identity (92%) (nair2015insights).

The primary structure of UGT2B11 shares significant homology with UGT2B28, with a 95% identity in amino acid sequence (Lévesque2001Isolation). The secondary structure likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of the GT-B fold observed in other UGTs, which consists of two Rossmann-like domains forming a catalytic cleft (Fujiwara2016Structure). The quaternary structure involves the potential for oligomerization, as UGTs can form homo- and hetero-oligomers, affecting their enzymatic activities (Fujiwara2016Structure).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, although specific details for UGT2B11 are not provided. The presence of splice variants could lead to different isoforms with distinct functions, but specific variants for UGT2B11 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
UGT2B11 is a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) superfamily, which plays a crucial role in the glucuronidation process. This process involves the conjugation of glucuronic acid to various substrates, enhancing their solubility and facilitating their excretion from the body. UGT2B11 is involved in the metabolism of endogenous compounds, including steroid hormones and fatty acid metabolites, by converting them into glucuronide derivatives (Turgeon2003Glucuronidation; Meech2019The).

Despite its low catalytic activity compared to other UGTs, UGT2B11 can glucuronidate 3-alpha-hydroxysteroids and hydroxylated metabolites of arachidonic and linoleic acids, such as 12-HETE, 15-HETE, and 13-HODE (Turgeon2003Glucuronidation; Meech2019The). This activity suggests a role in the metabolism and clearance of these biologically active lipids, which are involved in various physiological processes (Turgeon2003Glucuronidation).

UGT2B11 is expressed in multiple human tissues, including the liver, kidney, and prostate, indicating its potential involvement in local metabolic processes within these tissues (Hu2021The; Beaulieu1998Isolation). Its expression in steroid-sensitive tissues suggests a role in modulating hormone levels, which may have implications for conditions like prostate cancer (Meech2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the UGT2B11 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. UGT2B11 is involved in the metabolism of steroid hormones and drugs, and its expression levels can influence cancer risk and drug response. Variations in UGT2B11 expression have been linked to hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer, due to its role in steroid hormone metabolism (Sun2011SNP). 

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), UGT2B11 is highly expressed but also noted for its downregulation, which may impact drug metabolism and cancer progression (Hu2021The). The gene's expression patterns are unique across different cancer types, with high expression observed in LIHC but not in other cancers (Hu2021The). 

Somatic mutations in UGT2B11, including missense and splice site mutations, have been identified in various cancers. These mutations can lead to altered protein function, potentially affecting drug metabolism and therapeutic outcomes (Hu2022The). The presence of UGT2B11 mutations in tumors with high expression of the gene suggests potential clinicopathological impacts (Hu2022The).
