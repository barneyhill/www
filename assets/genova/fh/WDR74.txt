# WDR74

## Overview
WDR74 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 74 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats. These structural motifs facilitate protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly ribosome biogenesis. The WDR74 protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits, essential for protein synthesis and cellular proliferation (Wu2022A). It interacts with the MTR4-exosome complex and is involved in pre-rRNA processing, highlighting its importance in RNA metabolism (Hiraishi2015AAAATPase; Hiraishi2018WDR74). WDR74 is expressed in multiple tissues, including bone marrow and dendritic cells, suggesting roles in hematopoiesis and immune function (Wu2022A). Additionally, alterations in WDR74 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it influences pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, affecting cell proliferation and metastasis (Cai2021WDR74; Wu2022A).

## Structure
The WDR74 protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which are structural motifs of approximately 40 amino acids that often terminate in a tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) dipeptide. These repeats are minimally conserved and are known to mediate protein-protein interactions during complex assembly (Maserati2011Wdr74). The WD40 repeats contribute to the formation of a beta-propeller structure, a common feature among WD-repeat proteins, which typically consists of a series of blades forming a closed ring. This structure is crucial for maintaining stability and facilitating interactions with other proteins or small ligands (Smith1999The).

WDR74 is a single-copy gene highly conserved across mammalian species, with vertebrates having one orthologous locus of at least 77% amino acid identity (Maserati2011Wdr74). The protein is involved in various cellular functions, including ribosome biogenesis, where it interacts with the MTR4-exosome complex and is dissociated by the AAA-ATPase NVL2 (Hiraishi2015AAAATPase; Hiraishi2018WDR74). WDR74 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Hiraishi2015AAAATPase). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its localization and function (Hiraishi2015AAAATPase).

## Function
The WDR74 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, a fundamental process for protein synthesis in cells. The WDR74 protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it is involved in the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits, essential for maintaining cellular growth and proliferation (Wu2022A). The protein contains WD40 domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, contributing to various cellular functions such as cell division, gene transcription, and mRNA modification (Wu2022A).

In healthy human cells, WDR74 is expressed in tissues such as bone marrow and dendritic cells, suggesting a potential role in hematopoiesis or immune function (Wu2022A). The gene shows low RNA tissue specificity, indicating a broad but not highly specialized function in normal cells (Wu2022A). While specific functions in healthy cells are not extensively detailed, the involvement of WDR74 in fundamental cellular processes like RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and organismal homeostasis (Wu2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and genetic mutations of the WDR74 gene have been implicated in various cancers. High expression levels of WDR74 are associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including adrenocortical carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, liver cancer, and prostate cancer (Wu2022A). In contrast, increased expression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is linked to a better prognosis, though this finding may be limited by small sample sizes (Wu2022A). In lung cancer, WDR74 overexpression is associated with worse survival outcomes and is involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting proliferation and chemoresistance (Virk2022Genome; Wu2022A).

In colorectal cancer, WDR74 promotes proliferation and metastasis by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, leading to increased nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and activation of downstream target genes (Cai2021WDR74). Genetic alterations in WDR74, particularly in the promoter region, have been observed in various cancers, including prostate cancer, where they are associated with tumor progression (Weinhold2014Genomewide). These findings suggest that WDR74 plays a significant role in cancer progression and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
WDR74 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing. It interacts with the RNA helicase MTR4 and the nuclear exosome complex, playing a role in the biogenesis of 60S ribosomal subunits. The dissociation of WDR74 from the MTR4-exosome complex is regulated by the ATPase activity of NVL2, a member of the AAA-ATPase family (Hiraishi2015AAAATPase; Hiraishi2018WDR74). This interaction is crucial for the proper processing of pre-rRNA, as WDR74 is involved in the early cleavage steps of pre-rRNA processing, affecting the transition from 47S to mature rRNAs (Hiraishi2018WDR74).

WDR74 also shows interactions with other proteins in cancer contexts. In colorectal cancer, WDR74 is implicated in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it influences the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, thereby affecting cell proliferation and metastasis (Cai2021WDR74). Additionally, WDR74 has been identified to interact with proteins such as BOP1, PPAN, PUS1, SNHG1, and MRTO4, which are involved in RNA metabolism pathways, including ribosome biogenesis (Wu2022A). These interactions highlight WDR74's role in both normal cellular processes and disease states.
