# CDH26

## Overview
CDH26 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 26, a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is known for its role in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Cadherin 26 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its five extracellular cadherin repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail, which facilitate its function in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and polarity (Caldwell2017Cadherin). The protein is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, such as those in the airway and esophagus, where it plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (LachowiczScroggins2018Cadherin26). CDH26 is involved in various cellular interactions, including those with integrins and catenins, which are essential for its role in immune modulation and tissue homeostasis (Caldwell2017Cadherin). The gene's expression is notably altered in certain allergic inflammatory conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Caldwell2017Cadherin; Chen2024Cadherin26).

## Structure
The CDH26 protein, encoded by the human gene CDH26, is a member of the cadherin family characterized by its sequence homology to other cadherin proteins. It features a specific molecular structure that includes five extracellular cadherin (CDH) repeats in its extracellular domain, a predicted transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic region (Caldwell2017Cadherin). The extracellular domain contains five asparagine residues that are potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, confirmed by increased mobility upon treatment with peptide: N-glycosidase F (Caldwell2017Cadherin). A tryptophan residue at position 2 of the most N-terminal extracellular CDH repeat domain is critical for dimerization, allowing the protein to interact in a homotypic manner (Caldwell2017Cadherin).

CDH26 has two transcript variants, A and B. Variant A is more commonly expressed, with 3192 base pairs, 18 exons, and a predicted protein molecular weight of 92.4 kDa. It includes four cadherin domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. Variant B has 1092 base pairs, six exons, and a predicted molecular weight of 17.7 kDa, lacking a transmembrane region (LachowiczScroggins2018Cadherin26). CDH26 can form complexes with beta-catenin and alpha-catenin, linking it indirectly to the actin cytoskeleton, which supports cell adhesion (Caldwell2017Cadherin).

## Function
Cadherin 26 (CDH26) is a protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion, particularly in epithelial tissues. It is part of the cadherin family, which is known for mediating calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. CDH26 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and polarity of epithelial cells, such as those in the airway and esophageal epithelium (Caldwell2017Cadherin; LachowiczScroggins2018Cadherin26).

In airway epithelial cells, CDH26 is highly expressed and localizes near ciliary membranes, where it regulates cytoskeletal structure and cell polarity. It is crucial for the formation of cortical actin and the establishment of apicobasal polarity, which are essential for the proper function of the mucociliary escalator and lung health (LachowiczScroggins2018Cadherin26). CDH26 interacts with actin, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and maintaining cell adhesion and polarity (LachowiczScroggins2018Cadherin26).

CDH26 also interacts with integrins, such as a4 and aE, which are involved in cellular adhesion and signaling. These interactions may impact processes like gene expression and barrier function, suggesting a role in immune modulation and tissue homeostasis (Caldwell2017Cadherin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDH26 gene have been linked to several allergic inflammatory conditions, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. In eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and eosinophilic gastritis (EG), CDH26 is significantly overexpressed, with studies showing a 115-fold increase in EoE and up to a 35.6-fold increase in EG compared to controls. This overexpression is associated with increased CDH26 protein levels in epithelial cells of inflamed tissues, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions by affecting cell adhesion and immune cell migration (Caldwell2017Cadherin; Zhernov2021Molecular).

In asthma, particularly eosinophilic and severe forms, CDH26 expression is upregulated in lung macrophages. This upregulation correlates with markers of airway eosinophilia and is involved in macrophage alternative activation by suppressing STUB1-mediated IL-4Rα ubiquitination. This mechanism contributes to airway inflammation and mucus overproduction, highlighting CDH26 as a potential therapeutic target in asthma management (Chen2024Cadherin26).

The specific regulation of CDH26 in these allergic conditions, without significant changes in other inflammatory diseases like Helicobacter pylori gastritis, underscores its unique role in allergic inflammatory responses (Caldwell2017Cadherin).

## Interactions
CDH26, a member of the cadherin family, participates in several physical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular adhesion and signaling. CDH26 interacts with beta-catenin, a protein that links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. It is also found in a complex with alpha-catenin, supporting its role in cell adhesion (Caldwell2017Cadherin). CDH26 interacts with integrins, specifically integrins a4 and aE, and impacts cellular adhesion. It can bind to integrin a4b7, facilitating adhesion in cells expressing CDH26 (Caldwell2017Cadherin). 

CDH26 also modulates immune cell behavior by inhibiting CD4+ T-cell activation, including the secretion of IL-2, through its interaction with integrins (Caldwell2017Cadherin). The CDH26A variant interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cell morphology. This interaction is confirmed through co-localization studies using super-resolution microscopy, indicating a direct or indirect interaction with actin (LachowiczScroggins2018Cadherin26). CDH26 also interacts with STUB1, a protein involved in the ubiquitination process, suggesting a role in modulating the degradation of the interleukin-4 receptor subunit alpha (IL-4Rα) (Chen2024Cadherin26).
