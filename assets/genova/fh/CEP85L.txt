# CEP85L

## Overview
CEP85L is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 85 like, a crucial component involved in the regulation of neuronal migration and microtubule organization. This protein localizes to the maternal centriole and plays a significant role in the activation of Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) at the centrosome, which is essential for cerebral cortical migration. As a centrosomal protein, CEP85L interacts with various other proteins, such as LIS1, NDE1, KIF2A, and DYNC1H1, to facilitate proper neuronal migration and brain development. Mutations in the CEP85L gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders, including posterior lissencephaly and pachygyria, which are characterized by abnormal brain development due to disrupted neuronal migration (Tsai2020Pathogenic; Kodani2020Posterior).

## Function
CEP85L is a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in neuronal migration and microtubule organization in healthy human cells. It localizes to the maternal centriole and is essential for the activation of Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) at the centrosome, which is vital for cerebral cortical migration (Kodani2020Posterior). CEP85L interacts with several centrosomal proteins, including LIS1, NDE1, KIF2A, and DYNC1H1, which are necessary for neuronal migration (Kodani2020Posterior). The protein is involved in organizing the centrosome and microtubule cytoskeleton, which are critical for neuronal migration, particularly in the developing cortex (Kodani2020Posterior).

CEP85L's function includes promoting the localization and activation of CDK5 in the centrosome, which is necessary for forming a dynamic microtubule cytoskeleton essential for neuronal migration (Contrò2021Posterior). In healthy cells, CEP85L is expressed at higher levels in the posterior cortex during development, indicating its importance in this region (Kodani2020Posterior). The protein's role at the centrosome is crucial for proper neuronal migration, which is essential for normal brain development (Tsai2020Pathogenic). Disruption of CEP85L function can lead to abnormal neuronal migration, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal brain structure and function (Tsai2020Pathogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP85L gene are associated with several neurological disorders, primarily affecting neuronal migration and cortical development. Pathogenic variants in CEP85L have been linked to posterior predominant lissencephaly (LIS), a condition characterized by a smooth brain surface due to abnormal neuronal migration. This disorder often presents with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. The severity of the condition can vary, with some individuals exhibiting mild symptoms while others experience severe neurological impairments (Tsai2020Pathogenic).

CEP85L mutations are also associated with posterior-specific pachygyria, a neuronal migration disorder marked by reduced and coarse cerebral cortical folds. This condition is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. The mutations disrupt the organization of the centrosome and microtubule cytoskeleton, which are crucial for neuronal migration (Kodani2020Posterior).

Additionally, CEP85L variants have been identified in cases of subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), a condition where neurons are improperly positioned beneath the cortical surface, leading to a "double cortex" appearance. This condition is often associated with epilepsy and variable intellectual outcomes (Tsai2020Pathogenic; Contrò2021Posterior). The clinical presentations of CEP85L-related disorders can range from mild to severe, highlighting the gene's critical role in brain development (Tsai2020Pathogenic).

## Interactions
CEP85L interacts with several proteins that are crucial for neuronal migration and centrosome function. It localizes to the maternal centriole and is essential for microtubule organization. CEP85L is known to interact with CDK5, a kinase necessary for neuronal migration, and is required for CDK5's localization and activation at the centrosome. This interaction is critical for controlling centrosome and cytoskeleton organization, and the loss of CEP85L or CDK5 results in improper microtubule anchoring and impaired cell migration (Kodani2020Posterior).

Immunoprecipitation assays have identified several other proteins that interact with CEP85L, including LIS1, NDE1, KIF2A, and DYNC1H1. These proteins are involved in neuronal migration and centrosomal protein interactions, highlighting CEP85L's role in organizing LIS proteins at the centrosome (Kodani2020Posterior).

Mutations in CEP85L are associated with posterior lissencephaly, a condition characterized by abnormal brain development. These mutations often occur within a critical 10-amino-acid stretch, suggesting a significant functional domain for protein interactions (Kodani2020Posterior; Contrò2021Posterior).
