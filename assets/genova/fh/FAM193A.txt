# FAM193A

## Overview
FAM193A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 193 member A. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM193A is implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways, and may play a role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The protein encoded by FAM193A is not currently categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but ongoing research continues to explore its potential interactions and functional significance in cellular contexts (Qiu2020aarFDC).
