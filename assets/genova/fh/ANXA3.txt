# ANXA3

## Overview
The ANXA3 gene encodes annexin A3, a member of the annexin family of proteins, which are characterized by their ability to bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. Annexin A3 is primarily expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage, such as neutrophils and monocytes, where it plays a crucial role in membrane-associated activities, including membrane trafficking, vesicle fusion, and the regulation of intracellular calcium signals (Le1994Annexin; Sopkova2002Ca2+). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including exocytosis, phagocytosis, and cell proliferation, and is implicated in the regulation of phosphoinositide turnover (Raynal1994Annexins:). ANXA3's interactions with proteins such as RANK and TRAF6 highlight its role in osteoclast differentiation and cancer-related pathways, including the ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways (Lin2023Annexin; Guo202133kDa). Clinically, alterations in ANXA3 expression are associated with several cancers, influencing tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance, making it a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target (Yang2021Annexin; Liu2021Annexin).

## Structure
Annexin A3 (ANXA3) is a member of the annexin family, characterized by its ability to bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. The protein is encoded on human chromosome 4q13-q22 and consists of 323 amino acids, forming two isoforms: a 36 kDa form and a 33 kDa form. The 33 kDa isoform lacks the first 39 amino acids of the N-terminal region present in the 36 kDa isoform, resulting from alternative splicing of exon III (Guo202133kDa; Ozturk2022Role; Liu2021Annexin).

The molecular structure of ANXA3 includes a C-terminal region with four conserved annexin repeat domains (I-IV), each composed of five α-helices (A-E), forming a circular queue. These domains contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, facilitating its role in membrane binding and ion channel regulation (Yang2021Annexin; Liu2021Annexin). The N-terminal region, which is 20 amino acids long, contains two tryptophan residues, W5 and W190, essential for phospholipid membrane binding and interaction with calcium ions (Yang2021Annexin; Liu2021Annexin).

ANXA3 does not undergo post-translational modifications but is known for its splice variant isoforms, which exhibit different expression patterns in various cell types and conditions (Liu2021Annexin).

## Function
Annexin A3 (ANXA3) is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein primarily expressed in neutrophils and monocytes, where it plays a significant role in membrane-associated activities. In resting cells, ANXA3 is associated with cytoplasmic granules, and upon activation, it translocates to the plasma membrane, suggesting its involvement in granule fusion and exocytosis (Le1994Annexin). This translocation is calcium-dependent, highlighting the protein's role in calcium signaling and membrane interactions (Le1994Annexin).

ANXA3 is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, vesicle fusion, and the regulation of intracellular calcium signals (Le1994Annexin; Sopkova2002Ca2+). It binds to phospholipid membranes in a calcium-dependent manner, which affects its conformation and dynamics, particularly in its N-terminal region (Sopkova2002Ca2+). This binding is crucial for its function in membrane organization and repair, as well as in processes like exocytosis and phagocytosis (Le1994Annexin).

ANXA3 also plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation, as it is involved in phosphoinositide turnover, which is activated by growth factors (Raynal1994Annexins:). Its expression is almost exclusive to differentiated cells of the myeloid lineage, indicating its specialized function in these cells (Sopkova2002Ca2+).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ANXA3 gene have been linked to various cancers, influencing tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. ANXA3 is overexpressed in several cancer types, including breast, bladder, ovarian, gastric, pancreatic, hepatocellular, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, while it is downregulated in renal, prostate, and papillary thyroid cancer (Yang2021Annexin). In breast cancer, high ANXA3 expression correlates with shorter disease-free and overall survival, particularly in triple-negative cases, suggesting its role in metastasis and poor prognosis (Liu2021Annexin). ANXA3 overexpression is also associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, such as platinum drugs in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors like sorafenib (Yang2021Annexin).

In colorectal cancer, ANXA3 is overexpressed compared to normal tissues, and its knockdown reduces tumor proliferation and size (Yang2021Annexin; Liu2021Annexin). Conversely, in papillary thyroid cancer, lower ANXA3 expression is linked to lymph node metastasis, serving as a negative predictive index for metastasis (Liu2021Annexin). These findings suggest that ANXA3 could serve as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in various cancers. Additionally, ANXA3 has been implicated in ischemic stroke, where its expression correlates with pyroptosis-related pathways, suggesting a role in disease development (Liu2023Identification).

## Interactions
Annexin A3 (ANXA3) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. ANXA3 interacts with RANK and TRAF6, two proteins essential for osteoclast differentiation. These interactions are significant as ANXA3 modulates the stability and degradation of RANK and TRAF6, primarily through the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways. ANXA3 knockdown leads to the degradation of these proteins, while its overexpression can reverse the reduction in osteoclast numbers caused by ANXA3 downregulation (Lin2023Annexin).

Co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown assays have demonstrated strong binding among ANXA3, RANK, and TRAF6 in osteoclast precursors. ANXA3 colocalizes with TRAF6 and RANK, and ANXA3-overexpressed exosomes enhance the ANXA3-RANK interaction. ANXA3 also facilitates the binding of RANK to TRAF6, particularly upon RANKL exposure. Specific binding domains within ANXA3 have been identified, with TRAF6 binding to ANXA3 162-323 aa and RANK binding to ANXA3 1-161 aa (Lin2023Annexin).

ANXA3 is also involved in cancer-related pathways, interacting with signaling molecules in the ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways, which are implicated in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance (Guo202133kDa).
