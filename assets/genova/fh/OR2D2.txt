# OR2D2

## Overview
The OR2D2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily D member 2, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. These receptors are a subset of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play a crucial role in the detection of odorants, thereby contributing to the sense of smell. The protein encoded by OR2D2 is involved in the initial molecular interactions that occur when odorant molecules bind to receptors in the nasal epithelium, triggering a neuronal response that is ultimately perceived as smell. As a transmembrane receptor, OR2D2 spans the cell membrane and transduces extracellular signals through interaction with intracellular G-proteins. This gene and its encoded protein are of particular interest in the study of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, as variations in their expression have been observed in conditions such as progressive supranuclear palsy and chronic schizophrenia (Ansoleaga2015Decrease; Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR2D2 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, has been explored in various neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), OR2D2 mRNA expression in the entorhinal and frontal cortices showed no significant changes compared to controls, suggesting limited involvement in AD pathology (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation). In contrast, OR2D2 was significantly up-regulated in the frontal cortex of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), indicating a potential role in this disease (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation). In Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), OR2D2 expression was up-regulated in the cerebellum of the MM1 subtype, but not in the frontal cortex, highlighting a subtype-specific expression pattern (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), OR2D2 expression levels were similar between control and diseased samples, indicating no significant dysregulation in this context (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional). However, in chronic schizophrenia, OR2D2 was significantly down-regulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with expression levels correlating with daily antipsychotic dose, suggesting a potential link to treatment effects (Ansoleaga2015Decrease). These findings suggest that alterations in OR2D2 expression may be associated with specific neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, although the exact clinical implications require further investigation.
