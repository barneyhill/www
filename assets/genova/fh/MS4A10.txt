# MS4A10

## Overview
MS4A10 is a gene that encodes the protein membrane spanning 4-domains A10, which is a member of the MS4A family of proteins. This family is characterized by the presence of four transmembrane domains, allowing the proteins to span the cell membrane multiple times, a feature that is crucial for their function in cellular signaling and interaction (Mattiola2021The; Ishibashi2001Identification). The MS4A10 protein, specifically, is composed of 241 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 26,900 Daltons (Liang2001Structural). It is distinguished by a longer hydrophilic loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains, which may serve as a ligand-binding domain, and contains potential phosphorylation sites that suggest regulatory roles (Ishibashi2001Identification). The gene is located on chromosome 11q12, a region often altered in various cancers, indicating its potential involvement in oncogenic processes (Liang2001Structural).

## Structure
The MS4A10 protein is encoded by the MS4A10 gene, which spans at least 8183 base pairs and is composed of six exons (Liang2001Structural). The protein consists of 241 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 26,900 Daltons (Liang2001Structural). It is characterized by four transmembrane domains, a common feature of the MS4A family, which allows the protein to span the cell membrane multiple times (Mattiola2021The; Ishibashi2001Identification). The first two transmembrane domains are highly conserved among MS4A proteins (Ishibashi2001Identification).

The MS4A10 protein has a longer hydrophilic loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains, which is expected to be extracellular and may function as a ligand-binding domain (Ishibashi2001Identification). The protein also contains three putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, suggesting potential regulatory roles through phosphorylation (Ishibashi2001Identification). The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of MS4A10 is 28 amino acids shorter than that of its mouse counterpart, MS4a10 (Liang2001Structural). Despite these differences, MS4A10 and MS4a10 are considered homologous genes, with significant homologies in the transmembrane domains and the putative second extracellular loop (Liang2001Structural).

## Clinical Significance
The MS4A10 gene has been implicated in various cancers, particularly in the context of metastasis. In colorectal carcinomas (CRC), a missense mutation in MS4A10 has been identified as potentially promoting metastasis to lymph nodes. This mutation is part of a broader study that identified genetic markers associated with CRC metastasis, suggesting that MS4A10 could serve as a potential cancer marker for patients at risk of lymph node metastasis (Aridi2022Detection).

In gastric cancer, MS4A10 expression levels have been observed to decrease in cases with bone metastasis compared to those without. This differential expression suggests a possible role in the metastatic process, although the specific clinical implications of these alterations in MS4A10 expression remain to be fully elucidated (Oh2024Genomic).

The MS4A gene family, including MS4A10, is located on chromosome 11q12, a region frequently altered in certain cancers such as renal oncocytomas and lung cancers. While the specific clinical significance of MS4A10 mutations or expression changes is not well-documented, these chromosomal alterations suggest a potential area for further research into its role in oncogenesis (Liang2001Structural).
