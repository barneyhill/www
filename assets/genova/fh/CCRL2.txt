# CCRL2

## Overview
CCRL2, or C-C motif chemokine receptor like 2, is a gene that encodes an atypical chemokine receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains and is primarily involved in modulating immune responses and inflammation. Unlike typical chemokine receptors, CCRL2 does not engage in intracellular signaling due to the absence of the DRYLAIV motif, which is essential for G protein coupling, thus functioning as a decoy receptor (Yoshimura2011Chemokinelike; Bonecchi2010Chemokine). The protein encoded by CCRL2 is expressed in various cell types, including leukocytes and endothelial cells, and plays a crucial role in processes such as angiogenesis and leukocyte migration by binding and presenting chemokines like chemerin to other functional receptors (Schioppa2020Molecular; Ben2021CCRL2). CCRL2's involvement in disease contexts, such as HIV/AIDS progression, myelodysplastic syndromes, and atherosclerosis, underscores its significance in clinical research and potential therapeutic targeting (Tang2023Endothelial; Karantanos2022CCRL2; An2011Role).

## Structure
CCRL2 is a chemokine receptor that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by seven transmembrane helices. It shares over 40% amino acid identity with other chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, and CCR5, but lacks the conserved DRYLAIV motif typical of signaling receptors, which suggests it functions as a decoy receptor (Yoshimura2011Chemokinelike; Vanheule2018How; Bonecchi2010Chemokine). 

CCRL2 has two transcript variants: variant 1, previously known as CRAM-B, encodes a 344-amino acid protein, while variant 2, known as CRAM-A, encodes a 356-amino acid protein with a distinct N-terminus due to differences in the 5' UTR and coding region (Yoshimura2011Chemokinelike). The receptor is expressed on the cell surface and is not internalized after ligand engagement, unlike other receptors that undergo internalization and recycling (Bonecchi2010Chemokine).

CCRL2 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not provided (Vanheule2018How). The receptor's role involves binding chemokines and presenting them to other functional receptors, such as CMKLR1, without directly inducing cell migration (Yoshimura2011Chemokinelike; Bonecchi2010Chemokine).

## Function
CCRL2, an atypical chemokine receptor, plays a significant role in modulating inflammation and angiogenesis in healthy human cells. Unlike typical chemokine receptors, CCRL2 does not couple to intracellular signaling pathways due to the absence of the DRYLAIV motif necessary for G protein coupling (Schioppa2020Molecular; Ben2021CCRL2). Instead, it functions primarily as a binding site for chemerin, a protein involved in inflammation and metabolism, without triggering signaling pathways (Schioppa2020Molecular; Ben2021CCRL2).

CCRL2 is expressed in various cell types, including leukocytes and endothelial cells, and its expression is upregulated by inflammatory stimuli (Del2013CCRL2; Ben2021CCRL2). In endothelial cells, CCRL2 captures and concentrates chemerin on the cell surface, influencing the local concentration and distribution of chemerin, which is crucial for processes like angiogenesis (Monnier2012Expression; Ben2021CCRL2). This receptor modulates the density of blood vessels during retinal development, protecting developing vascular networks from the anti-angiogenic effects of chemerin (Ben2021CCRL2).

CCRL2 also plays a role in leukocyte migration by forming a non-soluble chemotactic gradient for cells expressing the functional receptor CMKLR1, thereby influencing immune cell recruitment to sites of inflammation (Schioppa2020Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The CCRL2 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In the context of HIV/AIDS, the CCRL2-F167Y variant is associated with accelerated progression to AIDS, particularly through the rapid development of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). This variant appears to influence disease progression independently of other known polymorphisms, suggesting a unique role in immune regulation or interaction with HIV coreceptors (An2011Role).

In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML), higher expression of CCRL2 in CD34+ cells correlates with a poorer response to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, such as azacitidine. CCRL2 overexpression reduces sensitivity to these treatments by affecting cytokine-regulated signaling pathways, indicating its potential as a biomarker for treatment response (Karantanos2022CCRL2).

CCRL2 also plays a role in atherosclerosis, where its expression is upregulated in endothelial cells under disturbed blood flow conditions. This upregulation is crucial for leukocyte adhesion and atherosclerotic plaque formation, highlighting its involvement in vascular inflammation (Tang2023Endothelial).

In lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, CCRL2 expression by endothelial cells supports immune surveillance by facilitating the recruitment of NK cells to tumors. Higher CCRL2 expression is associated with improved survival, suggesting a protective role in early-stage lung cancer (Del2019The).

## Interactions
CCRL2 (C-C motif chemokine receptor like 2) is involved in several physical interactions that play a crucial role in immune response regulation. It binds the chemotactic protein chemerin, which does not trigger receptor internalization, ligand scavenging, or calcium mobilization. This interaction increases the local concentration of chemerin, forming a chemotactic gradient for leukocytes expressing the chemerin receptor CMKLR1, facilitating the recruitment of cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells (Schioppa2020Molecular; Yoshimura2011Chemokinelike).

CCRL2 also forms heterodimers with chemokine receptors like CXCR2, which modulate neutrophil migration in inflammatory contexts. These heterodimers are detectable at the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm, suggesting a role for CCRL2 in the intracellular retention of these complexes. CCRL2 influences CXCR2 membrane expression and signaling, affecting ERK1/2 and small GTPases phosphorylation, and β2-integrin activation (Schioppa2020Molecular).

Despite its interactions, CCRL2 does not act as a decoy receptor in endothelial cells, as its internalization is not influenced by ligand binding, distinguishing it from other atypical chemokine receptors (Mazzotti2017The). CCRL2's role in modulating inflammatory responses is further highlighted by its ability to present chemerin to CMKLR1-expressing cells, potentially influencing inflammatory responses (ReganKomito2017Absence).
