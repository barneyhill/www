# CCNJL

## Overview
CCNJL, or cyclin J-like, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cyclin family, which is known for its role in regulating the cell cycle. The protein product of CCNJL, cyclin J-like, is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not yet fully understood. Cyclins typically function as regulatory subunits that activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), but the precise interactions and pathways involving cyclin J-like remain to be clarified. Research has indicated that CCNJL may play a role in tumor biology, as its expression is altered in certain types of cancer and pituitary adenomas, suggesting potential implications in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Quandt2020Atypical; TaniguchiPonciano2022The). Further studies are required to elucidate the detailed mechanisms and clinical relevance of CCNJL in human health and disease.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The CCNJL gene, also known as cyclin J-like, has been implicated in various pathological conditions due to its altered expression levels. In the context of pituitary adenomas, CCNJL is notably downregulated in both POU1F1-derived and TBX19-derived adenomas, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of these tumors (TaniguchiPonciano2022The). This downregulation is statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.0002 in NR5A1-derived pituitary adenomas, indicating its differential expression in these tumors (TaniguchiPonciano2022The).

In cancer research, atypical cyclins, including CCNJL, are believed to contribute to cancer pathogenesis. The deregulation of CCNJL expression has been observed in various cancer types, suggesting its involvement in tumor heterogeneity and potential as a prognostic marker or drug target (Quandt2020Atypical). However, the specific clinical significance of CCNJL in cancer remains to be fully elucidated, as further studies are needed to establish its precise role (Quandt2020Atypical).

Overall, the altered expression of CCNJL in certain tumors highlights its potential clinical significance, although more research is necessary to understand its full impact on disease progression and treatment outcomes.
