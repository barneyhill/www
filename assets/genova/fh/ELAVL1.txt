# ELAVL1

## Overview
ELAVL1, also known as HuR, is a gene that encodes the ELAV-like RNA binding protein 1, a member of the ELAV/Hu family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which enable it to bind to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of mRNAs, thereby playing a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (Mulligan2023The). ELAVL1 is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA stabilization, translation, and microRNA-mediated repression, which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and stress response (Ma1996Cloning; Pascale2011The). The protein's ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to cellular stress further underscores its dynamic role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Wang2000HuR). ELAVL1's interactions with other proteins and its involvement in disease pathogenesis, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders, highlight its significance as a potential therapeutic target (BattagliaHsu2018Inherited; Cai2022ELAVL1).

## Structure
ELAVL1, also known as HuR, is an RNA-binding protein characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for its function in binding to AU-rich elements in mRNA. The RRM1 and RRM2 domains are located towards the N-terminus, while RRM3 is at the C-terminal end, separated by a hinge region. These domains are highly conserved, with 90% amino acid similarity, indicating a shared set of RNA targets (Mulligan2023The). The RRM domains facilitate binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' UTR of transcripts, and ELAVL1 can also bind to C-rich, U-rich, and GU-rich sequences. RRM1 and RRM2 directly associate with RNA, while RRM3 promotes stability through various mechanisms (Mulligan2023The).

The hinge region contains nuclear export and localization signals, enabling RNA shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Mulligan2023The). ELAVL1 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, with the third RRM domain facilitating homodimer formation and protein-RNA interaction (Mulligan2023The). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation can affect its localization and function, particularly during immune responses (Rothamel2021ELAVL1). Splice variants of ELAVL1 may result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties.

## Function
ELAVL1, also known as HuR, is an RNA-binding protein that plays a significant role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in human cells. It is ubiquitously expressed and primarily functions by binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of mRNAs, stabilizing these transcripts and influencing their translation (Ma1996Cloning; Mulligan2023The). This stabilization is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and stress response (Mulligan2023The).

HuR contains three RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains that facilitate its binding to target mRNAs. The RRM1 and RRM2 domains preferentially recognize AU-rich elements, while the RRM3 domain promotes transcript stability by mechanisms such as steric hindrance against poly(A) degrading exonucleases and interaction with ribosomal machinery to enhance translation (Mulligan2023The). HuR is predominantly located in the nucleus but shuttles to the cytoplasm in response to stress, where it stabilizes mRNAs like p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor involved in growth arrest and cell survival (Wang2000HuR).

In addition to its role in mRNA stabilization, HuR modulates microRNA-mediated repression, influencing the translation and degradation of specific mRNAs (Pascale2011The). This multifaceted regulation by HuR is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ELAVL1 gene, also known as HuR, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurological disorders. Inherited disorders of cobalamin (vitamin B12) metabolism can lead to the mislocalization of ELAVL1, disrupting mRNA transport and contributing to neurological manifestations. This mislocalization is linked to impaired methylation and phosphorylation of ELAVL1, affecting its interaction with nuclear export receptors and leading to decreased expression of genes involved in brain development and neuroplasticity (BattagliaHsu2018Inherited).

In cancer, ELAVL1 is often overexpressed and associated with tumor progression. In prostate cancer, high ELAVL1 expression correlates with increased tumor proliferation and RNA metabolism, and its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cai2022ELAVL1). In cervical cancer, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ELAVL1 gene, such as rs12983784, rs74369359, and rs10402477, are associated with increased risk, highlighting the gene's role in genetic susceptibility to this cancer (Boudhiba2023Association). ELAVL1's interactions with non-coding RNAs and m6A regulators further underscore its involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a drug target (Cai2022Roles).

## Interactions
ELAVL1, also known as HuR, is an RNA-binding protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to bind to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of target mRNAs, playing a crucial role in mRNA stability and translation. ELAVL1 interacts with several m6A regulators, including EIF3A, METTL3, PRRC2A, RBMX, HNRNPA2B1, WTAP, YTHDF3, and ZC3H13, through m6A sites, which are important for RNA metabolism and tumor development (Cai2022ELAVL1). 

In the context of immune response, ELAVL1 binds to the 3' UTRs of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), stabilizing these transcripts and playing a critical role in their stability during innate immune responses (Rothamel2021ELAVL1). ELAVL1 also forms a multiprotein complex with hnRNPM, TBK1, and NF-kB p65, which is essential for antiviral signaling by promoting IRF3 phosphorylation downstream of cGAS and RIG-I (Kirchhoff2023hnRNPM).

ELAVL1 interacts with CELF1 in the cell nucleus, influencing pre-mRNA processing and alternative splicing. This interaction is part of a macromolecular complex that affects RNA isoform production, with implications for cancer prognosis (David2018The).
