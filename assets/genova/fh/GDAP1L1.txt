# GDAP1L1

## Overview
GDAP1L1 is a gene that encodes the protein ganglioside induced differentiation associated protein 1 like 1, which is a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme family. Despite its classification, GDAP1L1 does not exhibit GST activity. The protein is primarily involved in mitochondrial dynamics within the central nervous system (CNS) and is distributed throughout the cytosol rather than localizing to mitochondria under normal conditions. GDAP1L1 interacts with the mitochondrial fission factor Drp1, playing a significant role in mitochondrial fission and cellular responses to oxidative stress. It is implicated in psoriasiform inflammation through its involvement in macrophage activation and cytokine production, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for inflammatory conditions (Alalaiwe2021Psoriasiform; wagner2009structural).

## Structure
The GDAP1L1 protein is a paralog of GDAP1, sharing 60% sequence homology and belonging to the same class of glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes, although it does not exhibit GST activity when expressed in bacteria (wagner2009structural). GDAP1L1 is a 368 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 42 kDa, consisting of six exons spanning 33.1 kb of DNA, located at chromosomal region 20q12-q13 (wagner2009structural). The protein contains two hydrophobic domains at the C-terminal region, similar to GDAP1, and predictions suggest a third transmembrane domain upstream of these hydrophobic domains (wagner2009structural). Despite these structural similarities, GDAP1L1 does not localize to mitochondria and is distributed throughout the cytosol (wagner2009structural).

Three potential splice variants of GDAP1L1 have been identified, with isoform A being the primary and functionally relevant form (wagner2009structural). Isoform B displays a distinct mitochondrial pattern, suggesting possible regulation by chaperones, posttranslational modifications, or external stimuli (wagner2009structural). The C-terminal regions of GDAP1L1 and GDAP1 differ, with GDAP1L1's transmembrane anchor being hidden under normal conditions (wagner2009structural).

## Function
GDAP1L1 is a protein that plays a role in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS). It is expressed in various CNS regions, including the cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, olfactory bulb, and spinal cord, but not in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (wagner2009structural). Unlike its paralog GDAP1, which localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane, GDAP1L1 is ubiquitously distributed throughout the cell and does not naturally localize to mitochondria under normal conditions (wagner2009structural).

GDAP1L1 is suggested to have a compensatory role in the CNS, potentially mitigating the effects of GDAP1 dysfunction, which is associated with peripheral neuropathies (wagner2009structural). It may be involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress, as it can translocate to mitochondria under specific stress conditions, such as exposure to menadione, a potent inducer of oxidative stress (wagner2009structural). Despite structural similarities to glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), GDAP1L1 does not exhibit GST activity, and its exact molecular function in healthy human cells remains speculative (Shield2006Functional).

## Clinical Significance
GDAP1L1 has been implicated in psoriasiform inflammation, a condition that mimics psoriasis, through its role in macrophage activation and cytokine production. Alterations in GDAP1L1 expression have been associated with increased macrophage infiltration and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-17A, IL-23, IL-24, and TNF, which are key contributors to the inflammatory response in psoriasis-like conditions (Alalaiwe2021Psoriasiform). The gene is involved in mitochondrial fission, a process crucial for macrophage activation, and its depletion has been shown to reduce psoriasiform symptoms by decreasing macrophage migration and cytokine release (Alalaiwe2021Psoriasiform).

GDAP1L1's interaction with Drp1, a protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics, is essential for the development of psoriasiform lesions. The phosphorylation of Drp1, facilitated by GDAP1L1, leads to mitochondrial fission, which is necessary for macrophage trafficking and the inflammatory response (Alalaiwe2021Psoriasiform). These findings suggest that GDAP1L1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for managing psoriatic inflammation and possibly other conditions related to mitochondrial dynamics (Alalaiwe2021Psoriasiform).

## Interactions
GDAP1L1 interacts with the mitochondrial fission factor Drp1, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics. Upon stimulation with imiquimod (IMQ), GDAP1L1 translocates to the mitochondrial surface, facilitating the translocation and phosphorylation of Drp1 at serine residue 616, which is essential for mitochondrial fission. This interaction is significant in the context of psoriasiform inflammation, where GDAP1L1 and Drp1 contribute to the activation of macrophages by promoting mitochondrial fragmentation (Alalaiwe2021Psoriasiform).

GDAP1L1 is also involved in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6, IL-23, IL-24, and TNF, through its interaction with signaling pathways like MAPK and NF-κB. These interactions are critical for the inflammatory response in psoriasis, as GDAP1L1 modulates cytokine production and macrophage activation (Alalaiwe2021Psoriasiform).

In the central nervous system, GDAP1L1 may compensate for the loss of GDAP1 function, as it can rescue fission activity in GDAP1 knock-down cells. This suggests a potential compensatory mechanism in neuronal cells, although GDAP1L1's mitochondrial fission activity is less pronounced than that of GDAP1 (wagner2009structural).
