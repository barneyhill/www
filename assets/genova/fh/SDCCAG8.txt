# SDCCAG8

## Overview
The SDCCAG8 gene encodes the SHH signaling and ciliogenesis regulator SDCCAG8 protein, which plays a pivotal role in the formation and function of primary cilia, as well as in the regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein due to its localization and function at the centrosome and basal body of cilia, where it is involved in microtubule organization and stability. SDCCAG8 is essential for proper ciliogenesis and is implicated in various cellular processes, including endosomal vesicle trafficking and neuronal migration. Mutations in the SDCCAG8 gene are linked to several ciliopathies, such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome and nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies, underscoring its clinical significance in human health (Schaefer2010Mutations; Airik2016SDCCAG8; Insolera2014SDCCAG8).

## Structure
The SDCCAG8 protein, encoded by the SDCCAG8 gene, is involved in ciliogenesis and Sonic Hedgehog signaling. The full-length isoform of SDCCAG8, known as isoform-a, is 713 amino acids long with a molecular weight of approximately 82.7 kDa (Weihbrecht; Otto2010Candidate). This isoform contains an N-terminal globular domain, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and eight putative coiled-coil domains, which are structural features common in proteins associated with ciliary function (Weihbrecht page 2 of 16). 

The C-terminal portion of SDCCAG8, specifically amino acids 543-621, is crucial for binding with AIMP2, and this region overlaps with the binding domain for OFD1, which requires the entire C-terminal region (amino acids 543-716) for interaction (Weihbrecht page 6 of 16). The presence of a nuclear localization signal in the N-terminal portion suggests a role in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, potentially overridden by AIMP2 binding through a nuclear exclusion signal (Weihbrecht page 6 of 16).

SDCCAG8 has multiple isoforms, including isoform-b, which lacks exon 6, and isoform-e, which lacks exons 10-18, resulting in a truncated protein of 41 kDa (Otto2010Candidate). These isoforms may influence the protein's function and localization within the cell.

## Function
The SDCCAG8 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in ciliogenesis and the regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, SDCCAG8 is essential for the formation and function of primary cilia, which are small hair-like structures on the cell surface that are crucial for cellular signaling and sensory functions. The protein is localized to the centrosome and basal body of cilia, where it contributes to the organization and stability of microtubules, which are vital for proper ciliary function (Airik2016SDCCAG8; Insolera2014SDCCAG8).

SDCCAG8 interacts with various proteins, including RABEP2 and ERC1, which are involved in endosomal vesicle trafficking and centriolar satellite functions. These interactions are important for the regulation of material transport to the basal body and the cilium, processes essential for ciliogenesis (Airik2016SDCCAG8). The protein also plays a role in neuronal migration by regulating the centrosomal accumulation of pericentriolar material, which is crucial for microtubule organization and the coordination of centrosome and nucleus movement during neuronal migration (Insolera2014SDCCAG8).

Mutations in SDCCAG8 can lead to defects in neuronal migration and are associated with conditions such as nephronophthisis, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and schizophrenia, highlighting its importance in maintaining neurological health (Insolera2014SDCCAG8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SDCCAG8 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), a severe multisystemic ciliopathy. BBS is characterized by symptoms such as retinal degeneration, obesity, cognitive defects, renal failure, and hypogonadism. Notably, patients with primary SDCCAG8 mutations often exhibit early-onset renal failure and obesity but lack polydactyly, a common feature in BBS, indicating a distinct genotype-phenotype correlation (Schaefer2010Mutations). SDCCAG8 mutations are also linked to nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC), which involve end-stage renal failure, kidney cysts, and retinal degeneration (Weihbrecht2018Genotypic; Bahmanpour2020A).

Mouse models with SDCCAG8 mutations have shown phenotypes such as pre-axial polydactyly, cleft palate, and neonatal lethality, with variations depending on genetic background (Weihbrecht2018Genotypic). These models help elucidate the gene's role in vivo and highlight the complexity of SDCCAG8-related disorders (Weihbrecht2018Genotypic). Additionally, SDCCAG8 mutations can lead to respiratory issues, as evidenced by recurrent pulmonary infections and poor respiratory function in affected individuals (Weihbrecht2018Genotypic).

## Interactions
SDCCAG8 is involved in several protein interactions critical for its role in ciliogenesis and the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. It forms a distinct functional module at the centrosome and interacts with a variety of proteins, including oral-facial-digital syndrome 1 protein (OFD1), centrosomal protein 131kDa (CEP131), and components of the endosomal vesicle trafficking complex such as RABEP2 and ERC1 (Airik2016SDCCAG8). These interactions are validated through co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that SDCCAG8 co-immunoprecipitates with RABEP2, ERC1, and CEP131, likely mediated through coiled-coil domains (Airik2016SDCCAG8).

SDCCAG8 is essential for the centrosomal localization of RABEP2, a protein crucial for ciliogenesis, although its own localization is independent of RABEP2 (Airik2016SDCCAG8). It also interacts with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (KARS, DARS) and non-muscle myosin II motor proteins (MYH9, MYH10, MYH14) (Airik2016SDCCAG8). In photoreceptor neurons, SDCCAG8's ciliary targeting is dependent on RPGRIP1, and its absence leads to mislocalization, contributing to photoreceptor degeneration (Patil2012Selective). These interactions underscore SDCCAG8's role in maintaining ciliary function and structure, impacting cellular signaling and development.
