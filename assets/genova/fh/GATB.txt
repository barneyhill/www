# GATB

## Overview
The GATB gene encodes the glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase subunit B, a critical component of the GatCAB complex involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This protein functions as an amidotransferase, facilitating the conversion of misacylated Glu-tRNA^Gln to Gln-tRNA^Gln, a necessary step for accurate mitochondrial translation. Structurally, GATB is characterized by a unique folding pattern that includes a hydrophobic tunnel for ammonia transport, essential for its enzymatic activity (Nakamura2006Ammonia). The protein's interaction with other subunits, GatA and GatC, forms a heterotrimeric assembly that is vital for the stability and function of the complex (Nakamura2006Ammonia). Mutations in the GATB gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

## Structure
The GATB protein is a subunit of the GatCAB complex, which plays a crucial role in the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNA Gln. Structurally, GATB is organized into two domains connected by an elongated linker loop. The 'cradle' domain features a Mg2+ ion coordinated by conserved residues His12, Glu124, and Glu150, while the auxiliary C-terminal helical domain is composed of an α-helical bundle (Nakamura2006Ammonia). The C-terminal domains, including the helical and YqeY domains, are essential for tRNA anchoring and the synthesis of Gln-tRNA Gln (Araiso2014Crystal).

GATB's tertiary structure involves a unique folding pattern that facilitates intramolecular ammonia transportation through a hydrophobic tunnel, which is crucial for its function in the amidotransferase process (Nakamura2006Ammonia). The quaternary structure of the GatCAB complex includes the interaction of GATB with GatA and GatC subunits, forming a heterotrimeric assembly that stabilizes the complex and facilitates the amidotransferase reaction (Nakamura2006Ammonia).

The protein's structure also includes a bottleneck in the ammonia channel path, constricted by a conserved Glu125 residue, which is hypothesized to undergo conformational changes upon tRNA binding (Nakamura2006Ammonia). These structural features are critical for the protein's function in mitochondrial protein synthesis.

## Function
The GATB gene encodes a subunit of the GatCAB aminoacyl-tRNA amidotransferase complex, which is essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis in human cells. This complex is responsible for the transamidation reaction that charges glutaminyl mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA Gln) indirectly. Initially, mt-tRNA Gln is charged with glutamic acid by mitochondrial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (EARS2), and then the GatCAB complex converts Glu-mt-tRNA Gln into Gln-mt-tRNA Gln using free glutamine as an amide donor (Friederich2018Pathogenic). This process is crucial for the proper translation of mitochondrial proteins, which are necessary for the assembly and function of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), a critical component for ATP production and cellular energy metabolism (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

The GatCAB complex, including the GATB subunit, ensures the correct charging of mt-tRNA Gln, which is vital for mitochondrial translation and overall mitochondrial function (Friederich2018Pathogenic). In healthy cells, the presence of the GatCAB complex maintains the stability and synthesis of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins, supporting normal respiratory chain enzyme function (Friederich2018Pathogenic). The GATB subunit's role in this complex is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial respiratory chain function and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GATB gene, which encodes a subunit of the glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase complex, are associated with a lethal mitochondrial cardiomyopathy disorder. This condition is characterized by severe cardiomyopathy and fatal lactic acidosis, often presenting in infancy. Patients with these mutations exhibit symptoms such as anemia, liver dysfunction, and elevated creatine kinase levels. Postmortem biopsies frequently reveal massive mitochondrial proliferation in cardiomyocytes, indicating significant mitochondrial dysfunction (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

The pathogenic variants in GATB lead to a reduction in the GatB protein levels, resulting in the absence of the GatCAB holocomplex. This absence causes defects in mitochondrial translation, evidenced by combined deficiencies in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, particularly complexes I and IV, and low activity of complex III. These deficiencies contribute to the development of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

The severity of the disorder correlates with the degree of amino acid conservation affected by the mutations. Molecular modeling suggests that specific mutations, such as Phe136Leu, may reduce catalytic activity due to their location near the catalytic amidotransferase site, further impairing mitochondrial function (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

## Interactions
The GATB gene encodes a subunit of the glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase complex, known as GatCAB, which is essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This complex consists of three subunits: GatA, GatB, and GatC. GatB interacts with GatA and GatC to form the functional GatCAB complex, which is responsible for the transamidation of misacylated Glu-tRNA^Gln to Gln-tRNA^Gln, a critical step in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

The interactions within the GatCAB complex are crucial for its function. GatB, along with GatA, possesses catalytic functions, while GatC acts as a stabilizing linker. Mutations in GATB can disrupt these interactions, leading to reduced catalytic activity and impaired mitochondrial function (Friederich2018Pathogenic). The structural integrity of GatB is maintained by specific residues, such as Leu472, which are important for binding to tRNA Gln (Nakamura2006Ammonia).

GatB also plays a role in the intramolecular transportation of ammonia within the complex, facilitated by a tunnel lined with conserved polar residues. This tunnel connects the glutaminase active site in GatA to the transamidase site in GatB, highlighting the intricate interactions necessary for the complex's function (Nakamura2006Ammonia).
