# ZNF430

## Overview
ZNF430 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 430, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by silencing retroviral elements, particularly the THE1B retroelements, through the deposition of repressive chromatin marks. ZNF430 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to essential cellular processes such as DNA repair, replication, and transcriptional regulation. The gene is located on chromosome 19 and has been implicated in various diseases, including ovarian carcinomas and primary myelofibrosis, due to its potential role in oncogenic processes and gene regulation (Zuo2023THE1B; Micci2010Array‐CGH; Salati2015Integrative).

## Function
ZNF430, a zinc finger protein, plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability in human cells by silencing retroviral elements. It specifically represses THE1B retroelements by binding to their sequences and facilitating the deposition of repressive H3K9me3 chromatin marks, which effectively silence these elements. This repression is particularly significant in human trophoblast tissues, where ZNF430 is ubiquitously expressed, preventing any potential enhancer activity of THE1B elements in human tissues (Zuo2023THE1B).

ZNF430 emerged during the simian lineage and works alongside its paralog ZNF100, which targets THE1A retroelements. The presence of ZNF430 binding sites in THE1B elements, including those near the CRH gene, underscores its role in preventing the activation of these retroelements, which could otherwise disrupt genomic integrity. This function is crucial for maintaining the stability of the human genome by silencing potentially harmful retroviral elements in healthy cells (Zuo2023THE1B).

ZNF430 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA and other nuclear proteins, contributing to various cellular processes such as DNA repair, replication, and transcriptional regulation. These activities are essential for proper cellular function and the maintenance of genomic stability (Zuo2023THE1B).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF430 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in gene regulation. In ovarian carcinomas, ZNF430 is located on chromosome 19, a region often showing DNA gains, which may lead to its overexpression or rearrangement. Such alterations could be significant in cancer development, as zinc finger genes like ZNF430 might contribute to oncogenic processes by affecting the regulation of key target genes (Micci2010Array‐CGH). The overexpression of transcription factors encoded by zinc finger genes, including ZNF430, is suggested to promote carcinogenesis (Smebye2014Chromosome).

In primary myelofibrosis (PMF), ZNF430 is among the zinc finger proteins identified in regions with copy number loss, although its specific role in PMF pathogenesis remains unclear. The study did not find significant effects on cell proliferation, survival, or differentiation when ZNF430 was silenced, suggesting potential functional redundancy with other zinc finger proteins (Salati2015Integrative).

ZNF430's role in silencing the THE1B retrovirus element in humans is crucial for preventing THE1B from acting as an enhancer for the CRH gene, which could have implications in human pregnancy (Zuo2023THE1B). The absence of ZNF430 in rodents highlights the importance of using appropriate model systems to study its function in humans.
