# MS4A12

## Overview
MS4A12 is a gene that encodes the protein membrane spanning 4-domains A12, which is part of the MS4A family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their four transmembrane domains and are involved in various cellular signaling pathways. MS4A12 is distinct from other members of its family due to its specific expression in the apical membrane of normal colonic epithelial cells, rather than in hematopoietic or lymphatic tissues (Koslowski2009Selective). The protein plays a crucial role in store-operated calcium entry, influencing epidermal growth factor-mediated cellular processes such as proliferation and chemotaxis. This function is particularly significant in the context of colon cancer, where MS4A12 expression is maintained and contributes to growth factor-mediated signal transduction (Koslowski2009Selective). The regulation of MS4A12 is closely linked to the transcription factor CDX2, highlighting its potential importance in both normal colonic function and cancer biology.

## Function
MS4A12 is a member of the membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A (MS4A), which includes proteins involved in cellular signaling and immune response. Unlike other MS4A proteins, MS4A12 is not expressed in hematopoietic or lymphatic lineages but is specifically expressed in the apical membrane of normal colonic epithelial cells (Koslowski2009Selective). In healthy human cells, MS4A12 functions as a component of store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) entry, playing a role in sensitizing cells for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated effects on proliferation and chemotaxis (Koslowski2009Selective). This suggests that MS4A12 is involved in regulating cellular processes critical for maintaining normal colonic epithelial function.

The expression of MS4A12 is maintained in colon cancers, where it modulates growth factor-mediated capacitative Ca2+ entry, a key point in signal transduction pathways controlling cellular functions (Koslowski2009Selective). The regulation of MS4A12 expression is linked to the transcription factor CDX2, which binds to a specific site on the MS4A12 promoter, essential for its transcriptional activity (Koslowski2009Selective). This indicates that MS4A12 may play a significant role in normal colonic development and potentially in colon cancer biology.
