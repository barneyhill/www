# TSPYL2

## Overview
TSPYL2, or testis-specific protein Y-encoded-like 2, is a gene that encodes a nucleosome assembly protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, transcriptional repression, and DNA damage response. The protein TSPY like 2, encoded by TSPYL2, functions as a key regulator in maintaining genomic stability by modulating the activity of critical proteins such as p53, SIRT1, and p300. It is a component of the REST/NRSF transcriptional repressor complex, playing a significant role in gene silencing and transcriptional repression, particularly in the context of TGFβ signaling. TSPYL2's interactions with other proteins, such as EZH2 and MDM2, further underscore its involvement in neuronal development and cancer biology. Alterations in TSPYL2 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Epping2015TSPYL2; Zhang2023AAV9Tspyl2; Magni2018TSPYL2).

## Function
TSPYL2, also known as TSPY like 2, encodes a nucleosome assembly protein involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, TSPYL2 plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in maintaining the G1 checkpoint upon DNA damage. It inhibits cyclin B-CDK1 activity, acting as a negative regulator of the cell cycle, which is crucial for arresting cell growth when DNA damage occurs (Tao2011TSPYL2). TSPYL2 is also a key component of the REST/NRSF transcriptional complex, essential for TGFβ signaling activation. This complex is involved in the transcriptional repression of genes like TrkC, which is important for TGFβ-dependent proliferation arrest (Epping2015TSPYL2).

TSPYL2 regulates the activity of SIRT1 and p300, which are crucial for the acetylation of p53, a protein involved in apoptosis and cellular stress responses. By inhibiting SIRT1 and promoting p300 activity, TSPYL2 ensures proper acetylation and activation of p53, facilitating p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage (Magni2018TSPYL2). This regulation is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing unwarranted cell death, highlighting TSPYL2's role in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation (Magni2018TSPYL2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TSPYL2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. TSPYL2 is recognized for its tumor suppressor role in several cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer, TSPYL2 expression is significantly reduced, and its overexpression in lung and breast cancer cells has been shown to reduce cell growth and migration ability (Magni2018TSPYL2). The gene is also involved in the TGFβ signaling pathway, where its loss leads to resistance to TGFβ-induced proliferation arrest, contributing to cancer progression in epithelial tissues (Epping2015TSPYL2).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, TSPYL2 mutations or expression alterations are associated with conditions such as schizophrenia, autism, and ADHD. TSPYL2 knockout mice exhibit sensorimotor gating impairments and altered dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling, which are linked to these disorders (Li2016Tspyl2). The gene's role in regulating glutamate receptor expression further implicates it in neurodevelopmental abnormalities (Liu2018TSPYL2).

In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), TSPYL2, also known as CDA1, is downregulated. Overexpression of TSPYL2 has been shown to inhibit pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for IPF (Zhang2023AAV9Tspyl2).

## Interactions
TSPYL2 is a component of the REST/NRSF transcriptional repressor complex, interacting with several proteins such as REST, SIN3A, HDAC1, HDAC2, CoREST, and ZMYND8. These interactions suggest TSPYL2's role in gene silencing and transcriptional repression, particularly in the regulation of TGFβ signaling (Epping2015TSPYL2). TSPYL2 binds to the central domain of REST, facilitating the formation of the REST/SIN3A repressor complex, which is crucial for repressing genes like TrkC involved in TGFβ signaling (Epping2015TSPYL2).

TSPYL2 also interacts with the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2, part of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), to regulate the expression of neuronal genes. This interaction is important for neuronal development and function (Liu2018TSPYL2). In the context of DNA damage response, TSPYL2 associates with SIRT1 and p300, inhibiting SIRT1 and promoting p300 activity. This interaction is crucial for the acetylation and activation of p300, which is enhanced upon DNA damage (Magni2018TSPYL2).

Additionally, TSPYL2 is regulated by the ubiquitin ligase MDM2, which influences its stability through ubiquitination, particularly in a sex-specific manner in cancer cells (Cardano2023Sex). TSPYL2's interaction with ZFP91, another E3 ubiquitin ligase, affects its stability in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, impacting chemotherapy sensitivity (Pan2022Ginsenoside).
