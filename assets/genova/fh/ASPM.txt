# ASPM

## Overview
ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated) is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for proper mitotic spindle function and cell division. The ASPM protein, known as assembly factor for spindle microtubules, is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a significant role in spindle organization, orientation, and cytokinesis during mitosis. It is particularly important in neuroepithelial cells, where it ensures symmetrical cell division, a process vital for brain development and cortical expansion (Fish2006Aspm; Higgins2010Human). Mutations in the ASPM gene are the most common cause of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), a condition characterized by reduced brain size and intellectual disability (Bond2003Protein-Truncating; Létard2018Autosomal). Additionally, ASPM is implicated in cancer progression, with its overexpression linked to increased tumor invasiveness and poor prognosis in various cancers (Xu2018Overexpression; Wu2023The).

## Structure
The ASPM protein is a large protein, approximately 400 kDa, that plays a crucial role in mitosis by anchoring the mitotic spindle at the spindle poles and facilitating normal cytokinesis (Holt2021Structure). Its structure includes an N-terminal domain with two tandem calponin homology (CH) domains, which are typically actin-binding but in ASPM, they bind to microtubules, suggesting a unique microtubule-binding site (Holt2021Structure). Following the CH domains, ASPM contains 81 isoleucine-glutamine (IQ) motifs that bind light chains such as calmodulin, forming a single alpha-helix and suggesting an elongated structure (Holt2021Structure).

ASPM also contains ASH domains, which are associated with ciliary and centrosomal functions and are homologous to domains in other ciliary proteins (Ponting2006A). These domains may contribute to its role in ciliary and flagellar function, potentially influencing sperm flagellar function or cilia-mediated neuronal migration (Ponting2006A). The protein's structure is characterized by a high number of asparagine and glutamine repeats, and it is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms (Nicholas2008The). The complete structure-function relationship of ASPM remains unclear, and specific details on its tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ASPM gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in spindle organization, spindle orientation, and cytokinesis during cell division. ASPM is a microtubule minus end-associated protein that localizes to the pericentriolar matrix at the spindle poles during mitosis, facilitating proper spindle microtubule organization and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation (Higgins2010Human). This function is essential for maintaining symmetrical cell division, particularly in neuroepithelial cells, which are crucial for cortical expansion during brain development (Fish2006Aspm; Higgins2010Human).

ASPM is involved in the precise orientation of the mitotic spindle, which is vital for the developmental asymmetrical cell division of neural progenitor cells. This process is critical for the expansion of the progenitor pool that underpins cortical neurogenesis (Higgins2010Human). The protein is expressed in proliferating tissues and is upregulated in many cancers, indicating its role in cell proliferation (Kouprina2005The). Mutations in ASPM can lead to microcephaly, a condition characterized by reduced brain size, due to defects in neural progenitor cell division (Kouprina2005The; Higgins2010Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASPM gene are primarily associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly reduced brain size and intellectual disability. ASPM mutations are the most common cause of MCPH, accounting for a substantial proportion of cases worldwide. These mutations often lead to protein truncation, resulting in impaired neurogenesis and reduced cortical area (Bond2003Protein-Truncating; Naseer2021Whole; Létard2018Autosomal). Clinical features of individuals with ASPM mutations include intellectual disability, epilepsy, and various brain structural abnormalities such as simplified gyral patterns and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (Hashmi2016A; Abdel‐Hamid2016Molecular).

Alterations in ASPM expression are also linked to cancer progression. The gene is often upregulated in various tumors, including glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and bladder cancer, where its overexpression is associated with increased tumor invasiveness and poor prognosis. ASPM interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and tumorigenicity (Lin2008ASPM; Xu2018Overexpression; Wu2023The). High ASPM expression correlates with poor outcomes in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a marker for aggressive cancer behavior (Xu2018Overexpression; Wu2023The).

## Interactions
The ASPM protein interacts with several other proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its function in cell division and neurogenesis. ASPM forms a complex with the microtubule-severing ATPase katanin, specifically interacting with its p60 and p80 subunits. This interaction is essential for regulating spindle orientation and microtubule dynamics at spindle poles. The ASPM-katanin complex localizes to spindle poles during mitosis, and knockouts of ASPM or katanin subunits result in spindle defects (Jiang2017Microtubule).

ASPM also interacts with citron kinase (CITK), a cytokinesis regulator, to modulate spindle orientation in a kinase-dependent manner. This interaction supports ASPM's role in maintaining proper spindle orientation and cell division (Wu2023The).

In the context of DNA damage repair, ASPM is recruited to DNA damage sites where it protects the breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) from degradation by antagonizing the ubiquitination mediated by HERC2, an E3 ligase. This interaction promotes efficient homologous recombination and maintains chromosome stability (Wu2023The).

ASPM also stabilizes disheveled-3 (Dvl-3), enhancing Wnt-induced β-catenin transcriptional activity, which is significant in cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenicity (Wu2023The).
