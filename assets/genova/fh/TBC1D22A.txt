# TBC1D22A

## Overview
TBC1D22A is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 22A, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, particularly within the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TBC1D22A plays a crucial role in maintaining Golgi morphology and function by interacting with ACBD3, a protein essential for Golgi organization, and regulating the localization and activity of PI4KB, a kinase involved in phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate metabolism (Greninger2013ACBD3). Additionally, TBC1D22A influences the trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from the ER to the Golgi, impacting their cell surface expression and highlighting its significance in cellular signaling and homeostasis (Wei2019Specific). The gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and potentially in lipid metabolic disorders and melanoma, suggesting its broader relevance in human health and disease (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16; Belhedi2013A; Duan2021Regulation).

## Function
TBC1D22A is a protein involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, particularly in the context of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases, which are crucial for vesicle transport. TBC1D22A is localized to the Golgi membrane and plays a significant role in maintaining Golgi morphology and function. It interacts with ACBD3, a protein important for Golgi organization, and this interaction is crucial for regulating the localization and activity of PI4KB, a kinase involved in phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) metabolism (Greninger2013ACBD3).

TBC1D22A also influences the trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from the ER to the Golgi, affecting their cell surface expression. This regulatory function is mediated through its GAP activity, which inactivates specific Rab GTPases, although not Rab7 and Rab33, as these do not regulate GPCR transport (Wei2019Specific). The protein's role in GPCR trafficking highlights its importance in cellular signaling and homeostasis (Wei2019Specific). Additionally, TBC1D22A may be involved in lipid metabolism, as suggested by studies on its orthologs, indicating a potential role in maintaining lipid homeostasis (Duan2021Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
The TBC1D22A gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly in the context of genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). A study on a consanguineous Tunisian family identified a new locus on chromosome 22q13.31, which includes the TBC1D22A gene, as potentially linked to GEFS+. Although no specific mutations were found in the exons of TBC1D22A, the study suggests that the disease mutation might reside in an intron or the 3'UTR, affecting splicing and contributing to the pathogenesis of GEFS+ (Belhedi2013A).

In addition to its potential role in epilepsy, TBC1D22A has been associated with lipid metabolism. Research in Drosophila suggests that the human orthologs of dTBC1D22, including TBC1D22A, may play a role in lipid homeostasis, potentially linking them to lipid metabolic disorders (Duan2021Regulation). Furthermore, TBC1D22A has been studied in the context of melanoma, where its mRNA expression levels were found to be significantly increased in metastatic cases, suggesting a potential role as a prognostic marker (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16). These findings indicate that alterations in TBC1D22A expression or function may contribute to various disease processes.

## Interactions
TBC1D22A interacts with the Golgi adaptor protein ACBD3, a multifunctional protein involved in organizing cellular functions and viral replication. This interaction is specific and occurs at the Golgi apparatus, where TBC1D22A is localized. The binding between TBC1D22A and ACBD3 is mediated by a predicted alpha-helix in TBC1D22A, specifically between residues 90 and 105, with a critical valine-leucine residue pair required for binding. This interaction is independent of the RabGAP domain of TBC1D22A (Greninger2013ACBD3).

TBC1D22A competes with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase class III beta (PI4KB) for binding to ACBD3, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for PI4KB recruitment. This competition is independent of RabGAP activity and involves only the N terminus of TBC1D22A (Greninger2013ACBD3).

The interaction of TBC1D22A with ACBD3 is differentially affected by viral 3A proteins. Kobuviral 3A proteins prevent TBC1D22A from binding to ACBD3, while enteroviral 3A proteins do not have this effect. This suggests that different viral 3A proteins can influence the competition between TBC1D22A and PI4KB for ACBD3 binding (Greninger2013ACBD3).
