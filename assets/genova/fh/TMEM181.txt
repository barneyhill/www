# TMEM181

## Overview
TMEM181 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 181, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by their ability to span cellular membranes. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cellular communication, due to its structural role in the membrane. Transmembrane proteins like TMEM181 are integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating interactions between the cell and its external environment. The specific functions and interactions of TMEM181 are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in pathways that are critical for cellular function and development (Qiu2020aarFDC).
