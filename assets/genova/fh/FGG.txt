# FGG

## Overview
The FGG gene encodes the fibrinogen gamma chain, a critical component of the fibrinogen protein complex involved in blood coagulation. Fibrinogen is a soluble plasma glycoprotein that is converted by thrombin into fibrin during blood clot formation. The gamma chain, one of the three polypeptide chains in fibrinogen, plays a pivotal role in the polymerization and stabilization of fibrin, contributing to the formation of a stable blood clot. It is involved in key interactions with thrombin and other coagulation factors, facilitating the cross-linking and structural integrity of the fibrin network. The gamma chain exists in two main forms, γA and γ′, each with distinct functional roles in hemostasis. Mutations in the FGG gene can lead to various fibrinogen disorders, such as dysfibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia, which are characterized by abnormal bleeding and thrombotic events (Xu2024A; MOSESSON2001The; ASSELTA2006The).

## Structure
The FGG gene encodes the gamma chain of fibrinogen, a crucial component of the fibrinogen molecule involved in blood clotting. The gamma chain is a 47 kDa polypeptide consisting of 411 amino acid residues (ASSELTA2006The). It forms part of the fibrinogen molecule, which is a 340-kDa glycoprotein composed of two identical heterotrimers, each containing one Aα, one Bβ, and one γ chain (ASSELTA2006The). The gamma chain contributes to the formation of the distal globular D domains, which are connected to a central E domain by coiled-coil regions (ASSELTA2006The).

The gamma chain undergoes glycosylation at a single asparagine residue at position 52, contributing to the microheterogeneity observed in fibrinogen (ASSELTA2006The). There is also a minor variant of the gamma chain, known as the γ' chain, which results from intron 9 retention and accounts for about 8% of the total gamma chain population. This variant replaces the last four amino acids of the major γA form with a 20-amino-acid sequence (ASSELTA2006The).

The assembly of fibrinogen involves the formation of Aα-γ and Bβ-γ dimers, followed by the addition of a third chain and dimerization of Aα-Bβ-γ half-molecules to form the hexameric fibrinogen. This process is stabilized by 29 inter- and intrachain disulfide bonds (ASSELTA2006The).

## Function
The FGG gene encodes the gamma chain of fibrinogen, a crucial component in the blood coagulation process. Fibrinogen is a glycoprotein composed of three pairs of polypeptide chains: alpha, beta, and gamma. The gamma chain exists in two forms, γA and γ′, each playing distinct roles in hemostasis. The γA chain is involved in platelet aggregation by interacting with the platelet fibrinogen receptor, αIIbβ3, while the γ′ chain binds plasma factor XIII B subunits and acts as a carrier for the catalytic A subunits, although it does not bind to the platelet receptor (MOSESSON2001The).

The gamma chain is essential for fibrin polymerization and cross-linking, processes critical for forming stable blood clots. It contains important sites for polymerization, including the 'a' polymerization site, which interacts with the 'A' site on another fibrin molecule to form protofibrils. The gamma chain also has a calcium-binding site and a crosslinking site for factor XIIIa, which stabilizes the clot by forming covalent bonds between gamma chains (Côté1998γChain). These interactions are vital for maintaining hemostasis and tissue repair in healthy human cells (MOSESSON2001The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FGG gene, which encodes the gamma chain of fibrinogen, are associated with several congenital fibrinogen disorders. These include dysfibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia, afibrinogenemia, and hypodysfibrinogenemia, each characterized by varying degrees of bleeding and thrombotic events. Dysfibrinogenemia often results from mutations in FGG exon 8 and can lead to mild bleeding symptoms or be asymptomatic, with diagnosis often occurring incidentally (Castaman2019Risk; Mohsenian2021Clinical). Hypodysfibrinogenemia, caused by mutations such as the novel missense mutation FGG c.1168G > T, is characterized by low plasma fibrinogen levels and a bleeding phenotype, with more severe clinical manifestations compared to other variants (Xu2024A).

In Polish patients, three novel mutations in the FGG gene were identified, each associated with different clinical phenotypes, including bleeding disorders and obstetric complications (Wypasek2019Genetic). A case report also highlighted a truncating mutation in FGG, leading to hypofibrinogenemia and neurological symptoms, suggesting a broader impact of FGG mutations beyond coagulation disorders (Stephen2018Cortical). These findings underscore the clinical significance of FGG mutations in the pathogenesis of fibrinogen-related disorders.

## Interactions
The fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG) is involved in several critical interactions within the coagulation pathway. It plays a central role in fibrin polymerization, a process essential for blood clot formation. The gamma chain interacts with thrombin, which catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, forming a stable clot. This interaction is crucial for the 'A:a' interaction, a key step in fibrin polymerization (Xu2024A).

FGG is also involved in protein-protein interactions that influence its function and stability. For instance, mutations in the gamma chain, such as the γD390Y mutation, can significantly alter hydrogen bonding, affecting the protein's structural stability and its ability to polymerize fibrin (Xu2024A). These interactions are vital for maintaining the integrity and function of fibrinogen.

Additionally, FGG is part of a larger fibrinogen complex composed of two sets of three polypeptide chains: alpha, beta, and gamma. This complex formation is necessary for proper fibrinogen secretion and function. Mutations in the gamma chain, such as W253C, can impair fibrinogen secretion by affecting the assembly and stability of the fibrinogen hexamer (Vu2005Hypofibrinogenaemia).
