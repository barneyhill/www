# ZNF713

## Overview
ZNF713 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 713, a member of the Krüppel-type zinc-finger protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and enable its function as a transcription factor. The zinc finger protein 713 contains a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression, suggesting its role in regulating gene expression. ZNF713 is notably expressed in the brain, particularly in the fetal temporal lobe, indicating a potential role in neurodevelopmental processes. The gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including autism spectrum disorder and metabolic dysregulation, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Bonelli2020Identification; Metsu2014A).

## Structure
ZNF713 is a member of the Krüppel-type zinc-finger protein family, characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains that facilitate DNA binding. These domains are typically rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which coordinate zinc ions to stabilize the structure. The primary structure of ZNF713 includes these zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its role as a transcription factor (Metsu2014A).

The secondary structure of zinc finger proteins generally includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of the zinc finger motifs. These motifs allow the protein to interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a stable three-dimensional conformation, essential for its function in gene regulation (Metsu2014A).

ZNF713 contains a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is a transcriptional repression domain found in many zinc finger proteins. This domain plays a role in modulating the transcriptional activity of the protein (Metsu2014A). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination may occur, affecting the protein's function and stability. Splice variants of ZNF713 may exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with diverse functions (Metsu2014A).

## Function
ZNF713 is a member of the Krüppel-type zinc-finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding. These proteins often function as transcription factors, regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. ZNF713 is expressed from a transcription start site located near a CGG-associated CpG island, with significant expression in the brain, particularly in the fetal temporal lobe, suggesting a potential role in brain development or function (Metsu2014A).

The protein encoded by ZNF713 includes a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is a common feature of transcriptional repressors. KRAB-containing zinc-finger proteins are primary regulators of transcription, and mutations in such transcription factors are often associated with diseases (Metsu2014A). In healthy human cells, ZNF713 is likely involved in transcriptional regulation, impacting cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. It is typically active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional regulation of target genes, thereby affecting cellular and organismal functions (Metsu2014A).

The expression pattern of ZNF713, particularly its enrichment in the brain, highlights its potential significance in neurodevelopmental processes (Metsu2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF713 gene have been implicated in several disorders, particularly neurodevelopmental conditions. A study identified a CGG-repeat expansion mutation in ZNF713 associated with the folate-sensitive fragile site FRA7A, which was observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This mutation led to hypermethylation and reduced expression of ZNF713, suggesting a potential link between the gene's transcriptional misregulation and ASD (Metsu2014A). The study also noted that the expression of ZNF713 is significantly enriched in the brain, particularly in the fetal temporal lobe, indicating its potential role in brain development and function (Metsu2014A).

In addition to its association with ASD, ZNF713 has been linked to other conditions. It has been identified as a candidate gene involved in umbilical hernia in pigs, suggesting a broader role in developmental abnormalities (Savoldi2021A). Furthermore, ZNF713 has been associated with metabolic dysregulation and retinal disorders, such as MacTel, through genome-wide association studies (Bonelli2020Identification). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in various diseases, although further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance.

## Interactions
ZNF713, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various protein-protein interactions. In a study focusing on the expression and purification of GST/MRPS fusion proteins, ZNF713 was identified as an interacting partner of MRPS10 through a GST pull-down assay. This suggests that ZNF713 may participate in extramitochondrial protein-protein interactions, potentially implicating it in cellular processes beyond its traditional roles (Revathi2021Expression).

In the context of genetic studies, ZNF713 has been associated with a folate-sensitive fragile site (FRA7A) due to a CGG-repeat expansion mutation. This mutation is linked to autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) in two families. The study reported that the expanded allele of ZNF713 showed hypermethylation and reduced expression, indicating a potential regulatory interaction affecting its transcriptional activity (Metsu2014A).

While these studies highlight the involvement of ZNF713 in protein interactions and genetic regulation, specific details about its interactions with nucleic acids or participation in multiprotein complexes remain limited. Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of ZNF713's interactions and their implications in human health and disease.
