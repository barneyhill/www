# TNFAIP8L3

## Overview
TNFAIP8L3, or tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8-like 3, is a gene that encodes the TIPE3 protein, a member of the TIPE (TNFAIP8) family of proteins. TIPE3 is characterized by a conserved TIPE homology (TH) domain, which includes structural features such as α-helix structures and a death effector domain (DED)-like structure, essential for its function as a lipid second messenger transporter (LIN2023Structure; Padmavathi2018Novel). The protein plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly the PI3K/Akt pathway, by facilitating the transport of phospholipids like phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (LIN2023Structure; Bordoloi2018TIPE). This function is crucial in the context of cancer, where TNFAIP8L3 is implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (LIN2023Structure).

## Structure
The TNFAIP8L3 protein, also known as TIPE3, is a member of the TIPE family of proteins, which are characterized by a conserved TIPE homology (TH) domain. This domain includes six to seven α-helix structures and a death effector domain (DED)-like structure, which are crucial for its function (LIN2023Structure; Padmavathi2018Novel). TIPE3 has a unique 19 amino acids N-terminal region and an N-terminal α0 helix connected with α1 via a flexible short hinge motif (LIN2023Structure). The protein contains a large hydrophobic central cavity that serves as a binding site for phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which are important for its role as a lipid second messenger transporter (LIN2023Structure; Bordoloi2018TIPE).

The crystal structure of TIPE3 reveals a central hydrophobic cavity occupied by phospholipids, suggesting a structural role in the protein's function (Bordoloi2018TIPE). Specific amino acid residues, such as Arg181 and Arg197, are involved in phosphoinositide binding, highlighting their importance in the protein's activity (LIN2023Structure). TIPE3 is implicated in cancer progression through its involvement in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (LIN2023Structure).

## Clinical Significance
TNFAIP8L3 (TNF alpha induced protein 8 like 3) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in lipid signaling pathways and its upregulation in tumor cells. It is highly expressed in several cancers, including cervical, colon, non-small cell lung cancer, breast, esophageal cancer, and glioblastoma, where it activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, crucial for tumor cell growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion (LIN2023Structure). In gastric cancer, TNFAIP8L3 promotes tumor cell migration and invasion, and its expression is negatively regulated by miR-9-5p, which suppresses malignant behaviors in gastric cancer cells (Fan2019miR95p).

In glioma, TNFAIP8L3 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, although some studies suggest that its high expression does not significantly affect prognosis compared to low expression (Zhang2024Comprehensive). Genetic alterations in TNFAIP8L3, such as deep deletions and missense mutations, are linked to the prognosis of glioma patients, affecting overall survival and disease-specific survival (Zhang2024Comprehensive). The gene's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint genes in glioma, suggesting a role in tumor immunity (Zhang2024Comprehensive).

## Interactions
TNFAIP8L3, also known as TNF alpha induced protein 8 like 3, is involved in various interactions that influence cancer progression and immune responses. It is associated with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, where it acts as a phosphatidylinositol transporter. This interaction promotes tumor progression by activating PI3K/Akt signaling, leading to increased tumor cell growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion (LIN2023Structure). In breast cancer, TNFAIP8L3 is involved in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which are crucial for tumor invasion and metastasis (LIN2023Structure).

In gastric cancer, TNFAIP8L3 is negatively regulated by miR-9-5p, a microRNA that binds to its 3′UTR. This interaction suppresses TNFAIP8L3 expression, thereby inhibiting the migration of gastric cancer cells. The silencing of TNFAIP8L3 through miR-9-5p leads to reduced tumor growth and migration, highlighting its role in cancer cell dynamics (Fan2019miR95p). These interactions underscore TNFAIP8L3's involvement in key signaling pathways and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer.
