# LRRN2

## Overview
LRRN2, or leucine-rich repeat neuronal 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in critical processes within the nervous system, such as cell adhesion and axon guidance. The LRRN2 protein is characterized by its extracellular leucine-rich repeats, which facilitate essential protein-protein interactions necessary for neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity (Andreae2009Chick). It is predominantly expressed in specific motor neurons and their target tissues, playing a pivotal role in the development and connectivity of the nervous system by functioning downstream of key signaling pathways like Hoxb1 and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (Andreae2009Chick). The precise expression and function of LRRN2 are crucial for the accurate targeting of axons, underscoring its importance in the proper formation and function of neural circuits.

## Function
The LRRN2 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion and axon guidance, primarily within the nervous system. It is a component of the plasma membrane and is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, where it undergoes glycosylation (Andreae2009Chick). LRRN2 contains extracellular leucine-rich repeats, which are crucial for its function in facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity (Andreae2009Chick).

In the context of motor neuron development, LRRN2 is expressed at high levels in rhombomere 4 (r4) motor neurons and their target tissue, the mesodermal pre-muscle mesenchyme of the second branchial arch (BA2). It functions downstream of the Hoxb1 and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathways, which regulate its expression in r4 motor neurons (Andreae2009Chick). Misexpression of LRRN2 can lead to mistargeting of axons, indicating its role in guiding facial motor axons to their target pre-muscle cells in BA2 (Andreae2009Chick). This suggests that LRRN2 is integral to the precise targeting and connectivity of motor neurons, contributing to the proper development and function of the nervous system.
