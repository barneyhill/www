# CSMD2

## Overview
CSMD2 (CUB and Sushi multiple domains 2) is a gene that encodes a synaptic transmembrane protein involved in neuronal development and synaptic function. The protein, also named CSMD2, is characterized by its large extracellular domain containing multiple CUB and Sushi domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the neocortex and hippocampus, and plays a crucial role in synaptic localization and function through interactions with synaptic scaffolding proteins like PSD-95. CSMD2 is implicated in the Reelin/Dab1 signaling pathway, essential for neuronal maturation and dendritic spine development. Beyond its neurological roles, CSMD2 is associated with various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and prognosis. The gene's involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders and its potential as a biomarker in oncology underscore its significance in both neuroscience and cancer research (Gutierrez2020Csmd2; Zhang2022Integrated; Gutierrez2018Csmd2).

## Structure
The CSMD2 gene encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein characterized by a large extracellular domain containing multiple CUB and Sushi domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Zhang2022Integrated; Gutierrez2019Csmd2). The protein structure includes fourteen CUB domains at the N-terminal, separated by a single complement control protein (CCP) domain, followed by 13 series of CCP domains (Zhang2022Integrated). These domains are also known as short consensus repeats (SCR) or Sushi domains, common in many complement inhibitors (Zhang2022Integrated).

The CSMD2 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein with a predicted transmembrane helix located between amino acids 3534-3556 (Gutierrez2019Csmd2). It has a signal peptide in the N-terminal 37 amino acids, with a cleavage site between positions G37-R38 (Gutierrez2019Csmd2). The cytoplasmic tail of CSMD2 contains a PDZ-binding domain, which is crucial for its interaction with synaptic scaffolding proteins like PSD-95, facilitating synaptic localization (Gutierrez2019Csmd2).

The CSMD2 protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and stability. The gene can produce different splice variant isoforms, potentially altering its structural and functional properties (Zhang2022Integrated).

## Function
CSMD2 encodes a synaptic transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in neuronal maturation and synaptic function. It is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the neocortex and hippocampus, and is also found in the retina (Gutierrez2018Csmd2). CSMD2 localizes to dendritic spines and is enriched in the postsynaptic density, where it interacts with synaptic scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. This interaction is mediated by a PDZ-binding domain on the CSMD2 tail, which is crucial for its synaptic targeting (Gutierrez2018Csmd2).

CSMD2 is involved in the Reelin/Dab1 signaling pathway, which is essential for neuronal maturation. It interacts with Dab1 through a specific FENPMY motif in its cytoplasmic tail, playing a critical role in dendritic spine development and maintenance (Gutierrez2020Csmd2). The protein's presence at synapses suggests it influences synaptic connectivity and may affect synaptic ion conductance and plasticity, potentially impacting calcium influx and synaptic activity (Gutierrez2020Csmd2). These functions highlight CSMD2's importance in maintaining synapse maturity and its potential involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders (Gutierrez2020Csmd2).

## Clinical Significance
The CSMD2 gene is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders and cancers. In schizophrenia, genetic studies have identified significant associations between CSMD2 variants and the disease, suggesting that alterations in this gene may contribute to schizophrenia susceptibility (Håvik2011The). CSMD2 is also linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, where its role in synaptic function and neuronal connectivity is crucial (Gutierrez2019Csmd2).

In cancer, CSMD2 expression levels are associated with various tumor types. It is often upregulated in cancers such as breast cancer (BRCA) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), where high expression correlates with poor prognosis (Zhang2022Integrated). Conversely, reduced expression of CSMD2 is linked to adverse outcomes in colorectal cancer, where it is associated with tumor size, lymphatic invasion, and differentiation (Zhang2014Loss). The gene's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression in the tumor microenvironment, indicating its role in immune evasion and immunosuppression in cancers (Zhang2022Integrated). These findings highlight CSMD2's potential as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in oncology.

## Interactions
CSMD2 is a synaptic transmembrane protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in synaptic function and neuronal development. One of its key interactions is with the synaptic scaffold protein PSD-95, mediated by a PDZ-binding motif located at the C-terminus of CSMD2's cytoplasmic tail. This interaction is crucial for the synaptic localization of CSMD2, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in utero electroporation studies (Gutierrez2018Csmd2).

CSMD2 also interacts with the Reelin downstream adapter protein Dab1 through an F/ENPxY consensus motif in its cytoplasmic tail. This interaction is essential for Reelin-mediated neuronal structural development, particularly in dendritic spine maturation. Mutations in this motif disrupt the interaction, leading to abnormal dendritic spine morphology (Gutierrez2020Csmd2).

In cancer research, CSMD2 has been associated with various proteins through a protein-protein interaction network, including experimentally determined interactions with CTSD, SCUBE3, and FOXP2. These interactions suggest a broader role for CSMD2 in cellular processes beyond the nervous system (Zhang2022Integrated).
