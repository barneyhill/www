# STIMATE

## Overview
STIMATE is a gene that encodes the STIM activating enhancer, a multipass membrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a critical mechanism for maintaining calcium homeostasis within cells. As a positive regulator of calcium entry, the STIM activating enhancer interacts with STIM1, a key protein in the SOCE pathway, facilitating its translocation to ER-plasma membrane junctions and promoting calcium influx. This interaction is essential for various cellular processes, including calcium signaling, protein biosynthesis, and gene expression. The STIMATE gene's function is crucial for cellular health, and its dysregulation is associated with several diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Nelson2018Molecular; Wang2021Proteins).

## Function
STIMATE (STIM activating enhancer) is an ER-resident protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a vital process for maintaining calcium homeostasis in cells. It functions as a positive regulator of calcium entry by directly interacting with STIM1, a key protein in the SOCE pathway. The interaction occurs specifically between the C-terminus of STIMATE and the coiled coil 1 (CC1) domain of STIM1. This binding disrupts the auto-inhibitory interaction between the CC1 and SOAR domains of STIM1, promoting its translocation to ER-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions, which facilitates calcium entry into the cell (Nelson2018Molecular).

STIMATE's role in SOCE is essential for various cellular functions, including the regulation of cytosolic and ER calcium levels, protein biosynthesis, gene expression, and cell viability. It aids in the clustering of STIM1 in plasma membrane-associated ER membrane nanodomains, which is critical for the activation of SOCE (Nelson2018Molecular). While the interaction of STIMATE with STIM2 has not been explored, its function in healthy human cells is primarily linked to its regulatory effect on STIM1 and the subsequent facilitation of calcium influx (Nelson2018Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the STIMATE gene can significantly impact calcium homeostasis, which is crucial for various cellular functions. Disruptions in STIMATE's normal interactions with STIM proteins can lead to a range of diseases. For instance, improper calcium signaling due to STIMATE anomalies is implicated in immune disorders, where the immune response may be compromised or improperly regulated. Muscle dysfunction is another potential consequence, as calcium signaling is vital for muscle contraction and function. Neurodegenerative conditions may also arise from altered STIMATE activity, given the importance of calcium in neuronal signaling and health. These associations highlight the clinical significance of STIMATE in maintaining cellular and systemic health, and underscore its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in related diseases.

## Interactions
STIMATE, also known as TMEM110, is a multipass membrane protein that interacts with STIM1, a key regulator of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). STIMATE binds to the coiled coil 1 (CC1) domain of STIM1, disrupting the auto-inhibitory interaction between the CC1 and SOAR domains. This interaction promotes the translocation of STIM1 to ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions, facilitating calcium entry (Nelson2018Molecular; Wang2021Proteins). 

STIMATE's interaction with STIM1 is crucial for the formation and enlargement of STIM1 puncta, which are essential for SOCE activation. Overexpression of STIMATE enhances STIM1 puncta size and formation, leading to increased SOCE activity, while silencing or knockout of STIMATE reduces these effects in various cell types, including HeLa, HEK293, and Jurkat T cells (Wang2021Proteins). 

The interaction between STIMATE and STIM1 involves the C-terminal region of STIMATE (amino acids 214-294) and the CC1 domain of STIM1 (amino acids 233-343). This interaction is important for maintaining and remodeling the cortical ER structure, which is crucial for efficient ER-PM membrane contact site formation during SOCE (Wang2021Proteins).
