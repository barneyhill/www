# ETDA

## Overview
The ETDA gene encodes the protein embryonic testis differentiation homolog A, which plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of embryonic testis. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, which is involved in regulating the expression of genes necessary for testis development. The ETDA gene is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential function in reproductive biology. Mutations or dysregulation of ETDA can lead to disorders of sexual development, highlighting its clinical significance in understanding and potentially treating such conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
