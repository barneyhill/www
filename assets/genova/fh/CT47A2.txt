# CT47A2

## Overview
CT47A2 is a gene that encodes the protein cancer/testis antigen family 47 member A2, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen family. This family of proteins is characterized by its restricted expression pattern, being predominantly expressed in the testis and various cancer types, but not in normal somatic tissues. The protein encoded by CT47A2 is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in its role as a cancer/testis antigen, which makes it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. Its expression is notably associated with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), where it serves as one of the top markers exclusive to this cancer type, highlighting its potential utility as a biomarker and therapeutic target (haase2020igf2bp1).

## Clinical Significance
CT47A2 is a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, which is typically expressed in the testis and various cancer types. Alterations in the expression of CT47A2 have been associated with cancer progression and immune evasion. In particular, CT47A2 has been identified as a cancer testis gene and is listed among the top 20 anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC)-exclusive markers, indicating its potential relevance in immunotherapy and as a biomarker for ATC (haase2020igf2bp1). The expression of CT47A2 in cancerous tissues, such as ATC, suggests its involvement in tumorigenesis and highlights its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy strategies. The gene's expression in cancerous tissues, while typically restricted to the testis in healthy individuals, makes it an attractive target for therapeutic interventions aimed at eliciting an immune response against tumor cells. However, specific details on the clinical significance of CT47A2 beyond its identification as a cancer testis antigen are not extensively covered in the available literature (haase2020igf2bp1).
