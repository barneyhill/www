# GCFC2

## Overview
GCFC2, or GC-rich sequence DNA-binding factor 2, is a gene that encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein known for its affinity to GC-rich DNA sequences. This protein plays a pivotal role in modulating gene expression, influencing cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and differentiation. As a nuclear protein, GCFC2 interacts with various transcription factors and regulatory proteins, forming part of complex networks that govern gene activity. Notably, GCFC2 has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including dyslexia and language impairments, and is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting its involvement in DNA damage response and mRNA processing (Pande2021Single; Eicher2015Dyslexia). Additionally, GCFC2's interactions with calcineurin and its role in the splicing factor 3b protein complex underscore its significance in transcriptional regulation and cellular function (Brauer2019Leveraging; AsselinMullen2017Protein).

## Function
GCFC2, or GC-rich sequence DNA-binding factor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation. This protein binds to GC-rich DNA sequences, influencing gene expression and playing a role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and differentiation. GCFC2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other transcription factors and regulatory proteins to modulate gene activity.

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, GCFC2 has been implicated in dyslexia and language impairment. Studies suggest that genetic markers associated with GCFC2 may influence cortical volume in specific brain regions, such as the right fusiform gyrus, which is linked to language and neurocognitive functions (Eicher2015Dyslexia). The gene is also part of a co-expression module associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's Disease and Multiple System Atrophy, indicating its involvement in DNA damage response and mRNA processing/splicing (Pande2021Single).

Despite these associations, the specific function of GCFC2 in healthy human cells remains less detailed in the literature. However, its role in transcriptional regulation and interaction with GC-rich DNA sequences suggests it is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and gene expression patterns.

## Clinical Significance
The GCFC2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), GCFC2 is identified as a differentially expressed transcript involved in pre-mRNA splicing and spliceosome C complex formation. This suggests a potential role in the pathology of DM1, where it may contribute to cardiac and muscle dysfunction (Dastidar2022Comprehensive). 

In the context of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), a missense variant in the GCFC2 gene, rs141752962, has been associated with the rapid progression of the condition, indicating a possible genetic influence on its development (Lee2021Unveiling). 

Additionally, GCFC2 has been linked to specific reading disabilities and developmental language disorders. Variations in this gene have been associated with changes in gray and white matter structures, potentially affecting interhemispheric connectivity and cognitive functions such as verbal IQ (Landi2019Neuroimaging). 

While these associations highlight the clinical significance of GCFC2, further research is needed to fully understand its role in these conditions and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
GCFC2, also known as GC-rich sequence DNA-binding factor 2, is involved in various protein interactions and plays a role in transcriptional regulation. It has been identified as a calcineurin (CN) interactor, with specific binding kinetics measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), showing a k_on of 2.84 x 10^2 M^-1 s^-1, a k_off of 0.211 s^-1, and a K_D of 752 µM (Brauer2019Leveraging). GCFC2 contains a πφ-LxVx motif, which is involved in CN binding, although the binding affinity of this sequence is relatively low, with a dissociation constant (K_D) of ≥ 500 μM (Brauer2019Leveraging). 

GCFC2 is also part of the splicing factor 3b protein complex, interacting with DHX15, a protein involved in mRNA splicing (AsselinMullen2017Protein). Additionally, GCFC2 has been identified in studies using the MitoID method as a potential interactor with GTPases, although it is considered likely to be a contaminant in this context (Gillingham2019In). These interactions suggest that GCFC2 may participate in multiprotein complexes and influence gene expression through its interactions with other transcription factors and proteins.
