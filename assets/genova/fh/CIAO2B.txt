# CIAO2B

## Overview
CIAO2B is a gene that encodes the protein cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly component 2B, which is integral to the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe/S) protein assembly machinery. This protein is a part of the CIA targeting complex (CTC), which also includes CIAO1 and MMS19, and is essential for the maturation and insertion of Fe/S clusters into cytosolic and nuclear apoproteins. These clusters are vital for the function of various enzymes involved in DNA replication and repair, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity (Petronek2023Maintenance; Braymer2021Mechanistic). The CIAO2B protein is characterized by its ability to form a dimeric structure, facilitating its role in Fe/S cluster binding and delivery (Braymer2021Mechanistic). As a component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) complex, CIAO2B is implicated in processes such as methionine biosynthesis and cellular iron regulation, highlighting its importance in cellular metabolism and homeostasis (Braymer2021Mechanistic).

## Function
CIAO2B is a crucial component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe/S) protein assembly machinery, specifically within the CIA targeting complex (CTC), which also includes CIAO1 and MMS19. This complex is responsible for the insertion of Fe/S clusters into apoproteins, a critical step in the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S proteins (Braymer2021Mechanistic). CIAO2B plays a significant role in the maturation and transfer of [4Fe-4S] clusters to target apo-proteins, which are essential for DNA replication and repair, thereby maintaining genome integrity (Petronek2023Maintenance).

CIAO2B, along with CIAO1, forms a docking site for cytosolic and nuclear apoproteins, facilitating the insertion of [4Fe-4S] clusters into nuclear apo-proteins. This process is crucial for the proper functioning of DNA metabolic enzymes, which act as electrochemical sensors in DNA metabolism, detecting electron transport along the DNA backbone and serving as redox switches to identify and repair DNA damage (Petronek2023Maintenance). The dimeric structure of CIAO2B, with two cysteine residues close to each other, suggests a direct role in Fe/S cluster binding and delivery (Braymer2021Mechanistic).

## Clinical Significance
CIAO2B is implicated in maintaining iron homeostasis and the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters, which are essential for various cellular processes. Alterations in CIAO2B expression or function can lead to significant disruptions in these processes, potentially contributing to disease states. In CIAO2B-depleted cells, there is a decrease in ferritin levels and an increase in transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) mRNA levels, along with increased iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) activity, indicating a state of iron deficiency (Bórquez2022New). This suggests that disruptions in CIAO2B can lead to imbalances in iron metabolism, which may have implications for conditions related to iron homeostasis.

CIAO2B is also part of the cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) complex, which is crucial for the maturation of Fe/S proteins. Disruptions in this complex can affect processes like methionine biosynthesis, genome integrity, and cellular iron regulation (Braymer2021Mechanistic). Although specific diseases directly linked to CIAO2B mutations are not detailed, its role in these critical pathways suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to metabolic disorders or neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of CIAO2B dysfunction.

## Interactions
CIAO2B is a component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein assembly pathway, where it plays a crucial role in the CIA targeting complex (CTC) alongside CIAO1 and MMS19. This complex is responsible for the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins by facilitating the transfer of Fe-S clusters to target proteins. CIAO2B interacts with the narrow-end face of the CIAO1 β-propeller through helices α3 and α4, forming a conserved interaction site essential for yeast viability (Kassube2020FeS). 

CIAO2B also acts as a bridge between CIAO1 and MMS19, with the latter interacting through its C-terminal HEAT-like repeats. This interaction is critical for the function of the CTC and is conserved across eukaryotes (Kassube2020FeS). The complex can form a dimeric structure, with CIAO2B protomers having an extensive interface, which is involved in the recruitment of client proteins (Kassube2020FeS).

CIAO2B is involved in the maturation of several Fe-S proteins, including dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) and ATP-binding cassette protein ABCE1, by forming various sub-complexes with CIA1 and MMS19 (Paul2015Biogenesis). The interaction with MMS19 prevents CIAO2B proteasomal degradation, suggesting a regulatory mechanism to maintain CIA stability (Petronek2023Maintenance).
