# CD101

## Overview
CD101 is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The CD101 protein, also known as IGSF-2, EWI-101, or V7, is characterized by several immunoglobulin-like domains and a conserved EWI motif, suggesting its role as a cell surface receptor involved in immune regulation (RichertSpuhler2021CD101; Wrage2021CD101). This protein is expressed on various immune cells, including T cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells, where it functions as a negative costimulatory and anti-inflammatory molecule. CD101 modulates immune responses by inhibiting T cell proliferation and activation, enhancing the suppressive function of regulatory T cells, and influencing cytokine production (RichertSpuhler2021CD101; Wrage2021CD101). The gene's involvement in immune homeostasis and its association with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and type 1 diabetes underscore its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Schey2016CD101; Wrage2021CD101).

## Structure
The CD101 protein, also known as IGSF-2, EWI-101, or V7, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is characterized by a conserved glutamine-tryptophan-isoleucine (EWI) motif and contains several immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region (RichertSpuhler2021CD101; Wrage2021CD101). The protein has a 20 amino acid hydrophobic signal sequence and a 934 amino acid extracellular domain, which suggests a complex structure with potential for multiple interactions (Wrage2021CD101).

CD101 is heavily glycosylated, a common post-translational modification that can affect its stability and function (Wrage2021CD101). The protein also contains several serine/threonine phosphorylation sites, indicating potential regulatory roles through phosphorylation (Wrage2021CD101). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of immunoglobulin-like domains suggests a folded structure typical of cell surface receptors (RichertSpuhler2021CD101).

The CD101 gene has been associated with various immune functions, but the context does not provide information on splice variant isoforms or detailed structural domains beyond the immunoglobulin-like regions.

## Function
The CD101 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is prominently expressed on various immune cells, including T cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. In healthy human cells, CD101 plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis. It acts as a negative costimulatory and anti-inflammatory molecule, directly or indirectly modulating T cell activation through interactions with dendritic cells (Wrage2021CD101). CD101 inhibits T cell proliferation and activation, impairs CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity, and enhances the suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Wrage2021CD101). 

CD101 is involved in the immunoregulatory processes by inhibiting interleukin-2 (IL-2) production upon T cell receptor activation and is associated with the suppression of effector T cells by Tregs (RichertSpuhler2021CD101). It also plays a role in the balance between anti-inflammatory Treg cells and proinflammatory Th17 cells in mucosal tissues (RichertSpuhler2021CD101). In myeloid cells, CD101 expression induces the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β, while inhibiting the release of IFN-γ, contributing to immune regulation and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Wrage2021CD101).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD101 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions, primarily due to its role in immune regulation. Variants in the CD101 gene have been linked to an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition. These genetic variations can lead to changes in T cell phenotypes and functions, resulting in a proinflammatory environment that may heighten susceptibility to HIV-1 infection (RichertSpuhler2021CD101).

In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, CD101 expression is inversely correlated with disease severity. Reduced CD101 expression on T cells and myeloid cells is associated with increased IL-17 production, suggesting a shift towards a pro-inflammatory Th17 response, which contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD (Schey2016CD101).

CD101 is also implicated in type 1 diabetes (T1D), where its expression is linked to intestinal immune homeostasis. Alterations in CD101 expression can lead to increased intestinal permeability and enteropathy, potentially affecting antigen responses and contributing to the development of T1D (Wrage2021CD101). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CD101 in modulating immune responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in autoimmune and infectious diseases.

## Interactions
CD101, also known as immunoglobulin superfamily member 2 (IGSF2), is a cell surface glycoprotein involved in immune regulation. It is expressed on various immune cells, including T regulatory cells (Tregs), memory T cells, granulocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells. CD101 acts as a negative costimulatory and anti-inflammatory molecule, modulating T cell activation directly or indirectly via dendritic cells (Wrage2021CD101). 

CD101 expression on T cells inhibits their expansion by restricting interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and the expression of IL-2 receptors (IL-2Ra and IL-2Rb). This inhibition is evident as CD101-deficient T cells proliferate more rapidly than CD101-positive T cells. CD101 promotes the development of naive T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are characterized by high IL-2Ra and FoxP3 expression (Schey2016CD101). 

Despite its roles, there are no known intra- or extracellular interaction partners for CD101. The protein's interactions with pattern recognition receptors or antigen presentation by major histocompatibility receptors remain unclear (Wrage2021CD101). CD101's role in diseases like inflammatory bowel disease and type 1 diabetes is being evaluated, given its accumulation in gastrointestinal tissues and its potential impact on immune homeostasis (Wrage2021CD101).
