# MANBAL

## Overview
The MANBAL gene encodes the protein mannosidase beta like, which is a member of the glycoside hydrolase family. This protein is involved in the processing of N-linked glycans, playing a crucial role in the modification and maturation of glycoproteins within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Mannosidase beta like is categorized as a hydrolase enzyme, which facilitates the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in complex carbohydrates. The activity of this enzyme is essential for proper cellular function and protein quality control, impacting various biological processes and pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
