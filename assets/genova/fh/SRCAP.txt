# SRCAP

## Overview
The SRCAP gene encodes the Snf2 related CREBBP activator protein, a pivotal component of the SRCAP complex, which functions as an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler. This protein is integral to the exchange of histone H2A with its variant H2A.Z, a process essential for transcription regulation, DNA replication, and genome stability. As a chromatin remodeling factor, SRCAP is involved in various cellular processes, including intestinal stem cell self-renewal and muscle differentiation. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the androgen receptor and cytokinesis regulators, underscore its role in epigenetic regulation and cell division. Clinically, mutations in the SRCAP gene are linked to Floating-Harbor Syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as potential implications in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Messina2021The; Hood2012Mutations; Vardarajan2017Ultrarare; Cuadrado2010Essential).

## Structure
The SRCAP protein is a chromatin remodeler that plays a crucial role in the exchange of canonical H2A for the histone variant H2A.Z. It is part of a 12-subunit complex that includes RUVBL1, RUVBL2, YL1, ZNHIT1, and ARP6, among others. The SRCAP complex is characterized by a core module that is structurally rigid, while other parts of the complex exhibit flexibility (Park2024Structures). The SRCAP ATPase domain is divided into N-terminal and C-terminal lobes, forming a DNA-binding cleft that interacts with nucleosomal DNA at specific superhelical locations, such as SHL2 and SHL-6 (Park2024Structures).

The SRCAP complex features a unique structural organization, with the YL1 subunit containing an H2A.Z-H2B chaperone domain and a dual arginine anchor motif that interacts with the H2A-H2B acidic patch (Park2024Structures). The complex also includes an HSA domain that serves as a scaffold for a module composed of GAS41, DMAP1, BAF53a, and actin subunits (Park2024Structures). The SRCAP subunit has a large disordered region with AT hooks important for nuclear localization and nucleosome binding, with mutations in this region linked to Floating-Harbor Syndrome (Park2024Structures).

## Function
The SRCAP gene encodes a component of the SRCAP complex, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler involved in the exchange of histone H2A with its variant H2A.Z in nucleosomes. This process is crucial for transcription regulation, as H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes are enriched at promoter regions and play a role in RNA polymerase II initiation and elongation. The SRCAP complex facilitates this histone exchange by binding to nucleosomes and inducing conformational changes that destabilize the H2A-H2B dimer, allowing for the incorporation of H2A.Z. This exchange is important for DNA replication, repair, and chromosome segregation, contributing to genome stability (Yu2024Structural).

In intestinal stem cells (ISCs), SRCAP is essential for self-renewal and intestinal epithelial regeneration. It interacts with the RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) and recruits it to the Prdm16 promoter, activating PPARd signaling, which is crucial for maintaining ISC self-renewal (Ye2020The). SRCAP is also involved in muscle differentiation, where it facilitates the incorporation of H2A.Z at the myogenin promoter, essential for muscle-specific gene expression and myoblast fusion (Cuadrado2010Essential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SRCAP gene are primarily associated with Floating-Harbor Syndrome (FHS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature, delayed bone maturation, language deficits, and distinctive facial features. These mutations are typically heterozygous truncating variants located in the final exon of the SRCAP gene, specifically between codons 2,407 and 2,517, and are often de novo (Hood2012Mutations). The mutations result in a truncated SRCAP protein that disrupts normal DNA-binding activity, potentially leading to a dominant negative effect (Messina2021The).

In addition to FHS, truncating variants in SRCAP outside the FHS locus have been linked to a distinct neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral and psychiatric issues, musculoskeletal problems, and hypotonia. This condition is identified by a specific DNA methylation signature, which differs from that of FHS, suggesting a divergent pathogenic mechanism (Rots2021Truncating).

Furthermore, ultra-rare missense mutations in SRCAP have been implicated in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in certain populations, with higher SRCAP expression associated with increased risk and cognitive decline (Vardarajan2017Ultrarare). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance in various developmental and neurological conditions.

## Interactions
SRCAP (Snf2 related CREBBP activator protein) is a chromatin remodeling factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is the core catalytic subunit of a chromatin-remodeling complex responsible for the exchange of histone H2A with the H2A.Z variant, playing a significant role in epigenetic regulation (Messina2021The). SRCAP interacts with several cytokinesis regulators, including Anillin, Cit-K, MKLP2, Aurora B, INCENP, MKLP1, PLK1, Cep55, Alix, and Spastin, which are crucial for successful cell division (Messina2021The). These interactions are observed in chromatin-free protein extracts from telophase-synchronized HeLa cells, indicating SRCAP's direct role in cytokinesis (Messina2021The).

SRCAP also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells, enhancing AR-mediated transcriptional activation of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation studies, demonstrating a physical association between SRCAP and AR (Slupianek2010The). SRCAP is recruited to androgen-responsive elements within the PSA gene, and its presence is detected at the PSA promoter under both basal and hormone-induced conditions (Slupianek2010The).

Structurally, the SRCAP complex includes a motor module that interacts with nucleosomal DNA and the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 hexamer, forming a stable association crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling (Yu2024Structural). The complex also involves the ARP6-ZNHIT1 heterodimer, which makes extensive contacts with the hexamer, facilitating histone exchange by destabilizing H2A-H2B dimers (Yu2024Structural).
