# RNF138

## Overview
RNF138 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 138, a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and protein degradation. The protein is characterized by its C3HC4 RING finger domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, and additional zinc finger domains that facilitate interactions with single-stranded DNA during repair processes (Xu2017Rnf138; Ismail2015The). RNF138 is involved in the regulation of DNA double-strand break repair, particularly promoting homologous recombination by facilitating the displacement of the Ku80 protein from DNA ends (Ismail2015The; Schwertman2016Regulation). Beyond its role in DNA repair, RNF138 interacts with various proteins, influencing pathways such as NF-κB signaling and antiviral responses (Zeng2023RNF138; Lu2022RING). Clinically, alterations in RNF138 expression have been linked to several cancers, including glioma and colorectal cancer, where it may serve as a potential therapeutic target due to its involvement in tumor progression and resistance to treatments (Wu2018Downregulation; Lu2022RING).

## Structure
RNF138 is a protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It contains an N-terminal C3HC4 RING finger domain, which is a type of zinc finger domain involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity (Xu2017Rnf138; Ismail2015The). The protein also includes three internal zinc finger domains, which are essential for binding to single-stranded DNA overhangs during DNA repair processes (Yard2016RNF138; Ismail2015The). At the C-terminus, RNF138 features a ubiquitin interaction motif (UIM), which is important for its interaction with other proteins, such as NIBP in the regulation of NF-κB signaling (Lu2022RING).

RNF138 undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which is central to its role in DNA repair and protein degradation pathways (Ismail2015The). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various partners, such as RAD51D and Ku80, facilitating its involvement in DNA damage response and repair (Yard2016RNF138; Ismail2015The). The presence of these domains and modifications underscores RNF138's multifaceted role in cellular processes.

## Function
RNF138 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in DNA repair processes, particularly in the context of homologous recombination (HR) in mammalian cells. It is involved in the regulation of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by promoting DNA end resection, a critical step for HR. RNF138 achieves this by ubiquitylating the Ku80 subunit of the Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer, facilitating its displacement from DSB ends, which is necessary for end-resection factors to access the break sites (Ismail2015The; Schwertman2016Regulation). This action promotes HR over non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), thereby influencing the choice of DNA repair pathway and maintaining genomic stability (Ismail2015The).

RNF138 is active during the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, ensuring that HR occurs when a sister chromatid is available as a template (Ismail2015The; Schwertman2016Regulation). It interacts with several DNA damage response proteins and is crucial for the recruitment of HR factors like RPA, CtIP, Exo1, and BLM to damage sites (Ismail2015The). RNF138's activity is regulated by its zinc finger domains, which are essential for its localization to DNA damage sites (Ismail2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNF138 gene have been implicated in several cancers, including glioma, colorectal cancer (CRC), and glioblastoma. In glioma, RNF138 is overexpressed, and its downregulation has been shown to inhibit cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing the Erk signaling pathway. This suggests that RNF138 could be a potential therapeutic target for glioma treatment (Wu2018Downregulation).

In colorectal cancer, RNF138 is downregulated, which is associated with poor prognosis. Its deficiency leads to aberrant NF-κB signaling, promoting the transition from colitis to aggressive malignancy. RNF138 acts as a suppressor of CRC tumorigenesis by preventing excessive activation of NF-κB signaling, and its downregulation correlates with more aggressive tumor phenotypes and poorer clinical outcomes (Lu2022RING).

In glioblastoma, RNF138 is highly expressed and contributes to radioresistance by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of rpS3, a process crucial for resisting radiation-induced apoptosis. Targeting RNF138 in glioblastoma cells has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance radiosensitivity (Kim2018RNF138mediated).

## Interactions
RNF138, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with IRF3, a key transcription factor in antiviral responses, inhibiting its activation. This interaction is modulated during viral infection, with RNF138 associating with the transcriptional activation domain of IRF3 (Zeng2023RNF138). RNF138 also interacts with PTEN, promoting its polyubiquitination, which inhibits PTEN's ability to facilitate IRF3 nuclear translocation, thereby suppressing IRF3 activation (Zeng2023RNF138).

In the context of DNA repair, RNF138 interacts with RAD51D, a member of the RAD51 family involved in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair. RNF138 ubiquitinates RAD51D, regulating its degradation and maintaining chromosome integrity (Yard2016RNF138). It also interacts with the Ku80 protein, promoting its ubiquitylation to facilitate DNA end resection, a critical step in HR repair (Ismail2015The).

In glioblastoma cells, RNF138 interacts with ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3), mediating its ubiquitination and degradation, which contributes to radioresistance by inhibiting rpS3/DDIT3-dependent apoptotic signaling (Kim2018RNF138mediated). These interactions highlight RNF138's role in regulating diverse cellular pathways through its ubiquitin ligase activity.
