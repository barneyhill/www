# C17orf50

## Overview
C17orf50 is a gene located on chromosome 17 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 17 open reading frame 50. This protein is currently not well-characterized, and its specific biological functions remain largely undefined. Preliminary studies suggest that the C17orf50 protein may play a role in reproductive biology, as it has been detected in human testis tissue (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). Additionally, genetic variations within or near the C17orf50 gene have been associated with coronary artery disease, indicating a potential involvement in cardiovascular health (Unknownauthors2023Cardiovasculardiseasesandcardiacbiomarkers). Despite these associations, the precise molecular mechanisms and pathways involving C17orf50 are not yet fully understood, necessitating further research to clarify its function and significance in human biology.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the C17orf50 gene is primarily associated with its potential link to coronary artery disease (CAD). Research has identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near the C17orf50 gene that are statistically associated with CAD at the genotype level. Among these, one variant located in the upstream region of the C17orf50 gene shows a significant association with CAD at both genotypic and allelic levels (Unknownauthors2023Cardiovasculardiseasesandcardiacbiomarkers). However, beyond this association with CAD, there is limited information on specific diseases or conditions directly linked to mutations, expression level changes, or interaction alterations in the C17orf50 gene.

The gene has been detected in human testis, suggesting a role in reproductive biology, but no specific conditions related to its expression in this context have been documented (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). Despite its detection and potential involvement in certain biological processes, the precise clinical implications of C17orf50 remain largely unexplored, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in human health and disease.
