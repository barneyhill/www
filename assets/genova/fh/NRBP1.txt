# NRBP1

## Overview
Nuclear receptor binding protein 1 (NRBP1) is a gene that encodes a pseudokinase protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell fate determination, proliferation, and differentiation. Despite lacking catalytic activity due to the absence of critical kinase motifs, the NRBP1 protein retains a typical eukaryotic protein kinase fold, suggesting its role as an adaptor protein in signaling pathways (Kerr2013Nuclear). It is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular homeostasis (Wilson2012Nuclear). NRBP1 is ubiquitously expressed and interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that regulate protein degradation and cellular signaling pathways, such as WNT, which are crucial for maintaining normal cellular function and preventing tumorigenesis (Wilson2012Nuclear; Yasukawa2020NRBP1Containing). The protein's involvement in various cancers highlights its dual role as a tumor suppressor and oncogene, depending on the cellular context (Ruiz2012High; Liao2018Nuclear).

## Structure
NRBP1 is a pseudokinase that lacks the critical motifs necessary for kinase activity, such as DFG, HRD, and VAIK, resulting in a degraded ATP-binding site and absence of catalytic activity (Kerr2013Nuclear). Despite this, NRBP1 retains a typical eukaryotic protein kinase fold, suggesting it may have non-catalytic roles in cellular processes (Kerr2013Nuclear). The protein is composed of 535 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 59.8 kDa (Hooper2000Cloning). 

NRBP1 contains several functional domains, including two nuclear receptor-binding motifs (LXXLL), a binding domain for Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins, and a BC-box motif (Wilson2012Nuclear; Hooper2000Cloning). It also has nuclear export and localization signals, a MLF1-binding region, and a TSC22-binding region (Kerr2013Nuclear). The protein is rich in PEST sequences, which may lead to its rapid degradation (Hooper2000Cloning).

NRBP1 is highly conserved across species, with 98.3% protein homology between human and mouse homologues (Kerr2013Nuclear). It is classified as a Class 1 pseudokinase, indicating it does not bind nucleotides or cations (Murphy2013A). The protein's structure and interactions suggest it functions as an adaptor protein, linking signaling pathways involving nuclear receptors and SH2 domain-containing proteins (Hooper2000Cloning).

## Function
NRBP1 (nuclear receptor binding protein 1) is a pseudokinase involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell fate, proliferation, and differentiation. It is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular homeostasis (Wilson2012Nuclear; Yasukawa2020NRBP1Containing). In healthy human cells, NRBP1 is involved in maintaining the balance between differentiation and proliferation, particularly in the intestinal crypt-villus axis, where it regulates intestinal progenitor cell homeostasis (Wilson2012Nuclear).

NRBP1 functions as part of a ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting proteins such as BRI2 and BRI3 for degradation, which is crucial for regulating amyloid β production (Yasukawa2020NRBP1Containing). It forms a heterodimeric complex with Cul2 and Cul4A, enhancing the ubiquitination process and maintaining protein homeostasis (Yasukawa2020NRBP1Containing). NRBP1's interaction with the Elongin BC complex suggests it may function as a substrate recognition subunit of a Cul5 E3 ligase complex, playing a role in protein turnover (Wilson2012Nuclear).

In the context of cellular signaling, NRBP1 interacts with pathways such as WNT, influencing cellular differentiation and proliferation (Wilson2012Nuclear). Its role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and preventing tumorigenesis (Wilson2012Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
NRBP1 (nuclear receptor binding protein 1) has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression. In colorectal cancer (CRC), NRBP1 expression is significantly downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival, suggesting that NRBP1 acts as a tumor suppressor in CRC (Liao2018Nuclear).

Conversely, in prostate cancer, high NRBP1 expression is linked to poor clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival and tumor-specific survival. This suggests an oncogenic role for NRBP1 in prostate cancer, where it promotes cancer cell growth (Ruiz2012High). Similarly, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), NRBP1 is associated with poor prognosis and is required for efficient migration, invasion, and proliferation of cancer cells, indicating its oncogenic potential in this context (Yang2023The).

NRBP1 also plays a role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where mutations in the gene are linked to enhanced survival and growth of cancer cells, further supporting its context-specific oncogenic role (Chandrani2015Integrated). In lung cancer, reduced NRBP1 levels correlate with poor prognosis, reinforcing its tumor suppressor function in certain cancers (Wilson2012Nuclear).

## Interactions
NRBP1 (nuclear receptor binding protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with Elongin BC, forming part of a Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex, specifically with Cul2 and Cul4A, which targets proteins such as BRI2 and BRI3 for degradation. This interaction is crucial for regulating amyloid β production, as BRI2 and BRI3 negatively regulate amyloid precursor protein processing (Yasukawa2020NRBP1Containing).

NRBP1 also interacts with Jab1, inhibiting AP-1 transcriptional activity by interfering with Jab1-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation. This interaction is specific to AP-1 and does not affect NFκB activation (Wang2006Adapter).

In the context of breast cancer, NRBP1 interacts with SALL4, negatively regulating its expression. This interaction affects cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and drug sensitivity, suggesting a role in cancer cell behavior (Yang2022NRBP1).

NRBP1 is also implicated in the ERK-NRBP1-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway, which is involved in the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine. It interacts with CREB, contributing to the upregulation of BDNF in microglia (Yao2021Microglial).
