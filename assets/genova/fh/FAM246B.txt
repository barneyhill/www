# FAM246B

## Overview
FAM246B is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 246, member B. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. FAM246B is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein, and it is implicated in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways. The protein's role in these pathways suggests it may have a significant impact on cell growth and differentiation. Research has indicated potential interactions with other proteins that could influence its function in cellular contexts (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the precise mechanisms of FAM246B and its encoded protein could provide insights into its involvement in health and disease.
