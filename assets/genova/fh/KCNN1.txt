# KCNN1

## Overview
The KCNN1 gene encodes the protein potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily N member 1, also known as the KCa2.1 channel, which is a member of the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. These channels are integral membrane proteins characterized by their six transmembrane domains and a pore-forming loop that is essential for potassium ion selectivity. The KCa2.1 channel plays a crucial role in linking intracellular calcium levels to changes in membrane potential, thereby regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. The protein's function is mediated through its interaction with calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein, which binds to the channel's C-terminal domain. KCNN1 expression is predominantly observed in the brain, where it contributes to maintaining neuronal signaling and homeostasis. Additionally, the gene has been studied in the context of Ewing Sarcoma, although its clinical significance as a prognostic marker remains uncertain due to the lack of functional protein expression in these cancer cells (Fuest2022Relevance; Shmukler2001Structure; Pedarzani2008Molecular).

## Structure
The KCNN1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels, specifically the KCa2.1 channel. This protein is characterized by having six transmembrane domains with a pore-forming loop between the fifth and sixth domains, which includes a GYG-type selectivity sequence crucial for potassium ion selectivity (Shmukler2001Structure). The protein's structure also features intracellular N- and C-termini, with the C-terminal domain containing a calmodulin binding 'A-D box' that is essential for its function and shows high identity with human and rat SK1 sequences (Shmukler2001Structure).

The KCNN1 protein can form tetrameric structures, which are important for its quaternary structure and function as a channel (Shmukler2001Structure). Alternative splicing of the KCNN1 gene results in multiple isoforms with variations in both N-terminal and C-terminal sequences, affecting the calmodulin binding properties and potentially altering channel function (Shmukler2001Structure). These splice variants contribute to the diversity of the protein's functional properties, with some variants lacking sequences encoded in specific exons, leading to altered domains necessary for calmodulin binding (Shmukler2001Structure).

## Function
KCNN1 encodes a protein that forms part of the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels, specifically the SK1 or KCa2.1 channel. These channels are crucial in linking intracellular calcium transients to changes in membrane potential, thereby regulating neuronal excitability and function. SK channels are activated by calcium binding to calmodulin, which is associated with the channel subunits, and they allow potassium ions to flow out of cells in response to increased intracellular calcium levels (Pedarzani2008Molecular; Berkefeld2010Ca2+Activated).

In healthy human cells, SK channels, including those formed by KCNN1, play a significant role in modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity. They contribute to the afterhyperpolarization following action potentials, which influences the firing patterns of neurons. This function is particularly important in the central nervous system, where SK channels are involved in a calcium-mediated feedback loop with NMDA receptors, affecting the threshold for hippocampal long-term potentiation (Pedarzani2008Molecular).

The expression of KCNN1 is primarily observed in the brain, where it helps maintain normal neuronal excitability and function by regulating potassium ion flow, which is essential for neuronal signaling and homeostasis (Wang2023A).

## Clinical Significance
The KCNN1 gene, which encodes the KCa2.1 channel, has been studied for its role in Ewing Sarcoma (EwS), a type of cancer. Despite high KCNN1 mRNA levels in EwS cells, there is no corresponding KCa2.1 channel activity, suggesting that the mRNA may not be translated into functional protein due to post-transcriptional modifications or degradation (Fuest2022Relevance). The expression of KCNN1 is driven by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion oncogene, which is characteristic of EwS, indicating a potential regulatory mechanism (Fuest2022Relevance). However, KCNN1 expression does not correlate with clinical parameters or overall survival in EwS patients, making it unsuitable as a prognostic marker (Fuest2022Relevance).

In contrast, another study suggests that KCNN1 overexpression, regulated by EWS-FLI1, promotes cell proliferation in EwS, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Dupuy2023Chimeric). The study highlights that KCNN1 expression is largely restricted to EwS tissues, suggesting its specificity as a biomarker (Dupuy2023Chimeric). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of KCNN1 in terms of prognosis or therapy for EwS remains unclear due to the lack of functional protein expression (Fuest2022Relevance).

## Interactions
The KCNN1 gene encodes the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel SK1, which interacts with calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein essential for its activation. Calmodulin binds to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the SK1 channel subunits in a Ca2+-independent manner, which is crucial for the channel's function (Shmukler2001Structure). The interaction with calmodulin is influenced by alternative splicing of the SK1 gene, resulting in multiple polypeptide variants with different calmodulin binding properties (Shmukler2001Structure).

The SK1 channel also forms tetrameric complexes, potentially with other SK channel subtypes, such as SK2, to create functional hetero-dimeric concatemers (Shmukler2001Structure). The presence of specific exon deletions can alter the interaction with calmodulin and affect phosphorylation sites, which may influence protein interactions (Shmukler2001Structure).

In studies involving Ewing sarcoma cells, KCNN1 expression is driven by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion oncogene, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Fuest2022Relevance). Despite high mRNA expression, the functional role of KCNN1 in these cells remains unclear, as no significant protein interactions or channel activity have been observed (Fuest2022Relevance).
