# EFNB3

## Overview
EFNB3 is a gene that encodes the ephrin B3 protein, a member of the ephrin family involved in cell signaling. Ephrin B3 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in neuronal development and synaptic function. It is characterized by an extracellular EPH-binding domain and a cytoplasmic PDZ-binding motif, which facilitate its interaction with EphB receptor tyrosine kinases, thereby influencing synapse density and dendritic spine formation (Xu2011A; Katoh2006Comparative). The protein is involved in both forward and reverse signaling pathways, impacting synaptic maturation and plasticity. Ephrin B3's interactions are essential for maintaining synaptic integrity and have been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including hypertension and glioblastoma (Royet2017EphrinB3; Henderson2019EphrinB3).

## Structure
The EFNB3 gene encodes the ephrin B3 protein, which is a member of the ephrin family involved in cell signaling. Ephrin B3 is a transmembrane protein characterized by an extracellular EPH-binding domain and a cytoplasmic PDZ-binding motif (Katoh2006Comparative). The protein consists of five exons and encodes a 340-amino-acid sequence, with a high degree of amino acid identity to its orthologs in chimpanzees and mice (Katoh2006Comparative).

The extracellular domain of ephrin B3 is crucial for its interaction with EPH receptors, facilitating bi-directional signaling. This domain is highly conserved among EFNB family members, ensuring effective receptor binding (Katoh2006Comparative). The cytoplasmic region contains five tyrosine residues, which are important for reverse signaling and can undergo phosphorylation, affecting synaptic and dendritic development (Xu2011A).

Ephrin B3 can exist in different splice variant isoforms, which may influence its functional interactions and signaling capabilities. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in ephrins, potentially affecting their stability and receptor interactions (Katoh2006Comparative). The structural integrity and function of ephrin B3 are essential for its role in neuronal development and viral entry facilitation (Priyadarsinee2022Glycoprotein; Xu2011A).

## Function
Ephrin-B3 (EFNB3) is a critical regulator of synaptic function and development in the brain. It plays a significant role in synapse density and dendritic spine formation by interacting with EphB receptor tyrosine kinases. This interaction is crucial for synapse maturation and the regulation of excitatory synaptic inputs, as ephrin-B3 inhibits postsynaptic MAPK signaling, which is essential for controlling synapse density (McClelland2010Transsynaptic). Ephrin-B3 also functions through a competitive mechanism, where neurons with higher levels of ephrin-B3 expression have an advantage in forming synapses, influencing synaptic distribution without altering the total number of synapses (Henderson2019EphrinB3).

Ephrin-B3 is involved in reverse signaling, interacting with presynaptic EphB receptors to stimulate dendrite pruning and spine maturation. This process recruits downstream molecules such as Grb4, Pick1, and syntenin, which are involved in cytoskeletal regulation and synaptic structure formation (Xu2011A). The protein is enriched in postsynaptic densities and colocalizes with PSD-95 at synapses, regulating synapse and spine formation in the hippocampus and cortex (Hruska2012Ephrin). These interactions highlight ephrin-B3's role in maintaining synaptic integrity and function through specific protein-protein interactions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EFNB3 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, particularly hypertension and glioblastoma. In the context of hypertension, studies have identified significant associations between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the EFNB3 gene and hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypogonadic males. These SNPs are located in the 3′ untranslated region or upstream regulatory regions of the gene, suggesting a role in blood pressure regulation potentially influenced by sex hormones (Wu2018Analysis; Tremblay2017Evidence). The deletion of EFNB3 in animal models has also been linked to hypertension, indicating its involvement in vascular function (Wu2018Analysis).

In glioblastoma, EFNB3 is highly expressed and contributes to tumor growth by inhibiting apoptosis through its interaction with the dependence receptor EphA4. This interaction supports tumor cell survival and angiogenesis, making EFNB3 a potential target for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma (Royet2017EphrinB3). The overexpression of EFNB3 in glioblastoma cells suggests its role in promoting tumor aggressiveness and resistance to cell death, aligning with the dependence receptor paradigm (Royet2017EphrinB3).

## Interactions
Ephrin-B3 (EFNB3) interacts with EphB receptors, particularly EphB2, to regulate synapse density through a competitive mechanism. This interaction is crucial for synapse development and involves unique signaling motifs in ephrin-B3, such as an Erk-binding D domain and a MAPK consensus sequence, which are not found in other ephrin-B family members (Henderson2019EphrinB3). Ephrin-B3 stabilizes nascent synaptic contacts by recruiting PSD-95, a protein essential for controlling synapse number (Henderson2019EphrinB3).

Ephrin-B3 also participates in reverse signaling pathways, interacting with SH2 and PDZ domain-containing proteins. It binds to the SH2/SH3 adaptor protein Grb4, linking it to intracellular proteins like Dock180 and Pak1. Additionally, ephrin-B3 interacts with PDZ domain proteins through its C-terminal tail, affecting dendritic morphogenesis and synaptic transmission (Xu2011A).

In the context of glioblastoma multiforme, ephrin-B3 interacts with the EphA4 receptor, inhibiting its pro-apoptotic activity and promoting tumor cell survival. This interaction supports the survival of endothelial cells and contributes to angiogenesis, which is associated with tumor aggressiveness (Royet2017EphrinB3).
