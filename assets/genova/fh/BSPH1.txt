# BSPH1

## Overview
BSPH1, or Binder of Sperm Protein Homolog 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Binder of SPerm (BSP) protein family, which is primarily expressed in the male reproductive tract, particularly within the epididymis. The protein encoded by BSPH1 is characterized by the presence of two fibronectin type-II (Fn2) domains, which are crucial for its binding activities with various molecules, including glycosaminoglycans and lipoproteins (Plante2014Implication; Lefebvre2008Recombinant). Functionally, the BSPH1 protein plays a significant role in sperm capacitation, a process essential for successful fertilization, by promoting phospholipid and cholesterol efflux from the sperm membrane (Plante2014Implication). The protein's interactions with specific regions on the sperm surface, such as the equatorial segment and post-acrosomal region, are vital for sperm-egg binding and fusion (Plante2014Implication). Despite its critical role in capacitation, BSPH1 does not influence sperm motility, indicating its specialized function in the fertilization process (Plante2014Implication).

## Structure
The BSPH1 protein is characterized by its structure, which includes two fibronectin type-II (Fn2) domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's binding activities, such as interactions with glycosaminoglycans, high-density lipoproteins, and choline phospholipids (Plante2014Implication; Lefebvre2008Recombinant). Each Fn2 domain contains two disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability and proper folding (Lefebvre2008Recombinant). The presence of these domains is a signature feature of the BSP protein family, which is conserved across various mammalian species (Plante2014Implication).

The tertiary structure of BSPH1 involves the formation of specific binding sites, as revealed by molecular docking analyses. These analyses show that heparin heptasaccharide binds to a groove between the two Fn2 domains, while chondroitin sulfate B binds in a different groove, indicating distinct binding affinities and structural features (Plante2014Implication). The protein also exhibits oligomerization, forming dimers and tetramers, which are important for its binding properties (Plante2014Implication). The quaternary structure, therefore, involves the assembly of these oligomeric forms, which are essential for the protein's biological function in sperm capacitation and interaction (Plante2014Implication).

## Function
The BSPH1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in sperm capacitation, a crucial process for fertilization. This protein is part of the Binder of SPerm (BSP) protein family and is expressed exclusively in the male reproductive tract, particularly in the epididymis (Plante2014Implication; Lefebvre2006Genomic). BSPH1 interacts with choline phospholipids on the sperm membrane, promoting phospholipid and cholesterol efflux, which is essential for capacitation (Plante2014Implication). The protein binds to specific regions on the sperm, such as the equatorial segment and post-acrosomal region, which are involved in sperm-egg binding and fusion (Plante2014Implication).

BSPH1 contains two fibronectin type II (Fn2) domains, which facilitate its binding to various molecules, including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and lipoproteins (Lefebvre2008Recombinant; Lefebvre2006Genomic). The protein's localization on the sperm surface, particularly over the head regions, suggests its involvement in capacitation and sperm-egg interaction (Plante2015Epididymal). Despite its role in capacitation, BSPH1 does not affect sperm motility parameters, indicating its function is specific to the capacitation process rather than motility or hyperactivation (Plante2014Implication).

## Interactions
BSPH1, a member of the Binder of Sperm Protein (BSP) family, is known for its interactions with various ligands rather than direct interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids. It binds to phosphatidylcholine liposomes, low-density lipoproteins, and human sperm, indicating its role in sperm capacitation and maturation (Lefebvre2008Recombinant). BSPH1 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans such as heparin, showing a strong binding affinity, which is crucial for its function in sperm capacitation (Plante2014Implication).

The protein's binding to gelatin and heparin is attributed to its fibronectin type-II (Fn2) domains, which are essential for its interaction with these molecules (Plante2014Implication). Although BSPH1 does not significantly bind to chondroitin sulfate B (CSB), it shows specific binding interactions with heparin heptasaccharide, highlighting its selective affinity for certain glycosaminoglycans (Plante2014Implication).

In mouse models, BSPH1 has been implicated in sperm-egg interaction, where its presence can inhibit fertilization, suggesting a potential role in modulating sperm binding to the egg surface (HeidariVala2020Role). However, direct interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been explicitly documented.
