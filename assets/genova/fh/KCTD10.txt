# KCTD10

## Overview
KCTD10 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 10, which is a member of the BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain-containing protein family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, and ubiquitination. It functions as a substrate recognition receptor for the cullin-3 (CUL3) ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in protein degradation pathways. KCTD10 is also implicated in cardiovascular development and angiogenesis, primarily through its interaction with the Notch signaling pathway. The protein's structural features, such as the BTB domain and potassium channel tetramerization domain, facilitate its interactions with other proteins, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and DNA polymerase δ, underscoring its role in DNA repair and replication (Maekawa2020KCTD10; Zhou2005A; Pinkas2017Structural).

## Structure
KCTD10 is a protein characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain at its N-terminus, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and oligomerization (Zhou2005A; Pinkas2017Structural). The BTB domain of KCTD10 forms a tetrameric assembly with two-fold rotational symmetry, consisting of five alpha helices and a single β-sheet made from three β-strands, creating a roughly pyramidal wedge shape (Pinkas2017Structural). This tetrameric form is distinct from other KCTD family structures and is stabilized by interactions between β1-β2 hairpins of adjacent monomers (Pinkas2017Structural).

In addition to the BTB domain, KCTD10 contains a potassium channel tetramerization (K_tetra) domain and a PCNA-binding motif at the C-terminus, which are shared with related proteins like PDIP1 and TNFAIP1 (Zhou2005A). The protein can interact with the small subunit of DNA polymerase δ and PCNA, suggesting a role in DNA replication and repair processes (Zhou2005A).

KCTD10 is also involved in forming 5:5 heterodecamers with Cullin 3 (CUL3), which are implicated in the ubiquitination of substrates (Maekawa2020KCTD10). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its function in various cellular processes, including cardiovascular development and angiogenesis (Maekawa2020KCTD10).

## Function
KCTD10 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, and ubiquitination. The protein interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and polymerase delta, enhancing their activity in DNA replication and repair, which is essential for cell proliferation and mitosis (Wang2009KCTD10; Skoblov2013Protein). KCTD10 also functions as a substrate recognition receptor for the cullin-3 (CUL3) ubiquitin ligase complex, mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of proteins such as RhoB, which is crucial for maintaining endothelial barrier function and regulating cytoskeletal dynamics (Maekawa2020KCTD10; Kovačević2018The).

In embryonic development, KCTD10 plays a significant role in cardiovascular development and angiogenesis by negatively regulating the Notch signaling pathway. It mediates the proteolytic degradation of Notch1, which is vital for proper vascular maturation and heart development (Ren2014KCTD10). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, highlighting its diverse roles in cellular and organismal functions (Ren2014KCTD10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KCTD10 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those affecting the cardiovascular system. In mice, deletion of KCTD10 results in embryonic lethality due to severe cardiovascular defects, including angiogenic abnormalities and heart malformations, highlighting its critical role in heart development (Ren2014KCTD10). In zebrafish, mutations in KCTD10 lead to heart defects such as atrioventricular canal malformations and heart looping failure, which are linked to the dysregulation of the Tbx5 transcription factor (Tong2014Kctd10).

In humans, KCTD10 expression is associated with congenital heart disease (CHD). The gene is downregulated in CHD, and this downregulation is linked to the activation of the Notch signaling pathway, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of CHD (Pang2018Downregulation). Additionally, polymorphisms in KCTD10 have been associated with coronary heart disease risk and lipid metabolism, suggesting a role in cardiovascular health (Sun2016Association).

KCTD10 also plays a role in cancer, particularly in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), where its expression is correlated with a favorable prognosis and reduced tumor growth and invasiveness (Kubota2013Gene). In lung adenocarcinoma, KCTD10 expression is associated with immune infiltration and better overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Shi2022Comprehensive).

## Interactions
KCTD10, a member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), suggesting a role in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. This interaction has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that KCTD10 may influence DNA replication and repair processes (Wang2009KCTD10; Zhou2005A).

KCTD10 also forms part of the CUL3/KCTD10 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, interacting with Cullin3 and other proteins such as RhoB. This complex is involved in ubiquitination processes, which regulate protein degradation and cellular signaling pathways. The interaction with RhoB, for instance, is crucial for endothelial barrier formation and angiogenesis (Maekawa2020KCTD10; Skoblov2013Protein).

Additionally, KCTD10 interacts with TNFAIP1, leading to its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The BTB domain of KCTD10 facilitates these interactions by forming tetramers and heterodecamers with CUL3, which are essential for its role in ubiquitination (Maekawa2020KCTD10). These interactions highlight KCTD10's involvement in regulating the RhoA/RhoB pathway and its potential role in cell proliferation and DNA repair (Skoblov2013Protein).
