# EIF2B4

## Overview
The EIF2B4 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit delta (eIF2Bδ), a critical component of the eIF2B complex, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in the process of protein synthesis. The eIF2B complex is composed of five subunits, with EIF2B4 being part of the regulatory subcomplex that modulates the activity of the entire complex. This regulation is particularly significant in response to cellular stress, where the phosphorylation of eIF2α can inhibit the eIF2B complex, thereby affecting global protein synthesis. The eIF2Bδ protein, characterized by its Rossman fold structure, plays a pivotal role in the integrated stress response (ISR) by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2, a necessary step for mRNA translation initiation (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). Mutations in the EIF2B4 gene have been linked to neurological disorders such as vanishing white matter disease and ovarioleukodystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance (EscobarPacheco2024Ovarioleukodystrophy; Tian2022Identification).

## Structure
The EIF2B4 gene encodes the delta subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex, which plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. The eIF2B complex is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) composed of five subunits, including eIF2B4, which is part of the regulatory subcomplex along with eIF2B1 and eIF2B2 (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). The eIF2B4 subunit is involved in the modulation of the eIF2B complex's activity, particularly in response to stress signals that lead to the phosphorylation of eIF2α (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological).

The eIF2B4 protein has two splice variants with different N-terminal extensions, which can influence the cell's sensitivity to eIF2α phosphorylation. The longer variant of eIF2B4 mimics the effects of ISRIB, a small molecule that stabilizes the eIF2B complex, suggesting a role in enhancing the interaction between eIF2B subunits (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). The regulatory subcomplex, including eIF2B4, is characterized by Rossman folds that bind nucleotides (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of EIF2B4, as well as post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
EIF2B4 encodes the delta subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex, which is essential for protein synthesis in human cells. The eIF2B complex functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2, a critical step in the initiation of mRNA translation (Oliveira2024The; Tian2022Identification). This process is vital for the formation of the ternary complex, which is necessary for translation initiation (Sonenberg2009Regulation).

In healthy cells, EIF2B4, as part of the eIF2B complex, plays a crucial role in maintaining normal protein synthesis and cellular function. The complex is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell growth and survival by regulating protein synthesis in response to cellular signals (Tian2022Identification). The eIF2B complex is composed of five subunits, with EIF2B4 being one of the regulatory subunits that modulate GEF activity in response to cellular conditions (Oliveira2024The). This regulation is particularly important under stress conditions, where the eIF2B complex helps modulate the integrated stress response (ISR) by controlling the activity of eIF2, thereby affecting global protein synthesis and stress-related protein translation (Hanson2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EIF2B4 gene are associated with vanishing white matter disease (VWM), a type of leukoencephalopathy characterized by progressive neurological deterioration. VWM is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, but there is evidence suggesting potential autosomal dominant inheritance in some adult-onset cases (Tian2022Identification). The disease is marked by symptoms such as progressive ataxia, spasticity, and cognitive decline, with varying onset ages and severity (Tian2022Identification).

A specific heterozygous missense mutation in EIF2B4, resulting in an arginine to histidine substitution (R446H), has been identified in a Han Chinese family with adult-onset VWM. This mutation is located in a highly conserved region of the eIF2Bδ protein and is predicted to affect its function, although it is classified as a variant of uncertain significance (Tian2022Identification).

In addition to VWM, mutations in EIF2B4 have been implicated in ovarioleukodystrophy, a condition that combines features of VWM with ovarian dysfunction. This condition is characterized by white matter involvement and ovarian changes, such as premature ovarian failure, and is typically associated with autosomal recessive inheritance (EscobarPacheco2024Ovarioleukodystrophy).

## Interactions
EIF2B4, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex, plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by interacting with other eIF2B subunits and eIF2. It is part of the regulatory subcomplex that provides binding sites for eIF2, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, a key step in translation initiation (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). The interaction of EIF2B4 with the small molecule ISRIB enhances the thermo-stability of EIF2B4 and promotes the dimerization of the eIF2B complex, which increases its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). ISRIB stabilizes the eIF2B complex by enhancing the interactions between eIF2B1 and EIF2B4 subunits, suggesting that EIF2B4 contributes to the ISRIB binding site (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological).

EIF2B4's interaction with eIF2 is crucial for its function, as phosphorylation of eIF2α at serine-51 inhibits eIF2B by slowing the dissociation of eIF2α-P from the eIF2B regulatory subcomplex, locking eIF2B into an inactive state (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). The interaction of EIF2B4 with ISRIB can alleviate this inhibition under certain conditions, promoting GDP release from unphosphorylated eIF2 even when eIF2-P is present below threshold levels (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological).
