# NETO1

## Overview
The NETO1 gene encodes the neuropilin and tolloid-like 1 protein, a synaptic transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the central nervous system. This protein is primarily involved in modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity, essential processes for learning and memory. Neuropilin and tolloid-like 1 functions as an auxiliary subunit for kainate and NMDA receptors, influencing their synaptic localization and channel properties. It is prominently expressed in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses, where it interacts with various receptor subunits and scaffolding proteins, such as PSD-95. The protein's structure, featuring CUB domains and a PDZ binding motif, facilitates these interactions, which are crucial for maintaining normal excitatory postsynaptic currents and synaptic plasticity (Tang2011Neto1; Ng2009Neto1). Alterations in NETO1 expression or function have been linked to neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Ng2009Neto1).

## Structure
The NETO1 gene encodes a protein known as neuropilin tolloid-like 1, which is involved in synaptic function. The protein is composed of 533 amino acids and features several distinct domains that contribute to its structure and function. It includes an N-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal sequence, two extracellular complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1 (CUB) domains, a low-density lipoprotein receptor domain class A (LDLa) motif, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail that ends with a class I PDZ binding tripeptide ligand (TRV-COOH) (Ng2009Neto1).

The CUB domains, each approximately 110 amino acids in length, are characterized by a 'jellyroll' topology formed by 10 beta-strands, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Ng2009Neto1). These domains are crucial for the protein's interaction with NMDA and kainate receptors, specifically through the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the GluK2 receptor (Li2019Neto). The second CUB domain is particularly important for interaction with kainate receptors (Tang2011Neto1).

Post-translational modifications of NETO1 may include glycosylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. Alternative splicing of the NETO1 gene can lead to different isoforms, which may vary in their functional roles and interactions. The protein's structure allows it to play a significant role in synaptic plasticity and receptor regulation.

## Function
NETO1 encodes a synaptic transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the central nervous system by acting as an auxiliary subunit of kainate receptors (KARs) and NMDA receptors (NMDARs). In healthy human cells, NETO1 is involved in regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity, which are essential for learning and memory processes. The protein is prominently expressed in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses, where it interacts with PSD-95 and NR1, and is localized to dendritic spines (Ng2009Neto1).

NETO1 is essential for the synaptic abundance and function of KARs, particularly influencing the abundance of GluK2-KARs in hippocampal PSDs. This regulation is critical for maintaining normal excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses (Tang2011Neto1). NETO1 also modulates the synaptic localization and channel properties of KARs, affecting their desensitization, deactivation kinetics, and ion permeation (Wyeth2017Neto).

In addition to its role with KARs, NETO1 interacts with NR2A-containing NMDARs, influencing their synaptic abundance and function. This interaction is vital for synaptic plasticity and learning, as evidenced by reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) and NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents in NETO1-null models (Ng2009Neto1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the NETO1 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders. Changes in NETO1 interactions can significantly impact synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions, potentially leading to conditions such as epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. The absence of Neto1 in mice models has been shown to result in impaired synaptic plasticity and spatial learning, which are critical for cognitive processes (Ng2009Neto1). These impairments are linked to a reduction in NR2A-containing NMDA receptors at synapses, although the total levels of NR2A in the brain remain unchanged (Ng2009Neto1).

The study of Neto1-null mice has also revealed a shift in NMDA receptor subunit dependency from NR2A to NR2B, which affects synaptic plasticity and learning (Ng2009Neto1). Pharmacological interventions, such as the use of the ampakine CX546, have been explored to rescue these deficits, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for conditions associated with NETO1 dysfunction (Ng2009Neto1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NETO1 in maintaining normal synaptic function and highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in neurological disorders.

## Interactions
NETO1 (neuropilin and tolloid like 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in the central nervous system by interacting with various proteins, particularly as part of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) complex. NETO1 interacts with NMDAR subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B, but not with AMPA receptor subunits like GluR2, indicating a specific association with NMDARs (Ng2009Neto1). It also binds to the scaffolding protein postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) through PDZ ligand-PDZ domain interactions, specifically with the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 (Ng2009Neto1).

NETO1 is involved in the regulation of kainate receptors (KARs) at synapses. It interacts with KAR subunits GluK2 and GluK5, enhancing their synaptic localization and function (Tang2011Neto1). The second CUB domain of NETO1 is crucial for its interaction with GluK2-containing KARs (Tang2011Neto1). NETO1 also associates with the NMDA receptor/amyloid precursor protein (APP) complex, co-immunoprecipitating with assembled NMDA receptors via GluN2A or GluN2B subunits (Cousins2013Neto1).

These interactions highlight NETO1's role in modulating synaptic plasticity and receptor localization, impacting both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamatergic signaling in the hippocampus (Wyeth2014Neto).
