# SYMPK

## Overview
The SYMPK gene encodes the symplekin scaffold protein, a pivotal component in the regulation of mRNA processing and polyadenylation. As a scaffold protein, symplekin plays a crucial role in the assembly of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, facilitating the maturation of pre-mRNA by adding a poly(A) tail, which is essential for mRNA stability and gene expression regulation (Sullivan2009A; Kolev2005Symplekin). Beyond its involvement in mRNA processing, symplekin is integral to alternative splicing and meiosis, particularly in male germ cells, where it influences pre-mRNA splicing and is necessary for proper chromosome synapsis and DNA repair (Wu2021SYMPK). The protein's interactions with various factors, including CPSF and CstF, underscore its multifaceted role in RNA processing and transcription regulation (Russo2023Restrictor; Ruepp2011Interactions). Symplekin's widespread presence in different cell types highlights its essential function in cellular processes, with implications for reproductive health and potential roles in cancer biology (Javadirad2020The; Wu2021SYMPK).

## Structure
Symplekin is a scaffold protein involved in mRNA processing and polyadenylation, with a complex molecular structure that includes distinct domains essential for its function. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of symplekin is crucial for the processing of histone pre-mRNA, forming ionic and hydrophilic interactions that are vital for the cleavage activity (Sun2020Structure). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of symplekin is integral to the core architecture of the histone cleavage complex (HCC), interacting intimately with CPSF73 and CPSF100, which are necessary for the active state of the machinery (Sun2020Structure).

Symplekin also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is important for its subcellular localization, although its nuclear import is primarily dependent on interactions with other proteins like CstF-77 (Ruepp2011Interactions). The interaction site for CstF-64 on symplekin is located between residues 391-448 and around 465, with a putative amphipathic α-helix spanning residues 442-460, which is crucial for binding (Ruepp2011Interactions).

Symplekin can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its function. It exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity. These structural features enable symplekin to serve as a versatile scaffold in various RNA processing complexes.

## Function
Symplekin (SYMPK) is a scaffold protein that plays a critical role in mRNA processing, particularly in the 3'-end maturation of pre-mRNA. It is essential for the assembly of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, facilitating the addition of the poly(A) tail to mRNAs, which is crucial for mRNA stability and regulation of gene expression (Sullivan2009A; Kolev2005Symplekin). Symplekin interacts with various polyadenylation factors, including CPSF and CstF, and acts as a scaffold to bring together components necessary for the cleavage of histone pre-mRNA, which lacks typical polyadenylation signals (Ruepp2011Interactions; Kolev2005Symplekin).

In addition to its role in mRNA processing, SYMPK is involved in alternative splicing and is crucial for meiosis in male germ cells, where it regulates pre-mRNA splicing and is necessary for proper chromosome synapsis and DNA repair (Wu2021SYMPK). SYMPK is also implicated in transcription termination, particularly in the suppression of extragenic transcription, where it interacts with proteins like Restrictor and PNUTS (Russo2023Restrictor). Symplekin is active in the nucleus and is present in various cell types, indicating its widespread importance in cellular processes (Kolev2005Symplekin).

## Clinical Significance
The SYMPK gene, encoding the symplekin scaffold protein, plays a critical role in meiosis and alternative splicing in male germ cells. Alterations in SYMPK expression or mutations can lead to significant reproductive issues, particularly male infertility. SYMPK deficiency in germ cells results in meiotic defects, characterized by improper chromosome synapsis and DNA double-strand break repair, ultimately leading to infertility in male mice (Wu2021SYMPK). The absence of SYMPK disrupts the splicing patterns of key genes involved in spermatogenesis, such as Sun1, Brdt, and Meioc, contributing to these meiotic defects (Wu2021SYMPK).

In addition to its role in reproduction, SYMPK has been identified as a stable reference gene for RT-qPCR data normalization in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), due to its low variation and lack of pseudogenes (Javadirad2020The). While the clinical significance of SYMPK mutations in cancer is not fully detailed, its stable expression in PTC suggests potential implications in tumorigenesis and cellular processes related to cancer (Javadirad2020The). Further research is needed to elucidate the broader clinical implications of SYMPK alterations.

## Interactions
SYMPK (symplekin scaffold protein) is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in mRNA processing and transcription regulation. It interacts with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, particularly with CPSF1, CPSF2, and CPSF3, facilitating the assembly of the polyadenylation machinery on nascent transcripts (Wu2021SYMPK). SYMPK also interacts with the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), specifically binding to CstF-64 through a predicted amphipathic α-helix, which is essential for efficient histone RNA processing (Ruepp2011Interactions).

In the context of transcription termination, SYMPK is associated with the Restrictor complex, working in synergy with proteins like PNUTS and ZC3H4 to regulate extragenic transcription termination (Russo2023Restrictor). Although SYMPK is in proximity to ZC3H4, it does not form stable interactions with it or its proximal proteins, indicating a more transient association (Russo2023Restrictor). SYMPK also interacts with splicing factors such as PRPF8 and DDX5 in spermatogenic cells, influencing alternative splicing and meiosis (Wu2021SYMPK). These interactions highlight SYMPK's multifaceted role in RNA processing and transcription regulation.
