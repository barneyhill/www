# UNC13C

## Overview
The UNC13C gene encodes the protein unc-13 homolog C, a member of the Munc13 family, which is integral to synaptic vesicle priming and neurotransmitter release. This protein is categorized as a synaptic vesicle priming factor, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of synaptic transmission by facilitating the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. The structure of unc-13 homolog C includes several key domains, such as the MUN domain and C2 domains, which are essential for its function in synaptic vesicle priming and calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, respectively (Li2011The). The protein's interactions with calmodulin and components of the SNARE complex underscore its critical involvement in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release (Richmond1999UNC13; Piotrowski2020Delineating). Alterations in UNC13C expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Velmurugan2019UNC13C; Kumar2023Prognostic).

## Structure
The UNC13C gene encodes a protein that is part of the Munc13 family, which plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle priming and neurotransmitter release. The protein structure includes several key domains, notably the MUN domain, which is essential for its function in facilitating the transition from the Syntaxin-1/Munc18-1 complex to the SNARE complex, a crucial step in synaptic vesicle priming (Li2011The). The MUN domain is an autonomously folded module that exhibits structural similarity to vesicle tethering factors, suggesting a shared role in membrane trafficking (Li2011The).

The MUN domain is composed of subdomains, including the MUN-CD module, which has an elongated structure with two lobes forming five-helix bundles. These helices are packed in an antiparallel fashion, contributing to a boomerang-like shape with a shallow concave surface (Li2011The). The surface of the MUN-CD module is predominantly negatively charged, with some positive patches that may be involved in membrane binding (Li2011The).

The UNC13C protein also contains C2 domains, which are calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding motifs, contributing to its role in synaptic vesicle priming (Li2011The). Splice variants of UNC13C may result in different isoforms with distinct functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
The UNC13C gene, also known as Munc13-3, encodes a protein that plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle priming, a key step in neurotransmitter release. This protein is involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission by facilitating the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, which is essential for efficient neuronal communication. UNC13C is primarily active in the nervous system, contributing to overall neural function by ensuring the proper release of neurotransmitters at synapses (Velmurugan2019UNC13C).

In healthy human cells, UNC13C is involved in vesicle maturation during exocytosis, a process crucial for normal synaptic function. The protein's activity is vital for maintaining the balance and timing of neurotransmitter release, which is necessary for proper signal transmission across synapses. This function underscores its importance in maintaining normal cognitive and motor functions by supporting the precise communication between neurons (Velmurugan2019UNC13C).

The role of UNC13C in these molecular processes highlights its significance in the nervous system, where it ensures the efficient operation of synaptic transmission, thereby supporting overall neural health and function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the UNC13C gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), UNC13C expression is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with advanced cancer stages, increased mortality, and reduced overall survival. The gene acts as a tumor suppressor, and its reduced expression may facilitate tumor progression and metastasis through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Overexpression of UNC13C in OSCC cells impairs migration and invasion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to prevent metastasis (Velmurugan2019UNC13C).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high UNC13C expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and poor overall survival, indicating its role as an independent prognostic indicator. This suggests that UNC13C could be a potential biomarker for early detection and treatment strategies in HCC (Kumar2023Prognostic).

UNC13C is also involved in the progression of OSCC through its interaction with circ-KIAA0907 and miR-96-5p. Circ-KIAA0907 regulates UNC13C expression by sponging miR-96-5p, affecting cell migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Targeting this axis may offer therapeutic potential in OSCC (Dong2021CircKIAA0907).

## Interactions
The UNC13C gene encodes a protein that is part of the Munc13 family, which plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle priming and neurotransmitter release. The protein interacts with calmodulin (CaM), forming a 1:1 complex that is essential for synaptic plasticity. This interaction is characterized by a unique N-terminal extension of the canonical CaM-binding motif, which is not observed in other Munc13 isoforms. The binding motif includes hydrophobic amino acids V709, I714, and F723, which are critical for CaM binding (Piotrowski2020Delineating).

UNC13C is also involved in the formation of the SNARE complex, a multiprotein assembly essential for synaptic vesicle fusion. It interacts with syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin, facilitating the conversion of docked vesicles into a primed state ready for fusion. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of neurotransmitter release (Richmond1999UNC13). The protein's C1 and C2 domains suggest a role in calcium and diacylglycerol-dependent steps of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Betz1996Mammalian).
