# JAM2

## Overview
JAM2 is a gene that encodes the protein junctional adhesion molecule 2, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in cell adhesion processes. The JAM2 protein is primarily expressed in endothelial and lymphatic cells, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cell polarity and vascular integrity. As a transmembrane protein, JAM2 is integral to the formation and function of tight junctions, contributing to the regulation of paracellular permeability and the integrity of cell monolayers. It facilitates lymphocyte transendothelial migration, a key process in immune surveillance, and interacts with other proteins such as PAR-3 and ZO-1 to maintain cell-cell contacts. Mutations in the JAM2 gene have been linked to primary familial brain calcification, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by calcium deposits in the brain, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining neurovascular integrity (AurrandLions2001JAM2; Schottlaender2020Biallelic; Ebnet2003The).

## Structure
Junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by its involvement in cell adhesion processes. The primary structure of JAM2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes two immunoglobulin-like domains: a membrane-distal V-type and a membrane-proximal C2-type Ig-like domain (Ebnet2003The). These domains are connected by a short linker, contributing to the secondary structure of the protein, which includes beta sheets and alpha helices (Kostrewa2001Xray).

The tertiary structure of JAM2 involves the folding of these elements into a stable three-dimensional shape, facilitating its function in cell adhesion. JAM2 typically forms homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, through a novel dimerization motif, R(V,I,L)E, which is crucial for dimer formation (Kostrewa2001Xray). This motif includes a salt bridge between specific residues, such as Arg58 and Glu60, and is flanked by hydrophobic interactions (Kostrewa2001Xray).

JAM2 is often glycosylated as a post-translational modification, which may influence its stability and interactions. The protein's structure allows it to associate with cell polarity proteins like PAR-3, playing a role in endothelial cell polarity and tight junction formation (Ebnet2003The).

## Function
Junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM-2) is a protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion processes, particularly in endothelial and lymphatic cells. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in maintaining cell polarity and vascular integrity. JAM-2 is primarily expressed at tight junctions between endothelial cells, where it contributes to the regulation of paracellular permeability and the integrity of cell monolayers (AurrandLions2001JAM2; Ebnet2003The).

JAM-2 facilitates lymphocyte transendothelial migration, a critical process in immune surveillance, by promoting the movement of lymphocytes across endothelial barriers. This function is crucial for lymphocyte recirculation and transmigration into secondary lymphoid organs (JohnsonLéger2002Junctional). The protein is also involved in the recruitment and localization of cell polarity proteins such as PAR-3 and ZO-1 to cell-cell contacts, which is essential for the formation and maintenance of tight junctions (Ebnet2003The).

JAM-2 interacts with other junctional adhesion molecules, such as JAM-3, to mediate cell adhesion and potentially regulate leukocyte transmigration during inflammation (Arrate2001Cloning). Its expression and function are regulated by phosphorylation, which influences its localization and activity at cell junctions (Ebnet2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the JAM2 gene are associated with primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by calcium deposits in the brain. This condition leads to neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive decline. Bi-allelic variants in JAM2 have been identified as a cause of PFBC, resulting in reduced mRNA expression and absence of the JAM2 protein, indicating a loss-of-function mechanism (Schottlaender2020Biallelic). Patients with JAM2 mutations exhibit severe brain calcifications, particularly in the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and deep gray matter, and present with symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, cognitive decline, seizures, and parkinsonism (Schottlaender2020Biallelic; Cen2019Biallelic).

The mutations in JAM2 disrupt cell-to-cell adhesion and impair the integrity of the neurovascular unit, leading to blood-brain barrier dysfunction and brain calcification (Carecchio2023The). This dysfunction is linked to movement disorders, cognitive decline, and psychiatric manifestations (Schottlaender2020Biallelic). The clinical phenotypes of patients with JAM2 mutations are heterogeneous, with some individuals experiencing severe symptoms while others remain asymptomatic (Cen2019Biallelic). The study of JAM2 knockout mouse models has replicated these neurological phenotypes, further supporting the role of JAM2 in brain calcification disorders (Schottlaender2020Biallelic).

## Interactions
Junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and signaling. JAM2 interacts with the cell polarity protein PAR-3 through its first PDZ domain, a connection that is significant for the formation of tight junctions in endothelial cells (Ebnet2003The). This interaction is specific to JAM family members and does not occur with other tight junction-associated proteins like occludin or claudins (Ebnet2003The).

JAM2 also associates with the tight junction protein ZO-1 in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. This interaction is important for clustering proteins at tight junctions, contributing to their function (Ebnet2003The). The phosphorylation of JAM2 at serine residue S281 regulates its localization at cell-cell contacts, influencing its interaction with PAR-3 and ZO-1 (Ebnet2003The).

In the immune system, JAM2 interacts with JAM3, serving as an adhesive ligand for T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells. This interaction is crucial for lymphocyte trafficking and immune surveillance (Liang2002Vascular). These interactions highlight JAM2's role in both endothelial cell polarity and immune cell adhesion.
