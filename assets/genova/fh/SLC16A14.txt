# SLC16A14

## Overview
SLC16A14 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 16 member 14 (MCT14), which is part of the monocarboxylate transporter family within the larger solute carrier (SLC) superfamily. MCT14 is characterized by its predicted structure of 12 transmembrane domains and intracellular N- and C-termini, a common feature among SLC16 family members (Halestrap2004The; Roshanbin2016Histological). Despite its structural similarities to other monocarboxylate transporters, the specific substrates and transport mechanisms of MCT14 remain unidentified, and it has not demonstrated transport activity for typical SLC16 substrates in experimental settings (Knöpfel2017Renal). MCT14 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the kidney, and its expression is influenced by dietary phosphate levels, suggesting a potential role in phosphate homeostasis (Knöpfel2017Renal; Roshanbin2016Histological). The clinical significance of SLC16A14 is still being explored, with research indicating possible implications in epithelial ovarian cancer and renal physiology (Knöpfel2017Renal; ELSNEROVA2016Gene).

## Structure
The SLC16A14 gene encodes the MCT14 protein, a member of the monocarboxylate transporter family, which is part of the larger solute carrier (SLC) superfamily. The MCT14 protein is predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains with intracellular N- and C-termini, a structural feature common to the SLC16 family (Halestrap2004The; Roshanbin2016Histological). This topology includes a large cytosolic loop between transmembrane segments 6 and 7 (Roshanbin2016Histological).

The protein's molecular weight is approximately 50 kDa, as confirmed by Western blot analysis, which also detected smaller bands that may represent degradation products or unglycosylated forms (Knöpfel2017Renal). The predicted topology and structure of MCT14 are similar to other members of the monocarboxylate transporter family, which typically do not undergo glycosylation (Halestrap2013The).

The specific substrate profile and transport mechanism of MCT14 remain unknown, and no transport activity was detected for classic substrates of the SLC16 family in experimental studies (Knöpfel2017Renal). The protein is expressed in various tissues, with particularly high levels in the kidney (Roshanbin2016Histological).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SLC16A14 gene, also known as MCT14, is not fully understood, but research suggests potential implications in various conditions. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), alterations in the expression of SLC16A14 have been associated with disease progression and therapy outcomes. Specifically, downregulation of SLC16A14 in EOC tissues compared to controls has been observed, and its expression level has been linked to progression-free survival in patients. This suggests that SLC16A14 could serve as a prognostic marker for EOC progression and therapy response (ELSNEROVA2016Gene).

In renal physiology, SLC16A14 expression is regulated by dietary phosphate levels, indicating a potential role in phosphate homeostasis. However, the exact physiological and clinical implications of this regulation remain unclear, as no significant transport activity for typical substrates has been identified (Knöpfel2017Renal).

In the central nervous system, SLC16A14 is expressed in various brain regions, but its specific role in neurological conditions has not been established. The gene's expression pattern suggests it may function as a neuronal transporter, yet its clinical significance in human neurological disorders is still unknown (Roshanbin2016Histological).
