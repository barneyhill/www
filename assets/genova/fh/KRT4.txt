# KRT4

## Overview
The KRT4 gene encodes keratin 4, a type II cytokeratin that plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells. Keratin 4 is primarily expressed in the suprabasal layers of non-cornified stratified epithelia, such as those found in the oral mucosa, esophagus, and anogenital regions (Chao2003A). As a structural protein, keratin 4 forms intermediate filaments that provide mechanical support and resilience to epithelial tissues, ensuring their stability under mechanical stress (Chao2003A). The protein is involved in the differentiation and lineage commitment of epithelial cells, and its expression is dynamically regulated during the hair follicle cycle, indicating its role in hair development (Hu2021Keratin; Tian2022Transcriptome). Mutations in the KRT4 gene are associated with White Sponge Nevus, a condition characterized by white, spongy plaques on mucosal surfaces, underscoring the gene's importance in maintaining epithelial tissue integrity (Terrinoni2000A; Zhang2008Two).

## Structure
The KRT4 gene encodes keratin 4, a type II cytokeratin involved in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. The primary structure of keratin 4 consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This configuration is typical of keratin proteins, facilitating their role in forming intermediate filaments (Törmä2011Regulation).

The secondary structure of keratin 4 includes alpha-helices that form coiled-coil dimers, a common feature in keratin proteins that allows for the formation of stable filamentous structures. These dimers are crucial for the assembly of keratin intermediate filaments, which provide mechanical support to epithelial cells (Törmä2011Regulation).

In terms of tertiary structure, keratin 4 dimers assemble into larger intermediate filaments, contributing to the cytoskeletal framework of epithelial tissues. The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterodimers with type I keratins, which is essential for the proper function and stability of the keratin network (Törmä2011Regulation).

Post-translational modifications of keratin 4 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence the protein's function and interactions within the cell (Törmä2011Regulation). These modifications are important for the regulation of keratin dynamics and cellular responses to environmental changes.

## Function
Keratin 4 (KRT4) is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells. It is primarily expressed in the suprabasal layers of non-cornified stratified epithelia, such as the oral mucosa, esophagus, and anogenital epithelia (Chao2003A). KRT4 contributes to the formation of intermediate filaments, which provide mechanical support and resilience to epithelial tissues, ensuring their stability and function under mechanical stress (Chao2003A).

In healthy human cells, KRT4 is involved in the differentiation and lineage commitment of epithelial cells. It is enriched in quiescent prostate stem cells, indicating its association with early stages of lineage commitment before full differentiation occurs (Hu2021Keratin). This dynamic expression pattern helps map the temporal progression of stem cell differentiation, highlighting the importance of keratin profiling in understanding stem cell lineage hierarchy (Hu2021Keratin).

Mutations in the KRT4 gene can disrupt the stability of keratin filaments, leading to disorders such as White Sponge Nevus (WSN), which affects the non-cornified stratified squamous epithelia (Chao2003A). This underscores the critical role of KRT4 in maintaining epithelial tissue integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT4 gene are primarily associated with White Sponge Nevus (WSN), a rare autosomal dominant disorder. WSN is characterized by the presence of white, spongy plaques on the oral mucosa and other mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal, esophageal, and anogenital epithelia. These plaques result from epithelial thickening, parakeratosis, and vacuolization of the suprabasal layer of epithelial keratinocytes (Terrinoni2000A; Zhang2008Two; Qiao2022White).

Several specific mutations in the KRT4 gene have been identified as causative for WSN. These include a 3 bp heterozygous insertion in the helix initiation motif of the 1A alpha helical domain (Terrinoni2000A), a heterozygous missense mutation 1829G>A in exon 2B (Zhang2008Two), and a heterozygous deletion (C. 438_440delCAA) in exon 1 (Qiao2022White). These mutations disrupt the structural integrity of keratin filaments, leading to the characteristic lesions of WSN (Liu2011Mutational; Chao2003A).

While WSN is generally benign, there have been rare cases of malignant transformation, potentially linked to lifestyle factors and specific mutations in the KRT4 gene (Liu2024Malignant). Accurate diagnosis and genetic analysis are crucial for managing WSN and differentiating it from other oral white spot diseases (Qiao2022White; Kanazawa2020Sporadic).

## Interactions
Keratin 4 (KRT4) is a type II cytokeratin that forms a major network with its type I partner, keratin 13 (KRT13), in non-cornified stratified squamous epithelium. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical stability of epithelial tissues (Hatta2016Mechanistic). KRT4 is also involved in the structural stability and integrity of keratinocytes, acting as a marker of cell differentiation in the hair follicle cycle of Liaoning cashmere goats (Gao2021Proteomics). 

In the context of hair follicle development, KRT4 has been identified as a core gene involved in hair development, with its expression significantly upregulated in certain seasons, suggesting its role in the regulatory network of hair development (Tian2022Transcriptome). The protein-protein interaction network analysis in the study of hair follicle cycles in goats indicates that KRT4 is part of a cluster of keratins that show varying expression levels across different phases of the hair follicle cycle, although specific interactions with other proteins were not detailed (Gao2021Proteomics). 

These interactions highlight the role of KRT4 in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and its involvement in hair follicle development and differentiation.
