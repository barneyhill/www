# SLC16A8

## Overview
SLC16A8 is a gene that encodes the protein monocarboxylate transporter 3 (MCT3), a member of the solute carrier family 16. MCT3 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its role as a proton-linked transporter, primarily facilitating the transport of lactate across cell membranes. This transporter is predominantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choroid plexus epithelia, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the metabolic balance and pH homeostasis of the retina by exporting L-lactate (Bosshart2019Mechanistic; Halestrap2004The). The proper function and localization of MCT3 are dependent on its interaction with accessory proteins such as CD147, which is essential for its membrane expression (Adijanto2012The; Meredith2008The). Variants in the SLC16A8 gene have been associated with ocular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, and have also been implicated in conditions such as severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Wen2024Rare; Klipfel2021A).

## Structure
The SLC16A8 gene encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 3 (MCT3), which is part of the SLC16 family of transporters. These transporters are characterized by having 12 transmembrane helices, with both the N- and C-termini located intracellularly (Halestrap2013The; Meredith2008The). MCT3 is specifically expressed in the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is involved in the transport of lactate and protons, playing a crucial role in maintaining pH and ion homeostasis in the retina (Daniele2008Altered; Meredith2008The).

The protein requires association with accessory proteins such as CD147 for proper membrane expression and function (Halestrap2013The; Meredith2008The). A splice variant in the SLC16A8 gene, specifically the rs77968014-G allele, leads to a lactate transport deficit due to the absence of MCT3 expression. This variant results in the retention of intron 2, producing a mutant protein with an altered structure that is likely destabilized and degraded (Klipfel2021A). The presence of this splice variant suggests that SLC16A8 can produce multiple isoforms, potentially affecting its function and localization (Klipfel2021A).

## Function
The SLC16A8 gene encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 3 (MCT3), which is a proton-linked transporter primarily involved in the transport of lactate across cell membranes. MCT3 is specifically expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choroid plexus epithelia, where it functions as an L-lactate exporter (Bosshart2019Mechanistic; Halestrap2004The). In the retina, MCT3 plays a crucial role in maintaining the metabolic ecosystem between photoreceptors and the RPE by facilitating the transport of lactate from the subretinal space to the choroidal circulation (Daniele2008Altered; Klipfel2021A).

MCT3 is located on the basolateral membrane of the RPE, where it helps regulate the ionic composition and pH balance of the outer retina, which is essential for normal visual function (Daniele2008Altered; Meredith2008The). The transport of lactate by MCT3 is vital for the removal of excess lactate produced by glycolysis in photoreceptor cells, thus supporting oxidative phosphorylation and maintaining the health of photoreceptors (Daniele2008Altered). The absence or dysfunction of MCT3 can lead to altered visual function due to changes in the microenvironment of the outer retina, affecting photoreceptor responses (Daniele2008Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC16A8 gene have been implicated in several diseases, primarily affecting the eyes and spine. In the context of ocular health, SLC16A8 encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 3 (MCT3), which is crucial for lactate transport in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). A splice variant in SLC16A8, specifically the rs77968014-G allele, leads to a lactate transport deficit, contributing to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by disrupting the metabolic balance in the retina (Klipfel2021A). This variant results in the absence of MCT3 expression, affecting the transepithelial transport of lactate and potentially leading to increased lactate concentration in the outer retina (Klipfel2021A).

In addition to its role in ocular diseases, SLC16A8 has been identified as a novel candidate gene associated with severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Deleterious variants in SLC16A8, including nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants, have been found in AIS patients. These variants are linked to disturbances in carbohydrate metabolism, which may contribute to the development of scoliosis and are often associated with high myopia before scoliosis onset (Wen2024Rare).

## Interactions
SLC16A8, which encodes the monocarboxylate transporter MCT3, is primarily expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and is involved in lactate transport. MCT3 requires interaction with accessory proteins for proper membrane localization and function. CD147, also known as basigin, is a critical accessory protein for MCT3. It facilitates the correct folding and trafficking of MCT3 to the plasma membrane. In CD147-null mice, there is a noted reduction in MCT3 expression and a loss of its polarized distribution, which may contribute to visual acuity loss, indicating a significant interaction between MCT3 and CD147 (Adijanto2012The; Meredith2008The).

While MCT3's interactions with nucleic acids have not been documented, its association with CD147 is crucial for its function. This interaction is similar to those observed with other monocarboxylate transporters like MCT1 and MCT4, which also rely on CD147 for their cell surface expression and activity (Kirk2000CD147). The absence of MCT3 due to a splice variant in the SLC16A8 gene results in a lactate transport deficit, underscoring the importance of its interactions for proper metabolic function in the retinal pigment epithelium (Klipfel2021A).
