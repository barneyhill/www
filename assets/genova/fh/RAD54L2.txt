# RAD54L2

## Overview
RAD54L2 is a gene that encodes the RAD54 like 2 protein, a member of the SNF2-family of ATPases, which are integral to chromatin remodeling and DNA repair processes. The protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in homologous recombination, a critical DNA repair mechanism. RAD54 like 2 interacts with the BLM helicase within the BLM-TOP3A-RMI1-RMI2 (BTRR) complex, facilitating the suppression of crossover recombination events that could otherwise lead to genomic instability (Ho2024The). The protein's ATPase activity is essential for its function, particularly in promoting non-crossover recombination and enhancing the activity of RAD51, which is crucial for DNA repair (Ho2024The; Li2019Impact). RAD54L2's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in preserving genomic integrity and preventing deleterious genome rearrangements (Tothova2021Cohesin).

## Function
The RAD54L2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the SNF2-family of ATPases, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair processes. In healthy human cells, RAD54L2 plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in homologous recombination, a key DNA repair mechanism. It interacts with the BLM helicase, a component of the BLM-TOP3A-RMI1-RMI2 (BTRR) complex, which is essential for suppressing crossover recombination events that can lead to genome instability (Ho2024The).

RAD54L2 specifically suppresses sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) by promoting non-crossover recombination. This function is dependent on its ATPase activity, which is necessary for the recruitment of BLM to chromatin during DNA replication stress, facilitating the re-start of replication forks (Ho2024The). The protein's activity is crucial for the dissolution of DNA repair intermediates by the BTRR complex, preventing deleterious genome rearrangements (Ho2024The).

RAD54L2 also interacts with RAD51, enhancing its ability to form structures necessary for DNA repair, further underscoring its role in maintaining genomic integrity (Li2019Impact). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it ensures proper cell cycle progression and prevents genomic instability (Tothova2021Cohesin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the RAD54L2 gene have been associated with varying risks of lung cancer, particularly in the Chinese Han population. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RAD54L2, such as rs11720298, rs4687592, and rs9864693, have been studied for their impact on lung cancer susceptibility. The rs11720298 GG genotype is linked to a significantly reduced risk of lung cancer, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.17, suggesting a protective effect (Geng2022Impact). Conversely, the rs4687592 TT genotype is associated with an increased risk, with an OR of 2.54, indicating a potential risk factor for lung cancer (Geng2022Impact). The rs9864693 GC heterozygote genotype also shows an increased risk of lung cancer compared to the GG wild-type genotype (Geng2022Impact).

These polymorphisms may influence lung cancer risk through their roles in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling, processes in which RAD54L2 is involved. The gene's expression has also been linked to shorter overall survival in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, suggesting its broader impact on cancer prognosis (Geng2022Impact). These findings highlight the potential of RAD54L2 polymorphisms as part of a genetic panel for predicting lung cancer risk, although further research is needed to fully understand its role in cancer development.

## Interactions
RAD54L2, a member of the SNF2-family of proteins, plays a significant role in DNA repair and homologous recombination through its interactions with various proteins. It is known to interact with the BLM protein, forming a stable complex that is crucial for suppressing sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and promoting non-crossover recombination repair. This interaction suggests that RAD54L2 and BLM function within the same genetic pathway to suppress crossover events, which are potentially harmful to genomic stability (Ho2024The).

RAD54L2 is also part of the BLM-TOP3A-RMI1-RMI2 (BTRR) complex, where it facilitates the association of this complex with DNA damage sites on chromatin. The proximity interactome of RAD54L2 overlaps with that of BLM, including proteins such as TOP3A, RMI1, and RAD50, and is enriched in functions related to DNA damage response and chromatin accessibility (Ho2024The).

RAD54L2 interacts with RAD51, enhancing its ability to form cruciform and D-loops, which are essential for DNA repair by homologous recombination. This interaction underscores RAD54L2's role in maintaining genomic stability through its involvement in DNA repair pathways (Geng2022Impact).
