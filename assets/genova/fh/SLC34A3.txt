# SLC34A3

## Overview
The SLC34A3 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 34 member 3, also known as NaPi-IIc, which is a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter. This protein is primarily expressed in the proximal tubules of the kidneys and plays a critical role in phosphate homeostasis by facilitating the reabsorption of phosphate ions from the renal filtrate into the bloodstream. NaPi-IIc is characterized by its electroneutral transport mechanism, operating with a 2:1 sodium-to-phosphate stoichiometry, and is a member of the transmembrane protein family (Forster2012Phosphate; Wagner2013The). The proper function of NaPi-IIc is essential for maintaining normal serum phosphate levels, and mutations in the SLC34A3 gene are linked to hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH), a disorder that affects phosphate reabsorption and bone mineralization (Bergwitz2006SLC34A3; LorenzDepiereux2006Hereditary).

## Structure
The SLC34A3 gene encodes the NaPi-IIc protein, a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter primarily expressed in the kidney's proximal tubule. The protein consists of 599 amino acids and is characterized by its electroneutral transport mechanism, with a 2:1 sodium-to-phosphate stoichiometry (Wagner2013The). The primary structure of NaPi-IIc includes a unique cysteine cluster in its C-terminal region, similar to SLC34A2 (NaPi-IIb) (Forster2012Phosphate).

The secondary structure of NaPi-IIc is proposed to include 12 transmembrane domains, with an inverted repeat motif conserved across the SLC34 family, which is crucial for the transport pathway (Forster2012Phosphate; Wagner2013The). The protein's topology suggests the presence of eight membrane-spanning domains and two reentrant loop domains (Wagner2013The).

The tertiary structure of NaPi-IIc is not fully resolved, but it is suggested to function as a monomer, although it may form dimers or tetramers (Forster2012Phosphate). The C-terminal region is important for targeting, hormonal regulation, and protein-protein interactions (Wagner2013The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the protein's function and regulation (Forster2012Phosphate).

## Function
The SLC34A3 gene encodes the NaPi-IIc protein, a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter primarily expressed in the brush border membrane of the proximal tubules in the kidneys. This transporter plays a crucial role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis by facilitating the reabsorption of phosphate ions from the renal filtrate back into the bloodstream (Bergwitz2006SLC34A3; Wagner2013The). NaPi-IIc operates with a 2:1 sodium-to-phosphate stoichiometry and is unique among the SLC34 family for being electroneutral, meaning it does not translocate net charge during transport (Wagner2013The).

In healthy human cells, NaPi-IIc is involved in the reabsorption of phosphate, which is essential for bone mineralization and energy metabolism. The transporter's activity is regulated by dietary phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which can suppress its expression (SEGAWA2015The). Although NaPi-IIa is responsible for most phosphate reabsorption in mice, NaPi-IIc has a more significant role in humans, highlighting species-specific differences in its function (Biber2013Phosphate). The proper functioning of NaPi-IIc is vital for preventing renal phosphate wasting and maintaining normal serum phosphate levels (Bergwitz2006SLC34A3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC34A3 gene are associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH), an autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by reduced renal phosphate reabsorption, leading to hypophosphatemia, rickets, and hypercalciuria. Patients with HHRH often present with elevated serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which distinguishes it from other forms of hypophosphatemic rickets (LorenzDepiereux2006Hereditary; Ichikawa2006Intronic).

The SLC34A3 gene encodes the sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaPi-IIc, which is crucial for phosphate homeostasis in the kidney. Mutations in this gene, such as frameshift, splice-site, and intronic deletions, lead to a loss of function of the transporter, resulting in the clinical manifestations of HHRH (Bergwitz2006SLC34A3; Ichikawa2006Intronic). These mutations can cause aberrant RNA splicing or premature termination of the protein, disrupting normal phosphate reabsorption (LorenzDepiereux2006Hereditary; Ichikawa2006Intronic).

HHRH is managed primarily through phosphate supplementation, which can lead to remission of symptoms. However, the addition of vitamin D can cause complications, highlighting the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment (LorenzDepiereux2006Hereditary).

## Interactions
The SLC34A3 gene encodes the NaPi-IIc protein, a sodium-phosphate cotransporter involved in renal phosphate reabsorption. NaPi-IIc interacts with several PDZ domain-containing proteins, including NHERF1 and NHERF3, which are crucial for its stabilization in the apical membrane of renal proximal tubular cells (VillaBellosta2008Interactions; Segawa2019Molecular). These interactions occur through novel binding motifs in the C-terminus of NaPi-IIc, despite the absence of a classical PDZ binding site (VillaBellosta2008Interactions). 

NaPi-IIc colocalizes with NHERF1 and NHERF3 in the brush border membrane of proximal tubules, and its interaction with NHERF3 is particularly significant under low-phosphate dietary conditions (VillaBellosta2008Interactions). The membrane-associated protein MAP17 modulates these interactions, specifically activating NHERF3 to internalize the NaPi-IIc complex to the trans-Golgi network (VillaBellosta2008Interactions). 

PDZK1, another PDZ domain protein, plays a role in the regulation of NaPi-IIc, particularly in response to dietary phosphate changes. PDZK1 knockout mice exhibit impaired adaptation of NaPi-IIc to low phosphate diets, highlighting its regulatory significance (Giral2011Role).
