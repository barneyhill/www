# RIPPLY2

## Overview
RIPPLY2 is a gene that encodes the ripply transcriptional repressor 2, a protein integral to the regulation of vertebral development and somitogenesis. As a transcriptional repressor, the protein plays a pivotal role in the formation of somites, which are precursors to the vertebral column and associated structures. RIPPLY2 functions by interacting with T-box transcription factors, such as TBX6, to modulate gene expression during embryonic development. This interaction is crucial for the proper segmentation and patterning of vertebrae, as it converts T-box proteins from activators to repressors, thereby influencing the Notch signaling pathway. Mutations in the RIPPLY2 gene have been linked to developmental disorders affecting vertebral and rib formation, underscoring its significance in maintaining vertebral stability and function (McInerneyLeo2014Compound; Zhao2018Ripply2).

## Structure


## Function
RIPPLY2 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a critical role in somitogenesis, the process of forming somites, which are segmented blocks of mesoderm that develop into the vertebral column and associated structures. In healthy human cells, RIPPLY2 functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, regulating gene expression during vertebral development. It interacts with T-box proteins, such as TBX6, converting them from transcriptional activators to repressors, thereby modulating Tbx6-mediated transcriptional activation (McInerneyLeo2014Compound).

RIPPLY2 is involved in a negative feedback loop that represses Tbx-mediated transcription from the Mesp2 promoter, a process crucial for proper somite segmentation and rostrocaudal patterning in vertebrates (McInerneyLeo2014Compound). The protein is expressed in the rostral presomitic mesoderm and is a direct transcriptional target of Mesp2 and Tbx6, indicating its role in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for cell differentiation and tissue patterning (McInerneyLeo2014Compound).

Mutations in RIPPLY2 can lead to vertebral segmentation defects, highlighting its importance in maintaining the stability and function of the vertebral column during development (McInerneyLeo2014Compound).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RIPPLY2 gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders, primarily affecting vertebral and rib formation. Compound heterozygous mutations in RIPPLY2 are associated with vertebral segmentation defects (SDV), a condition characterized by irregular vertebrae and rib formation due to aberrant somite formation during embryogenesis (McInerneyLeo2014Compound). These mutations include a novel stop mutation (c.A238T:p.Arg80*) and a splice site mutation (c.240-4T>G), both of which are likely causative of SDV in affected individuals (McInerneyLeo2014Compound).

RIPPLY2 mutations are also linked to Spondylocostal Dysostosis, a severe skeletal dysplasia syndrome, through biallelic loss-of-function variants (Yang2020Mutational). Additionally, a homozygous frameshift mutation in RIPPLY2 has been identified in patients with Klippel-Feil Syndrome (KFS), a disorder characterized by congenital fusion of cervical vertebrae, suggesting a role for RIPPLY2 in the pathogenesis of KFS (Li2020The).

Alterations in RIPPLY2 expression or its interactions, particularly with the Notch signaling pathway, may disrupt normal somitogenesis and skeletal development, contributing to these conditions (McInerneyLeo2014Compound).

## Interactions
RIPPLY2 is known to interact with T-box transcription factors, particularly Tbx6, playing a crucial role in somitogenesis. This interaction is mediated by the Ripply homology domain, specifically the FPIQ tetrapeptide motif, which binds to the T-box domain of Tbx6 (Zhao2018Ripply2). RIPPLY2 recruits the proteasome complex to facilitate the degradation of Tbx6, a process essential for defining segment borders during embryonic development (Zhao2018Ripply2). The interaction between RIPPLY2 and Tbx6 is context-dependent, occurring specifically in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) tissue (Zhao2018Ripply2).

RIPPLY2 also interacts with Groucho/TLE transcriptional corepressor proteins, converting T-box proteins from transcriptional activators to repressors (McInerneyLeo2014Compound). This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional repression activity of RIPPLY2, which is necessary for proper vertebral segmentation and development (McInerneyLeo2014Compound). The Ripply homology domain and the WRPW motif of RIPPLY2 are essential for these interactions, highlighting the importance of specific protein motifs in its function (Karaca2015Rare). These interactions underscore RIPPLY2's role as a negative regulator in the Notch signaling pathway, influencing somitogenesis and vertebral development.
