# NASP

## Overview
The NASP gene encodes the nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein, a histone chaperone that plays a pivotal role in chromatin assembly and cell cycle regulation. This protein is categorized as a histone-binding protein and is involved in the transport and storage of histones H1, H3, and H4 within the nucleus. NASP exists in multiple isoforms, including somatic NASP (sNASP) and testicular NASP (tNASP), which are generated through alternative splicing and serve distinct functions in different cellular contexts (Richardson2000Characterization; Batova2000Analysis). The protein's structure is characterized by tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, a nuclear localization signal, and a leucine zipper, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids (Wang2008Expanded). NASP is essential for chromatin dynamics, DNA replication, and repair, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Richardson2006Nuclear; Kang2018NASP).

## Structure
The human NASP protein is a histone-binding protein involved in chromatin assembly and cell cycle regulation. It exists in multiple isoforms, including somatic NASP (sNASP) and testicular NASP (tNASP), which arise from alternative splicing. The sNASP isoform is shorter, consisting of 421 amino acids, while tNASP is composed of 787 amino acids (Richardson2000Characterization; Batova2000Analysis).

NASP contains several structural features, including tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. These motifs are located both NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal to a large central domain enriched in acidic amino acids, such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid (Wang2008Expanded). The protein also includes a nuclear localization signal, a leucine zipper, and an ATP/GTP binding site (Richardson2000Characterization).

The histone-binding domains of NASP are highly conserved, with significant homology to the Xenopus N1/N2 protein. These domains facilitate the binding of histones H3 and H4, as well as histone H1 (Wang2008Expanded; Batova1996HistoneBinding). The protein's structure is further characterized by its acidic nature, which contributes to its higher molecular mass observed in SDS-PAGE analysis (Batova1996HistoneBinding).

## Function
The nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP) functions as a histone chaperone, playing a critical role in the transport and storage of histones, particularly H1, H3, and H4, within the nucleus. It is involved in chromatin assembly and disassembly, essential processes for DNA replication, repair, and cell cycle progression (Richardson2006Nuclear; Finn2012Vertebrate). NASP facilitates the import and nuclear hand-off of monomeric histone H3, acting as a predominant nuclear receptor and preventing aggregation before H3 encounters H4 (Pardal2022A). It also interacts with other proteins, such as HAT1-RBBP7 and UBR7, to form complexes that aid in histone acetylation and ubiquitination, respectively, ensuring a balanced supply of histones (Pardal2022A).

NASP exists in two isoforms, somatic (sNASP) and testis-specific (tNASP), which are involved in different cellular contexts. sNASP is crucial in somatic cells for maintaining a reservoir of histones that can be rapidly mobilized, supporting genome stability and cell growth (Finn2012Vertebrate). The protein's activity is regulated during the cell cycle, with its expression peaking during the S phase, highlighting its importance in DNA replication and chromatin remodeling (Richardson2000Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NASP gene have been linked to various cancers. NASP is highly expressed in dividing cells, including embryonic and malignant tissues, and its expression profile can indicate poor prognosis in cancers such as breast and ovarian cancer (Alekseev2009Analysis). In hepatocellular carcinoma, NASP levels are significantly higher in liver tumors compared to normal tissues, suggesting its role in cancer proliferation. Knockdown of NASP in liver cancer cells leads to decreased growth kinetics and reduced tumor formation, indicating its potential as a target for cancer prevention (Kang2018NASP).

NASP overexpression in HeLa cells affects proteins involved in cancer pathways, organismal injury, and immune response, while its depletion impacts DNA replication, repair, and cell cycle pathways (Alekseev2009Analysis). Overexpression also leads to the upregulation of genes associated with TNF, a cytokine involved in inflammation and cancer, suggesting a link to inflammatory responses and cancer-related processes (Alekseev2009Analysis).

NASP's interactions with chromatin remodeling proteins and its involvement in nucleosome assembly and DNA repair are crucial for maintaining chromatin stability, and its dysregulation can contribute to cancer progression (Richardson2006Nuclear; Kang2018NASP).

## Interactions
NASP (nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein) is a histone chaperone that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in chromatin assembly and cell cycle regulation. NASP is known to form complexes with histones, particularly H1, H3, and H4. It binds to histone H1 with high affinity, facilitating its transport into the nucleus and incorporation into chromatin (Wang2008Expanded; Richardson2000Characterization). NASP also interacts with histones H3 and H4, forming stable complexes that are essential for chromatin assembly (Wang2008Expanded).

In HeLa cells, NASP has been shown to interact with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), with approximately 27% of HSP90 cross-linked to NASP, indicating a significant interaction (Alekseev2005Mass). This interaction is confirmed by immunoaffinity chromatography, which shows that HSP90 co-purifies with both sNASP and tNASP in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Alekseev2005Mass). NASP also associates with other proteins involved in DNA repair, such as DNA-activated protein kinase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase II, suggesting its involvement in nuclear processes (Alekseev2005Mass).

NASP's interaction with importin-5 (Imp5) is crucial for the nuclear import and hand-off of monomeric histone H3. NASP binds to H3 after its release from Imp5, facilitated by RanGTP, acting as a receptor for monomeric H3 in the nucleus (Pardal2022A). These interactions highlight NASP's role in maintaining histone balance and facilitating chromatin dynamics.
