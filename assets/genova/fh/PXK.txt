# PXK

## Overview
The PXK gene encodes the PX domain containing serine/threonine kinase-like protein, which is involved in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. This protein is characterized by the presence of a PX domain, which facilitates its interaction with phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI 3 P), playing a crucial role in receptor internalization and intracellular trafficking processes (Teasdale2011Insights; Vaughn2015Lupus). Although classified as a kinase-like protein, the specific kinase activity of PXK remains to be fully elucidated. PXK is expressed in various tissues, with significant roles in the brain and immune cells, particularly B cells, where it is implicated in B cell receptor (BCR) internalization and signaling (Vaughn2015Lupus). Clinically, alterations in the PXK gene have been associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), highlighting its importance in immune regulation and disease pathogenesis (Vaughn2015Lupus).

## Structure
The PXK protein contains a PX domain, which is a globular fold approximately 110 residues in length, composed of three β-strands followed by three α-helices. This domain features a long proline-rich loop between helices α1 and α2 and an electropositive basic pocket involved in binding negatively charged phosphate groups of phosphoinositides (Teasdale2011Insights). The PX domain is crucial for membrane recruitment and is similar in function to other lipid-binding domains like PH, FYVE, and ENTH (Teasdale2011Insights). The PXK protein specifically interacts with liposomes containing PtdIns3P, indicating its specificity for this lipid (Chandra2019Classification).

The PX domain's binding to PtdIns3P involves specific interactions: the 3-phosphate forms electrostatic bonds with a conserved arginine, the inositol group stacks with a conserved tyrosine or phenylalanine, and the 4-and 5-hydroxy groups form hydrogen bonds with another conserved arginine. The 1-phosphate is coordinated by a conserved lysine (Teasdale2011Insights). PXK is also a serine/threonine kinase-like protein, suggesting potential kinase activity, although specific details on its kinase domain structure are not provided in the context. Post-translational modifications may include phosphorylation, influencing its function and interactions.

## Function
The PXK gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. In healthy human cells, PXK is involved in the internalization of receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), following ligand binding. This process is mediated by the PX domain, which binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI 3 P), facilitating receptor internalization and intracellular trafficking (Vaughn2015Lupus). PXK is widely expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the brain and blood, particularly in B cells, where it is hypothesized to participate in B cell receptor (BCR) internalization. This function is crucial for B cell signaling and the development of immune responses (Vaughn2015Lupus).

The PXK protein is believed to bind membranes at the C-terminal and actin at the N-terminal, potentially acting as a mechanical switch to facilitate the movement of receptor complexes inside the cell. This suggests a role in intracellular trafficking and receptor internalization, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Jacobsen2017The). PXK's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PXK gene have been implicated in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases. Variants in the PXK locus are associated with an increased risk of lupus, particularly among individuals of European descent. These variants are linked to a decreased rate of B-cell receptor (BCR) internalization, a process crucial for B cell survival and function. This alteration may impact B cell signaling and contribute to the pathophysiology of lupus by affecting B cell survival and cell fate (Vaughn2015Lupus).

The PXK gene is also expressed in immune cells, and its interaction with BCR suggests a regulatory role in BCR signaling. Knockdown experiments have confirmed PXK's involvement in BCR trafficking, supporting its role in lupus pathogenesis (Vaughn2015Lupus). Despite these findings, the exact genetic mechanisms by which PXK variants contribute to lupus remain unclear, and further studies are needed to understand their clinical significance (Vaughn2015Lupus).

In addition to its role in autoimmune diseases, PXK has been studied in the context of connective tissue disorders and inflammatory diseases, where it is differentially expressed in fibroblast-like cells from equine synovial membranes (Thomsen2017FOXO1).
