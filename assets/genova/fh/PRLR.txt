# PRLR

## Overview
The PRLR gene encodes the prolactin receptor, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in mediating the biological effects of the hormone prolactin. This receptor is integral to various physiological processes, including reproductive functions, lactation, immune regulation, and metabolic activities. The prolactin receptor is characterized by its complex structure, which includes extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains, facilitating its interaction with prolactin and subsequent activation of signaling pathways such as JAK2/STAT5. The PRLR gene is expressed in a wide range of tissues, underscoring its diverse functional roles. Mutations and alterations in the PRLR gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, including prolactinomas, benign breast tumors, and familial hyperprolactinemia, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (BoleFeysot1998Prolactin; Gorvin2015The; Gorvin2018Association).

## Structure
The prolactin receptor (PRLR) is a transmembrane protein with a complex molecular structure comprising several distinct domains. The primary structure of PRLR includes a sequence of amino acids that form its extracellular domain (ECD), transmembrane domain (TMD), and intracellular domain (ICD) (Bugge2016A). The secondary structure of the TMD is characterized by an alpha-helical conformation, specifically from residues D210 to A233, with a slight bend around S221 (Bugge2016A). The ECD is involved in ligand binding and maintains a similar conformation in both liganded and unliganded states, suggesting minimal structural rearrangement upon hormone binding (Bugge2016A).

The tertiary structure of PRLR includes a specific 3D shape that facilitates its interaction with prolactin. The quaternary structure involves dimerization, particularly at the stem-stem interface, which is crucial for receptor activation (van2010Structural). This interface is asymmetrical, with specific residues such as His159, Phe160, and Lys168 playing key roles in stabilizing the dimer (van2010Structural). The PRLR also features post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which are common in transmembrane proteins, although specific modifications for PRLR are not detailed in the provided context. Multiple splice variant isoforms of PRLR exist, affecting its function and localization (Bugge2016A).

## Function
The prolactin receptor (PRLR) is a critical component in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in mediating the effects of prolactin, a hormone essential for reproductive functions and lactation. PRLR is expressed in numerous tissues, including the mammary gland, pancreatic beta-cells, adipocytes, and immune cells, indicating its diverse roles in cell biology (Gorvin2015The).

Upon binding with prolactin, PRLR activates several signaling pathways, notably the JAK2/STAT5 pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (BoleFeysot1998Prolactin). This activation leads to various organismal outcomes, such as mammary gland development during late gestation and the early post-partum period, and the formation of the corpus luteum following blastocyst implantation (Gorvin2015The). In males, although prolactin is less abundant, PRLR may play roles in reproductive health, as hyperprolactinemia can lead to issues like erectile dysfunction and oligospermia (Gorvin2015The).

PRLR also influences immune regulation and metabolic processes, as it is involved in islet differentiation and the regulation of fat stores (Gorvin2015The). The receptor's ability to form homodimers upon prolactin binding is essential for its activation and subsequent signal transduction (BoleFeysot1998Prolactin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRLR gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Gain-of-function mutations, such as Asn492Ile, have been linked to prolactinomas, a type of pituitary tumor. This mutation leads to increased signaling via the Akt pathway, contributing to tumor development and potentially resulting in aggressive prolactinomas that are resistant to standard dopamine agonist therapy (Gorvin2018Association). 

In breast tissue, the I146L mutation in the PRLR gene is associated with benign breast tumors, specifically multiple fibroadenomas. This mutation causes constitutive activation of the receptor, leading to persistent signaling through the STAT5 pathway, which may contribute to tumor development (Bogorad2008Identification). 

The His188Arg mutation in the PRLR gene is linked to familial hyperprolactinemia. This mutation results in a loss of function, impairing the receptor's ability to activate the JAK2-STAT5 pathway, which is crucial for prolactin signaling. This disruption leads to elevated prolactin levels in affected individuals (Newey2013Mutant). 

Altered expression of PRLR is also implicated in various cancers, including breast and prostate cancer, where it can drive tumor progression and resistance to therapies (Kavarthapu2021Crosstalk; Standing2023Prolactin).

## Interactions
The prolactin receptor (PRLR) engages in several significant interactions with other proteins, which are crucial for its signaling functions. PRLR interacts with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) through a co-structure formation involving phosphoinositide-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). This interaction is essential for the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) pathway, with the FERM-SH2 domain of JAK2 and specific residues of PRLR playing key roles in this process (ArayaSecchi2023The).

PRLR also forms ligand-independent homo- and heterodimers with its variants, including long and short forms. These dimerizations occur on the cell surface and are independent of prolactin binding. The short forms can inhibit prolactin-induced signaling by forming heterodimers with the long form, which lack the necessary cytoplasmic sequences for activating the JAK2/STAT5 pathway (Qazi2006LigandIndependent).

Cyclophilin A (CypA) interacts with the intracellular domain of PRLR, modulating its signaling pathways. This interaction affects the activation of Rac1 and prolongs JAK2 phosphorylation, suggesting a role for CypA in modulating PRLR signal transduction (Syed2003A).
