# C15orf40

## Overview
C15orf40 is a gene located on chromosome 15, encoding the protein known as chromosome 15 open reading frame 40. This protein is currently not categorized into a specific functional class such as kinases or receptors, and its precise biological role remains to be fully elucidated. Despite its presence in various genetic studies, the protein encoded by C15orf40 has not been definitively linked to any specific cellular pathways or physiological processes. Research has yet to establish a clear connection between C15orf40 and particular diseases, although it has been mentioned in studies involving genetic deletions and mutations (Chen2020A; Renieri2014Oligogenic). Further investigation is required to determine the functional significance of this gene and its encoded protein in human health and disease.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the C15orf40 gene remains largely unclear, as current studies have not definitively linked it to specific diseases or conditions. In a study on a Chinese girl with a 15q25.2 microdeletion, C15orf40 was one of the seven genes deleted, but the study did not provide specific information on its clinical significance, focusing instead on the BNC1 gene's role in premature ovarian failure (Chen2020A). 

In a Finnish population study, C15orf40 was noted to have a higher frequency compared to other European populations, but the study did not elaborate on its clinical implications (Heyne2021Mono). Another study on lung adenocarcinoma identified a truncating mutation in C15orf40 in healthy controls, suggesting it is not linked to cancer in this context (Renieri2014Oligogenic). 

In research on non-syndromic primary failure of tooth eruption, C15orf40 was initially considered but later ruled out as a candidate gene due to lack of segregation with the disease phenotype (Assiry2019KMT2C). Overall, while C15orf40 is mentioned in various genetic studies, its specific role in disease remains to be clarified.
