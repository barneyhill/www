# SMIM15

## Overview
SMIM15 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 15, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. Research has highlighted its potential role in the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma, where its expression levels may influence patient outcomes (Li2022A). Additionally, SMIM15 has been identified as a candidate gene in studies of musculoskeletal traits, suggesting a broader biological significance (Hernandez2018Replication). Despite these associations, further research is necessary to fully understand the functional roles and clinical implications of SMIM15.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The SMIM15 gene has been implicated in the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). A study by Li et al. developed a prognostic model incorporating SMIM15 among 17 genes, which demonstrated significant predictive performance for overall survival in LUAD patients. The model showed that higher expression levels of SMIM15 were associated with high-risk groups, correlating with a worse prognosis and shorter survival times. This suggests that alterations in SMIM15 expression may contribute to the progression and severity of LUAD, making it a potential biomarker for assessing patient prognosis (Li2022A).

In the context of musculoskeletal traits, SMIM15 was identified as a candidate gene within a quantitative trait locus (QTL) related to tibia length in a study involving LG/J and SM/J mouse strains. However, the clinical significance of SMIM15 in this context was not specifically detailed, indicating that further research is needed to understand its role in musculoskeletal conditions (Hernandez2018Replication). Overall, while SMIM15 has been associated with certain disease conditions, its full clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target require further investigation.
