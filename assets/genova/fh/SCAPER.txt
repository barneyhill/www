# SCAPER

## Overview
SCAPER (S-phase cyclin A associated protein in the ER) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in cell cycle regulation and microtubule dynamics. The SCAPER protein is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a critical role in the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle by interacting with cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes. This interaction is essential for DNA replication and cell proliferation. Additionally, SCAPER is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics during meiosis, contributing to spindle formation and proper chromosome segregation. The protein is also expressed in primary cilia, where it influences ciliary dynamics and disassembly. Mutations in the SCAPER gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including intellectual disability, retinitis pigmentosa, and ciliopathy syndromes, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and developmental processes (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated; Wormser2020Absence).

## Structure
The SCAPER protein is encoded by the SCAPER gene and plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains and motifs. The primary structure of SCAPER features a SCAPER_N domain located at positions 90-183, which is involved in binding to cyclin A2 when it is associated with CDK2, facilitating the regulation of cellular reproduction (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated). The protein also contains a zinc finger domain of the C2H2-type at positions 790-822, suggesting a role in interacting with genomic or RNA molecules (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated).

SCAPER's secondary structure includes a long helix in its middle part, partially arranged as a coiled coil, and an α-solenoid C-terminal domain (CTD), which is implicated in the autoregulation of tubulin in cells (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated). The protein also features four coiled coil domains and a putative transmembrane domain, along with an ER retrieval signal at the C-terminus (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated).

Mutations in SCAPER can lead to early termination of the protein, affecting its expression, folding, or functional domains. Specific mutations, such as F628C, impact SCAPER's binding to the CCR4-NOT complex by weakening non-covalent interactions (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated).

## Function
The SCAPER gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and microtubule dynamics. In healthy human cells, SCAPER is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes. This interaction is essential for the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, influencing DNA replication and cell proliferation (Wormser2020Absence). SCAPER is also involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics during meiosis, binding to microtubules and contributing to spindle formation. This function is crucial for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis during cell division, ensuring normal cell division processes (Wormser2020Absence).

SCAPER is expressed in primary cilia, where it co-localizes with tubulin, forming bundles of microtubules. Its expression peaks during the late G1 and S phases, coinciding with ciliary resorption, suggesting a role in ciliary dynamics and disassembly (Wormser2019SCAPER). The protein's involvement in cilia length regulation is highlighted by its localization to the basal body and ciliary tip, indicating its importance in maintaining normal ciliary function and potentially influencing cell cycle progression (Wormser2019SCAPER).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCAPER gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily intellectual disability (ID) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Initial studies identified homozygous frameshift variants in SCAPER as a cause of nonsyndromic ID in an Iranian family. Subsequent research linked biallelic loss of function SCAPER variants to ID with or without RP in individuals from various countries, including Spain, Israel, and Iran (Fasham2019Delineating). SCAPER mutations have also been associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome-like presentations, which include ID, RP, short stature, obesity, and brachydactyly, particularly in Bedouin families from southern Israel (Wormser2019SCAPER).

SCAPER is implicated in ciliary dynamics, and its mutations can affect cilia length, contributing to ciliopathy syndromes. In particular, a homozygous truncation mutation in SCAPER was identified in individuals from consanguineous Bedouin families affected by Bardet-Biedl syndrome, highlighting the gene's role in ciliary function (Wormser2019SCAPER). Additionally, SCAPER mutations have been linked to male infertility due to disrupted microtubule dynamics during meiosis, as observed in both human and Drosophila studies (Wormser2020Absence). These findings underscore the diverse clinical manifestations associated with SCAPER mutations, emphasizing the gene's significance in various developmental and degenerative conditions.

## Interactions
SCAPER interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and microtubule dynamics. It binds to cyclin A2, a key regulator of the cell cycle, through residues 184-213, with a focus on residues 192-207, which are predicted to interact closely with cyclin A2 (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated). This interaction is crucial for SCAPER's function as a feedback loop regulator during the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated). SCAPER also interacts with CDK2, another cell cycle regulator, with the binding region located at positions 490-498 (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated).

In addition to its interactions with cyclin A2 and CDK2, SCAPER binds to the CNOT11 component of the CCR4-NOT complex, with the binding region extending to position 640 and involving residues E620, F628, I629, and L632 (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated). This interaction is characterized by significant hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for maintaining proper cellular functions (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated).

SCAPER's interactions are not limited to proteins; it also plays a role in tubulin autoregulation, affecting microtubule dynamics and chromosomal segregation during mitosis (Sharkia2024SCAPERRelated). These interactions highlight SCAPER's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
