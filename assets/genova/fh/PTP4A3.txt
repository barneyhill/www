# PTP4A3

## Overview
PTP4A3, also known as PRL-3, is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A3, a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family. This protein is characterized by its enzymatic ability to dephosphorylate tyrosine, threonine, and serine residues, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell migration, angiogenesis, and cancer progression (Li2020Endosulfan; Tautz2013Protein). PTP4A3 is particularly noted for its involvement in oncogenic pathways, where it interacts with several signaling molecules and pathways, such as the Src/FAK and PI3K/AKT/eNOS pathways, to promote tumor cell migration and invasion (Li2020Endosulfan; wei2020oncogenic). The overexpression of PTP4A3 is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including colorectal, gastric, and renal cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Song2021PTP4A3; Zimmerman2013Targeted).

## Structure
PTP4A3, also known as PRL-3, is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family, characterized by its ability to dephosphorylate tyrosine, threonine, and serine residues. The primary structure of PTP4A3 includes a catalytic domain with a conserved HC(X)5R motif, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Tautz2013Protein). This motif is part of the P-loop, a structural feature that creates a positively charged environment to stabilize the thiolate anion of the catalytic cysteine, facilitating catalysis (Tautz2013Protein).

The secondary structure of PTP4A3 typically involves alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a compact, globular tertiary structure. This configuration is common among protein tyrosine phosphatases, contributing to their stability and function (Tautz2013Protein). PTP4A3 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and prenylation, which can influence its cellular localization and function (Czub2020Structure).

PTP4A3 is overexpressed in many human solid tumors and leukemias, suggesting its role in cancer transformation. Its interactions with CNNM magnesium transport regulators enhance energy metabolism in cancer cells, contributing to its pro-oncogenic role (Czub2020Structure). The development of inhibitors like JMS-053 targets PTP4A3, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Czub2020Structure).

## Function
Protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A3 (PTP4A3) is involved in the regulation of endothelial cell motility and response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, which are essential for maintaining vascular health and function (Li2020Endosulfan). PTP4A3 mediates its effects through several signaling pathways, including Src/FAK, PI3K/AKT/eNOS, MAPK/ERK, and NF-κB, which are crucial for cell migration and angiogenesis (Li2020Endosulfan). In endothelial cells, PTP4A3 is suggested to be an upstream regulator of the FAK-Src complex, which is involved in cell migration (Li2020Endosulfan).

In the context of exposure to environmental stressors like the pesticide endosulfan, PTP4A3 expression is upregulated, enhancing cell migration through these pathways (Li2020Endosulfan). The protein is typically weakly expressed in vascular endothelial cells under normal conditions, but its overexpression can promote endothelial cell migration through the VEGF signaling pathway (Li2020Endosulfan). PTP4A3 also modulates endothelial cell functions such as nitric oxide (NO) production, which is crucial for vascular reactivity and endothelial function (Li2020Endosulfan).

## Clinical Significance
The PTP4A3 gene, also known as PRL-3, is implicated in the progression and metastasis of various cancers. Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including colorectal, gastric, breast, and renal cancers. In colorectal cancer, PTP4A3 is consistently elevated in metastatic liver samples, indicating its significant role in tumor biology and progression (Zimmerman2013Targeted). In renal cell carcinoma, particularly clear cell and papillary subtypes, PTP4A3 is overexpressed in tumor tissues and is linked to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as immune evasion (Song2021PTP4A3). 

PTP4A3 also plays a role in hematological malignancies. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), reduced expression of PTP4A3 is a negative prognostic indicator, suggesting its involvement in leukemogenesis (Beekman2011Retroviral). In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), PTP4A3 is upregulated and associated with drug resistance, particularly in cases resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Zhou2012The).

The gene's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in signaling pathways that promote tumor cell migration and invasion, such as the PI3K-AKT-ERK pathway, and its regulation of immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (Song2021PTP4A3).

## Interactions
Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 4A3 (PTP4A3), also known as PRL-3, is involved in several interactions that contribute to its role in cancer progression. PTP4A3 interacts with integrin β1, where its overexpression leads to downregulation of integrin β1 phosphorylation, affecting cell motility and invasion (wei2020oncogenic). It also interacts with CRMP2, dephosphorylating it at the T514 site, which influences cytoskeletal functions and promotes cell migration and invasion in uveal melanoma (Duciel2019Protein).

PTP4A3 forms a complex with matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), enhancing MMP14's membrane accumulation and vesicular trafficking, which is crucial for cell migration and invasiveness in uveal melanoma (Maacha2016Protein). The phosphatase also interacts with the Src signaling pathway, modulating Src activity by affecting the phosphorylation of Src at tyrosine 527 and altering the expression of C-terminal Src kinase (CSK), which influences leukemia cell migration (Wei2019Protein).

PTP4A3's interactions extend to the ERK 1/2 pathway, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (wei2020oncogenic). These interactions highlight PTP4A3's role in promoting malignancy through various signaling pathways and protein interactions.
