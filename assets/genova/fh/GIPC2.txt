# GIPC2

## Overview
GIPC2 is a gene that encodes the protein GIPC PDZ domain containing family member 2, which is part of the GIPC family of proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain, which is integral to its role in facilitating protein-protein interactions essential for intracellular trafficking and signal transduction. GIPC2 is expressed in various cellular compartments, including the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it plays a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Dong2021GIPC2). The protein is involved in the transcriptional regulation of key cell cycle inhibitors, such as p27, and interacts with other proteins like NONO and Fzd7, highlighting its involvement in both tumor suppression and cancer progression (Wang2022GIPC2; Dong2021GIPC2). GIPC2's diverse interactions and regulatory functions underscore its significance in cellular signaling pathways and its potential impact on cancer biology.

## Structure


## Function
GIPC2 is a member of the GIPC family of proteins, characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for intracellular trafficking and signal transduction. In healthy human cells, GIPC2 is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm, playing a significant role in regulating cell proliferation and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Dong2021GIPC2). It is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, which is essential for cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, thereby preventing the transition to the S phase and controlling cell proliferation (Dong2021GIPC2).

GIPC2 interacts with the protein NONO via its PDZ domain, which is crucial for its tumor-suppressive function. This interaction helps regulate the transcription of p27, contributing to its role in cell cycle control (Dong2021GIPC2). GIPC2 is also involved in maintaining the chromaffin phenotype of adrenal chromaffin cells, preventing their differentiation into neuronal cells by modulating the expression of specific markers (Dong2021GIPC2). These functions highlight GIPC2's role in cellular signaling and its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes and tissue architecture.

## Clinical Significance
GIPC2 is implicated in several cancers due to alterations in its expression and mutations. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), GIPC2 is downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, which can be reversed with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment, indicating epigenetic silencing (Katoh2013Functional). In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), increased GIPC2 expression is associated with a favorable prognosis and higher immune cell infiltration, while its expression is generally reduced in COAD tissues compared to normal tissues. Low GIPC2 expression correlates with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval, making it a potential prognostic biomarker (Kang2023Increased).

Somatic mutations in GIPC2 have been identified in various cancers, including F74Y, R312Q, and E216X in colorectal cancer; D125N and E288K in malignant melanoma; and G102E in ovarian cancer. The E216X mutation in colorectal cancer is particularly deleterious, resulting in the loss of the MYO6-binding GH2 domain, which may alter GIPC2 functions (Katoh2013Functional; Kang2023Increased). These mutations and expression changes suggest that GIPC2 plays a significant role in cancer biology, influencing tumor progression and metastasis.

## Interactions
GIPC2, a member of the GIPC PDZ domain-containing family, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the nucleoprotein NONO, which is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. GIPC2 interacts with NONO via its PDZ domain, and this interaction is essential for upregulating p27 transcription, thereby arresting the cell cycle in pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL) cells (Dong2021GIPC2).

In the context of prostate cancer, GIPC2 interacts with the WNT co-receptor Fzd7, also through its PDZ domain. This interaction promotes metastasis by activating the WNT-β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell movement and metastasis. The interaction between GIPC2 and Fzd7 has been confirmed through various experimental methods, including co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis (Wang2022GIPC2).

GIPC2 also interacts with myosin VI, a motor protein, through its GH2 domain. This interaction is enhanced by the presence of PlexinD1, suggesting a role in endocytic transport processes (Shang2017Structure). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of GIPC2 in different cellular contexts.
