# TMEM74B

## Overview
TMEM74B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 74B, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and maintaining cellular structure. The specific functions and interactions of transmembrane protein 74B remain under investigation, but it is hypothesized to be involved in cellular pathways that are critical for maintaining homeostasis and cellular communication. Understanding the role of TMEM74B and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease, as alterations in transmembrane proteins are often linked to pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
