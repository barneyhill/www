# ETDB

## Overview
The ETDB gene encodes the protein embryonic testis differentiation homolog B, which plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of embryonic testis tissue. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, which means it is involved in regulating the expression of other genes during the critical stages of embryonic development. The ETDB gene is part of a complex network of genetic interactions that are essential for proper sexual differentiation and reproductive system development. Mutations or dysregulation of this gene can lead to disorders of sexual development, highlighting its clinical significance in understanding and potentially treating such conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
