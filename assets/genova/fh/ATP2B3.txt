# ATP2B3

## Overview
The ATP2B3 gene encodes the ATPase plasma membrane Ca2+ transporting 3 protein, commonly referred to as PMCA3, which is a member of the P-type ATPase family. This transmembrane protein plays a pivotal role in cellular calcium homeostasis by extruding calcium ions from the cytosol in exchange for protons, a process driven by ATP hydrolysis. PMCA3 is characterized by its 10 transmembrane domains and is regulated by calmodulin, which enhances its calcium transport activity. The protein is predominantly expressed in the adrenal cortex and the cerebellum, where it is crucial for maintaining calcium levels necessary for hormone production and neuronal signaling, respectively. Mutations in ATP2B3 have been implicated in conditions such as aldosterone-producing adenomas, highlighting its clinical significance in disorders related to calcium dysregulation (Stafford2017The; Guo2023ATP2B3; Tauber2016Cellular).

## Structure
The ATP2B3 gene encodes a plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) involved in calcium ion transport. The protein is a P-type ATPase with 10 transmembrane domains and three large cytosolic domains, similar to the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) (Tauber2016Cellular). The primary structure consists of approximately 1200 amino acid residues, resulting in a molecular mass of about 125-140 kDa (Strehler2015The). 

The protein's secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices and sheets into a functional protein capable of calcium transport. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

Key domains include the catalytic domain, which is involved in the ATP-driven ion pump mechanism, and the regulatory domain, which interacts with calmodulin (CaM) to modulate activity (Krebs2015The). Alternative splicing at specific sites, such as site A and site C, results in various isoforms with distinct regulatory properties, affecting regions like the calmodulin-binding domain and the C-terminal tail (Strehler2015The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can enhance PMCA activity and are isoform-specific (Strehler2015The).

## Function
The ATP2B3 gene encodes a plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, specifically known as PMCA3, which plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis in human cells. This protein is responsible for extruding cytosolic calcium ions (Ca2+) in exchange for protons (H+), a process that is fueled by ATP hydrolysis. This function is essential for regulating intracellular calcium levels, which is vital for various cellular activities, including hormone production and neuronal signaling (Stafford2017The; Tauber2016Cellular).

In the adrenal cortex, ATP2B3 is expressed in all three zones and is particularly important in adrenal glomerulosa cells, where it helps control aldosterone production by managing Ca2+ influx and extrusion across the plasma membrane. This regulation prevents excessive aldosterone production, which is crucial for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance (Tauber2016Cellular).

In the nervous system, PMCA3 is involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis, which is critical for proper neuronal function and signaling. It is predominantly expressed in the cerebellum, where it helps regulate calcium levels necessary for neuronal activity and health (Stafford2017The). The protein's activity is modulated by calmodulin, which enhances its affinity for Ca2+ and increases its activity (Stafford2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP2B3 gene are associated with aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs), a primary cause of primary aldosteronism, which leads to arterial hypertension. These mutations, such as the Leu425_Val426del and K416_F418delinsN, result in increased intracellular calcium levels, which enhance aldosterone production by upregulating aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) expression (Liao2021Characteristics; Tauber2016Cellular). The Leu425_Val426del mutation is linked to a 7-fold increase in CYP11B2 mRNA and a 2-fold increase in aldosterone levels, contributing to the pathophysiology of primary aldosteronism (Tauber2016Cellular). 

These mutations disrupt calcium signaling and membrane potential regulation, leading to depolarization and increased sodium permeability, which are critical in the development of hyperaldosteronism (Tauber2016Cellular). The K416_F418delinsN mutation, specifically, has been associated with uncontrollable hypertension and hypokalemia, and its presence in adrenal tissue suggests a somatic origin specific to the tumor (Liao2021Characteristics). The prevalence of ATP2B3 mutations in APAs is relatively low, ranging from 0.5% to 3.1% in different populations (Murakami2015A; Liao2021Characteristics).

## Interactions
ATP2B3, also known as PMCA3, is primarily involved in calcium homeostasis and interacts with various proteins to perform its functions. It is known to interact with calmodulin, a protein that regulates its activity by binding to ATP2B3 in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the modulation of ATP2B3's calcium transport activity. ATP2B3 also associates with PDZ domain-containing proteins, which influence its localization and function within the plasma membrane, thereby affecting cellular calcium balance.

In the context of ferroptosis, ATP2B3 does not have direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids, but it plays a regulatory role in the P62-KEAP1-NRF2-HO-1 pathway. The inhibition of ATP2B3 affects the expression levels of proteins such as P62, NRF2, KEAP1, and HO-1, which are involved in oxidative stress responses. This regulatory interaction suggests that ATP2B3 modulates the sensitivity of cells to ferroptosis by influencing the expression of these proteins, rather than through direct physical interactions (Guo2023ATP2B3). The study highlights ATP2B3's role in reducing reactive oxygen species production and modulating oxidative stress-related protein expression, which contributes to its neuroprotective effects in the context of ferroptosis (Guo2023ATP2B3).
