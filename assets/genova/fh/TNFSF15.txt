# TNFSF15

## Overview
TNFSF15 is a gene that encodes the protein TNF superfamily member 15, also known as VEGI or TL1A, which is a cytokine involved in the regulation of immune and vascular functions. This protein is primarily expressed in endothelial cells and plays a significant role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by modulating processes such as neovascularization and inflammation. TNF superfamily member 15 is categorized as a cytokine due to its involvement in immune signaling, where it can induce growth arrest or apoptosis in endothelial cells, depending on their cell cycle stage. It interacts with death receptor 3 (DR3) to mediate apoptotic signals and acts as a coactivator for T cells, enhancing their responsiveness and cytokine secretion. The gene's expression and function are implicated in various clinical conditions, including inflammatory bowel diseases and diabetic retinopathy, highlighting its importance in both vascular and immune system regulation (Zhao2024TNFSF15; Zhang2012TNFSF15; Xu2014Death).

## Function
TNFSF15, also known as VEGI or TL1A, is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and modulating immune responses in healthy human cells. It is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells and is involved in regulating neovascularization and inflammation. TNFSF15 can induce growth arrest or apoptosis in endothelial cells, depending on the cell cycle stage, enforcing growth arrest in quiescent cells and inducing apoptosis in proliferating cells. This suggests its role in maintaining a quiescent endothelium and terminating angiogenesis (Zhang2012TNFSF15; Xu2014Death).

TNFSF15 interacts with death receptor 3 (DR3) to mediate apoptotic signals in endothelial cells, which is significant for understanding endothelial cell apoptosis in disease conditions (Xu2014Death). It also acts as a T-cell coactivator, enhancing T cell responsiveness to IL-2 and promoting the secretion of cytokines such as IFN-γ and GM-CSF. This interaction is crucial for T cell activation and expansion during immune responses (Migone2002TL1A; Zhang2012TNFSF15).

In addition to its role in endothelial cells, TNFSF15 influences antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, by stimulating their maturation and activating signaling molecules like NF-κB, STAT3, p38, and JNK (Zhang2012TNFSF15).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TNFSF15 gene are associated with several diseases, primarily due to its role in immune regulation and inflammation. Variants in TNFSF15 have been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFSF15, such as rs6478108 and rs4979462, are associated with increased risk for CD and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), while offering protection against leprosy (Sun2016Finemapping). Reduced expression of TNFSF15 in monocytes and macrophages is associated with increased susceptibility to IBD, suggesting that genetic predisposition to lower TNFSF15 expression contributes to disease risk (Richard2018Reduced).

The TNFSF15 gene is also implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease through its interaction with the DR3 receptor, affecting mucosal immune responses. Genetic variations in TNFSF15 can influence the severity and progression of IBD, with certain haplotypes being associated with increased risk or protection depending on the ethnic background (Valatas2019TL1A). These findings underscore the complex pleiotropic effects and tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms of TNFSF15 in immune-related diseases (Sun2016Finemapping).

## Interactions
TNFSF15, also known as TL1A, is involved in various protein interactions that influence vascular and immune functions. It interacts with death receptor 3 (DR3), encoded by the TNFRSF25 gene, to mediate immune responses and regulate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling. This interaction leads to the dephosphorylation of VEGFR2 through a complex involving the phosphatase SHP-1, which is crucial for controlling vascular permeability (Yang2017TNFSF15).

In the context of diabetic retinopathy, TNFSF15 interacts with gasdermin E (GSDME) to inhibit pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. This interaction is significant in preventing cell death and inflammation in retinal cells under high glucose conditions, suggesting a protective role against diabetic retinopathy progression (Zhao2024TNFSF15).

TNFSF15 also modulates vasculogenesis by regulating the levels of membrane-bound and soluble isoforms of VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1). It down-regulates membrane-bound VEGFR1 and up-regulates soluble VEGFR1, impacting endothelial progenitor cell function and angiogenesis (Qi2013TNFSF15).

These interactions highlight TNFSF15's role in modulating vascular and immune responses through its engagement with specific receptors and signaling pathways.
