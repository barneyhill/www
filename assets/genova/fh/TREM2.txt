# TREM2

## Overview
TREM2, or triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein predominantly found on myeloid cells, such as microglia, macrophages, and osteoclasts. The TREM2 protein plays a crucial role in immune regulation, particularly in processes like phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, and inflammation modulation. It is involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris, contributing to tissue homeostasis and immune response regulation. TREM2's interactions with various ligands, including apolipoprotein E and amyloid-beta oligomers, are significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease. Mutations in the TREM2 gene are linked to increased risks of Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Nasu-Hakola disease, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegeneration (Yeh2017TREM2; Kleinberger2014TREM2; Kober2017TREM2Ligand).

## Structure
TREM2 is a transmembrane receptor protein primarily expressed on myeloid cells. Its primary structure includes a single immunoglobulin-like domain, which is crucial for its function as an immune receptor. The secondary structure of TREM2 features beta-sheets typical of immunoglobulin domains, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of TREM2 is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are essential for maintaining its three-dimensional conformation. In terms of quaternary structure, TREM2 forms a complex with DAP12, a signaling adaptor protein, which is important for its signaling capabilities.

Post-translational modifications of TREM2 include glycosylation, which can affect its stability, localization, and interactions with other molecules. TREM2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms with distinct functions. Notably, a splice variant known as D2-TREM2 lacks exon 2, which encodes the ligand binding domain, yet retains the transmembrane domain. This variant is expressed in both Alzheimer's disease and non-disease brains and localizes similarly to the full-length TREM2 protein (Shaw2021An). Another isoform, referred to as De2, also lacks exon 2 and is abundant in the human brain, potentially affecting TREM2's interactions with ligands (Kiianitsa2020Novel).

## Function
TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) is a receptor protein that plays a significant role in the function and regulation of myeloid cells, including microglia, macrophages, and osteoclasts. In healthy human cells, TREM2 is involved in several critical molecular processes, such as phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, and the regulation of inflammation. It acts as a receptor or co-receptor for myeloid cell survival and maturation, potentially through mechanisms involving β-catenin activation and interactions with M-CSF signals (Kober2017TREM2Ligand).

TREM2 signaling is crucial for the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells, cellular debris, and bacteria, which is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing chronic inflammation (Deczkowska2020The). It is also involved in the maturation of myeloid cells into osteoclasts and dendritic cells, as well as in the regulation of TLR signaling pathways (Kober2017TREM2Ligand). TREM2's role in lipid sensing and metabolism is vital for microglial function, supporting their transition from a homeostatic to a disease-activated state, which is important for neuroprotection (Magno2021TREM2PLCγ2).

In the context of immune responses, TREM2 modulates inflammatory cytokine production and influences the inflammatory environment by interacting with adaptor proteins like LAB and DOK3 to modulate TLR signaling (Kober2017TREM2Ligand). These functions highlight TREM2's importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TREM2 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD). The R47H variant of TREM2 significantly increases the risk of AD, with an effect size comparable to the APOE ε4 allele, conferring a 3-4-fold increased risk (Yeh2017TREM2; Rayaprolu2013TREM2). TREM2 mutations are also linked to frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), with the R47H variant increasing the risk of FTD and PD (Cuyvers2014Investigating; Rayaprolu2013TREM2).

Homozygous mutations in TREM2 cause Nasu-Hakola disease, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone cysts and progressive dementia (Yeh2017TREM2; Kleinberger2014TREM2). These mutations lead to a loss of function, impairing microglial phagocytosis and increasing neuroinflammation, which contributes to neurodegeneration (Shafi2021Role; Kleinberger2014TREM2).

Alterations in TREM2 expression levels are linked to impaired microglial function, affecting the clearance of apoptotic neurons and amyloid plaques, which are critical processes in maintaining neuronal health (Shafi2021Role; Kleinberger2014TREM2). These dysfunctions are implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders (Carmona2018The).

## Interactions
TREM2, a receptor expressed on myeloid cells, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in immune responses and neurodegenerative diseases. TREM2 forms a complex with the adaptor protein DAP12, which is crucial for downstream signaling (Kober2017TREM2Ligand). It binds to apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms, with a preference for apoE4, and this interaction is mediated by a hydrophobic patch on TREM2 that also binds phospholipids (Kober2020Functional). TREM2's interaction with apoE is significant in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, as it affects microglial signaling (Kober2020Functional).

TREM2 also binds to amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers, particularly Aβ42, with high affinity. This interaction can inhibit Aβ polymerization, suggesting a protective role in AD (Kober2020Functional; Lessard2018High‐affinity). The receptor's interaction with Aβ oligomers can block the binding of other ligands, such as lipidated apoE, indicating a complex role in microglial activation and amyloid plaque interaction (Lessard2018High‐affinity).

Additionally, TREM2 interacts with IL-34, a cytokine, through a unique binding site distinct from those used by other ligands (Greven2024Biophysical). These interactions highlight TREM2's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.
