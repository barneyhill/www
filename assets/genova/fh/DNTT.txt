# DNTT

## Overview
The DNTT gene encodes the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a specialized DNA polymerase belonging to the X-family of polymerases. This enzyme is pivotal in the adaptive immune system, where it contributes to the diversity of antigen receptors on B and T lymphocytes through its role in V(D)J recombination. Unlike other DNA polymerases, TdT operates in a template-independent manner, adding nucleotides to the 3'-ends of DNA strands, thereby enhancing the variability of the non-templated nucleotide (N) regions of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene segments (Troshchynsky2015Functional; Motea2010Terminal). Structurally, TdT is characterized by a conserved polymerase beta-like fold and a unique 'lariat-like' loop that prevents interaction with double-stranded DNA, distinguishing it from template-dependent polymerases (Troshchynsky2015Functional). The enzyme is primarily active in primary lymphoid tissues, such as the thymus and bone marrow, during specific stages of lymphocyte development, and its activity is crucial for the generation of a robust and adaptable immune system (Troshchynsky2015Functional).

## Structure
The human DNTT gene encodes the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) protein, which is a member of the X-family of DNA polymerases. TdT is characterized by a catalytic domain with a conserved polymerase beta-like fold, essential for its function in adding nucleotides to DNA ends during V(D)J recombination (Troshchynsky2015Functional). The protein structure includes two functionally independent regions: the BRCT domain at the N-terminus, which is involved in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and the polymerase-like domain at the C-terminus, which serves as the catalytic core (Troshchynsky2015Functional).

The catalytic core is subdivided into four domains: 8 kDa, finger, palm, and thumb domains, forming a three-dimensional right-handed shape. The active site, located in the palm subdomain, contains three highly conserved aspartic acid residues and a divalent cation binding pocket crucial for catalysis (Troshchynsky2015Functional). A unique structural feature of TdT is a 16 amino acid 'lariat-like' loop that prevents interaction with double-stranded DNA, distinguishing it from template-dependent DNA polymerases (Troshchynsky2015Functional).

TdT exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including a short form (TdTS) and two long forms (TdTL1 and TdTL2), with the long isoforms possessing exonuclease activity (Troshchynsky2015Functional).

## Function
The DNTT gene encodes terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a specialized DNA polymerase that plays a crucial role in the adaptive immune system by contributing to the diversity of antigen receptors on B and T lymphocytes. TdT is involved in the V(D)J recombination process, which is essential for generating a diverse repertoire of immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors. This enzyme catalyzes the template-independent addition of nucleotides to the 3'-termini of DNA during the non-homologous end joining phase of V(D)J recombination, enhancing the variability of the non-templated nucleotide (N) region of recombined gene segments (Troshchynsky2015Functional; Motea2010Terminal).

TdT is primarily active in primary lymphoid tissues such as the thymus and bone marrow, where it is expressed during specific stages of B and T cell development. In B cells, TdT is expressed during the pro-B stage when heavy chain genes rearrange, while in T cells, it is active during the rearrangement of both alpha and beta chains (Troshchynsky2015Functional). The enzyme's activity is characterized by a preference for incorporating dGMP and dCMP, contributing to the high G/C content of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor N-regions (Motea2010Terminal). This activity is crucial for the development of a robust and adaptable immune system capable of recognizing a wide array of antigens (Troshchynsky2015Functional).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), encoded by the DNTT gene, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in V(D)J recombination. TdT interacts with Ku proteins, which are part of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. This interaction modulates TdT's catalytic activity, as evidenced by longer nucleotide additions in Ku80 knockout cells compared to wild-type cells (Troshchynsky2015Functional). TdT also interacts with DNA ligase IV and XRCC4, which are involved in the NHEJ pathway, facilitating the repair of DNA double-strand breaks during the recombination process (Troshchynsky2015Functional).

TdT's activity is influenced by its interactions with the Recombination Activating Genes (RAG1 and RAG2), which are essential for initiating V(D)J recombination. These interactions are crucial for the excision of the recombination signal sequence (RSS) region and the formation of coding and signal joints (Troshchynsky2015Functional). The presence of TdT can decrease recombination efficiency, suggesting it may interfere with the initiation of the V(D)J recombination process (Troshchynsky2015Functional). These interactions highlight TdT's role in generating diversity in antigen receptors through its involvement in the recombination machinery.
