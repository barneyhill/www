# WNT3

## Overview
WNT3 is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 3, a secreted glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the Wnt signaling pathway, particularly the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating various developmental processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning (Katoh2017Molecular). The WNT3 protein is characterized by its conserved cysteine residues, which are essential for forming disulfide bonds that stabilize its structure (Mirza2016Discovery). It is involved in critical biological functions, such as maintaining stem cell populations in the intestine and modulating the bone marrow microenvironment (Chiba2004Wnt3; Katoh2017Molecular). Mutations in the WNT3 gene have been associated with congenital disorders like tetra-amelia syndrome and orofacial clefts, highlighting its importance in limb and craniofacial development (Reynolds2019Wnt; Katoh2017Molecular).

## Structure
The WNT3 protein is a member of the Wnt family, characterized by a sequence of amino acids that includes numerous conserved cysteine residues, which are crucial for forming disulfide bonds that stabilize its structure (Mirza2016Discovery). The secondary structure of WNT3 features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, particularly in the finger domain and cysteine knot regions (Mirza2016Discovery). These structural elements are essential for the protein's stability and function.

The tertiary structure of WNT3 is globular, maintained by disulfide bonds, which are critical for its structural integrity. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation, where palmitoleic acid is attached to conserved serine residues, enhancing its maturation and function (Mirza2016Discovery). This modification is vital for the protein's activity and secretion.

In terms of quaternary structure, WNT3 interacts with other proteins, forming complexes necessary for signaling pathways. The protein's domains include the index finger, thumb, and palm-like features, which are involved in its interactions and functional activities (Mirza2016Discovery). These structural characteristics enable WNT3 to play a significant role in developmental processes.

## Function
WNT3 is a member of the Wnt gene family, which encodes secreted glycoproteins involved in various developmental and physiological processes. In healthy human cells, WNT3 plays a crucial role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning. This pathway involves the binding of WNT3 to Frizzled (FZD) and LRP5/6 receptors, leading to the formation of a complex that releases β-catenin from its degradation complex. The accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus activates TCF/LEF target genes, such as AXIN2, cyclin D1, and c-Myc, which are critical for cell cycle regulation and stem cell maintenance (Katoh2017Molecular).

In the adult intestine, WNT3 is secreted by Paneth cells and is vital for maintaining crypt base columnar (CBC) stem cells, supporting their self-renewal and differentiation (Katoh2017Molecular). In the bone marrow, WNT3 is expressed in mesenchymal stem cells and is involved in modulating the microenvironment that supports hematopoiesis, although its specific role in adult hematopoietic tissues is not fully documented (Chiba2004Wnt3; Sercan2010Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WNT3 gene are associated with several congenital conditions. Notably, WNT3 mutations have been linked to tetra-amelia syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by the absence of all four limbs and severe craniofacial defects (Katoh2017Molecular). This condition underscores the critical role of WNT3 in limb and craniofacial development.

WNT3 is also implicated in the development of orofacial clefts, including non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (NSCLP). Variants in WNT3, such as specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been associated with an increased risk of NSCLP in various populations, including Latin American, European, and Chinese groups (Reynolds2019Wnt; Lu2015Variations). However, the association is not consistent across all ethnicities, as seen in the unclear relationship in Caucasian Brazilians (Reynolds2019Wnt).

The WNT3 gene's interaction with other genes, such as COL2A1, which is involved in collagen production, suggests a broader role in craniofacial development and the extracellular matrix during palatogenesis (Reynolds2019Wnt). These interactions highlight the complex genetic and molecular pathways that WNT3 influences, contributing to its clinical significance in developmental disorders.

## Interactions
WNT3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various signaling pathways. In zebrafish brain development, WNT3 interacts with the Frizzled1 (Fzd1) receptor, with the co-receptor Lrp5 being essential for this interaction. The binding affinity between WNT3 and Fzd1 is measured with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 112 ± 15 nM, indicating a strong interaction that is crucial for WNT3's distribution and signaling range (Veerapathiran2020Wnt3).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, WNT3 interacts with the Frizzled-7 (FZD7) receptor, leading to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is specific to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FZD7, and the pathway activation is dependent on FZD7 expression. Knockdown of FZD7 abolishes the activation, highlighting the importance of this interaction in the pathogenesis of HCC (Kim2008Functional).

WNT3 also interacts with the KL1 domain of the Klotho protein, acting as an antagonist. This interaction has been studied using protein-protein docking simulations, which identify specific interaction points that could be targeted for developing peptide inhibitor drugs (Mirza2016Discovery).
