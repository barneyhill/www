# GALNT10

## Overview
GALNT10 is a gene that encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 10, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the initial stages of O-linked glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification process that attaches N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine or threonine residues on proteins. This modification is essential for various biological functions, including protein stability, signaling, and cell-cell interactions (Ten2002All). The enzyme is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the structural integrity and functional diversity of glycoproteins (Chia2016Short). GALNT10 is expressed ubiquitously across human tissues, with particularly high expression in the small intestine, indicating its significant role in maintaining normal tissue architecture and function (Nielsen2022Global; Kato2021Polypeptide).

## Function
GALNT10 encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 10, which plays a crucial role in the initial step of O-linked glycosylation. This process involves the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine or threonine residues on proteins, a modification essential for protein stability, signaling, and cell-cell interactions (Ten2002All). GALNT10 is particularly active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences the glycosylation patterns of proteins, contributing to their structural integrity and function (Chia2016Short).

The enzyme encoded by GALNT10 displays strong activity for glycosylated peptides, indicating its role in follow-up glycosylation, which is the addition of GalNAc to already glycosylated regions (Nielsen2022Global; Kato2021Polypeptide). This specificity suggests that GALNT10 is involved in the hierarchical addition of GalNAc residues, a process that requires the coordinated action of multiple glycosyltransferases (Ten2002All).

In healthy human cells, GALNT10 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels in the small intestine and intermediate levels in other organs such as the stomach and pancreas, indicating its broad role in maintaining normal tissue architecture and differentiation (Nielsen2022Global; Kato2021Polypeptide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GALNT10 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and mental health disorders. In ovarian cancer, GALNT10 expression is upregulated in platinum-resistant cells and is associated with poor prognosis. This upregulation contributes to the cancer's progression by promoting cancer stem cell-like properties, which are linked to chemotherapy resistance. The regulation of GALNT10 in this context involves the BAG3/WDR5 pathway, where BAG3 knockdown leads to decreased GALNT10 expression and reduced cancer stem cell markers, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance (Zhao2021BAG3).

In mental health, GALNT10 has been associated with schizophrenia. Genome-wide association studies have identified a significant link between GALNT10 and schizophrenia, suggesting that alterations in glycosylation patterns mediated by GALNT10 may play a role in the disease's pathogenesis. The exact mechanisms remain unclear, but the gene's involvement in glycosylation processes in the brain is considered significant (Mealer2020Glycobiology; Kato2021Polypeptide).

While GALNT10 is broadly expressed, including in the brain, no specific diseases have been directly linked to mutations in the gene itself, and its deletion in mice does not result in a known phenotype (Mealer2020Glycobiology).
