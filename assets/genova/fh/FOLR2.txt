# FOLR2

## Overview
FOLR2 is a gene that encodes the folate receptor beta (FRβ), a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor involved in the high-affinity binding and transport of folate, a vital nutrient for numerous cellular processes. This receptor is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, including tissue-resident and tumor-associated macrophages, where it plays a significant role in mediating anti-inflammatory responses and cellular uptake of folate, which is crucial for DNA synthesis and repair (Samaniego2020Folate). The expression of FOLR2 is regulated by transcription factors such as PU.1, which are essential for macrophage differentiation and function (Samaniego2020Folate). Alterations in FOLR2 expression have been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may influence tumor growth and serve as a potential therapeutic target (Chen2024microRNA622).

## Structure
FOLR2 encodes the folate receptor beta, a protein involved in the transport of folate. The primary structure of FOLR2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function. The secondary structure of the protein includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and folding. The tertiary structure of FOLR2 results in a three-dimensional conformation that is crucial for its ability to bind folate effectively. This conformation is essential for the protein's role in folate transport.

FOLR2 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability, localization, and function. These modifications are important for the protein's activity and interaction with other molecules. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which allows for variations in its structure and function. These isoforms may have distinct roles in different tissues or under varying physiological conditions. The structural features of FOLR2, including its ability to undergo modifications and exist in multiple isoforms, highlight its complexity and importance in cellular processes related to folate transport.

## Function
The FOLR2 gene encodes the folate receptor beta (FRβ), a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface receptor with a high affinity for binding folic acid (vitamin B9) and its physiologically active form, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This receptor is crucial for the cellular uptake of folate, which is essential for one-carbon transfer reactions involved in DNA and RNA synthesis, epigenetic processes, and cellular proliferation and survival (Samaniego2020Folate). FRβ is primarily expressed in myeloid cells, particularly in tissue-resident macrophages and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), where it is associated with an anti-inflammatory gene set (Samaniego2020Folate).

The expression of FOLR2 is regulated by the transcription factor PU.1, which is essential for myeloid cell differentiation and the expression of macrophage-specific markers like CD163. This regulation is crucial for the anti-inflammatory functions of macrophages, as FOLR2 expression correlates with the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Samaniego2020Folate). FRβ may also play a role in macrophage adhesion to collagen and in the recognition of bacterial microbiota, suggesting a function in maintaining microbiota homeostasis (Samaniego2020Folate).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the FOLR2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. FOLR2 is involved in folate transport, and its expression is linked to the body's response to environmental teratogens. For instance, Folr2 nullizygous mice are highly sensitive to in utero arsenic exposure, leading to congenital malformations such as exencephaly, omphalocele, and craniofacial clefts, especially under conditions of folate deficiency (Taparia2007Importance).

In the context of cancer, FOLR2 has been identified as a target of microRNA-622 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Overexpression of miR-622 downregulates FOLR2, promoting CRC proliferation through cell cycle pathways. This suggests that FOLR2 plays a role in tumor growth and could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in CRC (Chen2024microRNA622).

While FOLR2 mutations have not been directly linked to specific congenital disorders like myelomeningocele (MMC) or nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate, its role in folate metabolism suggests it could be a candidate for further study in these conditions (Hussain2023Mutational; Scapoli2004Study).

## Interactions
The FOLR2 gene encodes the folate receptor β (FRβ), which is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein. While specific physical interactions of FOLR2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, there are some suggested interactions and functional associations. FRβ is hypothesized to interact indirectly with proteins such as the CD11b/CD18 integrin, which modulates macrophage adhesion to collagen, suggesting a role in macrophage function and immune response (Samaniego2020Folate). The structure and recycling behavior of FRβ resemble that of CD14, a known regulator of TLR4 ligand binding and signaling, indicating that FRβ might function similarly as a receptor or co-receptor for bacterial recognition (Samaniego2020Folate).

The expression of FOLR2 is associated with transcription factors such as PU.1 and MAF, which are involved in macrophage differentiation and function, although direct physical interactions with these factors have not been confirmed (Samaniego2020Folate). The gene is co-expressed with other macrophage-specific genes, including CD163, suggesting a potential role in macrophage-related pathways (Samaniego2020Folate). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving FOLR2 remain to be fully elucidated.
