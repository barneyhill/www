# POM121C

## Overview
POM121C is a gene that encodes the protein POM121 transmembrane nucleoporin C, a critical component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). This protein is categorized as a transmembrane nucleoporin, playing a vital role in the transport of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. POM121 transmembrane nucleoporin C is integral to maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope and facilitating nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is essential for cellular function and homeostasis (Funakoshi2007Two). The protein is involved in the assembly of NPCs during interphase, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression (Funakoshi2011Localization). It contains a transmembrane domain that anchors it to the nuclear envelope and interacts with other nucleoporins to form the NPC structure (Funakoshi2007Two). Additionally, POM121C is implicated in the recruitment of nucleoporins to the nuclear envelope, necessary for the proper assembly and function of NPCs (Funakoshi2011Localization). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in cancer biology, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis and may serve as a potential therapeutic target (Yu2024Nuclear).

## Structure
POM121C encodes a protein that is an integral component of the nuclear pore complex, facilitating transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The protein is characterized by a transmembrane domain, which anchors it within the nuclear envelope. It also contains FG-repeat regions, which are crucial for its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, as these regions interact with transport receptors. The presence of coiled-coil domains suggests a role in protein-protein interactions, potentially contributing to the structural integrity of the nuclear pore complex.

Post-translational modifications of POM121C include phosphorylation, which may regulate its function or interactions with other proteins. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may have distinct functional properties. These isoforms could differ in their specific domain compositions or in the presence of certain structural motifs, potentially affecting their roles within the nuclear pore complex. The diversity in isoforms allows for a range of functional adaptations, possibly in response to different cellular conditions or requirements.

## Function
POM121C encodes a protein that is an integral component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is essential for the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the nuclear envelope and facilitating nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is vital for cellular function and homeostasis (Funakoshi2007Two). POM121C is involved in the assembly of NPCs during interphase, a process crucial for the regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression (Funakoshi2011Localization). The protein contains a transmembrane domain that anchors it to the nuclear envelope, and it interacts with other nucleoporins to form the NPC structure (Funakoshi2007Two). POM121C is also implicated in the recruitment of nucleoporins to the nuclear envelope, which is necessary for the proper assembly and function of NPCs (Funakoshi2011Localization). The presence of multiple nuclear localization signals within POM121C is essential for its targeting to the NPCs, highlighting its role in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport and overall cellular function (Funakoshi2011Localization).

## Clinical Significance
POM121C is significantly overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to normal tissues, as evidenced by multiple datasets, including TCGA and OncoDB. This overexpression is associated with worse overall, progression-free, and disease-specific survival, indicating that POM121C serves as a negative prognostic factor in CRC. The gene is particularly enriched in the CMS2 CIN+ subtype of CRC, suggesting its involvement in chromosome segregation during mitosis. Mutations and alternative splicing of POM121C may affect protein function and contribute to CRC progression (Yu2024Nuclear).

In cancer, POM121C is linked to poor prognosis, particularly in gastrointestinal cancers, where it coincides with copy-number gains or gene amplifications. The co-expression of POM121C with PPARγ in CRC suggests a functional interaction that may influence cancer progression. POM121C acts as a posttranslational regulator of PPARγ, potentially affecting its transcriptional regulation and contributing to cancer-related pathways (Yu2024Nuclear).

The overexpression of POM121C in tumors is associated with higher tumor staging and metastasis, highlighting its potential role in cancer biology. These findings suggest that POM121C may be a target for therapeutic strategies in CRC and other cancers (Yu2024Nuclear).

## Interactions
POM121C, a variant of the nucleoporin POM121, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the nuclear pore complex (NPC). It interacts with the transcription factor PPARγ, influencing its subcellular localization and transcriptional activity. This interaction is significant in the context of active RAS signaling, where POM121C inhibits the nuclear accumulation of PPARγ, particularly in KRAS mutant cases (Yu2024Nuclear).

POM121C also participates in interactions with various nucleoporins, which are essential for NPC assembly. It binds to the Nup107-160 complex, a critical component in nuclear pore formation, and this interaction is independent of importin α or β, as shown in studies using Xenopus egg extracts (Rasala2008Capture). The Nup93-205 complex also interacts with POM121C, indicating its role in recruiting nuclear pore components (Rasala2008Capture).

The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of POM121C is crucial for its interactions with import receptors such as importin α/β, which facilitate its import into the inner nuclear membrane (INM) (Yavuz2010NLS‐mediated). These interactions highlight POM121C's role in NPC assembly and its regulatory functions in nuclear transport and transcriptional activity.
