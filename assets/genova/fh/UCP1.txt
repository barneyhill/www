# UCP1

## Overview
UCP1, or uncoupling protein 1, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial carrier protein involved in the regulation of energy balance and thermogenesis. The protein product, also known as UCP1, is a transmembrane protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, primarily expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT). UCP1 plays a pivotal role in non-shivering thermogenesis by dissipating the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, thereby uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis and generating heat instead (Ricquier2011Uncoupling; Chouchani2019New). This process is crucial for maintaining body temperature in cold environments and contributes to energy expenditure and metabolic regulation. The activity of UCP1 is modulated by various factors, including fatty acids and nucleotides, which influence its proton transport capabilities (Ježek2019Uncoupling; Bouillaud2016UCPs). Genetic variations in the UCP1 gene have been linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, highlighting its significance in metabolic health (Flouris2017Role).

## Structure
Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is a mitochondrial carrier protein primarily involved in thermogenesis. It is composed of approximately 306 amino acids, with a molecular mass of around 33 kDa (Ježek2019Uncoupling; Klingenberg1999Structure). UCP1 is characterized by a structure that includes six transmembrane α-helices, forming a channel within the inner mitochondrial membrane (Jacobsen2023ATPBound; Klingenberg1999Structure). These helices are organized into three repeated domains, each containing two transmembrane helices and a short matrix-facing α-helix (Jacobsen2023ATPBound).

The protein binds tightly to three cardiolipin molecules, which are crucial for its stability and function (Crichton2017The; Lee2015Uncoupling). UCP1 also features conserved salt bridge networks that regulate access to its substrate binding site, supporting a domain-based alternating-access mechanism (Crichton2017The). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as sulfenylation, which may play a role in its regulation (Ježek2019Uncoupling). UCP1 functions as a monomer, contrary to earlier assumptions of a dimeric structure (Crichton2017The; Lee2015Uncoupling).

## Function
UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) is a mitochondrial protein primarily found in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and plays a critical role in non-shivering thermogenesis. It facilitates the dissipation of the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, a process that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis, resulting in heat production instead of ATP generation (Ricquier2011Uncoupling; Chouchani2019New). This thermogenic process is crucial for maintaining body temperature in cold environments and is activated by cold exposure, which triggers the release of norepinephrine. This, in turn, stimulates lipolysis and the release of free fatty acids that activate UCP1 (Chouchani2019New).

UCP1's activity is regulated by fatty acids, which can initiate proton leak, and purine nucleotides, which inhibit it by binding to UCP1 and blocking the proton translocation pathway. However, elevated levels of long-chain fatty acids can overcome this inhibition (Chouchani2019New). In humans, UCP1 expression in BAT is linked to increased energy expenditure and cold tolerance, contributing to protection against metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (Busiello2015Mitochondrial). The protein's function is essential for converting stored energy into heat, thereby playing a significant role in energy balance and thermoregulation (Ricquier2011Uncoupling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UCP1 gene are associated with several metabolic disorders, including obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The UCP1 gene, located on chromosome 4, is primarily expressed in brown adipose tissue and plays a crucial role in thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Variants in this gene can disrupt normal brown adipose tissue function, leading to decreased energy expenditure and increased susceptibility to obesity and related metabolic disorders (Flouris2017Role).

Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the UCP1 gene, such as A-3826G, A-1766G, A-112C, and Ala64Thr, have been linked to various cardiometabolic conditions. The A-3826G SNP, for instance, is associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and increased risk of T2DM and lipid metabolism disorders. This polymorphism may disrupt transcription factor binding sites, affecting UCP1 expression and leading to reduced mRNA levels (Pravednikova2020Association; Dinas2022Prevalence).

The A-112C polymorphism affects UCP1 promoter activity and is associated with insulin resistance parameters in T2DM patients. The Ala64Thr variant is linked to higher waist-to-hip ratio and fatness, with varying effects across different ethnic groups (Pravednikova2020Association). These genetic variations highlight the role of UCP1 in metabolic health and its potential impact on disease susceptibility.

## Interactions
UCP1 interacts with various molecules, including fatty acids and nucleotides, which play significant roles in its regulation and function. Fatty acids bind to UCP1 at specific sites, facilitating proton transport across the mitochondrial membrane. This interaction is crucial for the 'fatty acid cycling' hypothesis, where fatty acids participate in repetitive cycles of proton transport (Ježek2019Uncoupling; Bouillaud2016UCPs). 

Nucleotides such as ATP, ADP, GTP, and GDP inhibit UCP1's activity by binding to it, although this inhibition can be modulated by the presence of fatty acids and the membrane potential (Arechaga2001The; Bouillaud2016UCPs). The nucleotide binding site is located on the cytosolic side of UCP1, and binding leads to minor conformational changes that inhibit proton conductance (Arechaga2001The). 

UCP1 also undergoes posttranslational modifications, such as sulfenylation of Cys253, which can affect its activity and sensitivity to nucleotide inhibition (Ježek2019Uncoupling). These interactions and modifications highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing UCP1's role in thermogenesis and mitochondrial function.
