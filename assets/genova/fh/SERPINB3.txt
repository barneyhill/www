# SERPINB3

## Overview
SERPINB3 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family B member 3, which is part of the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors. This protein is primarily involved in inhibiting papain-like cysteine proteases, such as cathepsins L, S, and K, and plays a significant role in regulating proteolytic processes within cells (Biasiolo2023EpitopeSpecific; Pontisso2024SERPINB3). SERPINB3 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis by protecting cells from protease-mediated damage, particularly in epithelial tissues. Beyond its protease inhibitory function, SERPINB3 is implicated in modulating inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, thereby influencing various signaling pathways and cellular responses (Wang2022SERPINB3). The gene is located on chromosome 18 (18q21.3) and can produce multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, which may affect its functional properties (Biasiolo2023EpitopeSpecific). Alterations in SERPINB3 expression and mutations are associated with several diseases, including liver cancers and autoimmune conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Kantaputra2023SERPINB3; Pontisso2024SERPINB3).

## Structure
SERPINB3 is a member of the serpin superfamily, specifically classified under clade B serpins. It is an intracellular protein characterized by an 'ovalbumin-like domain' that includes nine α-helices and three antiparallel β-sheets, along with a hydrophobic C-terminal reactive center loop (RCL) (Biasiolo2023EpitopeSpecific; Pontisso2024SERPINB3). The RCL is crucial for binding and inhibiting target proteases, primarily papain-like cysteine proteases such as cathepsins L, S, and K (Pontisso2024SERPINB3). 

The primary sequence of SERPINB3 consists of 390 amino acids, and it shares a 92% homology with its isoform SERPINB4 at the amino acid level, although the reactive site loop shows less homology, which accounts for their different protease targets (Biasiolo2023EpitopeSpecific). In humans, the gene encoding SERPINB3 is located on chromosome 18 (18q21.3) (Biasiolo2023EpitopeSpecific). 

SERPINB3 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its functional properties (Villano2014Hepatic). The protein forms a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-resistant complex with target proteases through an acyl-oxyester bond to inhibit proteolytic activity (Pontisso2024SERPINB3).

## Function
SERPINB3, a member of the serpin family, functions as a protease inhibitor, playing a crucial role in regulating proteolytic processes within cells. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis. By inhibiting proteases, SERPINB3 protects cells from protease-mediated damage, which is particularly important in epithelial tissues. This protective function is vital for preserving the integrity and function of these tissues.

In addition to its role in protease inhibition, SERPINB3 is involved in the regulation of inflammation. It modulates inflammatory responses, which can influence cell proliferation and apoptosis. These processes are essential for normal cellular function and organismal health, as they ensure that cells grow and die in a controlled manner, preventing abnormal cell growth and tissue damage.

The activity of SERPINB3 in the cytoplasm and nucleus suggests that it may have multiple roles in cell biology, potentially affecting various signaling pathways and cellular responses. Its involvement in these fundamental processes highlights its importance in maintaining the balance between cell survival and death, which is crucial for the overall health and function of the organism.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SERPINB3 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly adult-onset immunodeficiency (AOID) and generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP). In these conditions, specific heterozygous missense variants, such as p.Lys146Asn and p.Asp306Gly, have been identified. These variants are rare in the general population and are predicted to be deleterious, affecting the structural stability of the SERPINB3 protein and potentially accelerating its polymerization. This can lead to altered immune responses and autoantibody production, contributing to the pathogenesis of AOID and GPP (Kantaputra2023SERPINB3).

In the context of liver diseases, SERPINB3 is implicated in chronic liver diseases (CLDs) and primary liver cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. SERPINB3 contributes to cancer progression by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), inhibiting apoptosis, and enhancing immune escape mechanisms. It is also associated with increased expression of oncogenes like Myc and pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, which are crucial for maintaining cancer stem cell characteristics and therapeutic resistance (Martini2024SerpinB34; Pontisso2024SERPINB3).

## Interactions
SERPINB3, a member of the serpin family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRP) such as LRP-1, LRP-5, and LRP-6, which are co-receptors in the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction leads to the activation of Wnt signaling, promoting cell survival and invasiveness, particularly in liver cancer and monocytic cells (Quarta2023SerpinB3).

SERPINB3 also interacts with the receptor LRP-1, which is known to bind serine-proteinase complexes. The protein's structure, including a conserved pentapeptide sequence near its reactive site loop, suggests a tridimensional organization compatible with LRP-1 binding, potentially enhancing its stability and binding capability compared to other serpins like alpha-1 antitrypsin (Quarta2023SerpinB3).

In addition to its role in Wnt signaling, SERPINB3 inhibits cysteine proteases such as cathepsin L and falcipain-2. This inhibition is significant in protecting cells from processes like lysoptosis and radiation-induced cell death, as seen in cervical cancer cells. The interaction with cathepsin L is crucial for SERPINB3's protective role against radiation-induced cell death (Wang2022SERPINB3; Alam2019Inhibition). These interactions highlight SERPINB3's role in modulating apoptosis and contributing to cancer progression.
