# TPST1

## Overview
The TPST1 gene encodes the enzyme tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase 1, which is a member of the sulfotransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through the sulfation of tyrosine residues, a process that is essential for modulating protein-protein interactions, particularly in the extracellular environment. TPST1 is characterized as a type II transmembrane protein with a luminally-oriented catalytic domain, and it functions predominantly in the trans-Golgi network as an integral membrane glycoprotein (Tanaka2017Structural). The enzyme's activity is crucial in various biological processes, including immune responses and hormone activity, and it has been implicated in the regulation of interactions between pathogens and host cells (Byrne2018New; Tanaka2017Structural). TPST1 shares structural and functional similarities with its isoform TPST2, although they exhibit distinct substrate specificities (Tanaka2017Structural). The gene's expression and function have been linked to several clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Westmuckett2008Early; Xu2013Tyrosylprotein).

## Structure
The human tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase 1 (TPST1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the sulfation of tyrosine residues in proteins. TPST1 has a type II transmembrane topology with a luminally-oriented catalytic domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Tanaka2017Structural). The primary structure of TPST1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain, sharing 64% amino acid sequence identity with its isoform TPST2 (Tanaka2017Structural).

The tertiary structure of TPST1 includes a catalytic domain with a single α/β motif, similar to that of TPST2, indicating a conserved structural framework among these enzymes (Tanaka2017Structural). TPST1 forms a homodimer, which is a key aspect of its quaternary structure, and this dimerization is similar to that observed in TPST2, suggesting potential heterodimerization between the two isoforms (Tanaka2017Structural).

The enzyme's active site is characterized by conserved 5′-phosphosulfate-binding (5′-PSB) and 3′-phosphate-binding (3′PB) motifs, which are typical of the sulfotransferase family (Tanaka2017Structural). TPST1 recognizes various substrates through multiple interaction modes, including electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, contributing to its broad substrate specificity (Tanaka2017Structural).

## Function
Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase 1 (TPST1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the post-translational modification of proteins through the sulfation of tyrosine residues. This process is crucial for regulating protein-protein interactions, particularly in the extracellular environment. TPST1 transfers a sulfonate moiety from 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue, forming a tyrosine O-sulfate ester (Byrne2018New; Tanaka2017Structural).

TPST1 is predominantly active in the trans-Golgi network, where it functions as an integral membrane glycoprotein. It shares structural and enzymatic characteristics with its isoform TPST2, although they exhibit slight differences in substrate specificity (Byrne2018New; Tanaka2017Structural). The enzyme's activity is enhanced by divalent cations such as Mg2+ and Mn2+, which facilitate the sulfation process (Byrne2018New).

The sulfation of tyrosine residues by TPST1 is significant in various biological processes, including immune responses and hormone activity. It influences the binding of HIV to the chemokine receptor CCR5 and the activation of complement component C4, highlighting its role in immune function and pathogen interactions (Byrne2018New; Tanaka2017Structural). TPST1's broad substrate specificity allows it to modify multiple tyrosine residues in different proteins, affecting their function and stability (Tanaka2017Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TPST1 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions. In the context of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), TPST1 expression is upregulated by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). This upregulation enhances the tyrosine sulfation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, which is associated with increased metastatic potential of NPC cells. The regulation of TPST1 by LMP1 occurs through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, suggesting a significant role for TPST1 in the progression and metastasis of NPC (Xu2013Tyrosylprotein).

In studies involving mice, deficiencies in TPST1, particularly when combined with TPST2 deficiencies, result in severe developmental and physiological abnormalities. These include early postnatal pulmonary failure and primary hypothyroidism, leading to high mortality rates shortly after birth. The combined deficiency affects normal physiological development, particularly impacting pulmonary function and survival immediately after birth (Westmuckett2008Early).

Despite its potential involvement in various conditions, TPST1 was excluded as a candidate gene for Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) after mutation analysis showed no disease-causing mutations or alterations in its expression in SDS patients (Popovic2002Fine).

## Interactions
TPST1 interacts with various substrates through multiple interaction modes, including electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The enzyme recognizes acidic residues in substrates, such as the gastrin peptide, which form electrostatic interactions with its active site. Hydrophobic interactions also play a role in substrate recognition, allowing TPST1 to accommodate a wide range of protein substrates at multiple positions (Tanaka2017Structural).

TPST1 and its isoform TPST2 share structural similarities, including a similar dimer interface, which supports the possibility of heterodimerization. This structural feature suggests that TPST1 may form complexes with TPST2, potentially influencing its substrate specificity and enzymatic activity (Tanaka2017Structural).

TPST1 is also involved in interactions with various ligands, including sulfated PAPS and PAP, as well as the 3'-phospho-adenosine moiety of Coenzyme A. These interactions indicate the availability of a docking region in the active site for unrelated ligand binding, which may influence TPST1's enzymatic function and its potential as a target for inhibitors (Byrne2018New).

Inhibition studies have shown that compounds like suramin, aurintricarboxylic acid, and rottlerin can inhibit TPST1, suggesting that these interactions may be exploited to develop specific TPST1 inhibitors (Byrne2018New).
