# INSRR

## Overview
The INSRR gene encodes the insulin receptor-related receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is part of the insulin receptor family. Unlike its homologs, the insulin receptor (IR) and the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR), the protein product of INSRR does not bind insulin or insulin-like growth factors. Instead, it functions as an extracellular pH sensor, particularly responsive to alkaline conditions. This receptor is primarily expressed in tissues such as the kidney, pancreas, and stomach, where it plays a role in maintaining acid-base homeostasis (Deyev2013Structural). Structurally, the receptor is characterized by leucine-rich repeat domains, a cysteine-rich domain, and fibronectin type-III repeats, which are crucial for its pH-sensing capabilities (Deyev2015Mapping; Deyev2013Structural). The INSRR gene's unique function and structural features distinguish it from other members of the insulin receptor family, underscoring its specialized role in physiological processes (VÄSTERMARK2013Insulin).

## Structure
The insulin receptor-related receptor (INSRR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that shares structural similarities with the insulin receptor (IR) family. The primary structure of INSRR consists of a polypeptide chain that forms a homodimer linked by disulfide bonds (Deyev2015Mapping). The secondary structure includes leucine-rich repeat domains (L1 and L2), a cysteine-rich C domain, and fibronectin type-III repeats (FnIII-1, FnIII-2, and FnIII-3) (Deyev2013Structural). These domains contribute to the receptor's ability to sense alkaline pH levels, with specific amino acid residues playing crucial roles in this function (Deyev2015Mapping).

The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these domains, which is essential for the receptor's pH sensitivity and activation. The quaternary structure of INSRR is characterized by its dimeric form, which is necessary for its function as a receptor (Deyev2013Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are critical for INSRR activation, particularly in response to alkaline conditions (Deyev2013Structural).

INSRR also exhibits splice variant isoforms, with some variants lacking the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, which may affect its signaling capabilities (VÄSTERMARK2013Insulin). These structural features distinguish INSRR from other members of the insulin receptor family, highlighting its unique role as an extracellular pH sensor.

## Function
The insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR), encoded by the INSRR gene, is a member of the insulin receptor family, which also includes the insulin receptor (IR) and the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR). Unlike its homologs, IRR does not respond to insulin or insulin-like growth factors and lacks a known peptide agonist. Instead, IRR functions as a sensor of alkaline medium, suggesting its role as an extracellular pH sensor. This receptor is primarily located in tissues that interact with extracorporeal fluids of extreme pH, such as the kidney, pancreas, and stomach, indicating its involvement in acid-base homeostasis (Deyev2013Structural).

The activation of IRR by alkaline conditions is a complex process involving multiple structural elements in its N-terminal extracellular region. Key motifs and amino acid residues, such as Leu-135, Gly-188, Arg-244, His-318, and Lys-319, have been identified as crucial for alkali sensing. These residues are located at junctions between secondary structure folds, and their mutation affects IRR activity. In vitro and in vivo studies support the physiological relevance of IRR's alkali-dependent activation, as IRR knock-out mice fail to respond to alkali challenges (Deyev2013Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the INSRR gene can have significant clinical implications. INSRR encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that is structurally similar to the insulin receptor, and its dysregulation may contribute to various diseases. Changes in INSRR expression or mutations can disrupt cellular signaling pathways, potentially leading to metabolic disorders. The gene's involvement in pH sensing and cellular homeostasis suggests that its dysfunction could also impact conditions related to these processes.

Research is ongoing to determine the precise role of INSRR in cancer. Alterations in its normal interactions may influence tumorigenesis, as receptor tyrosine kinases are often implicated in the development and progression of cancer. The potential link between INSRR and cancer highlights the importance of understanding its regulatory mechanisms and interactions within cellular pathways.

Overall, the clinical significance of INSRR is an area of active investigation, with studies focusing on its role in disease pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target. Understanding the impact of INSRR mutations and expression changes is crucial for developing strategies to address the associated health conditions.
