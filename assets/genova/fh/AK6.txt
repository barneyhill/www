# AK6

## Overview
The AK6 gene encodes adenylate kinase 6, a nuclear enzyme that plays a pivotal role in nucleotide metabolism and cellular energetics. As an atypical adenylate kinase, adenylate kinase 6 is involved in the reversible transfer of phosphate groups, crucial for maintaining intracellular nucleotide pools and facilitating energetic communication between the nucleus and mitochondria. Structurally, the protein is characterized by its unique α/β domain and the presence of Walker motifs, which are essential for its enzymatic activity. AK6 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the assembly of Cajal bodies and ribosomal RNA processing, and has been associated with cancer progression and neurodegenerative diseases. Its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids underscore its significance in cellular metabolism and potential as a therapeutic target (Fujisawa2023Regulation; Drakou2011hCINAP; Ren2005The).

## Structure
Adenylate kinase 6 (AK6), also known as hCINAP, is an atypical adenylate kinase with unique structural features. The primary structure of AK6 consists of 172 residues with a molecular mass of 20 kDa (Ren2005The). Its secondary structure includes a single α/β domain with three functional subdomains: the CORE domain, the NMP-binding domain, and the LID domain. The CORE domain features an ATP-binding site with a five-stranded, parallel, open-twisted beta-sheet surrounded by seven alpha-helices (Ren2005The). The NMP-binding domain comprises three alpha-helices and a long loop, while the LID domain is formed by two alpha-helices (Xu2021Unique).

AK6 contains a Walker A motif and an hhh(DE)XH-type Walker B motif, characteristic of NTPases, with key residues such as Asp77 and His79 crucial for its enzymatic activity (Xu2021Unique). The protein is known to form homodimers, which is significant for its function (Drakou2011hCINAP). AK6 is involved in the assembly and disassembly of Cajal bodies in the nucleus, a process influenced by its structural features and enzymatic activity (Drakou2011hCINAP). The protein's structure is further characterized by large regions of negative charges on its surface, due to conserved acidic residues (Ren2005The).

## Function
Adenylate kinase 6 (AK6) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in nucleotide metabolism and cellular energetics. It is primarily localized in the nucleus of cells, including HeLa cells, suggesting its involvement in nuclear nucleotide metabolism and energetic communication between the nucleus and mitochondria through phosphotransfer networks (Ren2005The). AK6 catalyzes the reversible transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to AMP, producing two ADP molecules, which is crucial for maintaining intracellular nucleotide pools and regulating ATP-producing processes (Ren2005The).

The enzyme is characterized by its ability to use various nucleoside triphosphates as phosphate donors, with a preference for CTP and UTP over ATP, indicating a unique phosphoryl transfer reaction compared to other adenylate kinases (Ren2005The). AK6's broad activity with all NTPs and dNTPs suggests its role in maintaining nucleotide balance in cells (Ren2005The). The crystal structure of AK6 reveals a unique interaction between its lid domain and the NMP-binding domain, which may stabilize the enzyme in an open conformation, further highlighting its distinct characteristics among adenylate kinases (Ren2005The).

## Clinical Significance
AK6, also known as coiled-interacting nuclear ATPase protein (CINAP), is implicated in several pathological conditions due to its role in energy and nucleotide metabolism. In cancer, AK6 is highly expressed and correlates with poor prognosis. It is particularly associated with cervical cancer, where its suppression reduces the migratory ability and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells. This suggests that AK6 promotes metastasis and malignant transformation, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Fujisawa2023Regulation). The loss of AK6 in fast-growing human cancer cells inhibits ribosome assembly and abolishes tumorigenesis, highlighting its critical role in cancer cell proliferation (Fujisawa2023Regulation).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, AK6 has been studied in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease. Knockdown of AK6 in glial cells increases adenosine levels, which has been shown to rescue neurodegeneration, suggesting a neuroprotective role of adenosine. This indicates that targeting AK6 could be a potential therapeutic pathway for Parkinson's disease (Sodders2024Genetic). Despite these findings, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in the AK6 gene have not been extensively documented.

## Interactions
AK6, also known as coiled-interacting nuclear ATPase protein (CINAP), is primarily localized in the nucleus and is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with collin, a marker protein of Cajal bodies, which are involved in nuclear splicing. This interaction is significant as the RNAi knockdown of AK6 leads to a slow growth defect due to disrupted RNA splicing in the nucleus (Fujisawa2023Regulation).

In yeast, the homologue of AK6, known as Fap7, interacts with the small subunit ribosomal protein Rps14. This interaction is crucial for assembling a protein-RNA complex essential for the maturation of 18S rRNA, indicating a role in ribosomal RNA processing (Fujisawa2023Regulation).

AK6 is also involved in cancer cell metabolism and metastasis. It positively regulates lactate dehydrogenase A activity in cancer stem cells, which results in increased production of extracellular lactate. This interaction provides a favorable microenvironment for the growth and invasion of colorectal cancer stem cells, promoting metabolic changes that support cancer progression (Fujisawa2023Regulation). These interactions highlight AK6's role in cellular metabolism and its potential impact on cancer biology.
