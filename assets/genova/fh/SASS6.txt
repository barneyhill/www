# SASS6

## Overview
SASS6 is a gene that encodes the SAS-6 centriolar assembly protein, a pivotal component in the process of centriole duplication. The SAS-6 protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in forming the cartwheel structure, which is essential for the assembly and function of centrioles. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates dimerization and the formation of a ninefold symmetrical cartwheel, a critical feature for maintaining the structural integrity and function of centrioles (Gönczy2012Towards; Hilbert2016SAS6). The proper function of SAS-6 is crucial for cell division and chromosome segregation, as it interacts with various proteins to ensure the accurate duplication and organization of centrioles (Yoshiba2019HsSAS6dependent; Lin2013Human). Dysregulation of SASS6 expression is associated with several pathological conditions, including primary autosomal recessive microcephaly and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (SHINMURA2015SASS6; Zhang2019Novel).

## Structure
The SASS6 protein, also known as SAS-6 centriolar assembly protein, plays a critical role in centriole duplication. Its primary structure includes a coiled-coil domain essential for dimerization, which is a key feature for its function in forming the cartwheel structure of centrioles (Banterle2021Kinetic; Hilbert2016SAS6). The secondary structure of SASS6 is characterized by alpha-helices, which contribute to the stability and formation of its coiled-coil domain (Banterle2021Kinetic).

In terms of tertiary structure, SASS6 contains a globular N-terminal head domain, which is crucial for its interactions and assembly into higher-order structures (Hatzopoulos2021Tuning). The quaternary structure of SASS6 involves the formation of a ninefold symmetrical cartwheel-like assembly, which is essential for the architecture of centrioles (Hatzopoulos2021Tuning; Gönczy2012Towards).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may play a role in regulating the function and assembly of SASS6, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context (Fatalska2020Interaction). The protein's ability to form homodimers and oligomers is critical for its function in centriole assembly, highlighting its structural and functional complexity (Gönczy2012Towards; Hilbert2016SAS6).

## Function
The SASS6 gene encodes the SAS-6 protein, which is essential for centriole biogenesis in human cells. SAS-6 is a core component of the cartwheel structure, a critical element in the early stages of centriole assembly. This structure is necessary for maintaining the 9-fold radial symmetry of centrioles, which is crucial for proper cell division and chromosome segregation (Yoshiba2019HsSAS6dependent). SAS-6 self-assembles to form the central hub of the cartwheel, facilitating the recruitment and stabilization of other proteins involved in centriole formation, such as Cep135 and Cep295 (Yoshiba2019HsSAS6dependent; Lin2013Human).

In healthy human cells, SAS-6 interacts with proteins like Plk4 and STIL, which are involved in the early stages of procentriole formation. This interaction is crucial for the proper initiation and regulation of centriole duplication, ensuring that only one procentriole forms per mother centriole (Yoshiba2019HsSAS6dependent). The protein is active in the centrosome, contributing to cellular organization and stability, which impacts organismal development and tissue homeostasis (Yoshiba2019HsSAS6dependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the SASS6 gene are implicated in several diseases, notably primary autosomal recessive microcephaly (MCPH) and various cancers. In the context of MCPH, mutations in SASS6, such as novel splice site mutations, have been identified in affected individuals, leading to disruptions in neurogenesis and resulting in a significantly reduced brain size (Zhang2019Novel). These mutations impair centriole formation, which is crucial for proper cell division, and are associated with defects in centrosome duplication and ciliogenesis (Bergwell2022A; Xu2020Primary).

In cancer, SASS6 overexpression is linked to chromosomal instability and poor prognosis. In colorectal cancer, SASS6 overexpression is associated with centrosome amplification, mitotic abnormalities, and chromosomal numerical changes, contributing to cancer progression and poor survival outcomes (SHINMURA2015SASS6). High SASS6 expression is also observed in other cancers, including kidney renal cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, where it serves as an independent predictor of poor survival (SHINMURA2015SASS6). The overexpression of SASS6 in these cancers suggests its role in promoting chromosomal instability and cancer cell invasion, potentially through cilia-related pathways (Hargreaves2024DysregulatedSASS6expression).

## Interactions
SAS-6 is a crucial protein involved in centriole assembly, primarily through its interactions with other proteins to form the cartwheel structure. It interacts with Ana2, a protein that is essential for centriole assembly. The interaction between SAS-6 and Ana2 is necessary for the formation of the cartwheel structure, a key component of centrioles. Ana2's central coiled-coil domain is important for its recruitment to centrioles, and its interaction with SAS-6 is required for robust localization (Cottee2015The). The phosphorylation of Ana2 is crucial for its interaction with SAS-6, with specific regions in both proteins being critical for their binding (Fatalska2020Interaction).

SAS-6 also interacts with CEP135, another protein essential for centriole duplication. This interaction is significant for the assembly of centrioles and the integrity of mitotic spindles. The interaction domains have been mapped, identifying specific residues in both SAS-6 and CEP135 required for their interaction (Lin2013Human).

SAS-6 forms homodimers through its coiled-coil domains, which can further oligomerize into ring polymers. This self-assembly is influenced by interactions with proteins such as Cep152, Cep63, and Cep57, which are involved in its recruitment to centrioles (Banterle2021Kinetic).
