# MRPS10

## Overview
MRPS10 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S10, a crucial component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (28S). This protein plays a significant role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins essential for cellular respiration and energy production (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). The MRPS10 protein is characterized by its mito-specific N-terminal and C-terminal extensions, which contribute to its structural and functional interactions within the mitochondrial ribosome (Kaushal2014CryoEM). Beyond its primary role in mitochondrial translation, MRPS10 is involved in various cellular signaling pathways, including those related to tumorigenesis and p53 regulation, suggesting its potential extraribosomal functions (Revathi2021Expression). The gene's expression and interaction profiles have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Revathi2021Expression).

## Structure
The MRPS10 protein is a component of the small subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome, specifically the 28S subunit. It is significantly larger than its bacterial homolog, which may facilitate interactions with other mitochondrial components due to the truncation of rRNA in the small subunit (Haque2011Contacts). MRPS10 features a mito-specific N-terminal extension (NTE) and C-terminal extension (CTE), which are oriented on the solvent side of the ribosome. These extensions are positioned to potentially interact with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, such as MRP S24, contributing to the structural organization of the mito-SSU head and potentially playing a role in mRNA interaction (Kaushal2014CryoEM).

The protein's interaction with the mitochondrial translational initiation factor 3 (IF3 mt) has been studied, revealing that MRPS10 cross-links with the N-domain of IF3 mt, indicating its location in contact with the head of the small subunit (Haque2011Contacts). This interaction is significant for understanding the binding site of IF3 mt on the small ribosomal subunit, highlighting the unique structural adaptations of MRPS10 in the mitochondrial ribosome (Haque2011Contacts).

## Function
MRPS10 encodes a protein that is a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (28S), playing a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This protein is involved in the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for mitochondrial function and energy production, impacting cellular respiration and overall cellular metabolism (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). 

MRPS10 is traditionally associated with its role in mitochondrial translation, but recent studies suggest it may have additional functions beyond this primary role. It has been implicated in various cellular signaling pathways, including the nonsense-mediated decay pathway and the p53 pathway, indicating a potential involvement in tumorigenic processes (Revathi2021Expression). MRPS10 has also been shown to interact with proteins such as p53, suggesting a role in p53-related pathways or p53-dependent regulation of mitochondrial translation (Revathi2021Expression).

While the specific function of MRPS10 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its interactions and expression patterns suggest it may play a role in maintaining mitochondrial ribosome stability and possibly other cellular processes through its extraribosomal roles (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
MRPS10 has been implicated in various diseases, primarily through its altered expression and interactions. In cancer, MRPS10 is notably overexpressed in breast cancer and gastric cancer, suggesting a role in tumorigenic processes (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Revathi2021Expression). The overexpression of MRPS10 in breast cancer cell lines has been linked to its involvement in cancer-related pathways, such as the MAP Kinase, Wnt, and estrogen signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Revathi2021Expression). 

MRPS10's interactions with proteins like acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and its regulation by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway suggest its role in fatty acid oxidation, which may contribute to cancer cell metabolism (Revathi2021Expression). Additionally, MRPS10's interaction with p53 indicates a potential involvement in p53-related pathways, which are critical for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Revathi2021Expression).

Beyond cancer, MRPS10 has been identified as a marker for improved response to beta blocker therapy in a canine model of heart failure, indicating its potential role in cardiovascular disorders (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). These findings highlight the significance of MRPS10 in various disease processes through its expression and interaction profiles.

## Interactions
MRPS10, a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit, engages in various protein-protein interactions that suggest its involvement in both mitochondrial and extramitochondrial functions. It has been shown to interact with the mitochondrial translational initiation factor 3 (IF3 mt), specifically cross-linking with the N-domain of IF3 mt, indicating its proximity to the IF3 mt binding site on the 28S subunit (Haque2011Contacts). This interaction suggests a role in the initiation of mitochondrial protein synthesis.

MRPS10 also participates in interactions beyond the mitochondrial ribosome. It has been identified as an interacting partner of C4orf14, a protein involved in the biogenesis of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit, through tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry experiments (He2012Human). This interaction highlights MRPS10's potential role in mitochondrial ribosome assembly and function.

In cancer-related processes, MRPS10 is overexpressed in certain breast cancer cell lines and interacts with proteins such as acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADSB) and TDRKH. These interactions are implicated in pathways like BDNF signaling, which is associated with breast cancer metastasis, suggesting that MRPS10 may influence tumorigenic cellular processes (Revathi2021Expression).
