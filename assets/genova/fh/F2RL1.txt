# F2RL1

## Overview
F2RL1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is activated by serine proteases, such as trypsin, which cleave its extracellular domain to initiate a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways. PAR2 is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including inflammation, immune response, and tissue homeostasis. It plays a significant role in inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, and is implicated in the progression of certain cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The receptor's ability to modulate inflammatory responses and its involvement in tumorigenic processes make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Shrestha2024Association; Grab2009Protease; Qian2020Integrated).

## Structure
F2RL1, also known as protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its complex molecular structure. The primary structure of PAR2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of PAR2 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, essential for its interaction with other molecules and its activation by proteases. 

PAR2 contains specific domains, such as the extracellular N-terminal domain, which is crucial for its activation. This domain is responsible for the receptor's interaction with proteases, leading to its activation and subsequent signaling. Common post-translational modifications of PAR2 include phosphorylation and glycosylation. These modifications play a significant role in regulating the receptor's function and signaling pathways. 

Splice variant isoforms of PAR2 may exist, potentially altering its functional properties. These isoforms can lead to variations in the receptor's activity and its response to different physiological stimuli. The structural complexity of PAR2, along with its modifications and isoforms, underscores its involvement in various physiological processes.

## Function
The F2RL1 gene encodes the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation and immune response. PAR2 is activated by serine proteases such as trypsin, which cleave its extracellular domain, initiating intracellular signaling pathways. These pathways include the PLC/IP3 pathway, which increases intracellular calcium levels, subsequently activating protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (Grab2009Protease). This signaling is crucial for inflammatory responses and has been implicated in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (Grab2009Protease).

In healthy human cells, PAR2 is expressed in various tissues, including airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells, where it plays a role in inflammatory diseases such as asthma. Its activation is associated with allergic sensitization, eosinophilic inflammation, and airway remodeling (Shrestha2024Association). PAR2 is also involved in wound healing processes, where it can promote inflammation and regulate cell migration, potentially inhibiting epithelial cell migration during chronic wound healing (Yakupu2022Singlecell). These functions highlight the gene's role in modulating inflammatory responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
F2RL1, also known as PAR2, is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), F2RL1 is up-regulated and associated with poor overall survival, suggesting its role in tumor progression and as a potential prognostic biomarker (Qian2020Integrated). The gene's expression is linked to tumor growth, and its knockdown can restrict tumor development, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Qian2020Integrated).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), F2RL1 is downregulated, contrasting with its upregulation in many solid tumors, where it contributes to cancer cell migration and proliferation (Maiga2016Transcriptome). This differential expression underscores its complex role in cancer biology.

F2RL1 is also involved in inflammatory responses. Overexpression can exacerbate allergic inflammation and airway hyperreactivity, while its deletion reduces these effects, indicating its role in conditions like asthma (Alberts2011Expression). The gene's expression is regulated by a QTL on chromosome 4, which may influence autoimmune disease traits (Alberts2011Expression). These findings suggest F2RL1's significant impact on both cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
F2RL1, also known as Protease-Activated Receptor-2 (PAR-2), is a G protein-coupled receptor that participates in various protein interactions, primarily through its activation by trypsin-like serine proteases. One of the key interactions involves matriptase, a potent activator of PAR-2 in epithelial and tumor tissues. This interaction leads to the induction of protumorigenic cytokine expression via the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, which is implicated in tumor progression by promoting invasive growth and angiogenesis (Kawaguchi2020Protease‐activated).

In the context of intestinal tumor formation, PAR-2 interacts with components of the NF-κB signaling pathway, enhancing tumorigenicity when overactivated. The deletion of the F2RL1 gene, which encodes PAR-2, has been shown to reduce the number and size of intestinal tumors in specific mouse models. This suggests a physical interaction between PAR-2 and NF-κB signaling components, contributing to tumor progression. The ablation of PAR-2/F2RL1 disrupts the enhanced nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of the NF-κB subunit RelA/p65, a critical step in NF-κB activation (Kawaguchi2020Protease‐activated). These interactions highlight the role of PAR-2 in modulating the tumor microenvironment through NF-κB signaling.
