# MANEA

## Overview
The MANEA gene encodes the enzyme endo-α-1,2-mannosidase, a type II membrane protein that is part of the glycoside hydrolase family 99. This enzyme is primarily located in the cis-Golgi and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, where it plays a crucial role in the N-linked glycosylation process by trimming glucosylated mannose residues from glycan structures. This activity is essential for the maturation and quality control of glycoproteins, facilitating their proper folding and function. The MANEA protein is characterized by a (β/α)8 barrel structure with a unique open active center, which is vital for its enzymatic function. Variations in the MANEA gene have been associated with psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders and cocaine-related behaviors, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Sobala2020Structure; Jensen2014The; Sobala2020Structurea).

## Structure
The human MANEA protein, or endo-α-1,2-mannosidase, is characterized by a single domain (β/α)8 barrel structure with an open active center, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Sobala2020Structure; Sobala2020Structurea). The catalytic domain of MANEA includes key residues Glu404 and Glu407, part of a conserved EWHE motif, which facilitate a neighboring group participation mechanism through an epoxide intermediate (Sobala2020Structure; Sobala2020Structurea). This structure is similar to bacterial GH99 enzymes, sharing 40% sequence identity, but with notable differences such as a flexible loop (residues 191-201) that is absent in bacterial counterparts. This loop is important for substrate specificity, particularly in binding glucose residues in high-mannose N-glycans (Sobala2020Structure; Sobala2020Structurea).

MANEA is a type II membrane protein, consisting of a transmembrane helix, a stem region, and a catalytic domain (Sobala2020Structure). The protein is primarily located in the cis/medial Golgi and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, where it acts on glucosylated mannose residues (Sobala2020Structure). The gene encoding MANEA is located on chromosome 6 and is part of the glycoside hydrolase family 99 (Sobala2020Structure).

## Function
The MANEA gene encodes the enzyme endo-α-1,2-mannosidase, which plays a critical role in the N-linked glycosylation process within human cells. This enzyme is primarily located in the cis-Golgi and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, where it facilitates the maturation of glycoproteins by trimming glucosylated mannose residues from glycan structures. This activity provides an alternative pathway for glycoprotein maturation, bypassing the classical N-glycosylation trimming pathway that involves ER glucosidases I and II (Sobala2020Structure; Sobala2020Structurea).

MANEA's function is essential for protein quality control, trafficking, and function, as it allows glycoproteins that escape the endoplasmic reticulum to rejoin the downstream N-glycan maturation pathway. This process is particularly important under conditions where glucosidase activity is inhibited, accounting for a significant portion of glycoprotein processing (Sobala2020Structure; Sobala2020Structurea). The enzyme's activity is characterized by the removal of specific saccharide units from glycoproteins, facilitating the 'polishing' of N-glycans, which is vital for biological functions such as protein folding, cell adhesion, and cell-cell recognition (Sobala2023Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
The MANEA gene has been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety disorders and cocaine-related behaviors. Variations in the MANEA gene, such as the rs1133503 polymorphism, have been associated with an increased risk of anxiety disorders, including panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. Individuals carrying certain alleles of this polymorphism exhibit differences in MANEA mRNA expression levels, which may contribute to the development of these conditions (Jensen2014The).

In addition to anxiety disorders, MANEA variants have been linked to cocaine-induced paranoia (CIP) and cocaine dependence (CD). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MANEA gene, such as rs9387522, have shown significant associations with CIP, suggesting that MANEA may play a role in the genetic susceptibility to cocaine-related behaviors (Farrer2009Association).

The potential influence of MANEA on psychiatric conditions may be related to its role in glycoprotein processing, as other mannosidase genes have been associated with cognitive impairments and psychiatric manifestations. However, the exact mechanisms by which MANEA variants contribute to these disorders remain to be fully elucidated (Jensen2014The).
