# DENND6B

## Overview
DENND6B is a gene that encodes the protein DENN domain containing 6B, which is characterized by the presence of a DENN domain. This domain classifies the protein as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases, a group of proteins that are integral to the regulation of membrane trafficking processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis (Marat2011DENN; Ishida2016Multiple). The DENN domain's conserved structure facilitates the activation of Rab proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP, a critical step in Rab-mediated pathways (Cherfils2013Regulation). While the specific roles of DENND6B in normal cellular function are not fully characterized, it is hypothesized to be involved in pathways related to Rab14, which is essential for cell migration (Ishida2016Multiple). The gene has been implicated in various diseases, including multiple sclerosis and cancer, highlighting its potential significance in both physiological and pathological contexts.

## Function
DENND6B is a gene encoding a protein that contains a DENN domain, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases. These proteins are pivotal in regulating membrane trafficking processes, such as endocytosis and exocytosis, by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab proteins, thereby activating them (Marat2011DENN; Ishida2016Multiple). The DENN domain is a conserved protein module that interacts with Rab GTPases, playing a crucial role in Rab-mediated membrane trafficking pathways (Marat2011DENN).

Although the specific function of DENND6B in healthy human cells remains uncharacterized, it is suggested that DENND6B, as part of the DENND6 family, may be involved in processes related to Rab14, which regulates a recycling pathway necessary for cell migration (Ishida2016Multiple). The DENN domain's unique structural characteristics allow it to interact with Rab proteins, leaving GDP and GTP binding sites available, which is essential for the activation of a range of mostly endocytic Rab proteins (Cherfils2013Regulation). The precise cellular and organismal outcomes of DENND6B's activity are yet to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
DENND6B has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In multiple sclerosis (MS), DENND6B is identified as a significant risk gene regulated by vitamin D-induced super-enhancers, suggesting a role in neuroinflammatory processes relevant to MS (Lu2019The). The gene's high expression in the brain and its interaction with Rab GTPases, which are involved in vesicle trafficking and cytokine production, further support its involvement in MS (Lu2019The).

In glioblastoma, DENND6B was found to have a splicing variant in a non-responsive tumor sample, indicating a potential role in treatment resistance, although the clinical significance remains unclear (Morelli2022Metabolicimaging). In lung cancer, DENND6B mutations have been identified as clonal neoantigens, which may contribute to the immune response in patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy (Wu2020Identification).

DENND6B is also noted as a shared genetic risk factor between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis, suggesting overlapping genetic influences in these conditions (Li2021Genomewide). Additionally, alterations in DENND6B expression have been observed in Shank3B knock-out mice, although the specific implications for human disease are not fully understood (Jin2021The).
