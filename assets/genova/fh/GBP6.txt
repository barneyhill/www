# GBP6

## Overview
GBP6, or guanylate-binding protein 6, is a gene that encodes a member of the guanylate-binding protein family, which are large GTPases. These proteins are primarily involved in cell autonomous immunity, playing crucial roles in antiviral defense, inflammation, and cellular signaling. GBP6 is particularly noted for its ability to hydrolyze GTP to GDP and GMP, facilitating various cellular functions such as vesicle trafficking and pathogen defense. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and associates with cellular membranes, indicating its involvement in intracellular processes and signaling pathways. In pathological contexts, such as cancer, GBP6 expression is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues, particularly in oral squamous cell carcinoma, where it is associated with poor cell differentiation and metastasis, highlighting its potential role in maintaining normal cellular differentiation and inhibiting metastasis (Liu2019Guanylate-binding).

## Function
Guanylate-binding protein 6 (GBP6) is a member of the guanylate-binding protein family, which are large GTPases primarily involved in cell autonomous immunity against pathogens. These proteins are typically induced by interferons and play significant roles in antiviral defense, inflammation, and cellular signaling. GBP6 is involved in the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and GMP, a process that contributes to various cellular functions such as vesicle trafficking and pathogen defense. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is associated with cellular membranes, indicating its involvement in intracellular processes and signaling pathways (Liu2019Guanylate-binding).

In the context of cancer, GBP6 expression is notably downregulated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues in oral squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in tongue squamous cell carcinoma. This downregulation is linked to poor cell differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and poor disease-specific survival, suggesting that GBP6 may have a role in maintaining normal cellular differentiation and inhibiting metastasis in healthy cells (Liu2019Guanylate-binding). However, specific details about its function in healthy human cells remain less explored in the available literature.
