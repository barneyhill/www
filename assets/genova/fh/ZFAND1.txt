# ZFAND1

## Overview
ZFAND1 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger AN1-type containing 1 protein, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. The zinc finger AN1-type containing 1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription and protein degradation pathways. It plays a role in modulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell. The protein's function is significant in cellular stress responses and may have implications in various diseases, although the full extent of its clinical significance is still under investigation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
