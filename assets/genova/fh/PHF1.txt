# PHF1

## Overview
PHF1 (PHD finger protein 1) is a gene that encodes a chromatin-associated protein involved in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling. The protein, also named PHF1, is characterized by the presence of a Tudor domain and two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, which facilitate its role as a methyl-lysine reader and its interaction with histone marks. As a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), PHF1 plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression by enhancing the enzymatic activity of the complex, particularly in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27). This activity is essential for the silencing of developmental genes and maintaining genomic stability. Additionally, PHF1 is involved in the DNA damage response, where it interacts with key proteins to promote DNA repair processes. Clinically, PHF1 is implicated in various cancers, including endometrial stromal sarcoma and ossifying fibromyxoid tumors, often through chromosomal translocations and gene fusions that disrupt normal chromatin function (Cao2008Role; Hong2008A; Micci2006Consistent).

## Structure
PHF1 (PHD finger protein 1) is a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is composed of 456 amino acids and contains several distinct domains, including an N-terminal domain (NTD), a Tudor domain, and two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers (Gibson2017PHF1). The Tudor domain, located between amino acids 28 and 87, specifically recognizes trimethylated lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me3) and is characterized by a five-stranded β-barrel fold with an aromatic cage formed by residues W41, Y47, F65, and F71 (Dong2020Structural; Engelberg2021Discovery). This domain plays a crucial role in binding to histone marks and enhancing nucleosome accessibility (Musselman2013Binding).

The NTD, although largely disordered when isolated, becomes more structured when linked to the Tudor domain, increasing the beta strand content (Gibson2017PHF1). The PHD fingers, located between amino acids 87-140 and 189-240, may facilitate interactions with EZH2, a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (Gibson2017PHF1). The PHF1 protein can form homodimers, as observed in crystallization studies (Dong2020Structural). These structural features enable PHF1 to participate in chromatin interactions and the recruitment of PRC2 to specific genomic sites (Dong2020Structural).

## Function
PHF1 (PHD finger protein 1) is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and plays a significant role in gene expression regulation through histone H3K27 methylation and Hox gene silencing. It enhances the enzymatic activity of the EED-EZH2 complex, a key player in maintaining the silent state of developmental regulators (Cao2008Role). PHF1 is involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It is recruited to DSB sites, where it interacts with Ku70/Ku80, promoting non-homologous end-joining processes (Hong2008A; Yang2013Polycomb).

PHF1 also acts as a novel activator of the p53 signaling pathway. It interacts directly with p53, protecting it from MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, thereby stabilizing p53. This stabilization promotes p53-dependent cell growth arrest and apoptosis, especially in response to DNA damage (Yang2013Polycomb). PHF1 enhances the transcriptional activity of p53, increasing the promoter activity of p53 target genes such as p21 and Bax, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Yang2013Polycomb). PHF1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional processes and contributes to genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
PHF1 (PHD finger protein 1) is implicated in several cancers due to chromosomal translocations and gene fusions. In endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS), PHF1 is frequently rearranged, particularly at chromosomal band 6p21, resulting in fusion genes such as JAZF1-PHF1, EPC1-PHF1, and MEAF6-PHF1. These fusions are significant in the pathogenesis of ESS, suggesting that PHF1 plays a role in a new pathogenetic subgroup of this cancer (Han2020A; Micci2006Consistent; Panagopoulos2012Novel).

In ossifying fibromyxoid tumors (OFMTs), PHF1 rearrangements are a common feature, with EP400 being a frequent fusion partner. These rearrangements are present in a significant proportion of OFMTs, regardless of their classification as benign, atypical, or malignant, indicating a role in tumor development (Antonescu2013Novel; GebreMedhin2012Recurrent).

PHF1 is also involved in chromosomal rearrangements in other mesenchymal tumors, such as endometrial stromal sarcoma and mesenchymal tumors, where it forms fusions with genes like JAZF1 and MEAF6. These rearrangements suggest a potential role in tumorigenesis through the disruption of normal chromatin remodeling and gene regulation (Antonescu2013Novel; Vizán2014Role).

## Interactions
PHF1 (PHD finger protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling. PHF1 physically associates with the Ku70/Ku80 complex, which is essential for its recruitment to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and its involvement in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway (Hong2008A). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed this interaction, highlighting its role in genomic maintenance (Hong2008A).

PHF1 also interacts with other proteins involved in DNA damage response, such as Rad50, SMC1, DHX9, and p53, indicating its broader role in maintaining genomic integrity (Hong2008A). In the context of chromatin remodeling, PHF1 is part of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and interacts with components like EZH2 and SUZ12. This interaction is facilitated through phase separation, where PHF1 forms condensates that recruit PRC2 to target loci, promoting transcriptional repression (Lu2022PHF1).

PHF1's Tudor domain specifically binds to histone variants, such as H3K36me3, which is crucial for its function as a methyl-lysine reader and its role in gene regulation (Dong2020Structural; Engelberg2021Discovery).
