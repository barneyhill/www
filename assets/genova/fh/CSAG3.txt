# CSAG3

## Overview
The CSAG3 gene encodes the protein CSAG family member 3, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen family. This protein is predominantly expressed in various cancer tissues and testis, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and potential utility as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and therapy (Qiu2020aarFDC). While the precise biological function of CSAG family member 3 remains to be fully elucidated, its restricted expression pattern makes it a candidate for targeted cancer immunotherapy (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms by which CSAG3 contributes to cancer development and progression.
