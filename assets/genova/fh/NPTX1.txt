# NPTX1

## Overview
The NPTX1 gene encodes neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), a secreted glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and plasticity. As a member of the pentraxin protein family, NP1 is characterized by its pentameric structure and is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and amygdala. NP1 is involved in synaptogenesis, synaptic homeostasis, and synapse elimination, functioning as a synaptic organizer in the synaptic cleft. It interacts with other proteins to modulate synaptic activity and plasticity, including forming complexes with NPTX2 and NPXR to stabilize AMPA receptors. Beyond its neurological roles, NP1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and certain cancers, where it influences processes such as apoptosis and metastasis (NPTX1; Wu2022NPTX1; Gómez2021Neuronal; p&gt; Yan2019&lt).

## Structure
Neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), encoded by the NPTX1 gene, is a 47 kDa secreted glycoprotein composed of 432 amino acids. The primary structure includes a signal peptide (1-22 amino acids), two low complexity regions (98-108 and 129-140 amino acids), and a C-terminal pentraxin domain (222-428 amino acids) (Gómez2021Neuronal). The protein features two N-glycosylation sites at Asn154 and Asn193, and several cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, facilitating both homomeric and heteromeric assembly with NPTX2 (Gómez2021Neuronal).

The secondary structure of NP1 is characterized by a two-layered β-sheet with a flattened jellyroll topology, similar to other pentraxins like C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P component (SAP) (Gómez2021Neuronal). The tertiary structure forms a cyclic pentameric assembly, typical of the pentraxin family. The quaternary structure involves oligomerization, which is crucial for its function in synaptic plasticity and receptor clustering (Gómez2021Neuronal).

A novel isoform, NP1-38, has been identified, particularly in the context of Sandhoff disease. This isoform is a truncated form of NP1, maintaining the same glycosylation sites, and is implicated in disease progression (Hooper2016Neuronal).

## Function
Neuronal pentraxin 1 (NPTX1) is a protein encoded by the NPTX1 gene, primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and amygdala (Gómez2021Neuronal). It is a synaptic organizer located in the synaptic cleft and plays a significant role in synaptic function and plasticity. NPTX1 is constitutively released from excitatory synapses and is involved in synaptogenesis, homeostasis, and synapse elimination (Gómez2021Neuronal). 

In healthy cells, NPTX1 is involved in maintaining synaptic stability and function. It negatively regulates excitatory synapse density through interaction with a subunit of the Kv7 potassium channel and is enriched in the synaptic plasma membrane and mitochondria (Gómez2021Neuronal). NPTX1 can form heterocomplexes with NPTX2 in the synaptic cleft, which bind to NPXR in the post-synaptic membrane, stabilizing AMPAR and modulating excitatory drive onto parvalbumin interneurons (Gómez2021Neuronal). 

NPTX1 is also involved in synaptic pruning and modulation of synaptic activity, suggesting its role in synaptic plasticity (Gómez2021Neuronal). Its release and activity are modulated by neuronal activity and astrocytic signals, such as astrocyte-secreted glypican-4 (GPC4), which can induce NPTX1 release from pre-synaptic terminals (Gómez2021Neuronal).

## Clinical Significance
Neuronal pentraxin 1 (NPTX1) is implicated in several neurological disorders due to its role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal communication. Alterations in NPTX1 expression have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), where it is overexpressed in dystrophic neurites and associated with amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposits. This overexpression contributes to synapse loss, neurite damage, and neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that NPTX1 plays a significant role in the neurodegenerative processes characteristic of AD (Abad2006Neuronal).

In the context of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury, particularly in neonates, NPTX1 is identified as a mediator of neuronal damage. Its expression is upregulated following HI events, leading to excitotoxicity and neuronal death through interactions with glutamate receptors. Genetic deletion of NPTX1 in animal models has shown neuroprotective effects, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for HI brain injury (Hossain2004Neuronal; Thatipamula2015Genetic).

NPTX1 is also involved in neurodegeneration associated with Sandhoff disease and amyloid-beta-induced neuronal loss, where its expression is regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity. This suggests that NPTX1 may be a critical factor in various neurodegenerative pathways (Qu2018Proteomic).

## Interactions
Neuronal pentraxin 1 (NPTX1) is involved in several protein interactions that play critical roles in both neuronal and cancer cell processes. In neurons, NPTX1 interacts with pro-apoptotic proteins Bad and Bax, facilitating their mitochondrial translocation, which is essential for cytochrome c release and apoptosis under hypoxic-ischemic conditions. This interaction is enhanced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and is regulated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (Al2013Critical).

NPTX1 also forms complexes with NPTX2 and NPXR in the synaptic cleft, which stabilize AMPA receptors in the post-synaptic membrane, modulating synaptic activity and plasticity (Gómez2021Neuronal). In the context of cancer, NPTX1 interacts with integrins, particularly integrin α1 and α7, promoting metastasis in gastric cancer through the integrin/FAK signaling pathway (NPTX1; p&gt; Yan2019&lt).

In pancreatic cancer, NPTX1 interacts with RNA-binding protein 10 (RBM10), inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and migration, and enhancing chemotherapy sensitivity (Wu2022NPTX1). These interactions highlight NPTX1's diverse roles in cellular processes across different biological contexts.
