# HTRA1

## Overview
HTRA1 is a gene that encodes the HtrA serine peptidase 1, a serine protease that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including protein quality control and cellular stress response. The protein is a member of the HtrA serine protease family and is characterized by a conserved protease domain and a PDZ domain, which are crucial for its function in substrate recognition and protease activity regulation (MURWANTOKO2004Binding; Cabrera2017HtrA1). HtrA serine peptidase 1 is ubiquitously expressed and functions in diverse cellular locations, such as the extracellular matrix, microtubules, and the nucleus, where it is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis by degrading misfolded or fragmented proteins (Schillinger2018HTRA1Dependent). The protein also plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and neurodegeneration, and is implicated in matrix remodeling through the proteolysis of extracellular matrix proteins (Clausen2011HTRA). Mutations in the HTRA1 gene are associated with hereditary cerebral small vessel diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in vascular pathologies (Chen2022Identified; Li2023Exploring).

## Structure
The HTRA1 protein is a member of the human HtrA serine protease family, characterized by a highly conserved protease domain and a PDZ domain. The primary structure of HTRA1 includes an extracellular export signal, a Mac25/IGFBP domain, a Kazal-like structure, a serine protease module, and a single C-terminal PDZ binding motif (Friedrich2015Synonymous). The secondary structure involves the formation of a small helix in the LD loop during activation, which is crucial for inter-monomer communication and protease activity (Cabrera2017HtrA1).

The tertiary structure of HTRA1 is defined by its trimeric form, which is essential for its function. Each monomer consists of four distinct domains: a trypsin-like catalytic domain, a C-terminal PDZ domain, an IGFBP-like domain, and a Kazal-like domain (Cabrera2017HtrA1). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of these monomers into a trimer, which is the most abundant form in solution (Cabrera2017HtrA1).

The PDZ domain plays a significant role in substrate recognition and enhances protease activity upon ligand binding. It is involved in the regulation of protease activity by binding to specific motifs at the C-terminus of target proteins (MURWANTOKO2004Binding). The PDZ domain is also implicated in the inhibition of TGF-β signaling, which is dependent on the protease activity of HTRA1 (MURWANTOKO2004Binding).

## Function
HTRA1 (HtrA serine peptidase 1) is a serine protease involved in various cellular processes, primarily in protein quality control and cellular stress response. It is ubiquitously expressed and functions in multiple cellular locations, including the extracellular matrix, microtubules, and the nucleus (Schillinger2018HTRA1Dependent). HTRA1 plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis by degrading misfolded, mislocalized, or fragmented proteins (Schillinger2018HTRA1Dependent).

In healthy human cells, HTRA1 is involved in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and neurodegeneration. It cleaves IGFBP5, releasing IGF1 to stimulate proliferation, and inactivates TGFβ, which is involved in neuronal maturation and developmental survival (Clausen2011HTRA). HTRA1 also interacts with microtubules, modulating their stability and affecting cell motility. It associates with centrosomes and newly polymerized microtubules, promoting microtubule assembly and inhibiting cell migration (Chien2009Serine).

HTRA1 is implicated in matrix remodeling by proteolysing extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin, which leads to the activation of matrix metalloproteases (Clausen2011HTRA). This remodeling is essential for cell migration and maintaining cellular homeostasis. HTRA1's role in these processes highlights its importance in normal cell function and its potential impact on disease prevention.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HTRA1 gene are associated with several hereditary cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVDs). One such condition is cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), which is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in HTRA1. CARASIL is characterized by recurrent strokes, early-onset cognitive decline, alopecia, and spondylosis (Chen2022Identified). 

HTRA1 mutations are also linked to an autosomal dominant form of cerebral small vessel disease, often referred to as CADASIL2. This condition is associated with heterozygous mutations in the HTRA1 gene, leading to symptoms such as stroke, cognitive decline, and gait disorders. The mutations often occur in exon 4, affecting the L3/LD loops and the linker region, which are crucial for enzyme activity (Verdura2015HeterozygousHTRA1mutations; Li2023Exploring). 

The pathogenic mechanisms include haploinsufficiency and dominant-negative effects, where mutant alleles interfere with wild-type alleles, disrupting normal enzymatic functions (Li2023Exploring). These mutations can lead to dysfunction in the TGF-β signaling pathway, contributing to vascular changes and disease pathology (Li2023Exploring).

## Interactions
HTRA1, a serine protease, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly through its PDZ domain. It interacts with microtubules and tubulins, acting as a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) that modulates microtubule stability and cell motility. HTRA1 associates with α-, β-, and γ-tubulins, and its interaction is crucial for microtubule dynamics, as demonstrated by its ability to promote microtubule assembly and co-sediment with microtubules (Chien2009Serine). The PDZ domain of HTRA1 is essential for these interactions, as it facilitates binding to tubulins and other proteins, such as collagens, through specific C-terminal sequences (MURWANTOKO2004Binding).

HTRA1 also interacts with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as α, β, and γ tubulins, SEPT2, PSME1, MAD1, and APC3, as confirmed by mass spectrometry and Western blots (Schillinger2018HTRA1Dependent). The protein MAP7D1, associated with microtubule cytoskeleton organization, has been identified as a potential novel substrate of HTRA1, indicating its role in cytoskeletal organization (Schillinger2018HTRA1Dependent). These interactions highlight HTRA1's involvement in regulating microtubule dynamics and cell motility, with implications for cancer cell migration and tumor suppression (Chien2009Serine).
