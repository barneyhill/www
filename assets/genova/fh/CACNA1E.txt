# CACNA1E

## Overview
The CACNA1E gene encodes the alpha-1E subunit of the CaV2.3 voltage-gated calcium channel, a critical component in the regulation of calcium ion transport across cell membranes. This gene is part of the R-type calcium channel family, which plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and muscle contraction. The protein product, the CaV2.3 channel, is a transmembrane protein that contributes to the modulation of synaptic plasticity and insulin secretion, among other functions. It is involved in complex interactions with auxiliary subunits and other proteins, influencing its gating mechanisms and pharmacological properties. Mutations in CACNA1E have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and migraine, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Gao2023Molecular; Ambrosini2017Possible; RoyerBertrand2021De).

## Structure
The CACNA1E gene encodes the α1E subunit of the CaV2.3 voltage-gated calcium channel, which is crucial for calcium ion transport across cell membranes. The primary structure of the α1E subunit consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a pseudo-tetrameric pore-forming subunit divided into four homologous domains (DI to DIV), each containing six transmembrane helices (S1-S6) (Gao2023Molecular; Helbig2018De). These helices form the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and the pore domain, with the selectivity filter located between the S5 and S6 helices (Gao2023Molecular).

The secondary structure includes the S4 helix, which is positively charged and moves in response to changes in membrane potential, playing a crucial role in channel gating (Gao2023Molecular). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these domains, allowing for the formation of the channel's pore and voltage-sensing regions. The quaternary structure of the CaV2.3 channel includes its assembly with auxiliary subunits α2δ1 and β1, which are essential for its function (Gao2023Molecular).

The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in various splice variants that may affect its function and regulation (Bhuiyan2022Cataloging). These structural features and modifications are critical for the channel's role in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission.

## Function
The CACNA1E gene encodes the CaV2.3 calcium channel, a subtype of R-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which plays a significant role in various physiological processes. In pancreatic β-cells, CaV2.3 channels are crucial for the second phase of insulin secretion. They facilitate the mobilization and priming of insulin granules, ensuring a sustained release of insulin in response to glucose stimulation (Holmkvist2007Polymorphisms; Jing2005CaV2.3). This function is vital for maintaining glucose homeostasis, as evidenced by impaired glucose tolerance and altered insulin release in CaV2.3-deficient mice (Jing2005CaV2.3).

In the nervous system, CaV2.3 channels are involved in synaptic plasticity, particularly in the mossy fibre-CA3 synapse, where they contribute to long-term potentiation (LTP) and post-tetanic potentiation. These channels do not participate in neurotransmitter release during single action potentials but are active during high-frequency stimulation, highlighting their role in modulating synaptic strength (Striessnig2008Exploring).

CaV2.3 channels are also expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle, where they contribute to stimulus-secretion coupling and muscle contraction (Striessnig2008Exploring). Their activity is modulated by Zn2+ ions, which can influence channel gating and, consequently, cellular excitability and signaling (Neumaier2020Cav2.3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CACNA1E gene, which encodes the α1E subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav2.3, have been implicated in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include intellectual disability, developmental regression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), often without the presence of epilepsy (RoyerBertrand2021De). The study by Royer-Bertrand et al. identified de novo pathogenic variants in CACNA1E in individuals exhibiting global developmental delay, speech and language delays, and social cognition deficits, but notably without seizures, except for one case of epileptic spasms (RoyerBertrand2021De). The variability in clinical outcomes, even among patients with identical mutations, suggests the influence of other factors such as modifier genes or environmental influences (RoyerBertrand2021De).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, the CACNA1E gene has been associated with migraine, particularly in patients with complex neurological auras. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), Asp859Glu, in exon 20 of the gene has been found to be overrepresented in such patients, suggesting a potential role in migraine pathophysiology (Ambrosini2017Possible). The involvement of CACNA1E in migraine is thought to be related to its role in calcium channel functioning, which is crucial for neuronal signaling (Ambrosini2017Possible).

## Interactions
The CACNA1E gene encodes the alpha-1E subunit of the R-type voltage-gated calcium channel, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function. This subunit forms part of the CaV2.3 channel complex, which includes auxiliary subunits such as α2δ1 (CACNA2D1) and β1 (CACB1). These subunits are essential for the proper assembly and function of the channel, influencing its gating mechanisms and pharmacological properties (Gao2023Molecular).

The CaV2.3 channel, encoded by CACNA1E, is involved in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release, interacting with proteins that regulate these processes. It plays a role in the CREB signaling pathway, which is important for axon outgrowth and regeneration, and is influenced by gut microbiota, potentially affecting neurogenesis and depression-like behaviors (Huang2019Proteomic).

CACNA1E also participates in electrostatic interactions within the channel complex, particularly between specific residues in the S6 II helix and the AID helix, which are critical for open-state inactivation (OSI) of the channel. These interactions are conserved among P/Q-, N-, and R-type channels, highlighting their importance in channel regulation (Gao2023Molecular).
