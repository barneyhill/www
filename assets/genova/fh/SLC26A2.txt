# SLC26A2

## Overview
The SLC26A2 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 26 member 2, a transmembrane sulfate transporter crucial for cartilage development and skeletal integrity. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 26 and functions primarily as a sulfate/chloride exchanger, facilitating the uptake of sulfate ions necessary for the synthesis of sulfated proteoglycans in cartilage (Rossi2001Mutations; Maeda2006A). The structural integrity of the SLC26A2 protein is maintained through its domain-swapped homodimer configuration, which includes a transmembrane domain and a cytosolic STAS domain, essential for its transport function (Hu2024Substrate). Mutations in the SLC26A2 gene are linked to various skeletal dysplasias, highlighting its critical role in normal skeletal development and cartilage metabolism (Kausar2019Recessive; Silveira2022SLC26A2DTDST).

## Structure
The SLC26A2 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 26 and functions as a sulfate transporter. It is a domain-swapped homodimer, with each protomer divided into three regions: the N-terminal region, the transmembrane domain (TMD), and the C-terminal cytosolic sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist domain (STAS) (Hu2024Substrate). The TMD consists of 14 transmembrane helices organized into two sub-domains: the core domain and the gate domain, facilitating substrate transport through an elevator-like movement (Hu2024Substrate). The dimerization of SLC26A2 is primarily mediated by the cytosolic region, with strong hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the STAS domains of each protomer (Hu2024Substrate).

The protein follows the 'alternating access' model, transitioning between inward-facing, occluded, and outward-facing conformations (Hu2024Substrate). The N-terminal region, particularly residues 53-61, plays a crucial role in dimeric assembly and contributes to the stability of the protein (Hu2024Substrate). Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation, which affects protein stability and trafficking efficiency, with non-glycosylated versions showing reduced expression levels (Rapp2019Role).

## Function
The SLC26A2 gene encodes a sulfate/chloride exchanger protein that plays a crucial role in sulfate transport, essential for the synthesis of sulfated proteoglycans in cartilage. This process is vital for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cartilage, as proteoglycans are key components of the extracellular matrix (Rossi2001Mutations; Maeda2006A). The protein is highly expressed in the apical membrane of chondrocytes, where it facilitates the uptake of sulfate ions necessary for the sulfation of proteoglycans, a critical process for normal skeletal development (Mount2004The; Rapp2019Role).

In healthy human cells, SLC26A2 is involved in regulating chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and proteoglycan synthesis, processes activated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (Li2024Biallelic). The gene's activity ensures the extracellular deposition of collagen types II and IX, which are essential for proper cartilage formation (Li2024Biallelic). The protein's function is critical for endochondral ossification and maintaining the sulfation of cartilage matrix proteoglycans, which are necessary for normal cartilage metabolism and skeletal development (Hästbacka1994The; Ikeda2001Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC26A2 gene are associated with a spectrum of skeletal dysplasias, which include both lethal and non-lethal conditions. Lethal conditions include achondrogenesis type 1B (ACG1B) and atelosteogenesis type II (AO2), while non-lethal conditions include diastrophic dysplasia (DTD) and recessive multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (rMED) (Kausar2019Recessive; Härkönen2021SLC26A2Associated; Silveira2022SLC26A2DTDST). These disorders are characterized by abnormal cartilage and bone development due to impaired sulfate transport, leading to undersulfated proteoglycans and improperly constructed cartilage matrix (Rossi2001Mutations).

The severity of the phenotypes is correlated with the type of mutation in the SLC26A2 gene. Severe phenotypes, such as ACG1B, often result from mutations predicting a truncated protein or nonconservative amino acid substitutions in transmembrane domains, while milder phenotypes like rMED are associated with non-transmembrane amino acid substitutions and splice site mutations (Rossi2001Mutations). The R279W variant is particularly prevalent and is associated with rMED when homozygous (Silveira2022SLC26A2DTDST).

Clinical features of these conditions can include short stature, joint contractures, clubfeet, limb shortening, and a waddling gait, with radiographic findings often showing epiphyseal dysplasia (Kausar2019Recessive). The phenotypic variability suggests that factors beyond sulfate transport activity may influence disease severity (Zechi‐Ceide2013A).

## Interactions
SLC26A2, a member of the solute carrier family, is involved in sulfate transport and interacts with various proteins that influence its function and localization. A significant interaction is with the chaperone protein calnexin, which is mediated by N-glycosylation. This interaction is crucial for the retention of misfolded SLC26A2 mutants in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), preventing them from reaching the cell surface. The presence of high mannose forms of SLC26A2 and its mutants facilitates this interaction, while non-glycosylated forms do not interact with calnexin, highlighting the dependency on N-glycosylation (Rapp2019Role).

The interaction with calnexin is part of a quality control mechanism that ensures only properly folded proteins are trafficked to the plasma membrane. This interaction is disrupted when N-glycosylation is inhibited, allowing some mutants, such as the G678V mutant, to escape ER retention and reach the cell surface (Rapp2019Role). These interactions underscore the importance of N-glycosylation in the stability and functional expression of SLC26A2, affecting its cellular localization and transport activity (Rapp2019Role).
