# EFNB1

## Overview
EFNB1 is a gene that encodes the ephrin-B1 protein, a transmembrane protein that is part of the ephrin family, which plays a crucial role in cell signaling. Ephrin-B1 is involved in bi-directional signaling through its interaction with Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, influencing various cellular processes such as cell sorting, migration, and adhesion. This protein is particularly significant in developmental biology, contributing to craniofacial morphogenesis and the regulation of immune cell dynamics. Ephrin-B1's structure is characterized by a Greek key β-barrel topology and a PDZ-binding motif, which are essential for its signaling functions. Mutations in the EFNB1 gene are linked to craniofrontonasal syndrome and other developmental disorders, highlighting the gene's critical role in normal physiological processes (Makarov2010The; Nikolov2005Crystal; Bush2010Ephrin-B1).

## Structure
The EFNB1 gene encodes the ephrin-B1 protein, which is a member of the ephrin family involved in cell signaling. The primary structure of ephrin-B1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 21 kDa (Nikolov2005Crystal). The secondary structure includes a Greek key β-barrel topology, consisting of eight mixed parallel and antiparallel β-strands forming two β-sheets around a hydrophobic core, and three α-helices connecting the strands (Nikolov2005Crystal). Two buried disulfide bonds stabilize the structure (Nikolov2005Crystal).

The tertiary structure of ephrin-B1 is compact and globular, with a unique conformation of the receptor-binding G-H loop, which is more flexible compared to ephrin-B2 (Nikolov2005Crystal). Ephrin-B1 does not form homodimers, unlike ephrin-B2, and primarily forms heterodimers with EphB receptors (Nikolov2005Crystal). The protein contains a PDZ-binding motif in its intracellular domain, which is crucial for reverse signaling (Bush2022Cellular). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation of specific tyrosines in the cytoplasmic region, which is essential for its signaling function (Makarov2010The).

## Function
EFNB1 (ephrin B1) is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in cell signaling, particularly through its interactions with Eph receptor tyrosine kinases. This interaction forms bi-directional signaling complexes that are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell sorting, migration, adhesion, and boundary formation. In healthy human cells, ephrin-B1 is involved in forward signaling, which leads to cell repulsion and is essential for maintaining proper tissue organization by restricting cell intermingling at cellular interfaces (Makarov2010The).

Ephrin-B1 is also critical in craniofacial morphogenesis, where it regulates cell proliferation across eph-ephrin boundaries through the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway is activated by ephrin-B1 forward signaling, promoting the proliferation of palatal shelf mesenchymal cells, which is vital for the outgrowth of palatal shelves during craniofacial development (Bush2010Ephrin-B1).

In the immune system, ephrin-B1 regulates the dynamics of T follicular helper (T FH) cells within germinal centers. It repulsively inhibits the retention of T FH cells, preventing their excessive accumulation, while also promoting the production of interleukin-21 (IL-21), which is crucial for plasma cell formation and antibody affinity maturation (Lu2017Ephrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EFNB1 gene are primarily associated with craniofrontonasal syndrome (CFNS), an X-linked developmental disorder characterized by craniofacial, skeletal, and neurological anomalies. CFNS exhibits an unusual pattern of inheritance, where heterozygous females are more severely affected than hemizygous males. This is attributed to cellular interference resulting from EPHRIN-B1 mosaicism, which disrupts tissue boundary formation during development (Makarov2010The; Wallis2008Additional; Niethamer2020Aberrant).

The mutations in EFNB1 can include nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, and missense mutations, leading to truncated proteins or disrupted ephrin-B1 signaling, which affects cell behavior and communication (Makarov2010The; Wieland2005Twentysix). These mutations often result in loss of function, contributing to the CFNS phenotype, which includes craniofacial dysmorphology, coronal craniosynostosis, and hypertelorism (Twigg2004Mutations; Niethamer2020Aberrant).

In addition to CFNS, EFNB1 mutations have been implicated in other conditions such as epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females (EFMR), highlighting the broader impact of ephrin-B1 signaling disruptions (Makarov2010The). The role of EFNB1 in these disorders underscores its importance in normal developmental processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
EFNB1 (ephrin B1) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cell signaling. It interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1 and FGFR2) in Xenopus embryos, where these interactions exhibit antagonistic effects on cell adhesion and migration (Arvanitis2008Ephephrin). EFNB1 also interacts with claudin-1 and claudin-4 in mammalian cell lines, affecting epithelial permeability (Arvanitis2008Ephephrin). In the context of germinal centers, EFNB1 interacts with the EPHB6 receptor to regulate the movement and retention of T follicular helper (T FH) cells, promoting de-adhesion and territorial repulsion (Lu2017Ephrin).

EFNB1 is also involved in the regulation of autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells through its interaction with EPHB2, a receptor in the EPH family. This interaction is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and has implications for inflammatory bowel diseases (Zhang2020RNF186). Additionally, EFNB1 interacts with connexin43 in mouse embryos, influencing gap junction communication, which is essential for processes like skeletal development (Arvanitis2008Ephephrin). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of EFNB1 in different cellular contexts and species.
