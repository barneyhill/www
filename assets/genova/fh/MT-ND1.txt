# MT-ND1

## Overview
The MT-ND1 gene encodes the mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1, a critical component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, where it plays a pivotal role in oxidative phosphorylation, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. This process is essential for the generation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which ultimately drives ATP synthesis, a fundamental energy currency in cells (Lim2016Loss; Iommarini2018Unravelling). The MT-ND1 protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, featuring multiple transmembrane helices that contribute to its function in proton translocation and structural stability within complex I (Zickermann2015Mechanistic; Zhu2016Structure). Mutations in the MT-ND1 gene are associated with various mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and mitochondrial function (Kirby2004Mutations; La2014Association).

## Structure
The MT-ND1 protein is a core subunit of the mitochondrial complex I, playing a crucial role in the electron transport chain. Its primary structure consists of amino acid sequences that form part of the proton translocation channel within the complex. The ND1 subunit contains conserved residues such as Glu143 and Glu192, which are critical for proton translocation (Fiedorczuk2016Atomic).

In terms of secondary structure, ND1 includes transmembrane helices (TMHs) that contribute to its function. Specifically, ND1 comprises eight TMHs, with TMH5 noted to be discontinuous, which is a characteristic feature of antiporter-like subunits (Zickermann2015Mechanistic). The TMH2-6 region in ND1 replicates an antiporter-like half-channel motif, essential for its role in proton translocation (Zhu2016Structure).

The tertiary structure of ND1 involves its integration into the membrane domain of complex I, where it forms part of the quinone-binding site and the proton input channel (Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian). The ND1 subunit is enclosed by a cage of 18 supernumerary transmembrane helices, which stabilize its structure (Zhu2016Structure).

In the quaternary structure, ND1 interacts with other subunits like ND3, ND6, and ND4L to form a matrix-linked half-channel, contributing to the overall structural integrity and function of complex I (Fiedorczuk2016Atomic). The ND1 subunit is also involved in the interface between the peripheral and membrane arms of complex I, interacting with subunits such as the 49-kDa subunit and PSST (Zickermann2015Mechanistic).

## Function
The MT-ND1 gene encodes the ND1 protein, a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This complex is a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, playing a significant role in oxidative phosphorylation, which is essential for ATP production in cells (Lim2016Loss; Nguyen2020Deregulated). ND1 is involved in the initial step of electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, a process that contributes to the generation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, ultimately driving ATP synthesis (Lim2016Loss; Iommarini2018Unravelling).

ND1 is incorporated into complex I during the early stages of its assembly, forming part of the ubiquinone binding pocket at the interface between the membrane and matrix arms (Lim2016Loss). It is essential for the structural integrity and function of complex I, facilitating the integration of various subunits into a mature holoenzyme (Lim2016Loss). The proper function of MT-ND1 is critical for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and supporting various physiological processes, including metabolism, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (Nguyen2020Deregulated). ND1's role in complex I biogenesis underscores its importance in cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial function (Lim2016Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MT-ND1 gene are associated with a variety of mitochondrial disorders. One notable condition linked to MT-ND1 mutations is Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), a disease characterized by acute or subacute loss of central vision due to optic nerve degeneration (La2014Association). Additionally, MT-ND1 mutations can lead to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), which are associated with neurological and muscular symptoms (Kirby2004Mutations).

The m.3395A>G mutation in the MT-ND1 gene has been identified in patients with a range of clinical phenotypes, including deafness, diabetes, and cerebellar syndrome, but not LHON. This mutation causes a decrease in the activity and quantity of complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Gutiérrez2020Mutation). Another mutation, m.3911A>G, is associated with sensorineural hearing loss and neurodevelopmental delay, highlighting the gene's role in diverse clinical manifestations (MkaouarRebai2021Mitochondrial).

The m.4171C>A mutation in MT-ND1 has been linked to both optic neuropathy and bilateral brainstem lesions, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of this mutation beyond LHON (La2014Association). These mutations underscore the critical role of MT-ND1 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its impact on human health.

## Interactions
MT-ND1, a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I, is involved in several critical interactions within the electron transport chain. It is part of the membrane arm transporter module and associates with other subunits such as ND6 and the PSST subunit, which contains an iron-sulfur cluster essential for stabilizing the peripheral arm of complex I (Ugalde2004Human). The assembly of complex I involves the formation of intermediate subcomplexes, including subcomplex E, which comprises ND1, ND6, and PSST, eventually leading to the formation of a larger subcomplex B (Ugalde2004Human).

MT-ND1 also interacts with mitochondrial hTERT, which can hinder complex I functions and contribute to the Warburg effect, a metabolic shift associated with cancer chemoresistance. This interaction is mediated through the matrix loop region of hTERT, and disrupting it with a designed peptide can restore complex I activity and enhance chemosensitivity (Li2022Mitochondrial).

Mutations in MT-ND1, such as m.3571dupC, disrupt the assembly of complex I by preventing the formation of key intermediate complexes, leading to the degradation of other subunits and incomplete assembly of complex I (Lim2016Loss). These interactions highlight the critical role of MT-ND1 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its potential impact on disease states.
