# CCDC188

## Overview
The CCDC188 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 188 protein, which is primarily involved in the structural integrity and function of sperm cells. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in the head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) of sperm, a critical structure for maintaining the connection between the sperm head and tail. CCDC188 is predominantly expressed in the testes, particularly in spermatids and sperm subpopulations, highlighting its importance in sperm development and male fertility. The protein interacts with other proteins such as SUN5 and PMFBP1, which are associated with acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS), suggesting its role in mediating protein interactions essential for sperm head-tail linkage. Disruption of CCDC188 function can lead to male infertility, as evidenced by studies in knockout mice and human genetic analyses (Wang2024Discovery). Additionally, CCDC188 has been implicated in breast cancer, where it interacts with ATP5A1, indicating its potential involvement in oncological processes (Jiao2024DSBSOBased).

## Function
The CCDC188 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of sperm cells, particularly in the head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) of sperm. This protein is specifically expressed in the testes, with a significant presence in spermatids and sperm subpopulations, indicating its involvement in sperm development and function (Wang2024Discovery). CCDC188 is localized at the HTCA, a structure essential for maintaining the connection between the sperm head and tail, which is vital for proper sperm motility and male fertility (Wang2024Discovery).

The protein interacts with other proteins such as SUN5 and PMFBP1, which are also associated with acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS), suggesting that CCDC188 may mediate their interaction at the HTCA. This interaction is critical for maintaining the structural integrity of sperm, as evidenced by the separation of the sperm head and tail in the absence of CCDC188 (Wang2024Discovery). The disruption of CCDC188 function, as seen in knockout mice, results in male infertility due to the production of sperm with tailless heads and headless tails, despite normal testis size and spermatogenesis (Wang2024Discovery).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC188 gene have been identified as a novel genetic target for human acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS), a rare form of male infertility characterized by the separation of sperm heads and tails, leading to decapitated flagella in sperm. This condition is familial, indicating a genetic origin, and previously known mutations in the SUN5 and PMFBP1 genes account for about 70% of ASS cases. The discovery of a homozygous nonsense variant in the CCDC188 gene in an ASS patient suggests its significant role in the condition, particularly in cases where no variations are found in the known ASS-causing genes (Wang2024Discovery).

The CCDC188 gene is predominantly expressed in the testes, especially in early and late spermatids, and is involved in the formation and stability of the head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) in sperm. The absence of CCDC188 in the proband's sperm correlates with the ASS phenotype, suggesting that CCDC188 may regulate sperm head-tail linkage. Ccdc188-KO mice, created using CRISPR/Cas9, were infertile, with sperm showing head-tail separation similar to the proband, further supporting the gene's role in ASS (Wang2024Discovery). The study also found that CCDC188 interacts with SUN5 and PMFBP1, potentially mediating their interaction in the HTCA, indicating that mutations or alterations in CCDC188 expression are associated with acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (Wang2024Discovery).

## Interactions
CCDC188 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are significant in various biological contexts. In the study of human acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS), CCDC188 was found to interact with SUN5 and PMFBP1. These interactions suggest that CCDC188 may function as a linker between SUN5 and PMFBP1 in the head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) of sperm, which is crucial for sperm head-tail linkage and stability (Wang2024Discovery).

In the context of breast cancer, CCDC188 was identified as interacting with ATP5A1 specifically in luminal breast cancer samples. ATP5A1 is known to be upregulated in breast cancer and serves as a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target. This interaction indicates a potential role for CCDC188 in the molecular mechanisms of luminal breast cancer (Jiao2024DSBSOBased).

These interactions highlight the diverse roles of CCDC188 in different biological processes, from fertility to cancer. The protein's involvement in these interactions underscores its potential significance in both reproductive health and oncological research.
