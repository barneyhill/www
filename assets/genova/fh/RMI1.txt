# RMI1

## Overview
RMI1 (RecQ mediated genome instability 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a crucial component of the BLM-Topo IIIα-RMI1-RMI2 (BTR) complex. This protein complex plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks through homologous recombination. The RMI1 protein is characterized by its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB)-fold domains, which enable it to interact with other proteins in the complex, such as Topoisomerase IIIα and RMI2, thereby stabilizing the complex and enhancing its DNA repair functions (Wu2006BLAP75RMI1; Xu2008RMI). RMI1 is involved in the dissolution of double Holliday junctions, a critical step in preventing crossover events during DNA repair, thus safeguarding genomic integrity (Wu2006BLAP75RMI1; Xu2008RMI). Mutations in the RMI1 gene have been linked to Bloom syndrome and an increased risk of certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in genomic maintenance and disease prevention (Broberg2009Association; Gönenc2021Phenotypic).

## Structure
The human RMI1 protein is a component of the BLM-Topo IIIα-RMI1-RMI2 (BTR) complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and genome stability. RMI1 contains an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB)-fold domain, which is a conserved nucleic acid recognition motif that suggests its ability to bind DNA, particularly Holliday junctions (Wu2006BLAP75RMI1). The N-terminal region of human RMI1 forms a three-helix bundle followed by an OB-fold with an unstructured loop that interacts with Topo IIIα (Kennedy2015Structural). This loop is involved in complex formation with Topo IIIα, enhancing its catalytic activity by regulating the topoisomerase gate (Kennedy2015Structural).

RMI1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine residues 284 and 292 during mitosis, which is thought to have regulatory roles without disrupting its interaction with BLM and Topo IIIα (Xu2015Accumulation). These phosphorylation events are mediated by CDK1 and are associated with mitosis-specific functions (Xu2015Accumulation). The protein's interaction with hTOPO IIIα is crucial for the dissolution of double Holliday junctions, a key step in homologous recombination (Wu2006BLAP75RMI1).

## Function
The human gene RMI1 encodes a protein that is a critical component of the Bloom syndrome complex, which includes Bloom DNA helicase (BLM) and DNA topoisomerase IIIα (Top3A). This complex plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs), which are among the most severe forms of DNA damage (Fang2023RMI1; Wu2006BLAP75RMI1). RMI1 is involved in the dissolution of double Holliday junctions (DHJs), a crucial step in HR that prevents crossover events and reduces sister chromatid exchanges, thereby maintaining genomic integrity (Wu2006BLAP75RMI1; Xu2008RMI).

RMI1 contains oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB)-fold domains that facilitate its interaction with Top3A and RMI2, stabilizing the Bloom syndrome complex (Xu2008RMI). It enhances the ability of hTOPO IIIα to bind to DHJs, promoting the proper assembly and function of protein complexes necessary for DNA repair and recombination processes (Wu2006BLAP75RMI1). RMI1 is active in the nucleus, where it helps prevent chromosomal abnormalities and supports proper cell division, underscoring its role as a genome safeguard molecule (Fang2023RMI1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RMI1 gene have been associated with Bloom syndrome (BS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth deficiency, cancer predisposition, and immunodeficiency. Specifically, a 5-bp deletion in the RMI1 gene was identified in two patients from a consanguineous Turkish family, leading to a BS phenotype. However, unlike mutations in the BLM gene, which also cause BS, RMI1 mutations do not result in dermatological characteristics or immunodeficiency (Gönenc2021Phenotypic).

In addition to its role in Bloom syndrome, polymorphisms in the RMI1 gene have been linked to an increased risk of certain cancers. The SNP rs296887 in RMI1 has been significantly associated with an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (AML/MDS) and malignant melanoma, suggesting that alterations in RMI1 may contribute to cancer susceptibility (Broberg2009Association). The study highlights the potential of RMI1 polymorphisms as general cancer susceptibility markers, implicating the homologous recombination system in the neoplastic transformation of various cell types (Broberg2009Association). These findings underscore the importance of RMI1 in maintaining genomic stability and its potential impact on disease when mutated or altered.

## Interactions
RMI1 is a key component of the BLM-Topo IIIα-RMI1-RMI2 (BTR) complex, which is essential for maintaining genome stability. RMI1 interacts with BLM helicase and Topoisomerase IIIα, facilitating the dissolution of double Holliday junctions (dHJs) during homologous recombination. This interaction is crucial for preventing genomic instability and suppressing sister chromatid exchanges (Wu2006BLAP75RMI1).

RMI1 forms a stable subcomplex with RMI2, mediated through their respective OB-fold domains. This interaction is essential for the stability and function of the BLM complex, as RMI1 is unstable without RMI2 (Xu2008RMI). The N-terminal region of RMI1 interacts with BLM and Topo IIIα, while the C-terminal region interacts with RMI2 (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2).

RMI1 enhances the binding of Topo IIIα to dHJs, promoting the stepwise loading of Topo IIIα onto these structures. This interaction is mediated through protein-protein interactions rather than stable DNA binding (Wu2006BLAP75RMI1). The RMI complex, including RMI1 and RMI2, is crucial for the mitotic phosphorylation and nuclear localization of the BLM complex, contributing to its catalytic activities (Xu2008RMI).
