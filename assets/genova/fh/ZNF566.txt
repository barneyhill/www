# ZNF566

## Overview
ZNF566 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 566, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are typically involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein encoded by ZNF566 is implicated in various cellular processes, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Notably, the gene's circular RNA derivative, circZNF566, has been identified as playing a significant role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CircZNF566 acts as a competing endogenous RNA, influencing tumorigenesis by modulating the expression of other genes involved in cancer progression (Li2020Circular).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF566, a gene encoding a zinc finger protein, is implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through its circular RNA derivative, circZNF566. CircZNF566 is significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, correlating with poor prognosis and adverse clinicopathological features such as advanced clinical stage and distant metastasis (Li2020Circular). It functions as a competing endogenous RNA by sponging miR-4738-3p, a microRNA that acts as a tumor suppressor. This interaction leads to the upregulation of TDO2, a gene involved in tryptophan metabolism, which is linked to tumor activity and immune response regulation (Li2020Circular).

The circZNF566/miR-4738-3p/TDO2 axis is crucial for HCC progression, promoting cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and enhancing tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo (Li2020Circular). High levels of circZNF566 are associated with larger tumor size, higher tumor differentiation, and advanced metastasis stage, leading to poorer overall survival and disease-free survival in patients (Li2020Circular). These findings suggest that alterations in circZNF566 expression or its interactions could contribute significantly to HCC development and progression.
