# MYBPHL

## Overview
The MYBPHL gene encodes the myosin binding protein H-like (MyBP-HL), a myofilament-associated protein predominantly expressed in the atrial tissue of the heart. MyBP-HL is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in the sarcomere, the fundamental unit of muscle contraction. It shares structural similarities with cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C), particularly in its domain organization, which includes immunoglobulin and fibronectin-III domains essential for sarcomere integration (Lahm2019Myosin; AlvarezArce2024MYBPHLnonsense). The protein is involved in the regulation of myofilament protein content and is crucial for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and function, as evidenced by its localization in the heart's conduction system and its association with cardiac conduction abnormalities when absent (Barefield2019Myosin). MYBPHL's clinical significance extends beyond cardiac function, as alterations in its expression have been implicated in conditions such as hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy and multiple myeloma, highlighting its diverse roles in human health (Burnham2024The; Wong2021A).

## Structure
The MYBPHL gene encodes the myosin binding protein H-like (MyBP-HL), a myofilament protein primarily expressed in the atria of the heart. MyBP-HL is approximately 40 kDa in size and consists of three domains: the HL1 immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, the HL2 fibronectin-III (FN3) domain, and the HL3 Ig domain. These domains are essential for the proper incorporation of MyBP-HL into the sarcomere, a critical component of muscle contraction (AlvarezArce2024MYBPHLnonsense). The structure of MyBP-HL shares similarities with the last three C-terminal domains of cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C), which are also necessary for sarcomere integration (AlvarezArce2024MYBPHLnonsense).

MYBPHL exists in two isoforms, which differ by a deletion of 23 amino acids in isoform 2. Isoform 1 is expressed throughout all analyzed tissues, while isoform 2 is selectively expressed in the left atrium (Lahm2019Myosin). The protein's expression is predominantly in atrial tissues, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for atrial damage (Lahm2019Myosin). The MYBPHL gene is located on chromosome 1p13.3 and shares structural domains with the MYBPC3 gene, including fibronectin-3 and immunoglobulin C-2 type domains (Lahm2019Myosin).

## Function
The MYBPHL gene encodes the myosin binding protein H-like (MyBP-HL), which is primarily expressed in atrial tissue and plays a significant role in cardiac function. MyBP-HL is a component of the myofilament structure, with homology to MyBP-C, and is involved in the regulation of myofilament protein content in atrial and specific ventricular cardiomyocytes (Barefield2019Myosin). It is highly expressed in the atria, particularly in the left atrium, and is almost exclusively found in atrial tissue compared to other cardiac and non-cardiac tissues (Lahm2019Myosin).

In healthy human cells, MyBP-HL localizes to the myofilament in atrial tissue, suggesting a role in stabilizing or organizing myosin filaments, which are crucial for muscle contraction (Lahm2019Myosin). The protein is also associated with the heart's conduction system, co-localizing with the ventricular conduction system marker contactin-2 near the atrioventricular node and in a subset of Purkinje fibers (Barefield2019Myosin). The absence of MyBP-HL in mice leads to cardiac conduction abnormalities, such as third-degree AV block and prolonged action potential propagation, indicating its importance in maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and function (Barefield2019Myosin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MYBPHL gene have been linked to several cardiac conditions. MYBPHL is associated with hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), atrial fibrillation, and atrioventricular arrhythmias. In mouse models, the constitutive knock-out of MyBP-HL, the protein encoded by MYBPHL, results in atrial dilation, arrhythmia, and DCM, indicating its critical role in cardiac function (Burnham2024The). The absence of MyBP-HL leads to third-degree AV block and prolonged action potential propagation through the His system, although atrial cardiomyocyte morphology remains unchanged (Barefield2019Myosin).

Alterations in MYBPHL expression are also implicated in multiple myeloma (MM). The MYBPHL enhancer is significantly hypomethylated in MM cell lines compared to normal plasma cells, correlating with increased MYBPHL expression. This hypomethylation is associated with the t(11;14) translocation in MM, suggesting a potential oncogenic role in myelomagenesis. Knockdown of MYBPHL in MM cells reduces proliferation and increases cell death, indicating its role in cellular proliferation and survival (Wong2021A).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of MYBPHL in both cardiac and oncogenic contexts, suggesting that its mutations and expression alterations can lead to significant health implications.

## Interactions
MYBPHL, or myosin binding protein H-like, is involved in interactions within the sarcomere, a fundamental unit of muscle contraction. It is known to compete with cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) for binding sites on the thick filament of the sarcomere. This competition suggests a regulatory mechanism where the expression levels of MYBPHL and cMyBP-C are inversely related, influencing their incorporation into the sarcomere and potentially affecting muscle contraction (Burnham2024The).

Nonsense mutations in MYBPHL, such as Q29X and W54X, result in poor sarcomere binding and disrupt its localization within the sarcomere. These mutations lead to a diffuse localization pattern with some sarcomere enrichment, indicating that MYBPHL may interact with other sarcomeric components, although these interactions are impaired by the mutations (AlvarezArce2024MYBPHLnonsense).

The N'-terminal domain of MYBPHL is suggested to play a role in sarcomere interactions, as evidenced by the partial sarcomere stripe localization observed in the W54X mutant, which retains most of this domain (AlvarezArce2024MYBPHLnonsense). These findings highlight the importance of MYBPHL in maintaining proper sarcomere structure and function.
