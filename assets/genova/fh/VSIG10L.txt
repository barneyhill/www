# VSIG10L

## Overview
VSIG10L is a gene that encodes the protein V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 10 like, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). This protein is characterized by the presence of IgC2 domains in its extracellular region, which are typical of proteins involved in immune system functions and cellular interactions. VSIG10L has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly through its interaction with the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, a relationship that is not shared with other related receptors such as MERTK and TYRO3 (Verschueren2020The). The expression of VSIG10L varies across different cancer types, being downregulated in esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus, while upregulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting a complex role in oncogenic pathways and immune regulation (Zhou2022VSet). Further studies are required to fully understand the functional implications of VSIG10L in these contexts.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
VSIG10L is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and is involved in protein interactions that may have implications in cancer biology. The protein has been identified to interact with the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, a novel interaction confirmed through multiple experimental methods. This interaction is significant as it is not shared with related receptors MERTK and TYRO3, indicating a specific binding affinity between VSIG10L and AXL (Verschueren2020The). 

VSIG10L contains IgC2 domains in its extracellular domain, which are characteristic of its structural similarity to other IgSF proteins. These domains are involved in its interactions and potential roles in immune checkpoint pathways, although specific interaction partners beyond AXL have not been extensively detailed (Zhou2022VSet). 

The protein's expression patterns suggest a dual role in cancer, being downregulated in esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus, but upregulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma. This differential expression hints at its complex involvement in cancer-related pathways, possibly through its interactions with other proteins (Zhou2022VSet). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the range of interactions and functional implications of VSIG10L in cancer and immune regulation.
