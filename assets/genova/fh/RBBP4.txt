# RBBP4

## Overview
RBBP4, or retinoblastoma-binding protein 4, is a gene that encodes a chromatin remodeling factor known as RB binding protein 4. This protein is a crucial component of several chromatin remodeling complexes, including the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. It plays a significant role in modulating gene activity through histone modifications, such as the acetylation and methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27), which are essential for gene silencing and maintaining cellular identity (Mu2021RBBP4). RBBP4 is characterized by its WD40 repeat domains, forming a seven-bladed β-propeller structure that facilitates various protein-protein interactions, acting as a scaffold protein (Cai2023Unveiling; Liu2015Structural). This protein is implicated in several biological processes, including cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression, and is associated with various cancers and diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhan2024Interpreting; Kitange2016Retinoblastoma).

## Structure
RBBP4, also known as retinoblastoma-binding protein 4, is characterized by its WD40 repeat domains, which form a seven-bladed β-propeller structure. This structure is crucial for its role as a scaffold protein, facilitating various protein-protein interactions (Cai2023Unveiling; Liu2015Structural). The β-propeller structure of RBBP4 resembles a 'donut' with a central channel, allowing interactions on the top, bottom, or side surfaces (Cai2023Unveiling). 

The protein is composed of 425 amino acids and is encoded on chromosome 1p35 (Cai2023Unveiling). The WD40 domains are integral to its function, providing a platform for binding with histones and other proteins. For instance, the N-terminal peptide of histone H3 binds to the central propeller of RBBP4, and a unique PP loop forms a negatively charged pocket that interacts with histones (Cai2023Unveiling). 

RBBP4 can also bind non-histone proteins, such as the PHF6 peptide, which interacts with the smaller face of the β-propeller disc through a network of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts (Liu2015Structural). The protein is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, where it can form a 2:1 complex with the MTA1 subunit, highlighting its role in chromatin remodeling (Schmidberger2016The).

## Function
RBBP4, also known as RB binding protein 4, is a crucial component of several chromatin remodeling complexes, including the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. In healthy human cells, RBBP4 plays a significant role in modulating gene activity through the acetylation and methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) (Mu2021RBBP4). It is essential for the assembly of PRC2 and the establishment of H3K27me3 on target chromatin, which is crucial for gene silencing and maintaining cellular identity (Mu2021RBBP4).

RBBP4 also functions as a histone chaperone, binding directly to histones H3 and H4, and is involved in both the trimethylation of H3K27, associated with gene repression, and the acetylation of H3K27, linked to gene activation (Mu2021RBBP4). It helps guide the assembly of PRC2 subunits on target chromatin, facilitating the trimethylation of H3K27 (Mu2021RBBP4). Additionally, RBBP4 is part of the NuRD complex, which regulates gene activity by controlling acetylation levels on enhancers and promoters (Mu2021RBBP4). This balance between methylation and acetylation is critical for normal cellular functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation (Mu2021RBBP4).

## Clinical Significance
RBBP4 is implicated in various cancers and diseases due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In glioblastoma, RBBP4 modulates sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ) by regulating DNA repair proteins. Knockdown of RBBP4 enhances TMZ sensitivity by suppressing DNA repair genes such as MGMT and RAD51, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Kitange2016Retinoblastoma). In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), elevated RBBP4 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation, invasion, and poor clinical outcomes, suggesting its role as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Zhan2024Interpreting). In cervical cancer, RBBP4 downregulation leads to increased expression of oncogenes E6 and E7, contributing to radiation therapy resistance (Cai2023Unveiling). In liver cancer, RBBP4 maintains cancer cell stemness and silences tumor suppressor genes through interactions with the NuRD complex (Cai2023Unveiling). Additionally, RBBP4 is involved in age-related memory loss, with its expression declining with age, affecting memory formation (Zhan2024Interpreting). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RBBP4 in cancer progression, drug resistance, and cognitive aging.

## Interactions
RBBP4 is a key component of several multiprotein complexes, including the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, where it interacts with proteins such as MTA1, HDAC1, and histone H4. Within the NuRD complex, RBBP4 binds to histone H3 and other proteins like FOG1, SALL4, PHF6, and BMRF1, influencing gene expression and tumor suppression (Cai2023Unveiling). RBBP4 also interacts with the PRC2 complex, pairing with SUZ12 and interacting with AEBP2 and ARMC12, which affects chromatin methylation and gene repression (Cai2023Unveiling).

RBBP4's interaction with PHF6 is significant, as PHF6 binds to the same groove on RBBP4 as FOG1, indicating mutually exclusive binding. This interaction is crucial for PHF6's role in transcriptional repression (Liu2015Structural). RBBP4 also interacts with the transcription factor BCL11A, competing with histone H3 for binding. This interaction is important in triple-negative breast cancer, where BCL11A recruits epigenetic complexes like NuRD and PRC2 through RBBP4 (Moody2018Probing).

In addition, RBBP4 is involved in the DREAM complex, where it interacts with p130 and E2F, playing a role in cell cycle regulation (Cai2023Unveiling). These interactions highlight RBBP4's role in both normal cellular processes and disease states.
