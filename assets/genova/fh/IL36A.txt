# IL36A

## Overview
IL36A is a gene that encodes the protein interleukin 36 alpha, a member of the interleukin-1 cytokine family. This protein is primarily involved in mediating immune responses and inflammatory processes, particularly within epithelial tissues such as the skin and lungs. Interleukin 36 alpha functions as a cytokine, a type of signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in the immune system by activating various immune cells, including dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells, and promoting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is also involved in enhancing the phagocytic activity of macrophages and the production of antimicrobial peptides, contributing to the body's defense against pathogens. The activity of interleukin 36 alpha is regulated through its interaction with specific receptors and is modulated by proteolytic processing. Dysregulation of IL36A expression and function has been implicated in several inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as in certain cancers, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Yuan2019Biology; Peñaloza2021Interleukin36; Jensen2017Interleukin36).

## Structure


## Function
IL36A, or interleukin 36 alpha, is a cytokine that plays a significant role in immune responses and inflammatory processes. It is part of the interleukin-1 family and is primarily active in epithelial cells, including those in the skin and lungs. IL36A is involved in the activation of various immune cells and promotes immune responses by enhancing the activation of dendritic cells and stimulating the proliferation and polarization of CD4+ T cells towards a T helper 1 (TH1) cell fate. This leads to the production of cytokines such as IFN-g, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-17, which are crucial for orchestrating immune responses (Jensen2017Interleukin36).

IL36A also enhances the phagocytic ability of macrophages, aiding in the destruction of bacteria, and is involved in the production of antimicrobial peptides by keratinocytes and other epithelial cells, which restrict the growth of pathogens (Jensen2017Interleukin36). In healthy human cells, IL36A contributes to maintaining immune surveillance and responding to microbial threats by promoting cytokine production and leukocyte recruitment (Jensen2017Interleukin36). It is also implicated in the regulation of inflammatory pathways such as NF-kB and MAPK, which are activated upon binding to its receptor complex (Peñaloza2021Interleukin36).

## Clinical Significance
IL36A (interleukin 36 alpha) is implicated in several inflammatory diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), IL-36α is found at elevated levels in synovial tissues, promoting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, which contribute to disease progression (Yuan2019Biology; Swindell2018RNASeq). In psoriatic arthritis (PsA), IL-36α expression is also increased, and its signaling is linked to therapy resistance (Han2020IL36). 

In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, IL-36α is upregulated in inflamed tissues, contributing to inflammation and fibrosis (Neurath2020IL36; Elias2021IL36). IL-36α is also associated with psoriasis, where its elevated levels correlate with disease activity and exacerbate skin lesions (Carrier2011Inter-Regulation; Yuan2019Biology). 

In cancer, IL-36α has a dual role. It is downregulated in epithelial ovarian cancer, correlating with tumor progression, while in hepatocellular carcinoma, its expression is linked to improved patient survival (Han2020IL36). These findings suggest that IL-36α plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
IL36A, or interleukin 36 alpha, is a cytokine that interacts with the IL-1 receptor-like 2 (IL-1RL2), also known as IL-36R, and requires the interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) for signaling. This interaction forms a receptor-ligand complex that initiates an intracellular signaling cascade involving the recruitment of MyD88 and IRAK, leading to the activation of NF-kB and MAPK pathways. These pathways promote the expression of proinflammatory genes (Peñaloza2021Interleukin36; Jensen2017Interleukin36).

IL36A has a lower binding affinity to IL-1Rrp2/IL-1RAcP compared to other IL-36 agonists. IL-36Ra, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, can bind to IL-1Rrp2 but does not recruit IL-1RAcP, thereby inhibiting the inflammatory response. IL-38 also binds to IL-36R and suppresses the pro-inflammatory activity of IL-36 cytokines (Peñaloza2021Interleukin36).

IL36A is activated through proteolytic processing by neutrophil-derived proteases such as cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase, which enhances its biological activity. This processing is crucial for its function in inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Peñaloza2021Interleukin36).
