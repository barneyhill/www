# CHEK1

## Overview
CHEK1 is a gene that encodes the protein checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), a serine/threonine-protein kinase integral to the DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle regulation. CHK1 is activated by phosphorylation, primarily through the ATR kinase, in response to DNA damage and replication stress. This activation is essential for delaying cell cycle progression, allowing for DNA repair, and maintaining genomic stability (Liu2000Chk1; NeizerAshun2021Reality). As a key player in the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, CHK1 prevents cells with damaged DNA from entering mitosis by phosphorylating and inhibiting CDC25C, among other substrates (Liu2000Chk1). Beyond its role in cell cycle checkpoints, CHK1 also phosphorylates the tumor suppressor protein p53, contributing to its stabilization and activation, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Shieh2000The). The protein's interactions with other cellular components underscore its central role in coordinating cellular responses to DNA damage and ensuring genomic integrity.

## Function
CHEK1 encodes the CHK1 protein, a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a critical role in the DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle regulation in healthy human cells. CHK1 is activated in response to DNA damage and replication stress, primarily through phosphorylation by the ATR kinase. This activation is crucial for delaying cell cycle progression, allowing time for DNA repair, and maintaining genomic stability (Liu2000Chk1; NeizerAshun2021Reality).

CHK1 is involved in the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, where it prevents cells with damaged DNA from entering mitosis. It achieves this by phosphorylating and inhibiting CDC25C, which in turn prevents the activation of Cdc2 kinase, thereby inducing G2 arrest (Liu2000Chk1). CHK1 also phosphorylates other proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as CDC25A and CDC25B, and plays a role in the proteolysis-dependent activation mechanism during DNA replication (NeizerAshun2021Reality).

In addition to its role in cell cycle checkpoints, CHK1 phosphorylates the tumor suppressor protein p53 at multiple sites, contributing to its stabilization and activation in response to DNA damage. This phosphorylation is important for p53's role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Shieh2000The). CHK1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it regulates these critical processes to ensure proper cell division and prevent genomic instability (NeizerAshun2021Reality).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHEK1 gene are associated with various cancers. In breast cancer, frequent deletions and promoter methylation of CHEK1 are linked to poor prognosis, particularly in estrogen/progesterone receptor-negative cases, and are associated with advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis (Sinha2011Frequent). In ovarian cancer, a germline mutation in CHEK1, specifically c.613 + 2T>C, leads to a splicing error and a truncated protein, contributing to tumor development in a family with multiple cancer cases (Qian2024Case).

CHEK1 is often overexpressed in several cancers, including ovarian, breast, cervical, and brain cancers, where it enhances tumor cell survival by improving DNA damage repair, contributing to chemoresistance (Fadaka2020Gene). In cervical cancer, CHEK1 inactivation through deletions and promoter methylation is significant in the progression from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive carcinoma (Mazumder2011Inactivation). CHEK1 mutations, particularly frameshift mutations, are also found in colorectal and endometrial cancers with high microsatellite instability, leading to truncated proteins that may allow cancer cells to bypass cell cycle control (Bertoni1999CHK1). These genetic alterations highlight CHEK1's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1) is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its role in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. CHEK1 interacts directly with nucleophosmin (NPM), a histone chaperone, in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This interaction is independent of CHEK1's kinase activity and is crucial for recruiting NPM to chromatin, which is important for maintaining chromatin structure and cell cycle progression (Chen2009Interaction).

CHEK1 also forms complexes with other proteins such as p53 and Cdc25A, which are involved in cell cycle control and DNA damage response. These proteins coimmunoprecipitate with CHEK1 and NPM, indicating a network of interactions that regulate cell cycle checkpoints and genomic stability (Chen2009Interaction). CHEK1 phosphorylates substrates like p53 and Cdc25A, affecting their stability and activity, which is crucial for cell cycle arrest and DNA repair processes (Shieh2000The).

Additionally, CHEK1 interacts with ATR, which phosphorylates CHEK1 in response to DNA damage, facilitating its role in the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint (Liu2000Chk1). These interactions highlight CHEK1's central role in coordinating cellular responses to DNA damage and ensuring genomic integrity.
