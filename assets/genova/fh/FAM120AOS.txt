# FAM120AOS

## Overview
FAM120AOS is a gene that encodes a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) belonging to the protein family with sequence similarity 120 member A opposite strand. This lncRNA is involved in various biological processes and has been implicated in several diseases, including colorectal cancer and leukemia, through its role in apoptotic pathways and differential expression patterns. Although the precise molecular functions of FAM120AOS remain to be fully elucidated, it is recognized for its potential as a biomarker in disease contexts such as immune response in HIV and obesity susceptibility in children. The gene's association with these conditions highlights its significance in both clinical and research settings, despite the current lack of detailed structural and functional domain information in major protein databases (Bai2021Identification; Babbi2022Pathogenic; Ghazimoradi2023The; Warrington2015A; Akbari2020Integrative).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
FAM120AOS has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), FAM120AOS is among the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Its expression is significantly reduced in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, suggesting a potential role in CRC pathogenesis (Akbari2020Integrative). In the context of HIV, FAM120AOS is identified as a diagnostic marker for immune non-responders (INRs) undergoing antiretroviral therapy. It shows significant upregulation in INR samples, indicating its involvement in immune response differences (Bai2021Identification).

FAM120AOS is also associated with body mass index (BMI) in children. A genome-wide association study identified SNPs near FAM120AOS that influence BMI trajectories from early childhood, suggesting its role in obesity susceptibility (Warrington2015A). In leukemia, lnc-FAM120AOS-1 is differentially expressed in T-ALL cells, indicating its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Ghazimoradi2023The). Despite these associations, FAM120AOS lacks coverage in Pfam and InterPro databases, indicating limited information on its structural or functional domains related to disease (Babbi2022Pathogenic).
