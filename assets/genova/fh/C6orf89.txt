# C6orf89

## Overview
C6orf89 is a human gene that encodes a family of proteins known as amfions, which are involved in enhancing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. These proteins play significant roles in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, gene expression, and cell cycle progression. The amfion proteins are categorized into soluble and membrane-associated forms, with the soluble 34/64sp amfion localizing to the nucleolus and participating in ribosomal gene transcription, while the membrane-associated 42/116mp amfion is involved in maintaining Golgi structure and facilitating cell division. Additionally, C6orf89 is implicated in modulating immune and inflammatory responses through its influence on NF-kB transcriptional activity in airway epithelial cells. The gene's products interact with key cellular components such as the Pol I transcription factor UBF and the scaffold protein SIN3B, underscoring their multifaceted roles in cellular function and regulation (Lalioti2013C6orf89; Liu2015Bombesin).

## Function
The human gene C6orf89 encodes proteins known as amfions, which function as enhancers of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes and are localized in the nucleolus, Golgi apparatus, and midbody. In the nucleolus, the soluble protein 34/64sp amfion integrates into the ribosomal gene transcription machinery, interacting with the Pol I transcription factor UBF, and is implicated in the regulation of ribosomal DNA transcription (Lalioti2013C6orf89). The membrane proteins 42/116mp amfion are associated with the Golgi and midbody, where they play roles in maintaining Golgi structure and facilitating cell division, particularly during the late stages of mitosis (Lalioti2013C6orf89).

C6orf89 is also involved in modulating NF-kB transcriptional activity in human airway epithelial cells, acting as a modulator of immune and inflammatory responses. This modulation is achieved through the enhancement of HDAC activity, which is crucial for chromatin remodeling and gene expression (Liu2015Bombesin). The gene's products interact with SIN3B, a scaffold for HDAC regulators, further enhancing HDAC activity and impacting processes such as chromatin biology and protein transport (Lalioti2013C6orf89).

## Clinical Significance
The C6orf89 gene, also known as Amfion, has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although its precise role in disease is not fully understood. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mutations in C6orf89 have been identified as potential neoantigens, which can elicit immune responses. These neoantigens are recognized by T cells, suggesting that C6orf89 mutations could be targeted in personalized cancer immunotherapy (Rajasagi2014Systematic).

In the context of respiratory health, the C6orf89-encoded protein, bombesin receptor-activated protein (BRAP), has been shown to modulate NF-kB activation in human bronchial epithelial cells. BRAP acts as a negative regulator of NF-kB, a key transcription factor involved in inflammatory responses. This regulation is particularly relevant under conditions of oxidative stress, such as ozone exposure, indicating a potential role for C6orf89 in managing inflammatory and immune responses in the airway epithelium (Liu2015Bombesin).

Additionally, alterations in C6orf89 expression have been observed in breast cancer samples, where decreased expression correlates with RNA degradation, potentially affecting gene expression profiles and clinical outcomes (Strand2007RNA). These findings suggest that C6orf89 may have broader implications in cancer biology and immune regulation.

## Interactions
The C6orf89 gene encodes proteins known as Amfion, which participate in various physical interactions within the cell. These proteins enhance histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and are involved in chromatin structure regulation, gene expression, and cell cycle progression. The soluble protein, 34/64sp, localizes to the nucleolus and interacts with the Pol I transcription factor UBF, indicating a role in ribosomal gene transcription. This interaction is supported by colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation studies, suggesting a physical association with UBF (Lalioti2013C6orf89).

Amfion proteins also interact with SIN3B, a scaffold protein for HDAC regulators. The N-domain of the 42/116mp amfion interacts with SIN3B, enhancing HDAC activity. This interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens and immunoprecipitation experiments (Lalioti2013C6orf89). The presence of amfion in the midbody suggests a role in cell division, potentially involving the regulation of microtubule acetylation (Lalioti2013C6orf89). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of C6orf89 proteins in cellular processes.
