# FGF20

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20) is a gene that encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, specifically categorized within the FGF9/16/20 subfamily. The protein product, fibroblast growth factor 20, is a paracrine signaling molecule that plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including the development and survival of dopaminergic neurons, which are crucial for motor control and are implicated in Parkinson's disease (Itoh2013Roles). FGF20 is also essential for auditory function, contributing to the differentiation of cochlear cells, and is involved in hair follicle development (Biggs2018Hair; Huh2012Differentiation). The protein interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans to activate downstream signaling pathways, such as the MAPK pathway, which are vital for its neurotrophic and developmental functions (Trueb2012Role; Turner2016Dysregulated). Genetic variations in FGF20 have been associated with increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and may influence susceptibility to psychiatric conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Jiménez2018Depressive; Wang2008Variation).

## Structure
FGF20 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, specifically part of the FGF9 subfamily, which acts in a paracrine manner (Belov2013Molecular). The protein structure of FGF20 includes a core homology domain of 125 amino acids that adopts a conserved beta-trefoil fold, consisting of 12 antiparallel beta strands typical of paracrine FGFs (Belov2013Molecular). This beta-trefoil structure is crucial for its interaction with heparan sulfate, a cofactor in FGF signaling, which limits its diffusion and allows it to act locally (Belov2013Molecular).

FGF20 lacks a classical N-terminal signal peptide but contains an internal hydrophobic sequence that functions as a non-cleaved signal for transport into the endoplasmic reticulum and secretion from cells (Ornitz2015The). The FGF9 subfamily, including FGF20, uniquely activates the IIIb splice variant of FGFR3, FGFR4, and the IIIc splice variants of FGFRs 1, 2, and 3 (Ornitz2015The).

The primary sequence variation in the heparan sulfate binding site results in discrete affinities for heparan sulfate, forming FGF-specific morphogenetic gradients (Belov2013Molecular). The glycine box motif is conserved in paracrine FGFs, facilitating the formation of the beta11 strand (Belov2013Molecular). Specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of FGF20 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
FGF20 (fibroblast growth factor 20) is a member of the FGF family, specifically the FGF9/16/20 subfamily, known for its paracrine signaling properties. It plays a crucial role in the survival and development of dopaminergic neurons, particularly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), by binding to the FGF receptor 1c (FGFR1c) and activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is essential for neuron survival (Itoh2013Roles). FGF20 is involved in the differentiation of neural stem cells into dopaminergic neurons, which are critical for motor control and are affected in Parkinson's disease (Itoh2013Roles).

In the cochlea, FGF20 is essential for the differentiation of the lateral compartment, including outer hair cells (OHCs) and supporting cells, contributing to proper auditory function. Its absence leads to undifferentiated cells and hearing loss (Huh2012Differentiation). FGF20 also plays a role in hair follicle development by regulating cell cycle exit, cell motility, and aggregation during dermal condensation formation (Biggs2018Hair).

FGF20's neurotrophic activity supports neuronal growth and survival, but excessive signaling may have complex effects on brain function, as seen in its modulation of hippocampal biology and verbal episodic memory (Lemaitre2010Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FGF20 gene have been linked to several diseases, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD). A specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs12720208, in the 3' untranslated region of FGF20 disrupts a binding site for microRNA-433, leading to increased translation of FGF20. This results in elevated levels of α-synuclein, a protein associated with PD pathology (Itoh2013Roles; Wang2008Variation). The presence of the T allele of this SNP is particularly associated with higher FGF20 and α-synuclein levels, which may contribute to the risk of developing PD by affecting dopaminergic neuron survival (Lemaitre2010Genetic; Wang2008Variation).

The association between FGF20 polymorphisms and PD risk varies across populations, with significant correlations observed in Japanese and Chinese populations but not in Finnish and Greek populations (Itoh2013Roles). Additionally, the FGF20 gene has been implicated in depressive symptoms, with the rs12720208 polymorphism associated with higher depression scores in certain individuals (Jiménez2018Depressive). These findings suggest that genetic variability in FGF20 can influence susceptibility to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
FGF20 participates in several interactions that influence its biological activity. It undergoes reversible homodimerization, which serves as an autoinhibitory mechanism. This dimerization involves extensive interactions between the β-trefoil core and the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the protein. Approximately half of the residues involved in homodimerization are also predicted to mediate receptor binding, indicating that the homodimer form is incompatible with receptor interaction. Therefore, FGF20 must dissociate into monomers to bind to its receptors (Goetz2013Exploring).

FGF20 interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR1, to activate downstream signaling pathways such as the MAPK pathway. This interaction is crucial for its role in enhancing the survival of dopaminergic neurons and is implicated in conditions like Parkinson's disease (Lemaitre2010Genetic; Turner2016Dysregulated).

FGF20 also interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which act as coreceptors to enhance its activity. These interactions facilitate the binding of FGF20 to FGFRs, leading to receptor dimerization and activation of signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat, and PLCγ (Trueb2012Role).
