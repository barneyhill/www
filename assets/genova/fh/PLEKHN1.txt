# PLEKHN1

## Overview
PLEKHN1 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology domain containing N1, which is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cellular signaling. The protein is characterized by the presence of two pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains, which facilitate interactions with phosphoinositide lipids, and a C-terminal region that may function in nuclear activities (Yu2018Legionella). PLEKHN1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus but is also found in the cytosol and associated with mitochondrial functions, particularly in the context of apoptosis (Kuriyama2018PLEKHN1). It plays a significant role in apoptosis by interacting with the pro-apoptotic protein Bid, thereby influencing Bax-Bak oligomerization (Kuriyama2018PLEKHN1). Additionally, PLEKHN1 is implicated in host-pathogen interactions, notably through its interaction with the Legionella effector protein AnkX, suggesting a role in bacterial pathogenesis (Yu2018Legionella). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various diseases, including sporadic Parkinson's disease and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2021Sporadic; Kuriyama2018PLEKHN1).

## Structure
The PLEKHN1 protein contains two pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains in its N-terminal half, which are typically involved in recognizing phosphoinositide lipids and mediating binding to specific membrane compartments (Yu2018Legionella). The C-terminal half of PLEKHN1 is predicted to have similarity to DNA binding domains, suggesting a potential role in nuclear functions (Yu2018Legionella). Super-resolution microscopy has shown that PLEKHN1 is most abundant in the nucleus, where it forms speckles, and is also present in small puncta throughout the cytosol and on larger vesicular structures (Yu2018Legionella). 

The estimated full-length size of human PLEKHN1 is approximately 63 kDa, and multiple alternatively spliced forms are predicted from genomic sequences (Kuriyama2018PLEKHN1). PLEKHN1 is also localized in the mitochondrial fraction, indicating a role in mitochondrial functions, particularly in the context of apoptosis (Kuriyama2018PLEKHN1). The protein interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein Bid, facilitating the removal of Bid from Bid-Bax complexes, which is crucial for Bax-Bak hetero-oligomerization and subsequent apoptosis (Kuriyama2018PLEKHN1). However, specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PLEKHN1 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
PLEKHN1 (pleckstrin homology domain containing N1) is involved in several cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with phosphoinositide lipids and proteins. It contains two pleckstrin-homology domains in its N-terminal half, which are known to recognize phosphoinositide lipids, facilitating binding to specific membrane compartments. The C-terminal half of PLEKHN1 is predicted to have similarity to DNA binding domains, suggesting a potential role in nuclear functions (Yu2018Legionella).

In healthy human cells, PLEKHN1 is primarily expressed in the skin, esophagus, stomach, urinary bladder, and prostate. It is distributed in the cytoskeleton, mitochondrial membrane, mitochondrion, and plasma membrane, indicating its involvement in various cellular compartments (Wang2021Sporadic). PLEKHN1 participates in phospholipid-related functions, including binding to phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol phosphate, and phosphatidylserine, which are crucial for the production of the nerve myelin sheath. It also plays a role in 3'-UTR-mediated mRNA destabilization, positive apoptotic regulation, and hypoxia response, suggesting its involvement in maintaining nerve myelin sheath integrity, regulating neural cell apoptosis, and responding to hypoxia (Wang2021Sporadic). These functions highlight PLEKHN1's significance in cellular signaling and structural organization.

## Clinical Significance
PLEKHN1 has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD), a polymorphism in the PLEKHN1 gene, specifically the T allele of rs28499371, is associated with a decreased risk of developing the disease. This mutation results in an amino acid change that may influence the protein's structure and function, potentially affecting mitochondrial integrity and contributing to the pathology of sPD (Wang2021Sporadic).

In the context of cancer, PLEKHN1 plays a significant role in apoptosis, particularly in colon cancer. It promotes apoptosis by enhancing Bax-Bak hetero-oligomerization through interaction with Bid. The loss of PLEKHN1 expression in cancer cells is associated with increased resistance to apoptosis, which may contribute to tumor progression and drug resistance (Kuriyama2018PLEKHN1). PLEKHN1's expression is lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its potential role in tumor suppression (Kuriyama2018PLEKHN1).

PLEKHN1 is also involved in inflammatory responses. It interacts with the Legionella effector AnkX, which may target inflammatory pathways, indicating a potential role in inflammatory diseases (Yu2018Legionella). Additionally, PLEKHN1 has been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus-end-stage renal disease (T2DM-ESRD) in African American individuals, highlighting its potential involvement in chronic kidney disease (CañadasGarre2019Genetic).

## Interactions
PLEKHN1, a protein encoded by the PLEKHN1 gene, is involved in several significant protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of apoptosis, PLEKHN1 interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein Bid. This interaction enhances Bax-Bak hetero-oligomerization, a critical step in the apoptotic pathway. PLEKHN1 acts as a scaffold for Bid, facilitating the formation of Bax dimers and oligomers on the mitochondrial outer membrane, which is essential for apoptosis in human colon cancer cells (Kuriyama2018PLEKHN1).

PLEKHN1 also interacts with the Legionella effector protein AnkX. This interaction was identified through various assays, including bead-based pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. AnkX and PLEKHN1 co-localize on vesicular compartments within cells, suggesting a role in the host-pathogen interface during Legionella infection. The interaction is direct and does not require other mammalian proteins, indicating a specific binding affinity between AnkX and PLEKHN1 (Yu2018Legionella).

These interactions highlight PLEKHN1's role in apoptosis and its potential involvement in bacterial pathogenesis, making it a protein of interest for further research in cancer therapy and infectious disease mechanisms.
