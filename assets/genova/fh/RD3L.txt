# RD3L

## Overview
The RD3L gene encodes the RD3-like protein, which is a member of a family of proteins involved in various cellular processes. While the precise biological role of the RD3-like protein is not fully understood, it is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its involvement in modulating cellular pathways. Research has highlighted its potential significance in health and disease, particularly in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and retinal health. The RD3L gene has been associated with protective effects against AML and has been linked to variations in retinal layer thickness, suggesting its involvement in ocular physiology. Despite these associations, the comprehensive functional characterization of the RD3-like protein and its broader implications in human health remain areas of active investigation (Zekavat2023Insights; Pozarickij2020Nonadditive; Ahn2020Integrative; Zhang2024Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The RD3L gene has been implicated in various health conditions, although its specific clinical significance remains under investigation. In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression of RD3L is associated with a lower risk, suggesting it acts as a protective factor (Zhang2024Identification). This association highlights its potential role in cancer prognosis, particularly in AML.

In ophthalmology, the RD3L gene has been linked to retinal layer thickness. A study identified a significant association between the RD3L variant rs35337422-C and the thickening of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and inner nuclear layer (INL) in the retina (Zekavat2023Insights). This variant is a missense mutation that introduces an Ile → Arg substitution, which is considered deleterious by some predictive models (Pozarickij2020Nonadditive). However, the specific impact of RD3L mutations on retinal diseases remains unclear.

Despite these associations, there is currently no documented information on diseases or conditions directly caused by RD3L gene mutations or expression alterations in the context of heart function (Ahn2020Integrative). Further research is needed to elucidate the full clinical implications of RD3L.
