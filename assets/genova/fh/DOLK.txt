# DOLK

## Overview
The DOLK gene encodes the enzyme dolichol kinase, a transmembrane protein integral to the biosynthesis of dolichol phosphate, a lipid carrier essential for protein glycosylation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. Dolichol kinase facilitates the N-glycosylation process, a critical post-translational modification that ensures proper protein folding, stability, and function, thereby maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating processes such as cell-cell adhesion (Farooqi2023Phylogenetic; Cantagrel2011From). The DOLK gene is highly expressed in tissues such as the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart, underscoring its importance in these areas (Lefeber2011Autosomal). Mutations in DOLK can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, manifesting in a range of clinical symptoms, including developmental delays and cardiac issues, highlighting the gene's critical role in human health (Lefeber2011Autosomal; Cantagrel2011From).

## Structure
The DOLK gene encodes a protein consisting of 538 amino acids, located on chromosome 9q34.11 (Farooqi2023Phylogenetic). The protein is hydrophobic and features 13 to 15 membrane-spanning domains, indicating its transmembrane nature (Buczkowska2014Genetic). The C-terminal domain of DOLK is exposed to the cytoplasmic face and contains a CTP-binding pocket, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. Mutations in this region, such as K470/471 and T472, can lead to a loss of activity and altered affinity for CTP, while the G443D mutation abolishes the enzyme's activity entirely (Buczkowska2014Genetic).

The DOLK protein is involved in the N-glycosylation pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum, essential for protein and lipid glycosylation (Farooqi2023Phylogenetic). Although specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of multiple transmembrane domains suggests a complex folding pattern typical of membrane proteins. The protein's structure and function are highly conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary importance (Farooqi2023Phylogenetic). The DOLK protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and localization. However, specific details on these modifications are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The DOLK gene encodes dolichol kinase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of dolichol phosphate, a lipid carrier essential for protein glycosylation processes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells (Lefeber2011Autosomal; Farooqi2023Phylogenetic). Dolichol phosphate is involved in N-glycosylation, a post-translational modification where carbohydrates are added to proteins, which is vital for proper protein folding, stability, and function (Shridas2006Human; Cantagrel2011From). This process is critical for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of proteins, impacting cellular processes such as cell-cell adhesion and protein stability (Farooqi2023Phylogenetic).

In healthy human cells, DOLK is expressed at high levels in tissues such as the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart, where it ensures the availability of dolichol phosphate for glycosylation (Lefeber2011Autosomal). The enzyme's activity is essential for the proper glycosylation of proteins like alpha-dystroglycan, which is important for muscle and cardiac function (Lefeber2011Autosomal). Mutations in the DOLK gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, highlighting its critical role in cellular and organismal health (Cantagrel2011From).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DOLK gene, which encodes dolichol kinase, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically DOLK-CDG. These mutations lead to impaired N-glycosylation and reduced O-mannosylation, resulting in a range of symptoms including developmental delays, skin abnormalities such as ichthyosis, and significant cardiac issues like dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (Lefeber2011Autosomal; Cantagrel2011From). 

In particular, DOLK mutations have been linked to autosomal recessive dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by abnormal dystroglycan O-mannosylation. This condition can present with varying severity, from mild DCM to severe heart failure, and in some cases, necessitates heart transplantation (Kapusta2012From). The clinical presentation of DCM due to DOLK mutations is notable for the absence of significant muscular weakness or central nervous system involvement, although some patients may experience mild neurological symptoms (Lefeber2011Autosomal).

The deficiency in dolichol kinase activity due to DOLK mutations results in reduced availability of dolichol-P-mannose, which is crucial for proper glycosylation processes. This deficiency is directly linked to the clinical symptoms observed in patients, including the cardiac manifestations (Lefeber2011Autosomal; Farooqi2023Phylogenetic).
