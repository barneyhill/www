# ESM1

## Overview
ESM1, or endothelial cell-specific molecule 1, is a gene that encodes a secreted proteoglycan known as endocan. This protein is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells and plays a crucial role in modulating various physiological processes, including cell adhesion, inflammation, and vascular permeability. As a proteoglycan, endocan is characterized by its core protein linked to a dermatan sulfate chain, which is essential for its biological functions. Endocan is involved in key signaling pathways that regulate angiogenesis and immune responses, making it significant in both normal vascular development and pathological conditions such as cancer. The expression of ESM1 is regulated by inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, and its dysregulation has been associated with the progression and prognosis of several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhou2024Roles; Zhang2021Targeting).

## Structure
ESM1, also known as endocan, is a proteoglycan primarily expressed in endothelial cells. The primary structure of ESM1 includes a signal peptide and a mature protein sequence. It features a core protein with a single dermatan sulfate chain, which is a key component of its structure. The secondary and tertiary structures of ESM1 are less characterized, and there is limited information available about specific domains or prominent folds within the protein. ESM1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, particularly glycosylation, which is significant for its function and stability. This glycosylation involves the addition of glycosaminoglycan chains, contributing to its role in various biological processes. ESM1 does not typically form quaternary structures, indicating that it functions as a monomer rather than as part of a larger protein complex. The absence of detailed structural information on secondary and tertiary levels suggests that further research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular architecture of ESM1.

## Function
Endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 (ESM1), also known as endocan, is a proteoglycan primarily expressed in endothelial cells, particularly in the bronchial epithelium and vascular endothelial cells in the lung and kidneys. In healthy human cells, ESM1 is involved in the regulation of endothelial cell function and is expressed in tissues with proliferative activity, such as gastrointestinal glandular, bronchial, pulmonary capillary, glomerular, and renal tubular tissues (Zhou2024Roles). It plays a role in vascular tissue development and is used as an indicator of angiogenesis in clinical practice (Zhang2021Targeting).

ESM1 is a secreted proteoglycan composed of a 165-amino-acid polypeptide linked to a sulfated dermal polysaccharide chain. It is involved in modulating cell adhesion, inflammation, and vascular permeability, influencing processes like angiogenesis and immune response regulation (Zhou2024Roles). ESM1 expression is regulated by various factors, including inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, and is upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors such as VEGF, which modulates ESM1 expression through the PKC-NF-kB signaling pathway (Zhang2021Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ESM1 gene have been implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers. In cervical cancer, ESM1 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through the PI3K-Akt pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Lu2022Endothelial). Similarly, in ovarian cancer, ESM1 is upregulated and associated with poor overall survival, influencing cell proliferation, apoptosis escape, and angiogenesis via the Akt pathway (Li2023Validation).

In adrenocortical carcinoma, high ESM1 expression is linked to poorer overall and progression-free survival, with its role in cell cycle regulation and interaction with the Notch signaling pathway being significant (Huang2021EMS1DLL4Notch). ESM1 is also overexpressed in metastatic melanoma, where it is associated with tumor progression and immune evasion, impacting the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways (Miaomiao2023Identification).

In colorectal cancer, ESM1 expression is higher in tumor tissues and is associated with shorter disease-free survival, serving as a potential diagnostic marker (Xiao2022Exploration). These findings suggest that ESM1 could be a valuable biomarker and therapeutic target across various cancer types.

## Interactions
Endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 (ESM1), also known as endocan, is involved in various physical interactions with proteins that play significant roles in cancer progression and angiogenesis. ESM1 directly binds to the c-Met receptor on endothelial cells, which activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This interaction promotes angiogenesis and is crucial for gastric cancer metastasis (Yang2023ESM1). ESM1 also interacts with leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), antagonizing its interaction with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on endothelial cells, thereby influencing leukocyte adhesion and extravasation (Zhang2021Targeting).

ESM1 enhances the binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to its receptor VEGFR2, facilitating the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is essential for angiogenesis (Zhou2024Roles). It also interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), promoting EGF binding and activating downstream signaling pathways that sustain angiogenesis (Zhou2024Roles). These interactions highlight ESM1's role in modulating key signaling pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.
