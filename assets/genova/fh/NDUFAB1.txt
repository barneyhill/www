# NDUFAB1

## Overview
NDUFAB1 is a gene that encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit AB1, a mitochondrial acyl-carrier protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism. This protein is a component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is integral to the electron transport chain (ETC) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. As an accessory subunit, NDUFAB1 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes, enhancing their catalytic activity and electron transfer efficiency. It also contributes to the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, which are essential for the function of ETC complexes. The protein's expression is particularly high in energy-demanding tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscle, underscoring its importance in maintaining efficient ATP production and minimizing oxidative damage (Hou2019NDUFAB1; Zhang2019NDUFAB1; Triepels1999The).

## Structure
The NDUFAB1 protein, also known as the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein, is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. Its primary structure is highly conserved, showing a 97.7% similarity with its bovine counterpart, particularly from the amino acid sequence SDMPP towards the C-terminus (Triepels1999The). The protein contains a phosphopantetheine attachment site, which is crucial for its function, and an EF-hand calcium-binding domain (Triepels1999The). The conserved serine-44 residue is suggested to be the pantetheine 4'-phosphate binding site (Triepels1999The).

NDUFAB1 does not have hydrophobic regions, indicating it may not be membrane-bound (Triepels1999The). It interacts with LYRM family proteins, such as NDUFB9 and NDUFA6, through the insertion of its 4Ј-PP conjugated acyl-chain into a hydrophobic channel, forming salt-bridge contacts with conserved glutamates (Dibley2020The). NDUFAB1 is located at two different positions within complex I, playing a role in its assembly and stability (Formosa2018Building). The protein is essential for cell viability, independent of its function in complex I (Dibley2020The).

## Function
The NDUFAB1 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain (ETC) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein plays a significant role in mitochondrial bioenergetics by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Hou2019NDUFAB1; Triepels1999The).

NDUFAB1 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes, particularly complexes I, II, and III, enhancing their catalytic activity and electron transfer efficiency. This coordination is vital for reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and maintaining mitochondrial efficiency (Hou2019NDUFAB1; Zhang2019NDUFAB1). The protein also plays a role in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters, which are crucial for the function of ETC complexes (Hou2019NDUFAB1).

In healthy human cells, NDUFAB1 contributes to normal cardiac and skeletal muscle function by ensuring efficient ATP production and minimizing oxidative damage. Its expression is highest in energy-demanding tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscle, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and overall mitochondrial function (Hou2019NDUFAB1; Triepels1999The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NDUFAB1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiac and metabolic health. In the heart, NDUFAB1 is crucial for the assembly of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes and supercomplexes. Cardiac-specific knockout of NDUFAB1 in mice leads to progressive dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by an enlarged heart, increased heart weight relative to body weight, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This condition progresses to heart failure and results in a shortened lifespan, with sudden death occurring around 12 weeks of age (Hou2019NDUFAB1; Hou2018NDUFAB1). The absence of NDUFAB1 impairs mitochondrial function, leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and decreased ATP levels, contributing to cardiac dysfunction (Hou2019NDUFAB1; Hou2018NDUFAB1).

In metabolic health, NDUFAB1 plays a protective role against obesity and insulin resistance. Skeletal muscle-specific knockout of NDUFAB1 results in impaired glucose homeostasis and early postnatal death, highlighting its importance in metabolic processes (Zhang2019NDUFAB1). Overexpression of NDUFAB1 in transgenic mice confers resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and improves systemic metabolic profiles, including enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (Zhang2019NDUFAB1). These findings suggest that NDUFAB1 is a critical regulator of mitochondrial metabolism and a potential target for treating metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
NDUFAB1, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit AB1, is a mitochondrial acyl-carrier protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of mitochondrial respiratory complexes. It acts as an accessory subunit of complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and is involved in the assembly of complexes I, II, and III, as well as supercomplexes, which are essential for efficient mitochondrial energy metabolism (Dibley2020The; Hou2018NDUFAB1).

NDUFAB1 interacts with several members of the LYRM (Leucine-Tyrosine-Arginine motif) family, including LYRM1, LYRM2, LYRM4/ISD11, LYRM5, LYRM7/MZM1L, SDHAF3/ACN9, and FMC1/C7orf55. These interactions are important for various mitochondrial metabolic processes, such as the assembly of complex II and V, deflavination of the electron-transferring flavoprotein, and biosynthesis of iron-sulfur centers (Dibley2020The; Hou2019NDUFAB1).

NDUFAB1 is also involved in the biogenesis of mitochondrial Fe-S clusters, interacting with LYRM4 during this process. It plays a role in the stabilization and assembly of complex I by forming interactions with LYRM family members, such as LYRM2, which is crucial for the assembly of the N-module of complex I (Dibley2020The).
