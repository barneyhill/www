# VSNL1

## Overview
The VSNL1 gene encodes the visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1), a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein family, which plays a pivotal role in calcium-mediated signaling pathways within neurons. VILIP-1 is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which facilitate calcium binding, and a double-stranded RNA-binding domain, contributing to its diverse functional roles in the central nervous system (Ren2010Molecular; Groblewska2015The). As a calcium sensor, VILIP-1 is involved in modulating cyclic nucleotide signaling, influencing neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and receptor activity, thereby impacting learning and memory processes (Braunewell2011Association). The protein's interactions with various receptors and signaling molecules underscore its significance in maintaining neuronal function and its potential involvement in neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease (Groblewska2015The; Braunewell2011Association).

## Structure
The VSNL1 gene encodes the visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1), which is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein family. VILIP-1 consists of 191 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 22 kDa (Ren2010Molecular; Groblewska2015The). The protein structure includes four EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that bind calcium ions. However, only three of these motifs (EF-hands 2, 3, and 4) are functional for calcium binding, while EF-hand 1 is nonfunctional due to a lack of necessary residues for calcium coordination (Lin2002Functional; Trejter2015Visininlike).

VILIP-1 also features a double-stranded RNA-binding domain located between amino acids 110 and 182 (Ren2010Molecular). A significant post-translational modification of VILIP-1 is N-terminal myristoylation, which involves the attachment of a myristic acid to a glycine residue. This modification is crucial for the protein's membrane association and is regulated by a calcium-myristoyl switch mechanism, where calcium binding induces a conformational change that exposes the myristoyl group for membrane interaction (Lin2002Functional; Groblewska2015The; Braunewell2012The). VILIP-1 can form dimers, which are important for its interactions with receptors and other proteins (Braunewell2012The).

## Function
The VSNL1 gene encodes visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1), a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein family, which plays a crucial role in calcium signaling pathways in neurons. VILIP-1 is involved in modulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which are essential for neuronal differentiation and morphology. It influences processes such as neurite outgrowth, dendritic branching, and synaptic plasticity, which are vital for learning and memory (Braunewell2011Association).

VILIP-1 is primarily active in the central nervous system, where it interacts with various target proteins, including actin and guanylate cyclase, and modulates the activity of ion channels and receptors like glutamate and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These interactions enhance receptor surface expression and functional properties, affecting synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability (Groblewska2015The).

The protein's activity is regulated by calcium binding, which induces a conformational change that facilitates its association with cell membranes. This membrane association is crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways (Groblewska2015The). VILIP-1 also modulates cGMP signaling pathways, particularly in cerebellar granule neurons, by interacting with guanylyl cyclase-B, further influencing neuronal signaling (Braunewell2001Intracellular).

## Clinical Significance
The VSNL1 gene, encoding visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1), is implicated in several neurological disorders due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In schizophrenia, specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VSNL1 are associated with the condition and cognitive impairments, particularly those affecting frontal cortical function. Altered VILIP-1 expression is linked to changes in neuronal morphology and cAMP signaling, which may contribute to the cognitive disturbances observed in schizophrenia (Braunewell2011Association).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), VILIP-1 is considered a potential biomarker. Its expression is reduced in several brain regions of AD patients, correlating with cognitive decline. However, VILIP-1 protein levels are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting its release during neurotoxic events. This increase is associated with other AD biomarkers and cognitive impairment, indicating a role in the disease's pathophysiology (Groblewska2015The).

VSNL1 is also involved in glioblastoma multiforme, where its expression is downregulated. This downregulation is linked to the pathogenesis of the disease, affecting cell migration and proliferation (Barbagallo2015Dysregulated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of VSNL1 in various neurological and neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
Visinin-like protein 1 (VSNL1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence neuronal signaling and function. It interacts with the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), promoting its surface expression and trafficking, which affects neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (Zhao2009Neuronal; Li2011Structural). VSNL1 also forms a signaling complex with P2X2 receptors and proteins such as N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), tubulin1a, vesicle amine transport protein 1 homolog (VAT1), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and synapsin IIB, suggesting a role in receptor modulation (Ola2012The).

VSNL1 interacts with guanylyl cyclases GC-A and GC-B, modulating cGMP signaling pathways in a calcium-dependent manner (Braunewell2001Intracellular). It also binds to the 3' UTR of the neurotrophin receptor trkB RNA in a Ca2+-dependent manner, indicating a role in RNA interactions (Ola2012The). In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, VSNL1 dimerization is linked to oxidative stress and is a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where it is found in protein aggregates alongside hSOD1 mutants (Liebl2014Dimerization). These interactions highlight VSNL1's significant role in cellular signaling and its potential involvement in neurological disorders.
