# FMOD

## Overview
The FMOD gene encodes fibromodulin, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) that plays a pivotal role in the extracellular matrix. Fibromodulin is characterized by its leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which facilitate interactions with various proteins, particularly collagen types I, II, and III, thereby influencing collagen fibrillogenesis and tissue integrity (Oldberg1989A; Zhao2023The). The protein undergoes significant post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and sulfation, which are essential for its function in modulating collagen fiber organization and extracellular matrix assembly (Plaas1990Identification; Antonsson1991Posttranslational). Fibromodulin's interactions extend to growth factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), where it modulates signaling pathways involved in tissue repair and homeostasis (Hildebrand1994Interaction). Clinically, alterations in FMOD expression and mutations have been linked to various conditions, including high myopia, cancer, and glioma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Mondal2016Integrative; Majava2007Novel; Pourhanifeh2019The).

## Structure
Fibromodulin (FMOD) is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) characterized by a core protein with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). The primary structure of FMOD consists of 376 amino acid residues, with a molecular mass of approximately 42 kDa, although post-translational modifications increase its apparent size to 59 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Oldberg1989A; Zhao2023The). The protein contains a central domain with ten leucine-rich repeats, which are implicated in protein-protein interactions and are similar to those found in other proteins like decorin (Oldberg1989A).

The secondary structure of FMOD is characterized by β-sheets forming a curved solenoid structure typical of LRR proteins, with an N-terminal cap containing conserved disulfide bonds and 11 LRRs that form a β-strand on the concave face (Zhao2023The). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these LRRs, contributing to its interaction capabilities with other molecules such as collagen.

FMOD undergoes several post-translational modifications, including O-sulfation of N-terminal tyrosines and N-linked glycosylation at specific asparagine residues, with keratan sulfate chains linked via N-glycosidic linkages (Plaas1990Identification; Antonsson1991Posttranslational). These modifications are crucial for its function in the extracellular matrix and its interactions with collagen (Zhao2023The). FMOD is primarily monomeric in physiological solutions, unlike other SLRPs that form dimers (Zhao2023The).

## Function
Fibromodulin (FMOD) is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan that plays a crucial role in the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis and extracellular matrix assembly. It binds to collagen fibers, particularly types I and II, influencing their diameter and organization, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical properties of connective tissues (Iozzo2015Proteoglycan). In the cornea, FMOD is involved in the spatial and temporal regulation of collagen fibril growth, particularly in the limbus, a transition zone between the corneal and scleral stromas. This regulation is vital for the development of the optical properties of the eye and normal vision (Chen2010Fibromodulin).

FMOD also interacts with other small leucine-rich proteoglycans, such as lumican, to regulate fibril assembly and maintain fibril size, as evidenced by the larger fibril diameters observed in fibromodulin-deficient mice (Chen2010Fibromodulin). Additionally, FMOD modulates the classical complement pathway by binding to the collagenous part of complement C1q, and it influences angiogenesis by promoting an angiogenic microenvironment through its interaction with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFB1) (Iozzo2015Proteoglycan; Adini2013Melanocytesecreted). These functions highlight FMOD's significant role in tissue development, repair, and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FMOD gene have been implicated in several diseases. In high myopia, specific sequence variations in FMOD, such as Gly147Asp and Arg324Thr, have been identified in the leucine-rich repeat domains, which are crucial for the protein's function. These mutations are not found in non-myopic controls, suggesting a potential link to the disease's pathogenesis (Majava2007Novel).

In cancer, FMOD is recognized as a tumor-associated antigen, particularly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Its upregulation in CLL cells compared to normal B lymphocytes suggests its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy. FMOD modulates TGF-β signaling, which is crucial in cancer progression, and its interaction with TGF-β inhibits apoptotic activity in B-CLL (Pourhanifeh2019The).

In glioma, FMOD is epigenetically regulated, with specific methylation patterns associated with different glioma grades. It is hypermethylated and downregulated in glioma, suggesting a role in astrocyte transformation and glioma cell migration. The methylation status of FMOD could serve as a potential biomarker for glioma diagnosis and prognosis (Mondal2016Integrative).

## Interactions
Fibromodulin (FMOD) interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in the extracellular matrix. It binds to collagen types I, II, and III, influencing collagen fibrillogenesis and cross-linking. FMOD interacts with specific collagen cross-linking sites, particularly those containing the KGHR motif, which is conserved across these collagen types (Kalamajski2016Fibromodulin). It also interacts with lysyl oxidase (LOX), a key enzyme in collagen cross-linking, potentially modulating its activity and directing it to specific cross-linking sites on collagen (Kalamajski2016Fibromodulin).

FMOD also binds to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) isoforms, including TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, with varying affinities. It is more effective than decorin and biglycan in competing for TGF-β binding, suggesting a role in sequestering TGF-β in the extracellular matrix and influencing its availability to receptors (Hildebrand1994Interaction).

In the context of muscle biology, FMOD interacts with myostatin (MSTN), a known inhibitor of muscle growth. FMOD negatively regulates MSTN gene expression, thereby inhibiting muscle aging and promoting muscle regeneration by recruiting muscle stem cells and overcoming MSTN's inhibitory effects (Lee2021Interaction).
