# ELMO3

## Overview
ELMO3 (engulfment and cell motility 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell motility and cytoskeletal reorganization. The ELMO3 protein functions as part of a complex with DOCK proteins, acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac, a small GTPase critical for processes such as phagocytosis and cell migration (Michaelsen2018DNA; Boger2022Comparative). This protein is active in the cytoplasm and plays significant roles in developmental processes and immune responses (East2012ELMO). ELMO3 is also implicated in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation (Ashktorab2020Determination). The gene's expression and regulation are of particular interest in cancer research, as alterations in ELMO3 expression have been linked to various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target (Søes2014Hypomethylation; Zhang2024Identification).

## Function
ELMO3 (engulfment and cell motility 3) is a protein involved in the regulation of cell motility and cytoskeletal reorganization. It functions as part of a complex with DOCK proteins to activate Rac, a small GTPase, which is crucial for processes such as phagocytosis and cell migration (Michaelsen2018DNA; Boger2022Comparative). ELMO3 is active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in developmental processes and immune responses (East2012ELMO).

In healthy human cells, ELMO3 is involved in the migration of epithelial cells, particularly in the context of the intestinal epithelium, where it facilitates the movement of cells from the crypt to the villus tip (Ashktorab2020Determination). It is also implicated in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is important for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation (Ashktorab2020Determination). Although specific transcriptional regulation information for ELMO3 is not fully available, it is known to be involved in the organization of the extracellular matrix, which is essential for maintaining structural integrity in tissues (Boger2022Comparative). The protein's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular and tissue function.

## Clinical Significance
ELMO3 is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ELMO3 is overexpressed as a result of hypomethylation of its promoter, which is associated with metastasis formation. This overexpression suggests ELMO3 could serve as a prognostic or predictive biomarker and a potential drug target in NSCLC (Søes2014Hypomethylation). In colorectal cancer (CRC), ELMO3 is highly expressed and involved in signaling pathways related to growth, invasion, and metastasis, making it a potential target for prevention and treatment (Zhang2024Identification).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ELMO3 expression is associated with poorer prognosis, with higher expression correlating with decreased overall and disease-free survival (Kadletz2016ELMO3). Similarly, in minor salivary gland carcinoma, high ELMO3 expression is linked to worse disease-free survival and higher recurrence rates (Kotowski2018ELMO3). In early laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, ELMO3 expression is associated with higher recurrence rates and poorer clinical outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Haymerle2017ELMO3). These findings highlight ELMO3's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ELMO3 is known to interact with DOCK180, forming a complex that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac, a small GTPase involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. This interaction is crucial for processes such as cell migration and cytoskeletal changes. The DOCK180/ELMO complex, which includes ELMO3, is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting roles in different cellular compartments (Yin2004Nuclear).

Although specific interactions of ELMO3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, it is implied that ELMO3, like other ELMO isoforms, can form functional complexes with DOCK180. The complex is highly stable, resisting extraction and washing conditions, and is identified in HeLa cell nuclear extracts (Yin2004Nuclear).

ELMO3 is also suggested to interact with GPR128, an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR), through its RAE supramodule, similar to interactions observed with ELMO1 and ELMO2. This interaction is part of the ELMO/DOCK/Rac signaling module, which is involved in cellular processes such as phagocytosis and myoblast fusion (Weng2019Structure).
