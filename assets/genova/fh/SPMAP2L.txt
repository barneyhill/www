# SPMAP2L

## Overview
The SPMAP2L gene encodes the sperm microtubule associated protein 2 like, a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural organization and function of microtubules within sperm cells. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, which is essential for the stabilization and regulation of microtubule dynamics, particularly during spermatogenesis. The proper functioning of SPMAP2L is vital for the formation and motility of sperm, impacting fertility and reproductive success. Mutations or dysregulation of this gene may lead to defects in sperm structure and function, potentially contributing to male infertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
