# CCL28

## Overview
CCL28, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 28, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the chemokine family, specifically categorized as a chemokine ligand. The protein product of CCL28, also known as Mucosae-associated epithelial chemokine (MEC), plays a crucial role in the immune system by mediating the recruitment of immune cells to mucosal tissues. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells of mucosal tissues such as the salivary glands, mammary glands, intestines, and trachea (Hieshima2003CCL28; Mohan2017CCL28). The CCL28 protein is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes a canonical chemokine fold and a non-canonical disulfide bond, which contributes to its structural uniqueness and functional versatility (Thomas2018The). Functionally, CCL28 is involved in both innate and adaptive immunity, acting as a chemoattractant for immune cells and exhibiting antimicrobial activity against a range of pathogens (Mohan2017CCL28; Hieshima2003CCL28). Its expression and activity are implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its significance in health and disease (Chen2023Neutralization; Korbecki2020CC).

## Structure
The CCL28 protein exhibits a unique molecular structure characterized by a canonical chemokine tertiary fold, which includes a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a C-terminal α-helix (Thomas2018The). The protein's structure is further distinguished by an additional, non-canonical disulfide bond that links the first β-strand to the unstructured C-terminal tail, contributing to its structural uniqueness among chemokines (Thomas2018The). This disulfide bond stabilizes the C-terminal domain, forming an ordered loop between the end of the α-helix and the disulfide bond (Thomas2018The).

The C-terminal domain of CCL28, consisting of 28 residues, is largely unstructured and dynamic, yet it plays a significant role in the protein's antifungal activity (Thomas2018The). The structural lability of CCL28 is influenced by pH and salt concentration, with the protein unfolding at low pH but stabilized by physiological salt levels (Thomas2018The). Despite these structural changes, the tertiary fold is not necessary for its antifungal activity, as both folded and unfolded forms are effective against Candida albicans (Thomas2018The). The C-terminal domain shares sequence homology with the antifungal peptide histatin-5, and a peptide consisting solely of this domain retains significant antifungal activity (Thomas2018The).

## Function
CCL28, also known as Mucosae-associated epithelial chemokine (MEC), is a chemokine involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. It is primarily expressed in mucosal tissues such as the salivary glands, mammary glands, intestines, and trachea, where it is secreted by epithelial cells (Hieshima2003CCL28; Mohan2017CCL28). CCL28 functions as a chemoattractant, recruiting immune cells like IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and T lymphocytes to mucosal sites through its interaction with chemokine receptors CCR3 and CCR10 (Mohan2017CCL28; Meurens2007Commensal). This recruitment is crucial for the localization and activation of immune cells, enhancing mucosal antibody responses and providing long-term protection against pathogens (Mohan2017CCL28).

In addition to its role in cell recruitment, CCL28 exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. It acts against a variety of microbes, including Candida albicans and both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, by increasing membrane permeability and forming pores in microbial plasma membranes (Hieshima2003CCL28; Mohan2017CCL28). This antimicrobial function is particularly effective in low-salt environments, such as saliva and milk, where CCL28 is abundantly secreted (Hieshima2003CCL28). Overall, CCL28 plays a vital role in maintaining immune homeostasis and protecting mucosal surfaces from microbial colonization.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL28 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. High expression levels of CCL28 are linked to salivary gland tumors, Hodgkin's disease, and Sjögren's syndrome, indicating its role in these pathologies (Mohan2017CCL28). In the context of cancer, CCL28 expression is down-regulated in breast cancer, colon cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme, suggesting a potential anticancer effect during early tumor development. However, elevated CCL28 levels in luminal-like breast cancer are associated with improved prognosis, while in triple-negative breast cancer, the effect is less beneficial (Korbecki2020CC).

In diabetes, excessive CCL28 expression is linked to impaired wound healing, particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Neutralizing CCL28 with an antibody has shown to improve wound healing by reducing inflammation and enhancing angiogenesis in diabetic mice (Chen2023Neutralization). CCL28 also plays a role in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis, where its expression is upregulated (Mohan2017CCL28).

In infections, CCL28 is crucial for neutrophil responses during mucosal infections, such as gastrointestinal infections with Salmonella. However, in lung infections with Acinetobacter, CCL28 deficiency appears beneficial, suggesting its dual role in different infection contexts (PerezLopez2021CCL28).

## Interactions
CCL28 interacts with the chemokine receptors CCR10 and CCR3, playing a significant role in immune cell migration and mucosal immunity. The interaction between CCL28 and CCR10 is particularly important in endothelial cells (ECs), where it influences angiogenesis and wound healing. CCL28 activates CCR10, which then interacts with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), leading to the activation of Src/PI3K/MAPK signaling pathways. This interaction negatively regulates eNOS expression and activity, impacting nitric oxide (NO) production and vascular homeostasis (Chen2020CCL28‐induced).

A novel myristoylated peptide, Myr-CBD7, has been developed to block the CCR10-eNOS interaction, enhancing eNOS activity and promoting angiogenesis and wound healing. This peptide specifically disrupts the interaction between eNOS and CCR10 without affecting the eNOS-CaM interaction, indicating a targeted mechanism of action (Chen2020CCL28‐induced).

CCL28 also exhibits antimicrobial activity, particularly against Candida albicans, through its ability to disrupt microbial membranes. This activity is attributed to its highly charged C-terminal tail, which interacts with negatively charged microbial membranes, leading to membrane permeation and disruption (He2020Chemokine).
