# TBC1D26

## Overview
TBC1D26 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 26, which is part of the TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain-containing protein family. These proteins are generally involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics, often acting as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Rab GTPases. The TBC1D26 protein has been implicated in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins, such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). Although the specific biological functions of TBC1D26 remain to be fully elucidated, its mutation has been observed in canine T-cell lymphomas, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis and highlighting its relevance in comparative oncology (Elvers2015Exome).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TBC1D26 is known to interact with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through a reconstituted complex, as identified in protein-protein interaction studies. This interaction was noted despite the challenges in identifying TBC1D proteins due to their high sequence similarity, which complicates mass spectrometry identification (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). The use of yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays has been highlighted as a promising method for identifying interactions involving TBC1D26, particularly for membrane proteins that are difficult to solubilize for mass spectrometry-based approaches (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

In addition to its interaction with APP, TBC1D26 has been identified as one of the significantly mutated genes in T-cell lymphomas in dogs, although specific protein interactions in this context have not been detailed (Elvers2015Exome). The study of TBC1D26 in canine lymphomas suggests potential implications for human cancer research, as some of the significantly mutated genes in T-cell lymphomas have been implicated in human lymphoma, though TBC1D26 itself has not been previously reported in human cancer studies (Elvers2015Exome).
