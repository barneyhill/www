# SF3B1

## Overview
The SF3B1 gene encodes the splicing factor 3b subunit 1, a crucial component of the spliceosome, which is a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. The SF3B1 protein is characterized by its α-helical HEAT repeat domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and is essential for recognizing branch point sequences during RNA splicing (Finci2018The; Maji2019Structures). As a core component of the U2 spliceosome, SF3B1 plays a significant role in alternative splicing, influencing various cellular functions such as development and stress responses (Kim2020Titration). Mutations in SF3B1 are associated with several hematologic malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where they contribute to aberrant splicing patterns and disease progression (Cazzola2013Biologic; Visconte2012SF3B1).

## Structure
The SF3B1 protein is a critical component of the spliceosome, characterized by its α-helical HEAT repeat domain, which forms a C-shaped scaffold. This domain consists of approximately 20 HEAT repeats that create a superhelical spiral, wrapping around the PHF5A protein (Finci2018The; Maji2019Structures). The HEAT repeats facilitate protein-protein interactions and are involved in the recognition of branch point sequences during splicing (Papaemmanuil2011SomaticSF3B1Mutation).

SF3B1's structure is dynamic, undergoing significant conformational changes during spliceosome assembly. It transitions from an open conformation in its isolated state to a closed conformation when bound to RNA, stabilizing the branch point sequence (BPS)-U2 snRNA duplex (Maji2019Structures). The N-terminal HEAT repeats interact nonspecifically with the polypyrimidine tract of pre-mRNA, while the C-terminal HEAT repeats form a specificity pocket for branch point adenosine (BPA) recognition (Finci2018The).

Mutations in SF3B1, particularly in the HEAT domains, are associated with cancer and can lead to aberrant splicing patterns. These mutations often result in conformational changes that affect the protein's function (Canbezdi2021Functional; Papaemmanuil2011SomaticSF3B1Mutation). The protein's structure is also targeted by splicing modulators, which can lock SF3B1 in an open conformation, inhibiting its function (Finci2018The).

## Function
SF3B1 is a core component of the U2 spliceosome, which is essential for RNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. This process is crucial for generating mature mRNA transcripts by recognizing and excising introns from pre-mRNA. SF3B1 plays a significant role in alternative splicing, allowing for the production of multiple mRNA transcripts from a single gene, which is vital for various cellular functions such as development, tissue specificity, signaling, and stress responses (Kim2020Titration).

SF3B1 is involved in recognizing the branchpoint sequence during splicing and influences other gene expression pathways beyond splicing. It is linked to the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, which degrades mRNA transcripts with premature termination codons, and protein quality control pathways that manage protein folding (Kim2020Titration). SF3B1 activity is finely regulated to coordinate mRNA splicing, gene expression, and cellular physiology, maintaining proper splicing and gene expression balance, which is critical for cell physiology (Kim2020Titration).

In the context of stress, SF3B1 regulates the heat shock response, as evidenced by changes in the expression of chaperone proteins, which are components of the proteostasis network. This regulation is crucial for maintaining protein-folding balance in cells (Kim2020Titration).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SF3B1 gene are implicated in several hematologic malignancies, notably myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In MDS, SF3B1 mutations are frequently associated with subtypes characterized by ring sideroblasts, such as refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and RARS with thrombocytosis (RARS-T). These mutations are linked to abnormal iron deposits around mitochondria in erythroid precursors, suggesting a dysfunction in iron metabolism and a potential role in the formation of ring sideroblasts (Cazzola2013Biologic; Visconte2012SF3B1). SF3B1 mutations in MDS are considered founder mutations and are associated with a lower risk of progression to leukemia (Cazzola2013Biologic).

In CLL, SF3B1 mutations, particularly the K700E variant, are associated with unmutated IGHV status and are considered an independent risk factor for a more aggressive disease course. These mutations are linked to a shorter time to initial treatment and are often found in cases refractory to fludarabine treatment (Rossi2011Mutations; Wang2011SF3B1and). SF3B1 mutations in CLL are associated with altered mRNA splicing, contributing to the pathogenesis and clinical progression of the disease (Rossi2011Mutations).

## Interactions
SF3B1, a component of the spliceosome, engages in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a pivotal role in pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with U2AF65, a splicing factor essential for the recruitment of U2 snRNP to the branch point sequence (BPS). This interaction is mediated through the ULM domain of SF3B1, which is crucial for promoting exon inclusion in SMN2 pre-mRNA (Choi2020U2AF65Dependent).

SF3B1 also interacts with Tat-SF1, a transcription and splicing factor, through a U2AF homology motif (UHM) interface. This interaction involves specific binding to SF3B1's ULM regions, particularly ULM5, which exhibits the highest affinity. The integrity of this interaction is essential for the functional partnership between Tat-SF1 and SF3B1, influencing gene expression and splicing (Loerch2019The).

Mutations in SF3B1, such as K700E, disrupt its interaction with SUGP1, leading to splicing errors. This disruption is significant in the context of myelodysplastic syndromes and certain cancers, where the loss of SUGP1 interaction is a common defect. Overexpression of SUGP1 can partially rescue these splicing defects, highlighting the importance of the SF3B1-SUGP1 interaction (Zhang2019DiseaseCausing).
