# MAP1S

## Overview
MAP1S, or microtubule-associated protein 1S, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the microtubule-associated protein family. The MAP1S protein plays a crucial role in the stabilization and dynamics of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton involved in maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. As a cytolinker, MAP1S cross-links microtubules and actin filaments, contributing to cellular architecture and function (OrbánNémeth2005Microtubuleassociated). The protein is synthesized as a precursor that undergoes cleavage to form a complex of heavy and light chains, with the light chain containing domains that bind to microtubules and actin (Halpain2006The). MAP1S is also implicated in various cellular signaling pathways, including cytokine signaling, through its interactions with proteins such as SOCS3 (Zou2008The). Alterations in MAP1S expression have been associated with several cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Luo2021Expression).

## Structure
MAP1S is a member of the microtubule-associated protein 1 family, characterized by its unique structure and function. The protein is synthesized as a precursor that undergoes partial cleavage into a heavy chain and a light chain, which together form the MAP1S complex (OrbánNémeth2005Microtubuleassociated; Halpain2006The). The heavy chain is approximately 100 kDa, while the light chain is about 26 kDa (OrbánNémeth2005Microtubuleassociated; Halpain2006The).

The light chain of MAP1S contains a microtubule-binding domain located at the NH2 terminus, spanning amino acids 755-875, which allows it to bind, bundle, and stabilize microtubules (OrbánNémeth2005Microtubuleassociated). The COOH terminus of the light chain, known as the MH3 domain, interacts with actin fibers (OrbánNémeth2005Microtubuleassociated). The heavy chain appears to regulate the activity of the light chain, although its specific role is less defined (OrbánNémeth2005Microtubuleassociated).

MAP1S is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may regulate its interaction with other proteins and its function in microtubule dynamics (TeghaDunghu2014MAP1S). The protein may also have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Halpain2006The).

## Function
MAP1S (microtubule-associated protein 1S) plays a critical role in maintaining microtubule stability throughout the cell cycle in human cells. It is involved in regulating microtubule dynamics, influencing both polymerization and stability during interphase and mitosis. Knockdown of MAP1S results in altered microtubule dynamics, characterized by faster growth but reduced lifetime of microtubules, leading to defects in spindle assembly and delays in mitotic progression (TeghaDunghu2014MAP1S).

MAP1S is also involved in microtubule nucleation and dynamics, particularly during cytokinesis, where its absence leads to fewer and less stable microtubules, affecting cytokinetic processes (TeghaDunghu2014MAP1S). It acts as a cytolinker, cross-linking microtubules and actin, which is crucial for maintaining cellular architecture and function (OrbánNémeth2005Microtubuleassociated).

In addition to its structural roles, MAP1S interacts with suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) to regulate interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, linking SOCS3 to the microtubule cytoskeleton and influencing STAT3 phosphorylation (Zou2008The). This interaction highlights MAP1S's role in cytokine signaling pathways, impacting cellular responses to external stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAP1S gene have been implicated in various cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), lower mRNA transcription levels of MAP1S are observed in cancerous tissues compared to normal specimens. However, higher expression levels of MAP1S are associated with poorer overall survival in NSCLC patients, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Luo2021Expression). In lung adenocarcinoma, MAP1S mRNA expression is significantly increased, yet protein expression is lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal lung tissues, indicating a complex role in tumor biology (Luo2021Expression).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, MAP1S expression is elevated in tumor tissues, correlating with increased autophagy flux. This suggests that MAP1S may play a role in the pathology of pancreatic cancer, potentially through its interaction with the transforming growth factor TGFβ signaling pathway (Song2015Transforming).

In colorectal cancer, MAP1S is targeted and down-regulated by miR-216a, leading to decreased autophagy. This interaction suggests that MAP1S is involved in the regulation of autophagy in colorectal cancer cells, implicating it in the disease's pathogenesis (Wang2019&lt; Overexpression; p&gt). These findings highlight the significance of MAP1S in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
MAP1S interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It specifically binds to microtubules and actin filaments through distinct domains within its structure. The NH2-terminal domain of the MAP1S light chain binds to microtubules, while the COOH-terminal MH3 domain interacts with actin filaments, facilitating its role as a cytolinker that cross-links these cytoskeletal components (OrbánNémeth2005Microtubuleassociated).

MAP1S also interacts with the NMDA receptor subunit NR3A in the brain. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminus of NR3A and has been confirmed through various experimental methods, including yeast two-hybrid screens and coimmunoprecipitation (Eriksson2007The). The interaction suggests a role for MAP1S in stabilizing NR3A-containing receptors at synapses and regulating their movement (Eriksson2007The).

Additionally, MAP1S interacts with the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) protein. This interaction influences the cellular localization of SOCS3 and is crucial for the regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, as MAP1S enhances SOCS3's ability to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation (Zou2008The). MAP1S also selectively binds to double-stranded DNA through its microtubule-binding domain (Zou2008The).
