# SECISBP2L

## Overview
SECISBP2L (SECIS binding protein 2 like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of selenoprotein synthesis, a critical process for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. The protein, categorized as a regulatory factor, interacts with SECIS elements in the 3' untranslated regions of selenoprotein mRNAs, facilitating the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins. This interaction is essential for the translation of selenoproteins, which are vital for antioxidant defense, thyroid hormone metabolism, and cellular redox balance (Kiledjian2022The; Dai2022SECISBP2LMediated). SECISBP2L plays a significant role in the central nervous system, particularly in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin development, by promoting the translation of selenoproteins such as DIO2 (Dai2022SECISBP2LMediated). Additionally, SECISBP2L is implicated in stress response pathways, potentially supporting selenoprotein production when its paralog, SBP2, is limited (Kiledjian2022The). The gene's involvement in various biological processes underscores its importance in health and disease, including its potential role in cancer progression and neurological disorders (Hwang2022Identification; Dai2022SECISBP2LMediated).

## Function
SECISBP2L (SECIS binding protein 2 like) is involved in the regulation of selenoprotein synthesis, a process crucial for various cellular functions. The protein interacts with SECIS elements in the 3' untranslated region of selenoprotein mRNAs, facilitating the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins. This interaction is essential for the translation of selenoproteins, which play significant roles in antioxidant defense and thyroid hormone metabolism (Kiledjian2022The; Dai2022SECISBP2LMediated).

In the central nervous system, SECISBP2L is particularly important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin development. It promotes the translation of the selenoprotein DIO2, which is involved in the conversion of T4 to T3, a thyroid hormone critical for oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination (Dai2022SECISBP2LMediated). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it aids in the translation of selenoproteins, impacting cellular redox balance and metabolic processes (Dai2022SECISBP2LMediated).

SECISBP2L's role extends to stress response pathways, where it may support selenoprotein production under conditions where its paralog, SBP2, is limited. This function is suggested by studies in zebrafish models, indicating a potential role in shifting selenoprotein synthesis to a survival mode during stress (Kiledjian2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the SECISBP2L gene can have significant clinical implications. SECISBP2L is involved in the regulation of selenoprotein synthesis, which is crucial for various biological processes, including thyroid hormone metabolism and oxidative stress response. Disruptions in SECISBP2L expression have been linked to impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin development in the central nervous system. This can lead to conditions such as hypomyelination and motor deficits, as observed in mouse models with conditional knockout of SECISBP2L in oligodendrocyte lineages (Dai2022SECISBP2LMediated).

SECISBP2L has also been associated with cancer progression. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), SECISBP2L mutations have been correlated with overall survival and disease-free survival, although this association was not observed in all patient cohorts (Hwang2022Identification). Additionally, SECISBP2L expression has been linked to lymph node metastasis in ccRCC, suggesting a role in cancer metastasis (Hwang2022Identification).

The gene's involvement in selenoprotein synthesis under stress conditions further indicates its potential protective role against diseases such as lung cancer, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to external stimuli (Kiledjian2022The).

## Interactions
SECISBP2L interacts with selenoprotein mRNAs by binding to SECIS elements, which are crucial for the translation of selenoproteins. This interaction has been demonstrated in brain tissues, where SECISBP2L directly binds to Dio2 and Dio3 mRNAs, enhancing their translation (Dai2022SECISBP2LMediated). The protein also interacts with the selenoprotein-specific elongation factor eEFSec. This interaction is essential for the recoding of UGA into selenocysteine (Sec), a critical step in selenoprotein synthesis. The full-length SECISBP2L is necessary for this interaction, as its C-terminal fragment alone is insufficient to recruit eEFSec (Dai2022SECISBP2LMediated).

In oligodendrocytes, SECISBP2L is involved in the translation of DIO2, a selenoprotein that plays a role in thyroid hormone metabolism. This interaction is part of a pathway that regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin development (Dai2022SECISBP2LMediated). The protein's ability to bind SECIS elements and interact with eEFSec suggests it plays a significant role in the regulation of selenoprotein synthesis, particularly in the central nervous system (Dai2022SECISBP2LMediated).
