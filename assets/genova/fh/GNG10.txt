# GNG10

## Overview
GNG10 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit gamma 10, a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in cellular signal transduction. These proteins play a pivotal role in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors, influencing various cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and metabolism. The G protein subunit gamma 10, categorized as a signaling protein, forms a dimer with beta subunits, which is essential for the functional interaction of G protein alpha subunits with receptors (Hurowitz2000Genomic). Unique among gamma subunits, GNG10 includes coding sequences in exons 1 and 2 without a 5' untranslated exon, and it has an alternative transcript known as DnaJ/Gg10, which may function as a chaperone-like protein due to its DnaJ domain (Yang2006Genomic). GNG10 is implicated in various diseases, including melanoma and glioma, and has been identified as a potential diagnostic marker in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (Cai2021A; CárdenasNavia2010Novel; Qiu2021Identification).

## Structure


## Function
The GNG10 gene encodes the gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are integral to signal transduction processes in cells. These proteins are involved in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism. The gamma subunits, including GNG10, form a tightly linked dimer with beta subunits, which is essential for the functional association of G protein alpha subunits with receptors (Hurowitz2000Genomic). 

GNG10 is unique among G protein γ subunits because it contains coding sequences in exons 1 and 2 without a 5' untranslated exon. An alternative transcript of GNG10, known as DnaJ/Gg10, includes an alternative exon 1 and is expressed in normal tissues. This transcript generates a protein product that does not bind to known Gh subunits in vitro, suggesting it may not form a functional Ghg dimer. Instead, it may generate a chaperone-like protein due to the presence of a DnaJ domain, which is a conserved domain among chaperone proteins (Yang2006Genomic). The full biological significance of this alternative transcript remains unclear.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GNG10 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In melanoma, somatic mutations in GNG10 were identified in approximately 5% of tumors, with specific missense mutations affecting the G protein gamma subunit-like domain, potentially influencing interactions with the G protein beta subunit. These mutations suggest a role for GNG10 in melanoma progression (CárdenasNavia2010Novel). Additionally, GNG10 mutations were observed in 8.75% of melanoma metastases, indicating a potential role in disease progression (Tennakoon2021Subtypedependent).

In glioma, high expression levels of GNG10 are associated with poor prognosis, particularly in patients with specific genetic profiles such as mutated IDH and non-codeleted 1p19q (Cai2021A). GNG10 expression levels have also been correlated with prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and radiotherapy response in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Tennakoon2021Subtypedependent).

In idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), GNG10 has been identified as a hub gene, with significant expression differences between IPAH patients and controls, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker (Qiu2021Identification).

## Interactions
GNG10, or G protein subunit gamma 10, is involved in several protein interactions as part of its role in signal transduction. In its Gβ-bound form, GNG10 undergoes a disorder-to-order transition, forming a tightly bound Gβγ subunit with a highly extended α-helical structure. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of the Gγ subunit, which is otherwise highly disordered when not bound (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

GNG10 has been identified as interacting with the putative magnetoreceptor cryptochrome 4 (ErCry4) in the avian retina. This interaction suggests that GNG10, along with the G t α subunit, may serve as a membrane anchor for ErCry4, potentially facilitating its role in magnetosensory signaling pathways (Wu2020Protein-protein).

Mutations in GNG10, such as p.P8L and p.E52A, have been found in melanoma, potentially affecting its hydrophobic interactions with the G protein beta subunit. These mutations may impact the protein's function and its role in melanoma progression (CárdenasNavia2010Novel). However, specific details on the physical interactions of GNG10 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature.
