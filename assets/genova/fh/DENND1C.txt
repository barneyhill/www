# DENND1C

## Overview
DENND1C is a gene that encodes the DENN domain-containing protein 1C, which is involved in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. The protein is characterized by the presence of a DENN domain, a feature that facilitates its role as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases, which are pivotal in regulating vesicle transport within cells. This regulation is crucial for processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis, which are essential for cellular communication and material exchange. The DENND1C protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing how cells interact with their environment. Additionally, the gene has been associated with various clinical conditions, including cancer and immune-related disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Ma2022A; Gu2023PCSK9; Jones2016Biological).

## Function
DENND1C encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. The protein contains a DENN domain, which is known for its involvement in the activation of Rab GTPases. Rab GTPases are essential regulators of vesicle transport, a process critical for maintaining cellular communication and material exchange. Through its interaction with Rab GTPases, the DENND1C protein is implicated in both endocytosis and exocytosis processes. These processes are vital for the uptake and release of materials in cells, influencing various cellular functions and maintaining homeostasis. The activity of DENND1C in these pathways highlights its importance in the regulation of vesicular trafficking, which is fundamental for the proper functioning of cells. The protein's role in these molecular processes underscores its significance in cell biology, impacting how cells interact with their environment and respond to external signals.

## Clinical Significance
DENND1C has been implicated in various cancers and immune-related conditions due to its role in tumor immune evasion and response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. In melanoma, DENND1C is upregulated in metastatic cases compared to primary tumors, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression and potential as a biomarker for predicting resistance to ICB therapy (Gu2023PCSK9). The gene is part of a set that can stratify responders and non-responders to ICB therapy, indicating its role in tumor immune evasion (Gu2023PCSK9).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), DENND1C is included in a thirteen-gene prognostic signature associated with patient outcomes. This signature, which considers immune cell infiltration, has been shown to be more predictive of LUAD outcomes than other clinical factors (Ma2022A). 

DENND1C is also one of the top hypomethylated genes in keloids, a type of benign fibroproliferative tumor, suggesting a potential role in keloid pathogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms (Jones2016Biological). These findings highlight the gene's significance in cancer and other proliferative disorders.
