# PRKRIP1

## Overview
PRKRIP1, or PRKR interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly RNA splicing and the regulation of protein kinase R (PKR). The protein encoded by PRKRIP1 is integral to the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing, where it stabilizes the active site conformation during the splicing process. It interacts with various components of the spliceosome, including the WD40 domain of Prp17 and the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), to maintain structural integrity and function (Zhang2019Structures). Additionally, PRKRIP1 acts as a negative regulator of PKR, influencing cellular responses to stress, such as apoptosis and protein synthesis inhibition (Codrington2007Exposure). The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including chronic kidney disease, schizophrenia, and bladder cancer (Liu2022The; RodríguezSantiago2009Association; Butte2011Protein).

## Function
PRKRIP1 (PRKR interacting protein 1) is involved in the regulation of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for RNA splicing in human cells. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the active site conformation of the spliceosome during the transition from the C* to the P complex, interacting with the WD40 domain of Prp17, the RNaseH-like domain, and the BPS/U2 duplex (Zhang2019Structures). PRKRIP1 bridges the splicing active site with the core of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), with its N- and C-terminal portions interacting with the BPS/U2 duplex and the U2 snRNA duplex, respectively, thus maintaining the structural integrity and proper function of the spliceosome during the splicing process (Zhang2019Structures).

In addition to its role in RNA splicing, PRKRIP1 is a nuclear protein with high nucleolar expression, acting as a negative regulator of protein kinase R (PKR). This interaction influences processes such as protein synthesis inhibition, apoptosis, cellular transformation, differentiation, and transcription, particularly in response to genotoxic stress (Codrington2007Exposure). PRKRIP1's modulation of PKR activity is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular stress.

## Clinical Significance
PRKRIP1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), PRKRIP1 is a novel target for autoantibodies, with increased levels of anti-PRKRIP1 antibodies observed in CKD patients. This suggests a potential role in kidney damage, although the specific pathogenicity remains unclear (Butte2011Protein). 

In schizophrenia, rare genomic variants involving PRKRIP1 have been identified, suggesting a potential contribution to the disease. These variants were found in patients but not in controls, indicating a possible link between PRKRIP1 alterations and schizophrenia (RodríguezSantiago2009Association).

In bladder cancer, alternative splicing events in PRKRIP1 are associated with high-risk groups, suggesting that PRKRIP1 may play a role in the development or progression of this cancer (Liu2022The). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of PRKRIP1 in various conditions, although further research is needed to fully understand its role and the mechanisms involved.

## Interactions
PRKRIP1 is a protein that plays a significant role in the human spliceosome, particularly within the C* complex. It is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, although its precise function is not fully understood. Structurally, PRKRIP1 consists of an extended N-terminal loop and a long alpha helix, which physically links the catalytic center of the spliceosome with the U2 snRNP at its periphery. The N-terminal portion of the alpha helix and its preceding loop sequences are inserted into a cavity formed by the RNaseH-like domain of Prp8, the U2/BS duplex, and the WD40 repeats of Prp17. The C-terminal portion of PRKRIP1 binds the U2 snRNP, with the C-terminal five turns of the alpha helix placed in the major groove of the U2 snRNA duplex (Zhang2017An).

PRKRIP1's binding to the spliceosome is mutually exclusive with CIR1's binding to the PRP8 RH domain. CIR1 is displaced during the formation of the C* complex, allowing PRKRIP1 to bind at this stage (Bertram2020Structural). PRKRIP1 is also suggested to play a key role in maintaining the active site conformation of the human C* complex (Zhang2017An).
