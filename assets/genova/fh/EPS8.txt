# EPS8

## Overview
EPS8 (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to the actin cytoskeleton and signal transduction. The EPS8 protein is characterized by its involvement in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway, where it acts as a substrate for receptor tyrosine kinases. It plays a critical role in regulating actin dynamics, which is essential for cell shape, movement, and signaling. The protein contains several functional domains, including a phosphotyrosine binding domain, a proline-rich region, and a Src-homology-3 (SH3) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and contribute to its role in cellular activities such as Rac-mediated actin remodeling and EGFR internalization. EPS8 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and congenital deafness, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Luo2021Effects; Behlouli2014EPS8).

## Structure
The EPS8 protein is a multifunctional molecule involved in EGFR signaling and contains several domains that contribute to its function. It includes an N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB), which is a conserved protein-protein interaction domain, and a proline-rich region (PR) that facilitates the formation of the IRSp53/Eps8 complex. The protein also has an EGFR binding region (BR) necessary for binding to the juxtamembrane region of EGFR, enhancing EGF-dependent mitogenic signals. The Src-homology-3 (SH3) domain is another critical component, serving as a ubiquitous interaction module that interacts with proteins like E3b1/Abi-1 and RN-tre, regulating cell growth (Ding2012Human).

The C-terminal effector region of EPS8 interacts with Sos1 and F-actin, and Abi-1 bridges EPS8 and Sos1 to form a tricomplex that induces Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, transducing signals from Ras to Rac and enhancing Rac-dependent actin remodeling (Ding2012Human). EPS8 is subject to post-translational modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation, which is detected in various tumor cell lines, contributing to its role in tumor cell proliferation and invasion (Ding2012Human). The protein also has multiple splice variants, including a short isoform (Eps8-S), which is a proteolytic or alternatively spliced product of the main isoform (Ding2012Human).

## Function
EPS8 (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8) is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is crucial for cell shape, movement, and signaling. It is involved in several key molecular processes, including actin-based movement, membrane flow, pseudopod formation, microvilli morphogenesis, and cell adhesion and motility (Luo2021Effects). EPS8 contains a phosphate binding protein (PTB) region, proline-rich sequences, an SH3 region, and a SAM-PNT domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins and influence cellular activities such as Rac-mediated actin remodeling and Rab5-mediated EGFR internalization (Luo2021Effects).

EPS8 is a substrate for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is involved in EGFR-mediated mitogenic signaling, which is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation (Matoskova1995Constitutive). It is phosphorylated by several receptor tyrosine kinases, leading to actin remodeling and influencing EGFR transduction, cell cycle regulation, and cell proliferation (Luo2021Effects). EPS8 is primarily located in the cytoplasm, nuclear membrane, and around the cell membrane, where it interacts with actin and accumulates in PDGF-induced ruffles (Luo2021Effects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EPS8 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of cancer. EPS8 is overexpressed in numerous malignant tumors, including breast cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), cervical cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), among others. This overexpression is linked to tumor proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance, making EPS8 a potential biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis (&lt; em&gt; Luo2021Effects; EPS8&lt; p&gt; Yang2019&lt).

In glioblastoma, high EPS8 expression correlates with poor overall survival and disease-free survival, suggesting its role as an independent prognostic factor (&lt; em&gt; EPS8&lt; p&gt; Yang2019&lt). In pancreatic cancer, EPS8 interacts with ALDH7A1, stabilizing its protein levels and promoting tumor growth (Tan2021EPS8). In cervical cancer, elevated EPS8 expression is associated with decreased chemosensitivity and poorer survival outcomes, potentially through the down-regulation of p53 and increased activity of prosurvival proteins (Chen2008Eps8).

EPS8 is also implicated in autosomal recessive profound deafness due to its role in cochlear hair cell stereocilia dynamics. A biallelic nonsense mutation in EPS8 can lead to a truncated, inactive protein, resulting in congenital deafness (Behlouli2014EPS8).

## Interactions
EPS8 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in signal transduction and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. It forms a tricomplex with SOS1 and ABI1, which is essential for Rac activation and cytoskeletal recombination. This complex is particularly significant in ovarian cancer metastasis, as it mediates cell migration through the Ras-SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 pathway (Luo2021Effects; Yu2019Inhibitory). EPS8 also interacts with the scaffolding molecule E3b1, facilitating the formation of a complex with SOS1 that displays Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity (Scita2001An).

The effector region of EPS8, spanning amino acids 648-821, binds directly to Sos-1, stimulating Rac-specific, Sos-1-dependent GEF activity. This interaction is E3b1-dependent, as Sos-1 can be recovered in EPS8 immunoprecipitates only when E3b1 is present (Scita2001An). EPS8 also binds to F-actin, directing its localization to actin-containing structures, although it does not exhibit actin-polymerizing activity (Scita2001An).

EPS8 interacts with the SH3 domain of RN-tre, a Rab5 GTPase-activating protein, which is necessary for regulating ligand-dependent endocytosis of EGFR (Lanzetti2000The). These interactions highlight EPS8's role in coordinating receptor signaling and trafficking.
