# ECRG4

## Overview
ECRG4, or esophageal cancer-related gene 4, is a gene that encodes the ECRG4 augurin precursor protein, which is involved in various physiological processes, including tumor suppression, immune response, and cellular signaling. The ECRG4 protein undergoes post-translational modifications to produce several bioactive peptides, such as augurin, which is secreted and functions similarly to growth factors or cytokines (Gonzalez2011Ecrg4; Richter2023Complex). This protein is characterized by its interaction with receptors like LOX-1, playing a role in immune responses and cellular signaling pathways (Moriguchi2018Ecrg4). ECRG4 is notably expressed in the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, where it contributes to homeostasis and stress response regulation (Zhang2023A; Gonzalez2011Ecrg4). Its expression is often downregulated in various cancers, where it acts as a tumor suppressor, and its re-expression can inhibit cell proliferation, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer prognosis and therapy (Götze2009ECRG4; Richter2023Complex).

## Structure
The ECRG4 gene encodes a precursor protein of 148 amino acids, which includes a leader peptide at residues 1-30 that is cleaved during secretion (Gonzalez2011Ecrg4; Moriguchi2018Ecrg4). The primary structure of the ECRG4 protein includes several cleavage sites, such as a putative furin-like cleavage site at amino acids 68-71 and a thrombin cleavage site near the C-terminus at amino acids 130-134 (Richter2023Complex; Moriguchi2018Ecrg4). These sites facilitate the production of various peptides, including augurin (amino acids 31-148), ecilin, and argilin (Gonzalez2011Ecrg4; Richter2023Complex).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including proteolytic processing, which results in the generation of different peptide fragments (Moriguchi2018Ecrg4). Augurin, a major product of ECRG4 processing, is a 14 kDa protein that corresponds to amino acids 31-148 (Gonzalez2011Ecrg4). The protein is secreted and trafficked into dense core granules, a characteristic of peptide hormones, and remains tethered to the surface of epithelial cells after secretion, suggesting a role similar to growth factors or cytokines (Richter2023Complex).

The ECRG4 protein interacts with various receptors, such as LOX-1, through specific binding domains, particularly involving residues 71-132 (Moriguchi2018Ecrg4). This interaction is significant for its role in immune responses and cellular signaling pathways (Moriguchi2018Ecrg4).

## Function
The ECRG4 gene, also known as the ECRG4 augurin precursor, encodes a protein involved in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in maintaining homeostasis and regulating cell proliferation and inflammation. ECRG4 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression often downregulated in many cancer types due to promoter methylation. When overexpressed, it leads to increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation (Zhang2023A; Richter2023Complex).

In the central nervous system (CNS), ECRG4 is highly expressed in the choroid plexus and is involved in neural cell senescence and aging, as well as in the proliferation of neural progenitor cells after injury. It is suggested to maintain CNS homeostasis by inhibiting excessive cell proliferation (Gonzalez2011Ecrg4; Podvin2011Esophageal). ECRG4 is also implicated in the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, influencing stress responses through the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) (Richter2023Complex).

In the cardiovascular system, ECRG4 is involved in regulating heart rhythm and maintaining cardiac homeostasis, suggesting its role in cardiovascular health (Zhang2023A). It is also associated with immune inflammatory reactions, acting as a chemokine that regulates early neutrophil recruitment and subsequent inflammatory decline (Zhang2023A).

## Clinical Significance
The ECRG4 gene, identified as a tumor suppressor, plays a significant role in various cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), breast cancer, colorectal carcinoma, glioma, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Alterations in ECRG4 expression, often due to promoter hypermethylation, are associated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages.

In RCC, high ECRG4 expression correlates with better clinical outcomes, including higher overall survival rates. Low ECRG4 expression is linked to higher histological grades, advanced tumor stages, and distant metastasis, serving as an independent prognostic factor for reduced survival (Luo2015Downregulated).

In breast cancer, ECRG4 downregulation is associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced tumor stages. It serves as an independent prognostic indicator, with higher expression linked to better overall survival (You2015Downregulated; Sabatier2011DownRegulation).

In colorectal carcinoma and glioma, ECRG4 promoter hypermethylation leads to transcriptional silencing, contributing to tumor progression. Re-expression of ECRG4 inhibits cell proliferation, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Götze2009ECRG4).

In ESCC, low ECRG4 expression is associated with more invasive tumors and shorter survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic factor (Mori2007Expression).

## Interactions
ECRG4, also known as augurin, interacts with several proteins and receptors, playing a significant role in various signaling pathways. One of the primary interactions of ECRG4 is with the lectin-like oxidised low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1). ECRG4 binds to the C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) of LOX-1, with a strong binding affinity, as demonstrated by a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 1 × 10^-8 M (Moriguchi2018Ecrg4). This interaction is crucial for the internalization of ECRG4 into cells, although it does not initiate signal transduction (Moriguchi2018Ecrg4).

ECRG4 also interacts with other scavenger receptors such as Scarf1, Cd36, and Stabilin-1, facilitating its internalization and subsequent activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in microglia and macrophages (Moriguchi2018Ecrg4). The C-terminal peptide of ECRG4 interacts with the TLR4/CD14/MD2 complex, indicating its role in inflammatory signaling through the MyD88-NF-κB axis (Moriguchi2018Ecrg4).

In cancer cell lines, ECRG4 overexpression inhibits NF-κB signaling, potentially through the upregulation of nuclear factor 1 C-type (NFIC), which binds to the promoter region of osteoglycin (OGN), leading to decreased NF-κB activity (Richter2023Complex).
