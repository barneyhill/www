# DYNLT4

## Overview
DYNLT4 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein light chain Tctex-type 4, which is a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex. This protein is categorized as a motor protein and is essential for intracellular transport processes. The dynein light chain Tctex-type 4 protein is involved in the movement of organelles, vesicles, and other cellular cargo along microtubules, contributing to the regulation of dynein motor activity and cargo binding. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular organization and facilitating processes such as mitosis and cell division. The activity of DYNLT4 in the cytoplasm is integral to the retrograde transport of cellular components, ensuring proper cellular function and homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
DYNLT4, or dynein light chain Tctex-type 4, is a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, which plays a crucial role in intracellular transport. This protein is involved in the movement of organelles, vesicles, and other cellular cargo along microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cellular organization and function. DYNLT4 contributes to the regulation of dynein motor activity and cargo binding, facilitating the transport processes necessary for various cellular functions, including mitosis and cell division.

In healthy human cells, DYNLT4 is active in the cytoplasm, where it is integral to the proper functioning of the dynein motor complex. This complex is responsible for the retrograde transport of cellular components, moving them from the periphery of the cell towards the nucleus. Such transport is vital for processes like endocytosis, organelle positioning, and the distribution of signaling molecules. By ensuring the correct positioning and movement of cellular components, DYNLT4 helps maintain cellular homeostasis and supports the dynamic changes required during cell division and differentiation. The protein's role in these fundamental processes underscores its importance in cell biology and the overall functioning of the organism.
