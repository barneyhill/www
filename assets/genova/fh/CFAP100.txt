# CFAP100

## Overview
CFAP100 is a gene that encodes the protein cilia and flagella associated protein 100, which is integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella. These hair-like organelles are crucial for cellular motility and sensory functions, playing significant roles in processes such as respiratory fluid movement and sperm motility. The CFAP100 protein is involved in the assembly and stability of axonemes, the core structural components of cilia and flagella, ensuring their proper formation and function. Disruptions in CFAP100 can lead to ciliopathies, a group of disorders characterized by impaired ciliary function, affecting respiratory and reproductive health (Brody2024Loss).

## Function
CFAP100 (cilia and flagella associated protein 100) plays a critical role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for cellular motility and sensory functions. This protein is integral to the assembly and stability of axonemes, the core structural components of cilia and flagella. Axonemes are composed of microtubules arranged in a specific pattern, and CFAP100 contributes to their proper formation and maintenance, ensuring the effective movement and signaling capabilities of these hair-like structures.

In healthy human cells, CFAP100 is active within the ciliary axoneme, where it supports processes such as fluid movement in the respiratory tract and sperm motility. The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal respiratory function and reproductive health. By facilitating the correct assembly of axonemes, CFAP100 ensures that cilia and flagella can perform their roles in moving fluids across epithelial surfaces and propelling sperm cells, respectively. This functionality is crucial for the organismal outcomes of efficient respiratory clearance and successful fertilization. The disruption of CFAP100 function can lead to impaired ciliary and flagellar activity, potentially resulting in clinical conditions related to respiratory and reproductive systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the CFAP100 gene can lead to a group of disorders known as ciliopathies. These conditions arise from dysfunctional cilia, which are essential for various physiological processes. Ciliopathies associated with CFAP100 mutations often manifest as respiratory issues due to impaired mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract. This can result in chronic respiratory infections and reduced lung function. Additionally, CFAP100-related ciliopathies may cause infertility, as cilia and flagella play a crucial role in the motility of sperm and the movement of eggs through the fallopian tubes. Other systemic problems can also occur, given the widespread role of cilia in cellular signaling and tissue homeostasis. The clinical significance of CFAP100 mutations underscores the importance of this gene in maintaining normal ciliary function and highlights the potential for targeted therapies to address the underlying ciliary dysfunction in affected individuals.

## Interactions
CFAP100, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 100, is involved in the structure and function of cilia. While specific physical interactions of CFAP100 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, it is known to be part of the ciliary connectome. During normal cilia assembly, CFAP100 remains in the cytoplasm near basal bodies in the early stages and later enters the cilia along with other connectome proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that CCDC40, a component of the CCDC39/40 heterodimer, can pull down connectome proteins like CFAP100 more effectively at later stages of cilia growth, indicating a potential interaction or association with these proteins during ciliary assembly (Brody2024Loss).

In CCDC39/40 variants, CFAP100 and other connectome proteins remain at the apical domain and are eventually degraded if not bound, suggesting that CFAP100's interaction with the ciliary structure is crucial for its stability and function (Brody2024Loss). Although CFAP100 is not specifically mentioned as a ciliary address recognition protein (CARP), its involvement in the ciliary connectome implies a role in the regulation of ciliary assembly and function (Brody2024Loss).
