# HOXC4

## Overview
The HOXC4 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which is known for encoding transcription factors that play pivotal roles in regulating gene expression during developmental processes. The protein encoded by HOXC4, homeobox C4, is characterized by a conserved homeodomain that facilitates its function as a transcription factor, primarily involved in DNA binding and gene regulation. This protein is crucial in hematopoiesis, where it influences the proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Beyond its developmental roles, HOXC4 has been implicated in various cancers, acting as an oncogene with potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment. Its expression is associated with tumor mutational burden and immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and immune modulation (Xiao2022The; Auvray2012HOXC4).

## Structure
The HOXC4 protein is a member of the homeobox gene family, characterized by a conserved 60-amino acid homeodomain responsible for DNA binding. This homeodomain is a critical component of the protein's primary structure, facilitating its role as a transcription factor (Park2009HoxC4; Luo2020Genomewide). The secondary structure of the homeodomain typically involves alpha helices, which are essential for the protein's ability to interact with DNA (Luo2020Genomewide). 

The tertiary structure of HOXC4 involves the folding of these alpha helices, allowing the protein to effectively bind to DNA and regulate gene expression (Luo2020Genomewide). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in HOX proteins, including HOXC4, and can influence the protein's function and stability (Daga2000The). 

While the context does not provide specific details on the quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms of HOXC4, it is known that the protein contains a YPWM motif, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions, further influencing its regulatory functions (Luo2020Genomewide).

## Function
HOXC4 is a homeobox gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression during hematopoiesis. It plays a crucial role in the expansion and maintenance of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors. HOXC4, similar to its paralog HOXB4, acts as a growth factor that enhances the proliferation of these cells while maintaining their multilineage repopulating ability (Auvray2012HOXC4). The protein is actively transcribed in undifferentiated hematopoietic cells and more mature myeloid and erythroid progenitors, indicating its involvement in the control of normal proliferation in hematopoietic tissues (Daga2000The).

HOXC4 is expressed in human CD34+ cells, and its overexpression leads to a significant expansion of clonogenic units such as CFU-GM, BFU-E, and LTC-IC, with a notable effect on LTC-IC (Daga2000The). The protein is detected in proliferating lymphocytes but not in resting cells, suggesting strong post-transcriptional regulation (Daga2000The). In activated lymphocytes, HOXC4 is involved in regulating genes that control activation and proliferation, with its expression rapidly induced upon activation (Meazza1995Expression). The protein's activity in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA, influences transcriptional activity, contributing to cellular differentiation processes (Meazza1995Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The HOXC4 gene has significant clinical implications in cancer. It is overexpressed in 21 types of cancer, acting as an oncogene, and is associated with poor survival outcomes in patients. High HOXC4 expression correlates with increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI), suggesting its role in mutation-driven tumorigenesis and as a potential marker for immunotherapy outcomes (Xiao2022The). HOXC4 is also linked to DNA methylation and mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations, indicating its involvement in cancer pathogenesis (Xiao2022The).

The gene's expression is significantly associated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, which may contribute to immune escape in cancers. This relationship suggests that HOXC4 could regulate the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and serve as a target for immunotherapy (Xiao2022The). Additionally, HOXC4 expression correlates with responses to various chemotherapeutic drugs, indicating its potential in personalized cancer treatment (Xiao2022The).

In non-cancer contexts, mutations in the HOXC4 gene in mice have been shown to cause esophageal defects and vertebral transformations, highlighting the gene's role in developmental processes (Boulet1996Targeted).

## Interactions
HOXC4, a member of the homeobox gene family, is involved in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The HOXC4 homeo domain can establish specific protein-protein interactions with other members of the HOX gene family, such as HOXD8. This interaction is facilitated by the homeo domain, which is crucial for the specificity of target recognition in vivo (Zappavigna1994Specificity). The amino terminus/helix 1 region of the homeo domain plays a significant role in these interactions, allowing for the transfer of target specificity between different HOX proteins (Zappavigna1994Specificity).

In the context of prostate cancer, HOXC4 shares a significant overlap in DNA binding sites with HOXC6, due to their similar DNA binding domains. This overlap extends to HOXB13, with which HOXC4 shares 37% of its binding sites. These proteins often bind to distal intergenic or intronic regions, far from transcription start sites, and co-bind with other transcription factors like FOXA1 and AR at active enhancers (Luo2020Genomewide). Despite these interactions, specific protein-protein interaction data for HOXC4 in human cells is limited, and future studies are suggested to explore these mechanisms further (Luo2020Genomewide).
