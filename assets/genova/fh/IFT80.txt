# IFT80

## Overview
IFT80 is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 80 (IFT80) protein, which is a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, specifically the IFT-B2 subcomplex. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD-40 repeats and a β-propeller structure, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions within the IFT complex (Taschner2012Architecture; Petriman2022Biochemically). IFT80 is integral to the formation and function of primary cilia, microtubule-based organelles that play a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, including the Hedgehog and Wnt pathways, which are vital for bone and cartilage development (Yuan2015Deletion; Yang2012The). Mutations in the IFT80 gene are linked to skeletal ciliopathies such as Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and short-rib polydactyly syndromes, underscoring its importance in skeletal development and patterning (Rix2011An; Wang2013IFT80).

## Structure
IFT80 is a protein involved in intraflagellar transport, characterized by the presence of WD-40 repeats, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions and are often found in proteins that form multi-protein complexes (Taschner2012Architecture). The WD-40 repeats are located at the C-terminus of the protein, while the N-terminus includes a β-propeller structure (Petriman2022Biochemically). The β-propeller domain of IFT80 interacts with the CH-domain of IFT38, forming a complex that is crucial for its function within the IFT-B complex (Petriman2022Biochemically).

The IFT80 protein is part of the IFT-B2 subcomplex, which includes other proteins such as IFT172, IFT57, IFT54, IFT38, and IFT20, forming a hexameric structure (Taschner2016Intraflagellar). The IFT80 protein is involved in forming a structural platform with other IFT proteins, contributing to the quaternary structure of the IFT-B complex (Petriman2022Biochemically).

A long isoform of IFT80, named IFT80-L, has been identified, which is a fusion of the TRIM59 and IFT80 genes. This isoform includes a RING finger, a B-box, and a coiled-coil motif at the N-terminus, with seven WD-40 repeats at the C-terminus (Huang2008Identification).

## Function
IFT80 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of primary cilia, which are microtubule-based organelles present on the surface of most vertebrate cells. It is a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex B, essential for the anterograde transport of specific cargoes from the base to the tip of cilia, a process vital for axonemal growth and cilia function (Yuan2015Deletion; Yang2012The). In healthy human cells, IFT80 is involved in regulating the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is critical for bone development and osteoblast differentiation. It functions downstream of Smoothened (Smo) and upstream of Gli proteins, regulating the expression of osteoblast marker genes such as BMP2, Runx2, and OCN (Yuan2016Ciliary; Yang2012The).

IFT80 is predominantly expressed in bone tissues and is essential for osteogenesis, as its silencing impairs osteoblast differentiation and mineralization (Yang2012The). It also plays a significant role in chondrocyte differentiation by regulating both the Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for cartilage formation and maintenance (Yuan2015Deletion; Wang2013IFT80). The protein's activity is vital for maintaining the balance between canonical and non-canonical Hh signaling pathways, which are important for normal bone development and cellular homeostasis (Yuan2016Ciliary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT80 gene are associated with several skeletal ciliopathies, including Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) and short-rib polydactyly (SRP) syndromes. These conditions are characterized by skeletal abnormalities such as shortened long bones and a constricted thoracic cage, which can lead to respiratory insufficiency (Rix2011An; Wang2013IFT80). SRP type III, also known as Verma-Naumoff syndrome, is a severe form that often results in perinatal lethality and may include extra-skeletal malformations like cleft lip or palate, cystic renal disease, and cardiac malformations (Cavalcanti2009Mutation; Rix2011An).

The IFT80 gene is crucial for intraflagellar transport, which is essential for cilia formation and function. Mutations in IFT80 disrupt hedgehog signaling, a pathway critical for skeletal development, leading to the phenotypes observed in these syndromes (Rix2011An; Wang2013IFT80). In a murine model, hypomorphic levels of Ift80 result in embryonic lethality and defects in hedgehog signaling without loss or malformation of cilia, indicating its critical role in development (Rix2011An). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its importance in skeletal formation and patterning, with mutations leading to a range of clinical presentations (Cavalcanti2009Mutation; Bizaoui2019Mutations).

## Interactions
IFT80 is a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, specifically part of the IFT-B2 subcomplex. It interacts with several other proteins within this complex, including IFT57, IFT54, IFT38, and IFT20, forming a stable multiprotein assembly essential for ciliary function (Taschner2016Intraflagellar). IFT80 is maintained in the IFT-B2 complex through its association with the IFT57/38 dimer, which binds to IFT172 and IFT80 via its two CH domains (Taschner2016Intraflagellar). The IFT54/20 dimer is also held in the complex by binding to both IFT80 and IFT57/38, indicating a network of interactions that stabilize the IFT-B2 complex (Taschner2016Intraflagellar).

IFT80 does not have documented interactions with nucleic acids, and its interactions are primarily within the IFT-B2 complex. The stability of these interactions is demonstrated by the ability of IFT80 to remain associated with the complex even at high salt concentrations, suggesting strong hydrophobic interactions (Taschner2016Intraflagellar). Additionally, IFT80 is involved in the regulation of signaling pathways, such as the Hedgehog signaling pathway, by influencing the localization and function of proteins like Smoothened (Smo) in cilia (Yuan2016Ciliary).
