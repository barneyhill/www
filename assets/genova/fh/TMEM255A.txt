# TMEM255A

## Overview
TMEM255A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 255A, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is implicated in cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins, notably CTDNEP1. TMEM255A is characterized by its transmembrane alpha helices, which facilitate its role in stabilizing CTDNEP1 by preventing its degradation. The expression of TMEM255A is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, both in its wild-type and mutant forms, indicating a potential role in cellular stress responses and tumorigenesis. The regulatory axis involving p53, TMEM255A, and CTDNEP1 highlights its significance in nuclear lipid regulation and histone behavior, contributing to our understanding of cellular homeostasis and the molecular mechanisms underlying certain diseases (Oikawa2023p53; Oikawa2024p53).

## Structure


## Function


## Interactions
TMEM255A, also known as FAM70A, is involved in interactions with the CTDNEP1 protein. It has been shown to coprecipitate with CTDNEP1, indicating a direct interaction between the two proteins. This interaction is thought to stabilize CTDNEP1 by preventing its degradation, potentially through the formation of a complex involving their transmembrane alpha helices. The stabilization effect of TMEM255A on CTDNEP1 is supported by experiments where inhibition of proteasome activity led to increased levels of both proteins, suggesting that TMEM255A helps protect CTDNEP1 from proteasomal degradation (Oikawa2023p53; Oikawa2024p53).

The expression of TMEM255A is induced by both wild-type and mutant p53, which in turn increases CTDNEP1 protein levels. This suggests a regulatory axis involving p53, TMEM255A, and CTDNEP1, although the increase in CTDNEP1 levels through this pathway is smaller compared to other mechanisms (Oikawa2023p53; Oikawa2024p53). The interaction between TMEM255A and CTDNEP1 is crucial for understanding the role of TMEM255A in cellular processes, particularly in the context of nuclear lipid regulation and histone behavior.
