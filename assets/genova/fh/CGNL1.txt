# CGNL1

## Overview
The CGNL1 gene encodes the cingulin-like 1 protein, which is a crucial component in the regulation of cell junctions, particularly in endothelial and epithelial cells. As a cytoskeletal-associated protein, cingulin-like 1 plays a significant role in angiogenesis and vascular development by stabilizing adherens junctions and promoting the assembly of focal adhesions in response to extracellular matrix interactions (Chrifi2017Cgnl1). In epithelial cells, it is involved in the formation and maintenance of tight junctions, acting as a modulator of RhoA and Rac1 activities, which are essential for cytoskeletal dynamics and cell morphology (Chrifi2017Cgnl1). The protein's interactions with other junctional proteins, such as ZO-1 and p114RhoGEF, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular barrier functions and integrity (Maupérin2023Knock). Alterations in CGNL1 expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and vascular disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yuan2024Role).

## Function
The CGNL1 (cingulin-like 1) gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in endothelial cell function, particularly in angiogenesis and vascular growth. CGNL1 is enriched in endothelial cells during vascular growth and is essential for the formation of stable tubule structures during new vessel formation. It promotes the association of VE-cadherin with the actin cytoskeleton, stabilizing adherens junctions, and is involved in focal adhesion assembly in response to endothelial cell-extracellular matrix contact (Chrifi2017Cgnl1). CGNL1 modulates Rac1 activation, which is vital for integrin-focal adhesion complex assembly, a process important for endothelial cell morphological adaptation during tubule formation (Chrifi2017Cgnl1).

In epithelial cells, CGNL1 is associated with tight junctions and acts as an inhibitor of RhoA activity while activating Rac1 through the GEF Tiam1. This dual role suggests that CGNL1 links intercellular junction assembly to actin cytoskeleton-regulated morphogenesis, key processes in angiogenesis (Chrifi2017Cgnl1). CGNL1 is also involved in the regulation of endothelial cell junctions, interacting with proteins like ZO-1 and p114RhoGEF to stimulate junctional actomyosin activation, ensuring the barrier function of the endothelium (Chrifi2017Cgnl1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CGNL1 gene, which encodes the cingulin-like 1 protein, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and vascular conditions. In pancreatic cancer, the circular RNA derived from CGNL1, known as circCGNL1, is significantly downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with increased tumor growth and poorer overall survival in patients. The circCGNL1 acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting apoptosis through the NUDT4-HDAC4-RUNX2-GAMT pathway, suggesting its potential as a prognostic factor and therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer (Yuan2024Role).

In the context of vascular development, CGNL1 plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular integrity and proper angiogenesis. Silencing of CGNL1 in endothelial cells disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and affects the formation of adherens junctions, leading to impaired vascular network expansion and stability. This suggests that alterations in CGNL1 expression or function could be linked to vascular-related conditions, as it is essential for the stabilization and elongation of newly formed vascular tubules (Chrifi2017Cgnl1). These findings highlight the importance of CGNL1 in both cancer progression and vascular health.

## Interactions
CGNL1, also known as cingulin-like 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for cell junction organization. It forms a complex with MgcRacGAP and cingulin (CGN), which is important for regulating Rac1 activation and the development of tight junction barriers during epithelial junction assembly. The strongest interaction of CGNL1 with MgcRacGAP occurs with the C-terminal two-thirds of the globular head domain and the N-terminal one-third of the coiled-coil rod domain of MgcRacGAP (Guillemot2014MgcRacGAP). CGNL1 also interacts with ZO proteins, such as ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3, which are components of tight junctions, playing a role in maintaining cell polarity and barrier function (Maupérin2023Knock).

In endothelial cells, CGNL1 is associated with the actin cytoskeleton and affects the stability of adherens junctions through Rac1 activation. This interaction is crucial for the formation and survival of the neovasculature (Chrifi2017Cgnl1). CGNL1 also interacts with proteins like ZO-1 and p114RhoGEF, which are involved in junctional actomyosin activation, suggesting its role in maintaining endothelial barrier function (Chrifi2017Cgnl1).
