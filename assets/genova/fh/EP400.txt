# EP400

## Overview
The EP400 gene encodes the E1A binding protein p400, a pivotal component of the SWI2/SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and differentiation. As a chromatin remodeler, E1A binding protein p400 is involved in the regulation of the p53-p21 senescence pathway and is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination. It also plays a significant role in the differentiation and myelination of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. The protein is a part of the TIP60 complex, which is involved in histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling, and interacts with various transcription factors and viral proteins, highlighting its importance in transcription regulation and oncogenesis (Courilleau2012The; Chan2005The; Elsesser2019Chromatin; Cheng2017Merkel).

## Function
The EP400 gene encodes a protein that is a key component of the SWI2/SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, EP400 is involved in the regulation of the p53-p21 senescence pathway. It acts as a chromatin remodeler that interacts with p53 on the p21 promoter, inhibiting p21 transcription and preventing premature senescence. Depletion of EP400 leads to increased p53 binding, elevated p21 expression, and premature senescence, indicating its role in regulating cell cycle progression and senescence (Chan2005The).

EP400 is also crucial for DNA repair, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination. It facilitates the formation of Rad51 foci, essential for the homologous recombination process, and interacts with Rad51 to form a complex necessary for efficient DNA repair (Courilleau2012The).

In the context of oligodendrocyte development, EP400 is vital for the differentiation and myelination processes in the central nervous system. It interacts with transcription factors like Sox10 to activate Myrf expression, which is crucial for myelination, and is involved in chromatin changes necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation (Elsesser2019Chromatin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EP400 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably schizophrenia and peripheral neuropathy. A study by Morimoto et al. identified a unique missense variant, rs200626129, in the EP400 gene within a Japanese family with autosomal dominant schizophrenia. This variant was associated with severe negative symptoms and low Global Assessment of Functioning Scale scores. Functional analyses suggested that this variant may cause protein dysfunction, contributing to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, broader case-control studies did not find a statistically significant association between EP400 variants and schizophrenia, indicating the complexity of its role in the disease (Morimoto2021A).

In peripheral neuropathy, particularly Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, EP400 is crucial for Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. Deficiency in EP400 leads to the persistent expression of early developmental regulators, resulting in aberrant gene expression and chromatin modifications. This disruption is linked to peripheral neuropathy, as evidenced by increased macrophage proliferation and myelin abnormalities in Ep400-deficient mice (Fröb2019Ep400).

EP400 also plays a role in cancer, where its mutations are mutually exclusive with those in the SWI/SNF complex, suggesting a compensatory relationship. This interaction is significant in non-small cell lung cancer, where targeting the dependency between EP400 and SWI/SNF could offer therapeutic potential (Martin2023Global).

## Interactions
EP400, also known as E1A binding protein p400, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. EP400 is a component of the TIP60 complex, which is involved in histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling. It interacts with TRRAP, KAT5, and other components within this complex (Cheng2017Merkel). EP400 also forms part of a complex with MYCL and the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) small T antigen (ST), which binds to actively transcribed promoters, playing a role in oncogenesis (Cheng2017Merkel).

EP400 interacts with the transcription factor Sox10, particularly involving the HMG domain of Sox10 and the HSA and SANT domains of EP400, which facilitates the activation of Myrf expression during oligodendrocyte differentiation (Elsesser2019Chromatin). It also interacts with the adenovirus E1A protein, which targets EP400 to induce the cellular oncoprotein Myc, promoting Myc's transcriptional activity and stability (Tworkowski2008Adenovirus). Additionally, EP400 is part of the NuA4/TIP60 histone acetylase complex, interacting with the papillomavirus E2 protein to repress HPV oncogenes (Smith2010Genomewide). These interactions highlight EP400's role in regulating gene expression and its involvement in various cellular processes.
