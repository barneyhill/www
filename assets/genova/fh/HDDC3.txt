# HDDC3

## Overview
HDDC3, or HD domain containing 3, is a gene that encodes a protein known for its enzymatic role as a hydrolase, specifically targeting the signaling molecule guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp). This protein, also referred to as MESH1, is a metazoan ortholog of the bacterial SpoT protein and is characterized by a conserved His-Asp-box motif essential for its function, coordinated by a Mn2+ ion (Sun2010A). HDDC3 is implicated in various biological processes, including the cellular response to starvation and ischemic stroke, where it may play a role in autophagy and neuronal protection (Liu2023Exploring). Additionally, HDDC3 has been identified as part of the cereblon interactome, suggesting potential involvement in protein-protein interactions relevant to multiple myeloma treatment (Zhu2014Identification). The gene's expression and regulation are of clinical interest, particularly in the context of ischemic stroke, where it is considered a feature gene in predictive models for disease risk (Liu2023Exploring).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The HDDC3 gene has been implicated in the regulation of ischemic stroke (IS) through its involvement in processes such as autophagy, DNA repair, and mitochondrial repair. Alterations in the expression of HDDC3 are associated with the occurrence, development, and prognosis of IS. The gene is part of a group of 13 genes with significant differential expression between normal and IS samples, suggesting its potential clinical significance in IS. These genes, including HDDC3, are primarily upregulated in IS, indicating a positive regulatory relationship and potential synergistic effects in the condition (Liu2023Exploring).

HDDC3 is also highlighted as a feature gene in predictive models for IS risk, suggesting its importance in understanding the genetic basis of IS and developing predictive models for IS risk (Liu2023Exploring). The gene's role in the starvation response, which protects neurons, further underscores its relevance in IS pathophysiology (Liu2023Exploring). Additionally, HDDC3 has been identified as a cereblon-binding protein, which may have implications in multiple myeloma treatment, although specific clinical outcomes related to HDDC3 in this context are not detailed (Zhu2014Identification).

## Interactions
HDDC3, also known as MESH1, is involved in various protein interactions, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed. The study by Zhu et al. identified HDDC3 as one of the proteins detected in cereblon (CRBN) immunoprecipitates, suggesting an interaction with CRBN. This interaction was observed in CRBN overexpressing cells, indicating a potential role in the CRBN interactome (Zhu2014Identification).

HDDC3, as a metazoan ortholog of the bacterial SpoT protein, is known for its enzymatic activity in hydrolyzing ppGpp, a signaling molecule involved in bacterial stress responses. This activity is specific to ppGpp and does not extend to other nucleotides, highlighting its substrate specificity (Sun2010A). The protein's structure includes a conserved His-Asp-box motif necessary for its hydrolase activity, which is coordinated by a Mn2+ ion (Sun2010A).

In the context of ischemic stroke, HDDC3 is noted for its role in the starvation response, potentially involving autophagy and neuronal protection. However, specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Liu2023Exploring).
