# MRFAP1L1

## Overview
MRFAP1L1, or Morf4 family associated protein 1 like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling. The protein, also named MRFAP1L1, is part of the Morf4 family, which is recognized for its role in modulating gene expression. Predominantly active in the nucleus, MRFAP1L1 influences cell cycle progression and differentiation, with potential implications in processes such as spermatogenesis and erythropoiesis (Dimas2012Sexbiased; MerryweatherClarke2016Distinct). Additionally, MRFAP1L1 has been identified as a host protein interacting with the chikungunya virus, suggesting its involvement in cellular responses to viral infections (Bouraï2012Mapping). The protein's interactions and co-expression patterns indicate its significance in maintaining specific protein-protein interactions within cellular networks (Camargo2007Linking).

## Function
MRFAP1L1 (Morf4 family associated protein 1 like 1) is involved in several cellular processes, primarily focusing on transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling. This protein is part of the Morf4 family, which is known for its role in modulating gene expression. MRFAP1L1 is typically active in the nucleus, where it influences cell cycle progression and differentiation. 

In the context of gene regulation, MRFAP1L1 has been identified as having a potential role in spermatogenesis, particularly through its interaction with TSNAX, as observed in a study focusing on sex-biased genetic effects on gene regulation (Dimas2012Sexbiased). Additionally, MRFAP1L1 is suggested to play a role in erythropoiesis regulation, as it co-clusters with KLF1 in gene expression studies, indicating its involvement in the regulation of erythroid cell development (MerryweatherClarke2016Distinct).

MRFAP1L1 has also been identified as a host protein interacting with the chikungunya virus non-structural protein 2 (nsP2), although the specific function of MRFAP1L1 in healthy human cells in this context is not detailed (Bouraï2012Mapping). These interactions suggest that MRFAP1L1 may have diverse roles in cellular processes and responses to external stimuli.

## Interactions
MRFAP1L1 (Morf4 family associated protein 1 like 1) has been identified as interacting with the chikungunya virus protein nsP2. This interaction was discovered using a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (HT-Y2H) system and validated through a protein-binding assay based on luciferase complementation. The assay demonstrated that MRFAP1L1 interacts with the nsP2 fragment 606-798, with a normalized luminescence ratio (NLR) value higher than the threshold of 3.5, indicating a positive interaction (Bouraï2012Mapping).

In the context of human heart failure, MRFAP1L1 is categorized as a network peripheral-A, showing a significant co-expression level of 100% with its interacting partners. This suggests that MRFAP1L1 may have strong co-expression with its interacting partners, which contrasts with the weaker co-expression observed in network hubs and superhubs. This finding highlights the potential importance of MRFAP1L1 in maintaining specific protein-protein interactions within the network (Camargo2007Linking).

While MRFAP1L1 is mentioned in other studies, specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in those contexts (Pirklbauer2019Unraveling).
