# FAM90A19

## Overview
FAM90A19 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, specifically member A19. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by shared sequence motifs, which may suggest functional similarities or evolutionary relationships among its members. While the precise biological role of FAM90A19 remains to be fully elucidated, proteins in this family are often involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and regulation of gene expression. The study of FAM90A19 and its encoded protein could provide insights into its potential involvement in cellular pathways and its implications in health and disease. Further research is necessary to determine the specific functions and interactions of FAM90A19 within the cellular context.
