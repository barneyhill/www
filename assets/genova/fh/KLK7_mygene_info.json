These enzymes have diverse physiological functions and many kallikrein genes are biomarkers for cancer. The encoded protein has chymotrypsin-like activity and plays a role in the proteolysis of intercellular cohesive structures that precedes desquamation, the shedding of the outermost layer of the epidermis. The encoded protein may play a role in cancer invasion and metastasis, and increased expression of this gene is associated with unfavorable prognosis and progression of several types of cancer. Polymorphisms in this gene may play a role in the development of atopic dermatitis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene, which is one of fifteen kallikrein subfamily members located in a gene cluster on chromosome 19.
