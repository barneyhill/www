# HEMK1

## Overview
HEMK1 is a gene that encodes the HemK methyltransferase family member 1 protein, which is a methyltransferase enzyme involved in post-translational modification processes. This protein plays a critical role in the methylation of target molecules, a modification that can significantly impact protein function, stability, and interactions. As a methyltransferase, HemK methyltransferase family member 1 is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, protein synthesis, and cellular signaling pathways. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular functions. Its activity is essential for cellular growth and differentiation, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the proper functioning of healthy human cells (Rhein2017Human; Freitas2023Gene).

## Structure


## Function
HEMK1 (HemK methyltransferase family member 1) encodes a protein that functions as a methyltransferase, which is crucial for post-translational modification processes, specifically methylation. This protein catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to target molecules, a modification that can significantly influence protein function, stability, and interactions. Methylation is a key regulatory mechanism in cells, affecting various biological processes such as gene expression, protein synthesis, and cellular signaling pathways.

HEMK1 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of cells, indicating its involvement in multiple cellular compartments and processes. In the cytoplasm, it plays a role in protein synthesis, where methylation can impact the translation process and the maturation of newly synthesized proteins. In the nucleus, HEMK1 may influence gene expression by modifying histones or other nuclear proteins, thereby affecting chromatin structure and accessibility.

The activity of HEMK1 is essential for cellular growth and differentiation, as these processes rely on precise regulation of protein function and gene expression. By modulating these molecular activities, HEMK1 contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the proper functioning of healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The HEMK1 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions through mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In familial intracranial aneurysms, a variant of HEMK1, specifically p.V68M, was identified in a study involving a First Nation population from Northern British Columbia. Although this variant was present in all affected individuals, its biological relevance to aneurysms remains unclear, necessitating further research to determine its significance (newman2021investigating).

In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), HEMK1 has been identified as a biomarker for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A study demonstrated that HEMK1, along with other genes, could predict pCR with high accuracy, suggesting its potential role in treatment response (Freitas2023Gene).

Additionally, a case study involving a patient with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and hyper IgE phenotype highlighted a microdeletion in the 3p21.31 region, which includes HEMK1. This deletion is associated with intellectual disability and developmental delay, indicating a potential link between HEMK1 and these conditions (Zechi‐Ceide2012Saethre–Chotzen). However, specific diseases directly caused by HEMK1 mutations or expression changes are not extensively detailed in the available literature.

## Interactions
HEMK1, a member of the HemK methyltransferase family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions. It is known to methylate a glutamine residue in the mitochondrial translation release factor MTRF1L, indicating its role in post-translational modification processes within mitochondria (Rhein2017Human). HEMK1 has also been identified as a primary interaction partner of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) ORF1 polypeptide, suggesting its involvement in host-virus interactions (Subramani2018HostVirus). However, specific details on the physical interactions of HEMK1 with other proteins or nucleic acids in these contexts are not provided.

In the context of protein-protein docking studies, HEMK1's interaction with the bacterial polypeptide release factor eRF1 has been explored. The HemK protein is involved in the methylation of a glutamine side chain at a specific target sequence (GGQ-motif) of polypeptide release factors, which modulates peptide chain release activity (May2007Protein–protein). Despite these findings, the precise nature of HEMK1's interactions in multiprotein complexes or its role in activating or inhibitory interactions remains to be fully elucidated.
