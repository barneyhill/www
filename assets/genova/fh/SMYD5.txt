# SMYD5

## Overview
SMYD5 is a gene that encodes the protein SMYD family member 5, a lysine methyltransferase involved in various cellular processes, including epigenetic regulation and mitochondrial function. As a member of the SMYD protein family, SMYD5 is distinguished by its unique structural features, such as the absence of the tetratricopeptide repeat-like C-terminal domain and the presence of a poly-glutamic acid tract and a novel SMI subdomain. These structural characteristics contribute to its distinctive 'crab-like' shape, which facilitates interactions with basic molecules like protamines and histones (Zhang2022Unique). Functionally, SMYD5 plays a critical role in chromatin remodeling by methylating histones, thereby influencing gene expression and chromatin structure. It also modulates mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular stress responses, impacting oxidative stress and apoptosis (Padilla2023Targeting; Hou2020Methyltransferase). Clinically, alterations in SMYD5 expression are linked to inflammatory bowel disease and various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Miao2024SMYD5; Hou2020Methyltransferase).

## Structure
SMYD5 is a unique member of the SMYD protein family, characterized by distinct structural features. It lacks the conserved tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like C-terminal domain (CTD) found in other SMYD proteins, which is typically involved in substrate binding (Zhang2022Unique). Instead, SMYD5 has a poly-glutamic acid tract at the C-terminus and a novel subdomain called SMI, which contributes to a large, negatively charged cleft that may bind basic molecules like protamines and histones (Zhang2022Unique). 

The protein's structure is described as resembling a 'crab' with two large 'legs' formed by unique insertions in the SET and MYND domains (Zhang2022Unique). The MYND domain in SMYD5 is less positively charged and includes a unique M-insertion, which forms three helices protruding from the core without significant intramolecular interactions (Zhang2022Unique). 

SMYD5 also features a non-classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) at its N-terminus, which is hydrophobic and forms a helix-turn-helix structure (Zhang2022Unique). The SET domain, crucial for its methyltransferase activity, includes a conserved S-sequence and a core-SET domain with unique insertions that affect the substrate binding cleft (Zhang2022Unique).

## Function
SMYD5 is a lysine methyltransferase involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in epigenetic regulation by methylating histones, particularly histone H3 on lysine residues 36 or 37, and histone H4, influencing gene expression and chromatin structure (Padilla2023Targeting; Zhang2022Unique). SMYD5 is also involved in the repression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) responses through the trimethylation of H4K20, which is crucial for regulating immune responses (Padilla2023Targeting).

In addition to its role in chromatin remodeling, SMYD5 is implicated in mitochondrial function and cellular stress responses. It modulates mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, potentially through the regulation of PGC-1α protein levels, which affects oxidative stress and apoptosis in cells (Hou2020Methyltransferase). SMYD5 also influences ribosomal function by catalyzing the methylation of lysine 22 on the ribosomal protein RPL40, enhancing translation output and protein synthesis efficiency (Miao2024SMYD5).

SMYD5 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with ribosomal components, but it also has nuclear functions related to chromatin and transcriptional regulation (Miao2024SMYD5; Zhang2022Unique). These activities are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SMYD5 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and various cancers. In the context of IBD, SMYD5 is upregulated in colonic epithelial cells of patients, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis. The gene negatively regulates PGC-1α, a transcriptional co-activator crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Overexpression of SMYD5 leads to decreased PGC-1α levels, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in the intestinal epithelium, which may exacerbate IBD symptoms (Hou2020Methyltransferase).

In cancer, SMYD5 is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through its role as a ribosomal methyltransferase. It catalyzes the methylation of RPL40, enhancing translation output and promoting tumorigenesis. Loss of SMYD5 sensitizes cancer cells to mTOR pathway inhibitors, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC (Miao2024SMYD5). Additionally, SMYD5 is overexpressed in esophageal carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma, correlating with poor prognosis and immune checkpoint regulation, indicating its role in cancer progression and potential as a target for immunotherapy (Liu2021Comprehensive).

## Interactions
SMYD5 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. It is involved in the basal repression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) responses through the trimethylation of H4K20, interacting with nuclear receptor NCoR corepressor complexes (Padilla2023Targeting). SMYD5 also interacts with chromatin repressor heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), affecting methyltransferase activity at H3K9 (Padilla2023Targeting).

In terms of structural interactions, SMYD5 has a unique 'crab-like' structure with negatively charged 'legs' formed by the poly-glutamic acid tract and insertions from the MYND and SET domains. This structure suggests potential binding sites for basic molecules such as protamines and histones, which are known to interact with SMYD5 (Zhang2022Unique). The MYND domain of SMYD5, although less positively charged than in other SMYD proteins, interacts with proline-rich sequences containing the PXLXP motif, similar to SMYD3 (Zhang2022Unique).

SMYD5 also interacts with protamine, an arginine-rich protein, enhancing its thermal stability. This interaction is specific to SMYD5, as protamine destabilizes the closely related SMYD2 (Zhang2021Sperm).
