# MEAF6

## Overview
MEAF6, or MYST/Esa1 associated factor 6, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. The protein is a non-catalytic component of several histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, including the TIP60-ING3, HBO1-ING4/5, and MOZ/MORF complexes, which are part of the MYST family. These complexes play crucial roles in nuclear acetylation, influencing gene-specific transcription regulation, DNA damage response, and DNA replication (Matsuura2020MEAF6; Micci2014MEAF6PHF1). MEAF6 is essential for the proper assembly of these complexes, although it does not directly contribute to their enzymatic activity (Matsuura2020MEAF6). The protein's interactions with PHD-finger proteins and its involvement in chromatin modification underscore its significance in cellular processes and its potential implications in oncogenesis (Matsuura2020MEAF6; Antonescu2013Novel).

## Function
The MEAF6 gene encodes a protein that is a component of several histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, including the TIP60-ING3, HBO1-ING4/5, and MOZ/MORF complexes, which belong to the MYST family. These complexes are involved in nuclear acetylation, playing critical roles in gene-specific transcription regulation, DNA damage response and repair, and DNA replication (Micci2014MEAF6PHF1). MEAF6 is a non-catalytic subunit that contributes to the assembly of the Myst2/Kat7 complex, which is involved in the acetylation of histones H3 and H4, although it is not essential for the HAT activity itself (Matsuura2020MEAF6). 

In healthy cells, MEAF6 is crucial for cell proliferation, as its absence leads to altered assembly of the Myst2/Kat7 complex and a proliferation defect independent of HAT activity (Matsuura2020MEAF6). MEAF6 also interacts with PHD-finger proteins in these complexes, influencing their assembly and function (Matsuura2020MEAF6). Additionally, MEAF6 is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, contributing to processes like DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Antonescu2013Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the MEAF6 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly through gene fusions. In endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS), a rare uterine cancer, MEAF6 is involved in novel gene fusions such as MEAF6-SUZ12 and MEAF6-PHF1. The MEAF6-SUZ12 fusion was identified in a case of low-grade ESS, expanding the molecular landscape of this tumor type (Makise2019Lowgrade). The MEAF6-PHF1 fusion, resulting from a chromosomal translocation t(1;6)(p34;p21), has been observed in both endometrial stromal nodules and low-grade ESS, suggesting a genetic overlap between these conditions (Nomura2020Detection; Panagopoulos2012Novel).

In ossifying fibromyxoid tumors (OFMTs), another rare tumor type, the MEAF6-PHF1 fusion has been identified, indicating a potential shared pathogenesis with ESS. This fusion involves MEAF6 exon 5 and PHF1 exon 2, and its presence in both OFMTs and ESS suggests a role in tumor development through chromatin structure modification and gene expression changes (Antonescu2013Novel).

In prostate cancer, alternative splicing of MEAF6, particularly the MEAF6-1 variant, has been associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to tumor progression (lee2019multifaceted).

## Interactions
MEAF6 (MYST/Esa1 associated factor 6) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily as a component of multiprotein complexes. It is a part of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, including the NuA4/Tip60 complex, where it plays a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Matsuura2020MEAF6; Antonescu2013Novel). MEAF6 interacts with PHD-finger proteins such as Jade1 and Brpf3 within the Myst2/Kat7 complex, where it negatively regulates their interaction (Matsuura2020MEAF6). It also forms tetrameric complexes with KAT6A, BRPF1, and ING4 or ING5, which are involved in histone propionylation, a process relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Yan2020Deficient).

In the context of endometrial stromal sarcoma, MEAF6 is known to fuse with PHF1, resulting in a chimeric protein that may misdirect HAT activity, potentially leading to aberrant gene expression (Antonescu2013Novel; Panagopoulos2012Novel). This fusion involves the histone acetyltransferase subunit NuA4 domain of MEAF6 and the tudor, PHD zinc finger, and MTF2 domains of PHF1 (Panagopoulos2012Novel). These interactions highlight MEAF6's role in chromatin modification and its potential implications in oncogenesis.
