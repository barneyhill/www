# FIG4

## Overview
The FIG4 gene encodes the FIG4 phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase, a crucial enzyme involved in the regulation of phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2). This enzyme is categorized as a phosphoinositide phosphatase and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as membrane trafficking, autophagy, and the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. The FIG4 protein forms a complex with other proteins, including VAC14 and PIKfyve, which is essential for the synthesis and turnover of PI(3,5)P2, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and neuronal function (Chow2009Deleterious; McCartney2013Phosphatidylinositol). Mutations in the FIG4 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, underscoring its importance in neuronal health (Chow2009Deleterious; Zimmermann2020FIG4).

## Structure
The FIG4 protein is a phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase involved in the regulation of phosphoinositides, specifically PI(3,5)P2. Its structure includes a SAC domain, which is crucial for its phosphatase activity (Chow2009Deleterious). The FIG4 protein interacts with other proteins such as VAC14 and FAB1, forming a complex that is essential for its stability and function (Lenk2011Pathogenic). The I41T mutation in FIG4, located near the surface of the non-catalytic domain in a hydrophobic pocket between two beta-sheets, affects protein-protein interactions by destabilizing the SacN domain, although it does not impact the enzymatic activity of the protein (Lenk2011Pathogenic).

The FIG4 protein's structure has been predicted by superimposing it with the crystal structure of Sac1p, a related lipid phosphatase, suggesting similarities in their structural folds (Lenk2011Pathogenic). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and interactions. FIG4 also has multiple splice variants, which may affect its function and localization within the cell (Chow2009Deleterious). The interaction with VAC14 is particularly important for maintaining the stability of the FIG4 protein, as mutations that disrupt this interaction can lead to neurodegenerative diseases (Lenk2011Pathogenic).

## Function
The FIG4 gene encodes a phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), a signaling lipid involved in various cellular processes. FIG4 is part of a protein complex with Vac14 and PIKfyve, which is responsible for the synthesis and turnover of PI(3,5)P2. This complex is essential for maintaining proper levels of PI(3,5)P2, which is critical for endosomal-lysosomal trafficking and cellular homeostasis (McCartney2013Phosphatidylinositol).

In healthy human cells, FIG4 is involved in the regulation of membrane trafficking, autophagy, and the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. It is particularly active in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain neuronal function and structure. The protein's activity is crucial for the retrograde trafficking of endosomal vesicles to the trans-Golgi network, a process vital for normal cellular operations (Chow2009Deleterious).

Mutations in FIG4 can lead to significant neurological diseases, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting its importance in neuronal health and function (Chow2009Deleterious; McCartney2013Phosphatidylinositol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FIG4 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J (CMT4J) and Yunis-Varón syndrome. CMT4J is an autosomal recessive neuropathy characterized by severe demyelination and axonal loss, affecting both motor and sensory nerves. Patients with CMT4J typically have compound heterozygous mutations, including one missense and one loss-of-function mutation, with the I41T allele being a common missense mutation that destabilizes FIG4 enzymatic activity (Vaccari2014Loss; Zimmermann2020FIG4). The I41T mutation impairs the interaction of FIG4 with the scaffold protein VAC14, leading to protein instability and reduced levels of FIG4 protein, which is crucial for the stability of the PI(3,5)P2 biosynthetic complex involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking and fusion (Lenk2011Pathogenic).

Yunis-Varón syndrome results from two null alleles in FIG4 and is characterized by severe central nervous system involvement, cleidocranial dysmorphism, absent thumbs and halluces, and early death (Zimmermann2020FIG4). FIG4 mutations have also been identified in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), with heterozygosity for a deleterious allele of FIG4 appearing to be a risk factor for these conditions (Chow2009Deleterious). The phenotypic variability in FIG4-related diseases is attributed to minimal residual FIG4 protein and other genetic factors (Zimmermann2020FIG4).

## Interactions
The FIG4 phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase protein is involved in several specific protein interactions. It interacts with the KIF5A protein, a neuronal kinesin heavy chain, through their respective C-terminal regions. This interaction is specific to KIF5A and does not occur with other kinesin heavy chains like KIF5B, KIF5C, or kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1). The interaction was identified using yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed through various assays, suggesting a role in transporting FIG4-associated protein complexes within cells (Jang2014PtdIns(3).

FIG4 is also part of a complex involved in the synthesis and turnover of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) in yeast, interacting with proteins such as Fab1, Vac14, and Vac7. FIG4 binds to Vac14 through a conserved C-terminal region, and this interaction is crucial for the activation of Fab1/PIKfyve. Mutations in FIG4 can disrupt these interactions, affecting PI(3,5)P2 turnover and response to stress (McCartney2013Phosphatidylinositol). In mammals, a similar complex is formed with PIKfyve and Sac3, the mammalian homolog of FIG4, indicating conserved interaction sites (McCartney2013Phosphatidylinositol).
