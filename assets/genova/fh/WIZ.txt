# WIZ

## Overview
The WIZ gene encodes the WIZ zinc finger protein, which is a critical component in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. This protein is characterized by its multiple C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as the G9a and GLP histone methyltransferases, to mediate transcriptional repression through histone methylation (Ueda2006Zinc; Simon2015A). WIZ also plays a significant role in the structuring of DNA loops by forming complexes with CTCF and cohesin, which are essential for maintaining proper gene expression and cell identity (Justice2020A). The gene's expression is crucial for normal embryonic development, and its dysfunction is associated with developmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Bukova2021Loss; Kuk2022Prognostic).

## Structure
The WIZ protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, specifically the C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which are widely spaced with intervals ranging from 16 to 263 amino acids in humans (Simon2015A). WIZ contains six Kruppel (C2H2)-type zinc finger motifs, with the ZF6 domain being crucial for interactions with G9a and GLP histone methyltransferases (Ueda2006Zinc). These zinc finger motifs are involved in binding specific DNA sequences, facilitating the targeting of the G9a/GLP complex to chromatin for transcriptional repression (Bian2015The).

The protein also contains two CtBP interaction domains (CID) near its ZF3 and ZF4 domains, which are important for binding with transcriptional co-repressors CtBP1 and CtBP2 (Ueda2006Zinc). The presence of these domains suggests a role in linking the G9a/GLP complex to other functional molecules (Ueda2006Zinc).

WIZ is expressed in various tissues, indicating the presence of different isoforms, as detected by specific antibodies in mouse and human cell lines (Ueda2006Zinc). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in chromatin retention and gene repression (Simon2015A).

## Function
The WIZ gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. WIZ is involved in the structuring of DNA loops, which is essential for the proper regulation of gene expression and maintenance of cell identity. It forms a complex with CTCF and cohesin, proteins that are integral to DNA loop architecture across the mammalian genome. This complex is important for transcriptional insulation at DNA loops, particularly within insulated neighborhoods containing super-enhancers, which often encode master transcription factors and other regulators of cell identity (Justice2020A).

WIZ also regulates cohesin distribution on chromatin, influencing DNA loop architecture. Its deletion leads to ectopic cohesin peaks and altered DNA loop structures, affecting the expression of genes responsible for stem cell identity and pluripotency (Justice2020A). Additionally, WIZ is part of the G9a-GLP-WIZ complex, which is involved in histone methylation, specifically the methylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 (H3K9), a modification associated with transcriptional repression (Ueda2006Zinc; Simon2015A). WIZ stabilizes the G9a/GLP complex, linking it to transcriptional co-repressors and playing a role in maintaining chromatin structure and gene repression (Ueda2006Zinc).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the WIZ gene have been implicated in several developmental and pathological conditions. In embryonic development, particularly in craniofacial development and palatogenesis, the loss of WIZ function leads to significant defects such as cleft palate and cleft eyelids. This is due to the disruption of the WIZ-dependent G9a-GLP methylation complex, which is crucial for the fusion of palatal shelves during palate development. WIZ knockout mice exhibit subviability during embryonic development and are non-viable after birth, highlighting the gene's critical role in these processes (Bukova2021Loss).

In the context of cancer, WIZ has been identified as a potential prognostic marker in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Mutations in WIZ are notably co-occurring in low-stage OSCC, suggesting its role in the early stages of this cancer type. The study of genetic heterogeneity in OSCC indicates that WIZ, along with other genes, could serve as a marker for prognosis and treatment stratification (Kuk2022Prognostic).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of WIZ in both developmental abnormalities and cancer, suggesting that alterations in WIZ function or expression can have profound effects on health and disease.

## Interactions
The WIZ protein, encoded by the WIZ gene, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. WIZ interacts with the G9a and GLP histone methyltransferases, forming a complex that is crucial for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9). This interaction is mediated through the zinc finger domains of WIZ, specifically the ZF6 domain, which binds to the SET domains of G9a and GLP (Ueda2006Zinc; Simon2015A). WIZ also plays a role in stabilizing the G9a protein on chromatin, as its knockdown leads to reduced G9a levels and decreased H3K9 methylation (Simon2015A).

In addition to its role with G9a and GLP, WIZ forms a complex with CTCF and the cohesin complex, which is involved in DNA loop architecture and gene expression regulation. This interaction is independent of DNA and RNA, suggesting a direct or indirect physical interaction. WIZ and CTCF co-occupy chromatin sites, influencing cohesin occupancy and potentially affecting gene expression and cell identity (Justice2020A). These interactions highlight WIZ's role in both transcriptional repression and the maintenance of chromatin structure.
