# HLA-DPB1

## Overview
HLA-DPB1 is a gene that encodes a protein component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, specifically the DP beta 1 chain. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by presenting extracellular antigenic peptides to CD4+ T lymphocytes, thereby initiating immune responses. The HLA-DPB1 gene is highly polymorphic, which contributes to its ability to bind a diverse array of peptides, a feature critical for effective immune surveillance. The protein is primarily expressed in antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and is involved in various immune interactions, including those with pathogens and allergens. Its polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to certain diseases, such as chronic beryllium disease and atopic dermatitis, highlighting its clinical significance in immune-related conditions (Silveira2012Chronic; Margolis2023A; Diaz2003Functional).

## Structure
The HLA-DPB1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which play a crucial role in the immune response. The protein is composed of an alpha and a beta chain, with the beta chain encoded by the HLA-DPB1 gene. The structure of HLA-DPB1 includes an antigen-binding groove formed by the alpha and beta chains, which is essential for peptide binding and T cell recognition (Silveira2012Chronic; Diaz2003Functional).

The secondary structure of the HLA-DPB1 protein features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its compact tertiary structure. The quaternary structure involves the dimerization of the alpha and beta chains, forming a functional MHC class II molecule (Silveira2012Chronic). The antigen-binding groove is characterized by specific pockets that interact with peptide residues, influencing the binding specificity and immune response (Diaz2003Functional).

Common post-translational modifications of the HLA-DPB1 protein include glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function (Silveira2012Chronic). The protein's structure and function are influenced by polymorphic residues, such as those at positions 9, 11, 35, 55, 56, 69, and 84-87, which are critical for T cell allorecognition and peptide binding (Diaz2003Functional).

## Function
HLA-DPB1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the immune response as part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. These proteins are crucial for presenting peptide fragments from extracellular antigens to CD4+ T lymphocytes, which is essential for initiating immune responses (Diaz2003Functional). The HLA-DPB1 protein is primarily active in antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, where it helps in the recognition and response to pathogens.

The protein encoded by HLA-DPB1 is involved in binding peptides within its peptide-binding groove, which is characterized by specific polymorphic residues that influence peptide binding and T cell recognition. These residues, such as those at positions 9, 11, 35, 55, 56, 69, and 84-87, are critical for the specificity of peptide binding and T cell allorecognition (Diaz2003Functional). The binding motifs of HLA-DPB1 alleles are largely consistent, allowing for a broad range of peptides to be presented, which is important for effective immune surveillance and response (Sidney2010Five).

HLA-DPB1 alleles are categorized into T cell epitope (TCE) groups based on their recognition patterns by T cells, which helps predict the outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation by classifying HLA-DP mismatches as permissive or nonpermissive (van2020Immunopeptidome). This classification is significant for understanding the functional hierarchies among different alleles and their role in immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
HLA-DPB1 polymorphisms are associated with several diseases, notably chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and atopic dermatitis (AD). CBD is a hypersensitivity granulomatous pulmonary disease caused by exposure to beryllium. The presence of glutamic acid at position 69 on the HLA-DPB chain (DPbE69) is a significant risk factor for developing CBD and beryllium sensitization (BeS). However, not all individuals with CBD or BeS are HLA-DPbE69 positive, and some beryllium-exposed workers who do not develop these conditions are also positive for this polymorphism (Rosenman2010HLA). The DPB1*0201 haplotype may offer some protection against CBD, as it lacks association with certain epitopes linked to the disease (Rosenman2010HLA).

In the context of atopic dermatitis, specific HLA-DPB1 alleles and polymorphisms, such as the SNP rs9277534 in the 3' UTR region, are linked to disease susceptibility. The G allele of this SNP, associated with higher expression levels, increases the risk of AD, while the A allele is protective (Margolis2023A). Certain haplotypes, like DPA1*01:03~DPB1*04:01, are associated with a decreased risk of AD, highlighting the complex genetic interactions influencing this condition (Margolis2023A).

## Interactions
HLA-DPB1 interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gp42 protein, forming a complex that is significant in the context of Hodgkin lymphoma development. The gp42 protein binds to the β-chain of HLA-DPB1 via its α-chain, forming a hydrophilic complex with a molecular weight of 39,144.12 and an instability index of 47.72, indicating it is unstable. This interaction involves 7 amino acids in the α-chain bonding with 7 amino acids in the β-chain through 9 hydrogen bonds. The binding efficiency of this interaction was highest at 80 μg of gp42 protein, with a binding efficiency in 293T cells of 26-31.3% (Li2020HLADPB1).

HLA-DPB1 also plays a role in the immune response to beryllium, relevant to chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Specific amino acid residues, such as those at positions 84 and 11, influence the binding of antigens to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. The electrostatic potential and charge differences in the binding groove, particularly influenced by amino acids like glutamic acid at position 69, are associated with the risk of CBD (Silveira2012Chronic).
