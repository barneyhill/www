# LIMS3

## Overview
LIMS3, or LIM zinc finger domain containing 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular adhesion processes. The protein LIMS3 is categorized as part of the 'adhesome,' a collection of proteins that facilitate the adhesion of cells, particularly during critical biological events such as embryo implantation. This protein is implicated in the adhesion of the trophectoderm to the endometrial epithelium, suggesting a potential role in reproductive biology, although it has not been directly linked to endometrial receptivity or implantation in previous studies (Evans2020Proteomic). Additionally, LIMS3 is associated with cell-matrix adhesion complexes and cell-substrate adherens junctions in trabecular meshwork cells, indicating its involvement in maintaining cellular adhesion and structural integrity (Maddala2020Global). Despite these associations, the specific molecular interactions and broader functional roles of LIMS3 remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further investigation.

## Function


## Interactions
LIMS3 (LIM zinc finger domain containing 3) is a protein that has been identified as part of the 'adhesome,' a group of proteins associated with the adhesion of the trophectoderm to the endometrial epithelium during embryo implantation. This suggests that LIMS3 may play a role in the adhesion processes critical for successful implantation, although it has not been previously associated with endometrial receptivity or implantation (Evans2020Proteomic).

In the context of trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, LIMS3 is listed as part of the cell-matrix adhesion complexes and cell-substrate adherens junctions. These complexes are crucial for maintaining cellular adhesion and structural integrity, indicating that LIMS3 may participate in interactions that support these functions (Maddala2020Global). However, specific interactions involving LIMS3 in these complexes are not detailed in the available data.

Overall, while LIMS3 is implicated in adhesion-related processes in different cellular contexts, detailed information on its specific protein-protein interactions or its role in multiprotein complexes remains limited. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise interactions and functions of LIMS3 in these biological processes.
