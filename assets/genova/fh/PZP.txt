# PZP

## Overview
The PZP gene encodes the protein PZP alpha-2-macroglobulin-like, which is a member of the α-macroglobulin protein family. This protein functions primarily as a protease inhibitor, playing a crucial role in regulating protease activity in the extracellular space. It is structurally similar to alpha-2-macroglobulin and features a macroglobulin domain, a bait region, and a thiol-ester site, which are essential for its protease inhibitory function (Kashiwagi2020Human). PZP is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, uterus, and brain, and is present in fluids such as blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Its expression levels increase significantly during pregnancy, suggesting a role in gestation and potential immunomodulatory functions (Wyatt2016PZP). Additionally, PZP interacts with amyloid-beta peptides, preventing their aggregation, which highlights its role as an extracellular chaperone in conditions like Alzheimer's disease (Cater2019Human). The protein's involvement in cancer and metabolic disorders further underscores its clinical significance (Chen2023Pregnancy; Lin2021Hepatokine).

## Structure
The PZP protein, encoded by the human PZP gene, is structurally similar to alpha-2-macroglobulin and is part of the A2M protein family. It features a macroglobulin domain, a unique bait region, and a thiol-ester site, which are crucial for its function as a protease inhibitor (Kashiwagi2020Human). The bait region contains multiple protease cleavage sites, and its sequence determines the accessibility and reactivity of proteases. Cleavage in this region induces a conformational change that inactivates the proteases (Kashiwagi2020Human).

The PZP protein can form dimers, which expose a greater hydrophobic surface area compared to the tetrameric form of alpha-2-macroglobulin, allowing it to bind to amyloid-beta monomers and oligomers (Cater2019Human). This structural feature is significant for its role in extracellular proteostasis during pregnancy and in conditions like Alzheimer's disease (Cater2019Human).

The tertiary structure of PZP has been analyzed through homology modeling based on the crystal structure of human A2M, suggesting a focus on its three-dimensional conformation (Kashiwagi2020Human). The protein's structure is highly conserved between humans and marmosets, although the bait region shows lower homology (Kashiwagi2020Human).

## Function
The PZP gene encodes the pregnancy zone protein, which is part of the α-macroglobulin protein family. This protein functions primarily as a protease inhibitor, similar to alpha-2-macroglobulin (α2M), and is involved in regulating protease activity in the extracellular space. PZP forms covalent complexes with various proteinases, allowing it to trap and inactivate these enzymes, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting tissues from proteolytic damage (Sand1985Characterization; Wyatt2016PZP).

PZP is expressed in several tissues, including the liver, uterus, and brain, and is present in fluids such as blood plasma, synovial fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid. Its levels are typically low in healthy individuals but increase significantly during pregnancy, suggesting a role in gestation (Wyatt2016PZP). The protein undergoes a conformational change upon cleavage by proteases, which may expose binding sites for receptors like the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), facilitating its clearance from the bloodstream (Wyatt2016PZP).

PZP is also believed to have immunomodulatory functions, potentially contributing to the immunologically privileged status of the fetus during pregnancy by influencing protease activity and possibly interacting with immune cells (Kashiwagi2020Human; Sand1985Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PZP gene have been linked to various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and breast cancer. In LUAD, PZP expression is significantly reduced compared to noncancerous lung tissues, and this reduction is associated with advanced clinical stages and poor prognosis. PZP is suggested to function as a tumor-suppressing gene in LUAD, with high diagnostic value for distinguishing LUAD. High PZP expression is linked to increased infiltration of CD86+ M1 macrophages, which are associated with antitumor effects, and decreased CD206+ M2 macrophages, which are associated with protumor effects, indicating its role in modulating the tumor microenvironment (Chen2023Pregnancy).

In breast cancer, genetic ablation of PZP in cell lines resulted in increased clonogenic potential and cell migration, indicating enhanced tumorigenic and metastatic capabilities. PZP knockout cells exhibited higher survival fractions after tamoxifen treatment and upregulation of the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway, contributing to breast cancer progression. Lower PZP expression in breast cancer patients is associated with poorer overall survival, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (Kumar2020Genetic).

PZP also plays a role in metabolic disorders. PZP deficiency in mice led to increased weight gain and adiposity under a high-fat diet, suggesting its involvement in energy metabolism and thermogenesis (Lin2021Hepatokine).

## Interactions
Pregnancy Zone Protein (PZP) is known for its interactions with various proteins, particularly in the context of stabilizing misfolded proteins. PZP forms soluble complexes with amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease, preventing their aggregation into fibrils. This interaction is more effective than that of native α2-macroglobulin (α2M), highlighting PZP's role as an extracellular chaperone (Cater2019Human). 

PZP also interacts with Glycodelin A (GdA) in the context of pregnancy. This interaction is significant in modulating immune responses, as PZP and GdA synergistically suppress T cell proliferation and IL-2 production, promoting a shift from Th-1 to Th-2 cytokines, which is crucial for maintaining pregnancy (Löb2021Pregnancy).

In addition to its role in protein stabilization, PZP may interact with metalloproteases and serine proteases, although these interactions are less efficient compared to α2M. This suggests a more specialized role for PZP in proteostasis, particularly during pregnancy (Cater2019Human). PZP's interactions with these proteins underline its importance in both pregnancy-related conditions and neurodegenerative diseases.
