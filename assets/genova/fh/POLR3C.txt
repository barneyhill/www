# POLR3C

## Overview
POLR3C is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase III subunit C, a critical component of the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) complex in eukaryotic cells. This protein is integral to the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which are essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth (Girbig2020CryoEM; Kessler2021The). As part of a heterotrimer initiation complex, POLR3C plays a pivotal role in initiating transcription through a promoter-independent mechanism, which is vital for the immune response to viral infections (Kessler2021The). The protein is also involved in the innate immune response by facilitating the production of interferons in response to viral pathogens, particularly those with A+T-rich genomes (Ogunjimi2017Inborn; CarterTimofte2018Mutations). Mutations in the POLR3C gene have been linked to severe infections, highlighting its clinical significance in antiviral immunity (Ogunjimi2017Inborn).

## Function
POLR3C encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III), which is crucial for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, including tRNAs and 5S rRNA, in eukaryotic cells. This transcription is essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth, as these RNAs play a key role in the translation process (Girbig2020CryoEM; Kessler2021The). POLR3C is part of a heterotrimer initiation complex that includes other subunits, and it is necessary for the proper function of Pol III in initiating transcription. This complex operates via a promoter-independent mechanism, facilitating the transcription of specific DNA sequences critical for initiating immune responses (Kessler2021The).

In healthy human cells, POLR3C is involved in the innate immune response by enabling the production of interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infections. It plays a role in the transcription of RNA from AT-rich DNA, which is crucial for activating the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on RNA, leading to an interferon response (Ogunjimi2017Inborn; CarterTimofte2018Mutations). This function is particularly important in the context of infections by A+T-rich viruses, such as the varicella zoster virus (VZV) (Kessler2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR3C gene have been implicated in severe varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections. These mutations can lead to impaired induction of type I and III interferons, which are crucial for antiviral immunity. The study identified that heterozygous mutations in POLR3C, along with POLR3A, may underlie life-threatening VZV disease, with inheritance potentially being monogenic or digenic. Structural modeling showed that some mutations are located in surface-exposed regions of the proteins, while others are in buried parts at the POLR3A-POLR3C interface (Ogunjimi2017Inborn).

Patients with these mutations exhibit impaired interferon responses to AT-rich DNA, which is essential for the immune system's ability to combat viral infections. Specifically, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with POLR3C mutations showed reduced ability to induce IFNA2 expression when stimulated with VZV-AT-high DNA. This impaired response is linked to a functional defect in the POL III DNA sensing system, responsible for converting AT-rich DNA into immunostimulatory RNA PAMPs (Ogunjimi2017Inborn).

Reconstitution of wild-type POLR3C in patient cells restored their ability to produce interferons and control VZV replication, indicating the direct role of these mutations in the observed immune deficiencies (Ogunjimi2017Inborn).

## Interactions
POLR3C, also known as RPC3, is a subunit of RNA polymerase III and participates in several protein-protein interactions within the complex. In HeLa cells, POLR3C is part of two main complexes: the full RNA polymerase III complex and a smaller trimeric subcomplex. The full complex includes POLR3A, POLR3G, and POLR3GL, while the trimeric subcomplex consists of POLR3C, POLR3F, and either POLR3G or POLR3GL (Renaud2013Gene). Immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that POLR3C coimmunoprecipitates with POLR3A, POLR3G, and POLR3GL in the full complex, and with POLR3G and POLR3GL in the trimeric subcomplex. GST pull-down experiments demonstrated direct interactions between POLR3C and POLR3G/POLR3GL, but not with POLR3F, BRF1, or BRF2 (Renaud2013Gene).

The POLR3C-POLR3F-POLR3G complex is involved in the formation of transcription initiation complexes, interacting with the transcription factor complex TFIIIB. In mammals, TFIIIB includes BRF1-TFIIIB and BRF2-TFIIIB, and POLR3F has been shown to associate with BRF1 and TBP, indicating that the trimeric complex interacts with these factors through other subunits (Renaud2013Gene).
