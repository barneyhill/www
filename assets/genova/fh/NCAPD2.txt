# NCAPD2

## Overview
NCAPD2 is a gene that encodes the non-SMC condensin I complex subunit D2, a crucial component of the condensin I complex involved in chromatin condensation and segregation during mitosis. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic integrity by organizing chromatin structure and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. As a non-SMC subunit, it interacts with other condensin components to form a stable complex essential for chromosomal architecture. NCAPD2 is expressed in various tissues and is particularly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to chromosome stabilization and cell cycle regulation. Its functions extend beyond mitosis, with implications in neurological conditions and cancer, highlighting its significance in both cellular and organismal biology (Jing2021NCAPD2; Gu2024NCAPD2; Feng2024NCAPD2).

## Function
NCAPD2 is a subunit of the condensin I complex, which is essential for chromatin condensation and segregation during mitosis. This protein plays a critical role in organizing chromatin structure, ensuring proper chromosome segregation, and maintaining genomic integrity during cell division. In healthy human cells, NCAPD2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the stabilization of chromosomes, facilitating accurate cell division and proliferation, which are vital for organismal development and tissue homeostasis (Jing2021NCAPD2; Gu2024NCAPD2).

NCAPD2 is expressed in various healthy tissues, including lymph nodes, bone marrow, and fat, and is involved in central nervous system development. Its function in chromosomal condensation is crucial for maintaining genome stability, which is essential for proper cell division and function (Gu2024NCAPD2). The protein's role in chromatin dynamics during mitosis has been well-studied, highlighting its importance in cell cycle regulation and chromosome maintenance (Feng2024NCAPD2). While its primary role is in mitotic chromosome condensation, NCAPD2 has also been implicated in several neurological conditions, suggesting its broader significance in cellular and organismal biology (Jing2021NCAPD2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NCAPD2 gene are implicated in several diseases and conditions. In liver cancer, NCAPD2 is upregulated and associated with poor survival, particularly in cases with TP53 mutations. It promotes tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and cell cycle progression while inhibiting apoptosis, primarily through the PI3K-Akt-mTOR/c-Myc signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Gu2024NCAPD2). In colorectal cancer, high NCAPD2 expression enhances tumor growth by promoting cell proliferation and migration via the Ca2+/CAMKK2/AMPK/mTORC1 pathway and inhibiting autophagy (Jing2021NCAPD2). In triple-negative breast cancer, NCAPD2 is a prognostic factor, with its expression correlating with poor survival outcomes. It promotes cell cycle progression and invasion, and its knockdown results in G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis (Zhang2020NonSMC).

NCAPD2 mutations are also linked to microcephaly, a condition characterized by reduced brain size. A specific splice site mutation in NCAPD2 disrupts chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to microcephaly through decatenation failure (Martin2016Mutations). These findings highlight NCAPD2's role in both cancer progression and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
NCAPD2, a non-SMC subunit of the condensin I complex, is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in chromosome condensation and stabilization. It interacts with other condensin subunits, including hCAP-C, hCAP-E, hCAP-G, and hCAP-H, forming a stable complex essential for chromosomal architecture. The amino-terminal half of NCAPD2 is necessary for interaction with the hCAP-C-hCAP-E heterodimer and hCAP-H, while hCAP-G interacts with both the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal halves of NCAPD2 (Ball2002Identification).

NCAPD2 also interacts with histones H1 and H3, which is crucial for its chromosome-targeting function. This interaction is mediated by a specific domain within NCAPD2 that binds to histone H1 in a salt-sensitive manner and associates with the histone H3 tail (Ball2002Identification).

In the context of DNA repair, NCAPD2 interacts with the PARP-1-XRCC1 complex, playing a significant role in DNA single-strand break repair. This interaction is crucial for the stable formation of the condensin I-XRCC1 complex, which is essential for effective DNA repair (Heale2006Condensin). These interactions highlight NCAPD2's multifaceted role in maintaining genomic stability and facilitating proper chromosomal functions.
