# TLCD1

## Overview
TLCD1 is a gene that encodes the protein TLC domain containing 1, which plays a significant role in cellular lipid metabolism and membrane dynamics. The protein is primarily involved in regulating the composition and fluidity of cell membranes by modulating long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) (Ruiz2018Membrane). TLCD1 is associated with the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi network, where it influences lipid balance and membrane integrity (Petkevicius2022TLCD1). It interacts with various proteins involved in mitochondrial function and phospholipid synthesis, highlighting its role in lipid homeostasis and cellular processes (Petkevicius2022TLCD1). TLCD1 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and liver conditions, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and prognosis (Wang2024Multiomics).

## Function
The TLCD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating membrane composition and fluidity in mammalian cells. It is primarily involved in the modulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), which are essential for maintaining membrane fluidity (Ruiz2018Membrane). TLCD1 limits the production of LCPUFA-containing phospholipids or promotes their turnover, acting independently of fatty acid desaturases (Ruiz2018Membrane). This regulation is vital for protecting cells against membrane rigidification, especially in the presence of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (Ruiz2018Membrane).

TLCD1 is localized to the plasma membrane and is not involved in ceramide synthesis or translocation processes. Instead, it may influence substrate selection by phospholipases or lysophospholipid acyltransferases, affecting the Lands cycle and thus membrane composition (Ruiz2018Membrane). In healthy human cells, TLCD1's primary function is to maintain lipid balance and membrane health, ensuring proper cell membrane integrity and function (Wang2024Multiomics). The protein is also associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi network and interacts with mitochondria, particularly at mitochondria-associated membranes, which are sites of mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism (Petkevicius2022TLCD1).

## Clinical Significance
The TLCD1 gene has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and liver conditions. In cancer, TLCD1 is often upregulated in numerous tumor types, correlating with poor prognosis and decreased overall survival in cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), ovarian cancer (OV), thymoma (THYM), and uveal melanoma (UVM) (Wang2024Multiomics). However, its expression is reduced in KIRC and acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) (Wang2024Multiomics). TLCD1 is also associated with immune infiltration and immune checkpoint pathways, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response (Wang2024Multiomics).

In liver diseases, TLCD1 plays a significant role in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Alterations in TLCD1 expression or function are linked to changes in phosphatidylethanolamine composition, which can influence liver lipid metabolism and contribute to NASH development (Petkevicius2022TLCD1). TLCD1 is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression is associated with hepatic inflammation and poor survival outcomes (Petkevicius2022TLCD1). These findings highlight TLCD1's potential as a therapeutic target in both cancer and liver disease contexts.

## Interactions
TLCD1, a protein encoded by the human gene TLC domain containing 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In HepG2 cells, TLCD1 has been shown to interact with components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function. These interactions suggest a role in regulating mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) composition, although TLCD1 is not considered an intra-mitochondrial protein (Petkevicius2022TLCD1).

Proteomic analysis using immunoprecipitation techniques has identified several proteins interacting with TLCD1, providing insights into its role in cellular lipid metabolism and liver disease progression (Petkevicius2022TLCD1). TLCD1 also interacts with proteins involved in phospholipid synthesis and lipid remodeling, such as PHB and PHB2, indicating its involvement in lipid homeostasis (Petkevicius2022TLCD1).

In the context of cancer, TLCD1 has been associated with various proteins through gene co-expression analysis and identified as a potential biomarker in pan-cancer studies. It is linked to pathways such as 'thyroid hormone signaling' and 'RNA transport', suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis (Wang2024Multiomics). These interactions highlight TLCD1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
