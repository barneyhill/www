# PQBP1

## Overview
PQBP1 (polyglutamine binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and RNA splicing. The protein, also named polyglutamine binding protein 1, is characterized by its intrinsically disordered structure and contains a WW domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. This domain is crucial for binding to other proteins, such as RNA polymerase II, and is involved in the regulation of gene expression and mRNA processing (Rees2012Solution; Takahashi2009Polyglutamine). PQBP1 is implicated in several neurological disorders due to its role in RNA metabolism and protein synthesis, particularly in neurons. Mutations in the PQBP1 gene are associated with X-linked intellectual disability syndromes, underscoring its clinical significance (Mizuguchi2014Mutations; Tanaka2022PQBP1:).

## Structure
PQBP1 (polyglutamine binding protein 1) is a nuclear protein characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, with a largely unfolded conformation in solution. The protein has a molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa and a radius of gyration of 3.8 nm, indicating it remains monomeric and partially unfolded (Rees2012Solution). PQBP1 contains a WW domain, which is a small protein-protein interaction module crucial for binding to other proteins, including RNA polymerase II. This domain is known to adopt a small β-sheet structure (Takahashi2009Polyglutamine). The WW domain's function can be affected by mutations, such as the Y65C mutation, which may lead to structural changes and loss of function due to potential disulfide bond formation (Sudol2012Molecular).

PQBP1 also includes a polar amino acid-rich domain and a C-terminal domain, which interacts with spliceosomal components like U5-15kD (Takahashi2010Polyglutamine). The protein is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms with variations in the C-terminal region, which may affect its functional interactions (Iwamoto2000Genomic). These structural features and modifications contribute to PQBP1's role in transcription regulation and RNA splicing.

## Function
Polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PQBP1 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in transcription regulation and RNA splicing. It interacts with transcription factors such as Brn-2 and components of the spliceosome, influencing gene expression and mRNA processing (Waragai1999PQBP1; Wang2013PQBP1). PQBP1 is also involved in alternative splicing, interacting with splicing factors like SF3B1, which is crucial for maintaining normal neuronal function and development (Wang2013PQBP1).

In addition to its nuclear functions, PQBP1 is present in the cytoplasm, where it participates in RNA metabolism. It forms complexes with RNA-binding proteins and is involved in mRNA transport and localization, particularly in neurons (Kunde2011The). PQBP1 also plays a role in protein synthesis by interacting with eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), promoting translational elongation by suppressing eEF2 phosphorylation. This regulation is essential for synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions (Shen2021PQBP1). Overall, PQBP1's diverse roles in transcription, RNA processing, and protein synthesis underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PQBP1 gene are linked to several X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndromes, including Renpenning syndrome, Golabi-Ito-Hall syndrome, Hamel syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and Sutherland-Haan syndrome, collectively known as the Renpenning syndrome spectrum. These conditions are characterized by symptoms such as intellectual disability, microcephaly, short stature, lean body, and small testes (Mizuguchi2014Mutations; Tanaka2022PQBP1:). Mutations in PQBP1 often involve frameshifts due to deletions or duplications of dinucleotide repeats, leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and loss of function (Musante2010Common; Cossée2006Exonic).

Alterations in PQBP1 expression levels can also contribute to disease phenotypes. Duplication of the PQBP1 gene has been associated with a phenotype similar to Renpenning syndrome, including intellectual disability, myoclonic seizures, and hyperactivity, potentially due to overexpression of PQBP1 proteins (Tanaka2022PQBP1:). PQBP1 is involved in RNA metabolism, and its mutations can disrupt normal RNA processing and splicing, affecting neuronal development and function (Kunde2011The; Wang2013PQBP1). These disruptions are implicated in the pathogenesis of associated neurological disorders, highlighting the clinical significance of PQBP1 mutations and expression alterations.

## Interactions
PQBP1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and RNA splicing. It binds to the spliceosomal protein U5-15kD through its carboxyl-terminal domain, a critical interaction for spliceosome stability and function (Mizuguchi2014Mutations; Waragai2000PQBP1Npw38). The YxxPxxVL motif in PQBP1 is essential for this binding, and mutations in this motif can disrupt the interaction, leading to neurological disorders (Mizuguchi2014Mutations).

PQBP1 also associates with the transcription factor ATXN1, forming nuclear inclusions that may contribute to the pathology of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (Okazawa2002Interaction). In the context of mRNA processing, PQBP1 interacts with the U2 snRNP component SF3B1, influencing alternative splicing and neurite outgrowth (Wang2013PQBP1). It is part of a protein network enriched for splicing factors, including WBP11 and U5-15KD, and is involved in early spliceosome assembly (Wang2013PQBP1).

In addition to its nuclear roles, PQBP1 is found in cytoplasmic RNA granules and stress granules, where it interacts with proteins like FMRP and Caprin-1, affecting mRNA translation and stress response (Wan2015X; Kunde2011The). These interactions highlight PQBP1's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
