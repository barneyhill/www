# WDR3

## Overview
WDR3 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 3 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD repeats that facilitate the formation of a beta-propeller structure. This structure is integral to the protein's role as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle regulation (McMahon2010Ribosomal; Li2001Human). The WDR3 protein is primarily located in the nucleus and is involved in the processing of 18S rRNA, a critical component of the small ribosomal subunit, thereby influencing cellular growth and proliferation (McMahon2010Ribosomal). Additionally, WDR3 interacts with various signaling pathways, including the IGF-I and Hippo pathways, and has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in thyroid and pancreatic cancers, where its expression levels are often altered (Akdi2010WDR3Gene; Su2021Overexpressed). The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Su2021Overexpressed).

## Structure
The WDR3 protein is characterized by the presence of WD repeats, which are conserved motifs of approximately 40 amino acids typically ending with a tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) dipeptide. These repeats facilitate the formation of a circularized beta-propeller structure, which is a common feature among WD-repeat proteins. This structure is composed of a series of four-stranded antiparallel beta sheets, with each propeller blade containing strands from adjacent repeat units. The most stable configuration of this structure is believed to have at least seven blades, providing a stable platform for protein-protein interactions (Li2001Human).

WDR3 contains 10 WD repeats and encodes a nuclear protein with 943 amino acids. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and ribosome biogenesis (McMahon2010Ribosomal; GarcíaQuispes2012Possible). Although the specific molecular structure of WDR3 is not fully detailed, its WD-repeat domains suggest a role in coordinating multiprotein complex assemblies, serving as a scaffold for protein interactions (Li2001Human). The protein's stability and expression are regulated by pathways such as PI3K/mTOR, indicating its integration into cellular signaling networks (McMahon2010Ribosomal).

## Function
The WDR3 gene encodes a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the processing of 18S rRNA, which is a component of the small 40S ribosomal subunit. This process is crucial for the synthesis of ribosomes, impacting cellular growth and proliferation (McMahon2010Ribosomal). WDR3 is a nuclear protein containing WD repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions necessary for its function in the nucleolus, where it participates in the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits (GarcíaQuispes2012Possible). 

In healthy human cells, WDR3 is involved in the coordination of ribosome biogenesis with cell cycle progression. It is a transcriptional target of the IGF-I signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth (McMahon2010Ribosomal). The suppression of WDR3 leads to defects in 18S rRNA processing, resulting in impaired ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle arrest, highlighting its role in cell cycle regulation (McMahon2010Ribosomal). Although the specific function of WDR3 in healthy cells is not fully understood, its involvement in ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle regulation suggests it plays a critical role in maintaining normal cellular functions and growth (Akdi2010WDR3Gene).

## Clinical Significance
The WDR3 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and genetic variations. In thyroid cancer, particularly in a Spanish population, certain haplotypes of the WDR3 gene, such as the CAT haplotype, have been associated with an increased risk of the disease. Altered expression of WDR3 has been observed in thyroid cancer cell lines, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Akdi2010WDR3Gene). 

In pancreatic cancer, WDR3 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor disease-free and overall survival. This overexpression promotes cancer progression by activating the Hippo signaling pathway, specifically through the induction of YAP1 expression. Silencing WDR3 has been shown to inhibit the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Su2021Overexpressed).

WDR3 is also involved in ribosome biogenesis and interacts with the p53 protein, playing a role in cell cycle regulation. Suppression of WDR3 in cancer cells leads to defects in ribosome biogenesis, stabilization of p53, and cell cycle arrest, highlighting its significance in cancer cell proliferation (McMahon2010Ribosomal).

## Interactions
WDR3 (WD repeat domain 3) is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cellular processes. In pancreatic cancer cells, WDR3 interacts with GATA4, a transcription factor, to regulate the Hippo signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional upregulation of YAP1, a key effector in the pathway, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Su2021Overexpressed). The interaction between WDR3 and GATA4 modulates GATA4's ability to bind to the YAP1 promoter, influencing YAP1 expression levels (Su2021Overexpressed).

WDR3 is also part of the Cul4-DDB1-WDR3/WDR6 complex, which interacts with SPAK and OSR1 kinases in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This complex binds to the OSR1 kinase domain when it is unphosphorylated, suggesting a regulatory role in kinase activity and ion homeostasis (Dhiani2019The). These interactions highlight WDR3's involvement in both cancer progression and cellular signaling pathways, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
