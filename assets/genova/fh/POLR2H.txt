# POLR2H

## Overview
POLR2H is a gene that encodes the protein RNA polymerase II, I, and III subunit H, which is a critical component of the transcription machinery in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a subunit shared by the three major RNA polymerases, highlighting its essential role in the transcription of DNA into RNA. The POLR2H-encoded protein is involved in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA, messenger RNA, and small RNAs, thereby playing a pivotal role in gene expression and regulation. It operates within the cell nucleus, contributing to fundamental processes such as cellular growth and differentiation by interacting with various transcription factors. The gene's expression and regulation are of significant interest in the context of cancer research, as alterations in POLR2H expression have been linked to various malignancies, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Ma2022Potential; Muste2023Deregulations).

## Function
POLR2H encodes a subunit that is common to RNA polymerases I, II, and III, which are essential for the transcription of DNA into RNA in eukaryotic cells. This protein plays a crucial role in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA, messenger RNA, and small RNAs, impacting gene expression and regulation (Muste2023Deregulations). POLR2H is involved in the transcription machinery that synthesizes mRNA from DNA templates, a key step in the central dogma of molecular biology (Ma2022Potential). 

The protein is active in the cell nucleus, where it contributes to fundamental cellular processes such as growth and differentiation. It is part of the transcription machinery that regulates gene expression by working with transcription factors (Muste2023Deregulations). The POLR2H subunit is shared among the three RNA polymerase complexes, highlighting its importance in maintaining the function of these essential enzymes (Muste2023Deregulations). 

While the specific function of POLR2H in healthy human cells is not detailed extensively, its role in the broader context of RNA polymerase function is crucial for normal cellular activities and gene expression (Muste2023Deregulations).

## Clinical Significance
The POLR2H gene is implicated in various cancers due to its upregulation and overexpression. In HPV+ head and neck carcinomas, POLR2H is notably upregulated, and its high mRNA expression is associated with poor prognosis in rectal cancer, where it is linked with increased risk of poor overall survival (Muste2023Deregulations). In prostate cancer, POLR2H is overexpressed in cancer cells compared to normal tissue, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for prognosis and diagnosis, as well as a drug target (Muste2023Deregulations). Its expression is also significantly higher in lung cancer tissues, correlating with patient survival in lung squamous cell carcinoma (Muste2023Deregulations). 

In neuroblastoma, higher POLR2H expression is associated with a higher risk of death, and it may act as a proto-oncogene. The gene's expression levels affect the immune microenvironment and patient prognosis, indicating its potential clinical significance in neuroblastoma prognosis and treatment strategies (Ma2022Potential). POLR2H is also upregulated in a subset of breast cancer patients resistant to radiotherapy, suggesting a role in radio-resistance acquisition (Muste2023Deregulations).
