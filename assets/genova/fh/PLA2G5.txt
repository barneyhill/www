# PLA2G5

## Overview
The PLA2G5 gene encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group V (sPLA2-V), a member of the secretory phospholipase A2 family, which plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes. This enzyme is characterized by its ability to hydrolyze phospholipids, releasing arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids, which are precursors for bioactive lipid mediators such as eicosanoids (Samuchiwal2019Harmful). sPLA2-V is predominantly found in the cytosol and associated with cellular membranes, where it influences eicosanoid production and membrane remodeling (Sergouniotis2011Biallelic). The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the eye, heart, and brain, and is involved in critical physiological processes such as phagocytosis and immune response modulation (Koganesawa2020Lipid). Alterations in PLA2G5 expression or function have been linked to several diseases, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Watanabe2020Group; Sato2014The).

## Structure
The PLA2G5 gene encodes the group V secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-V), an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. The primary structure of sPLA2-V consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a compact, globular shape in its tertiary structure, often stabilized by disulfide bonds (Murakami2014Emerging). The enzyme's secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function. sPLA2-V contains a calcium-binding domain crucial for its enzymatic activity, which is a characteristic feature of the secreted phospholipase A2 family (Murakami2014Emerging).

In terms of quaternary structure, sPLA2-V may form homodimers, which could be important for its biological function. Common post-translational modifications of sPLA2-V include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions with other molecules (Murakami2014Emerging). These structural features enable sPLA2-V to efficiently hydrolyze phospholipids, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism and associated physiological processes. The enzyme's ability to bind to membrane phosphatidylcholine with high affinity is critical for its function in arachidonic acid release and eicosanoid generation, which are important in inflammatory responses (Samuchiwal2019Harmful).

## Function
PLA2G5 encodes the group V phospholipase A2 enzyme, which is involved in the hydrolysis of phospholipids to release arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids. This enzyme plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cell signaling. It is primarily active in the cytosol and associated with cellular membranes, influencing processes like eicosanoid production and membrane remodeling (Samuchiwal2019Harmful).

In healthy human cells, PLA2G5 is expressed in various tissues, including the eye, heart, placenta, lung, and brain, and is present in cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and renal tubular epithelium (Sergouniotis2011Biallelic). The enzyme is involved in providing arachidonic acid for eicosanoid generation, which includes prostaglandins and leukotrienes, playing roles in phagocytosis regulation, foam cell formation, and antibacterial activities (Sergouniotis2011Biallelic).

PLA2G5 also contributes to the metabolism of specific phospholipids and the production of eicosanoids, such as Prostaglandin E2 and D2, which are important for macrophage function (Koganesawa2020Lipid). It is crucial for the development and function of IL-4-activated macrophages (M2) and plays a role in the phagocytosis of pathogens (Koganesawa2020Lipid).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PLA2G5 gene, which encodes the secreted phospholipase A2 group V (sPLA2-V), have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of cardiovascular health, sPLA2-V plays a protective role against aortic dissection. Mice deficient in sPLA2-V, particularly in endothelial cells, show increased susceptibility to aortic dissection, which can be mitigated by dietary supplementation with oleic and linoleic acids (Watanabe2020Group). 

In metabolic disorders, PLA2G5 is involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation. Its expression is induced in hypertrophic adipocytes and plays a role in controlling diet-induced obesity. The absence of PLA2G5 exacerbates obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance, indicating its beneficial role in these conditions (Sato2014The). PLA2G5 also influences macrophage polarization, promoting an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, which is crucial in reducing adipose tissue inflammation (Sato2014The).

Additionally, PLA2G5 is implicated in respiratory conditions such as asthma, where its absence affects macrophage polarization and Th2 immunity (Murakami2020Updating). These findings suggest that alterations in PLA2G5 expression or function can contribute to a range of diseases, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory disorders.

## Interactions
PLA2G5, or phospholipase A2 group V, is known to interact with various proteins and participate in significant biological processes. One of its key interactions is with proteoglycans, which enhances its enzymatic activity on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) phospholipids. This interaction is crucial for increasing LDL-proteoglycan complex formation, a process that is not significantly influenced by sPLA2-IIA, another member of the secretory phospholipase A2 family (Rosengren2006Secretory).

PLA2G5 also plays a role in the immune response, particularly in phagosome maturation. It translocates to phagosomes shortly after phagocytosis, facilitating the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes. This process is essential for the degradation of pathogens, such as Candida albicans, and is significantly impaired in macrophages lacking PLA2G5 (Balestrieri2009Group).

In the context of atherosclerosis, PLA2G5 interacts with lipoproteins, including very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and LDL. It modifies these lipoproteins, enhancing their association with arterial proteoglycans, which may contribute to atherogenic processes (Bostrom2007Group; Rosengren2006Secretory). These interactions highlight the enzyme's role in lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways.
