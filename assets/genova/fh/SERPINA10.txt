# SERPINA10

## Overview
SERPINA10 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family A member 10, also known as protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI). This protein is a member of the serpin superfamily, which is characterized by its role as a serine protease inhibitor. SERPINA10 plays a critical role in the regulation of blood coagulation by inhibiting Factor Xa, a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade, in the presence of protein Z, calcium, and phospholipids. This function is essential for maintaining hemostatic balance and preventing excessive clot formation, which could lead to thrombosis (Wang2023DIA; van2003Serpins:). The gene is primarily expressed in the liver, and its product is secreted into the plasma, where it interacts with other components of the coagulation system to exert its anticoagulant effects (Guo2021High). Variations in the SERPINA10 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as venous thromboembolism and have implications in cancer prognosis, highlighting its significance in both hemostatic and pathological processes (Corral2006A; Guo2021High).

## Structure
SERPINA10, also known as the protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI), is a member of the serpin superfamily characterized by a conserved serpin fold crucial for its inhibitory function. The primary structure of SERPINA10 consists of a polypeptide chain of amino acids, typically ranging from 350 to 400 residues, with a molecular weight of approximately 40-50 kDa (van2003Serpins:). The secondary structure includes three β-sheets and eight or nine α-helices, which are common features of serpin proteins (van2003Serpins:).

The tertiary structure of SERPINA10 is defined by the serpin fold, which is essential for its role as an inhibitor. This structure allows the reactive center loop (RCL) to interact with target proteases, forming a covalent link and trapping the protease in an irreversible complex (Forsyth2003A). SERPINA10 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its function and stability (Seixas2015The).

While specific details about the quaternary structure of SERPINA10 are not provided, serpins generally function as monomers. Splice variants of SERPINA10 may exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Seixas2015The).

## Function
SERPINA10, also known as protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI), is a serine protease inhibitor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood coagulation. It primarily functions by inhibiting Factor Xa, a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade, in the presence of protein Z, calcium, and phospholipids. This inhibition is essential for maintaining hemostatic balance and preventing excessive clot formation, which could lead to thrombosis (Wang2023DIA; van2003Serpins:).

SERPINA10 is synthesized by the liver and secreted into the plasma, where it exerts its anticoagulant effects. The interaction with protein Z is vital for its function, as the ability of ZPI to inhibit Factor Xa decreases significantly without protein Z (Wang2023DIA). This protein is part of the serpin superfamily, which includes various proteins involved in processes such as inflammation and tumor suppression (van2003Serpins:).

In healthy human cells, SERPINA10's role in the coagulation pathway is critical for preventing abnormal blood clotting, thereby contributing to the overall regulation of blood flow and vascular health. Its activity is primarily located in the extracellular space, where it interacts with other components of the coagulation system (Guo2021High).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SERPINA10 gene, also known as protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI), have been associated with various clinical conditions, particularly related to thrombosis. High expression of SERPINA10 has been linked to improved survival outcomes in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients, where it serves as a potential biomarker for predicting platinum sensitivity and survival benefit. Patients with high SERPINA10 expression exhibit longer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), as well as a longer platinum-free interval (PFI) compared to those with low expression (Guo2021High).

Conversely, certain genetic variants in SERPINA10 are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). For instance, the Arg67Stop polymorphism significantly elevates the risk of venous thrombosis, with carriers having a 3.3-fold increased risk (Corral2006A). Other variants, such as the R88* nonsense mutation, have been identified in patients with VTE, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of thrombophilia (Athar2021Targeted). However, some studies have not found a significant association between certain SERPINA10 variants, like rs2232710, and deep vein thrombosis (Gorski2016Single).

## Interactions
SERPINA10, also known as protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI), is involved in the regulation of blood coagulation through its interactions with several key proteins. It primarily interacts with protein Z (PZ), factor Xa, and factor XIa. The interaction with PZ is crucial as it forms a complex on phospholipid surfaces, which enhances the inhibitory effect of SERPINA10 on factor Xa. This interaction is calcium ion-dependent and is essential for the anticoagulant process, as it significantly reduces thrombin generation by inhibiting factor Xa and factor XIa (Almawi2013Protein). Without PZ, the ability of SERPINA10 to inhibit factor Xa decreases significantly, highlighting the importance of this interaction in maintaining hemostatic balance (Wang2023DIA).

SERPINA10's role in coagulation is further supported by its involvement in complement and coagulation cascades, as identified in studies exploring its association with venous thromboembolism (VTE). These studies suggest that SERPINA10 is part of a network of proteins that are more connected to each other than to other groups, indicating its involvement in specific biological processes related to coagulation and platelet activation (Li2023Proteomewide).
