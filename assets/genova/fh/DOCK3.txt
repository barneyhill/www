# DOCK3

## Overview
DOCK3, or dedicator of cytokinesis 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the DOCK-B subfamily of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). The DOCK3 protein plays a pivotal role in the activation of the small Rho GTPase RAC1, which is essential for cytoskeletal reorganization and neuronal development. Predominantly expressed in neural tissues, DOCK3 is involved in processes such as cell morphology, migration, and axon guidance, contributing to neuronal outgrowth and cellular adhesion. The protein's structure includes key domains such as an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, DOCK homology regions (DHR-1 and DHR-2), and a C-terminal proline-rich domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and lipids, thereby influencing its function in neuronal signaling pathways (Benson2021The; de2003Disruption). Mutations in the DOCK3 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as intellectual disabilities and muscular dystrophy (Alexander2023DOCK3Associated; Alexander2014MicroRNA486–dependent).

## Structure
The DOCK3 protein is a member of the DOCK-B subfamily of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which are involved in the activation of small Rho GTPases, specifically RAC1 (Benson2021The). The protein is composed of 2030 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 233.1 kDa (de2003Disruption). Structurally, DOCK3 contains several key domains: an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, two DOCK homology regions (DHR-1 and DHR-2), an armadillo repeat motif, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (Benson2021The).

The DHR-1 domain is responsible for membrane localization through interaction with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), while the DHR-2 domain binds the target small Rho GTPase to catalyze GTP-GDP exchange, leading to activation and subsequent actin polymerization (Benson2021The). The SH3 domain interacts with the PH domain of ELMO proteins, which is necessary for DOCK GEF activity (Benson2021The). The C-terminal proline-rich region binds phosphatidic acid and SH3-containing adaptor proteins like CRK, contributing to the functional complex required for Rho GTPase activity (Benson2021The).

DOCK3 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, including various parts of the brain, but not in the spinal cord or other non-neural tissues (de2003Disruption). The protein is soluble and does not rely on pleckstrin homology (PH) and Dbl homology (DH) domains for its GEF activity and membrane localization (Benson2021The). Information on post-translational modifications, specific folds, or splice variant isoforms of DOCK3 is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The DOCK3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), primarily activating the Rho GTPase RAC1. This activation is crucial for cytoskeletal reorganization, influencing cell morphology, migration, and axon guidance (Alexander2023DOCK3Associated). DOCK3 is predominantly expressed in neurons, where it plays a significant role in neuronal development and function. It is involved in cellular adhesion and neuronal outgrowth by interacting with the actin cytoskeleton and key signaling molecules (Alexander2023DOCK3Associated).

In healthy cells, DOCK3 contributes to normal cell growth, proliferation, and migration. It promotes neuronal outgrowth through interactions with N-cadherin and F-actin and is involved in axonal outgrowth by recruiting the WAVE1 signaling complex (Alexander2023DOCK3Associated). DOCK3 also interacts with ELMO1/2 to regulate axon guidance and cellular polarity and with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) to prevent cell death in retinal ganglion cells (Alexander2023DOCK3Associated).

The protein is active in the nervous system, particularly in retinal ganglion cells, where it protects against excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, promoting axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury (Namekata2014Dock3). DOCK3's role in activating RAC1 is essential for maintaining normal neuronal function and cellular processes (Alexander2023DOCK3Associated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DOCK3 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Biallelic variants in DOCK3, leading to complete or partial loss of function, have been linked to intellectual disabilities and muscle hypotonia. These conditions are characterized by developmental delays, gait abnormalities, and speech issues, with variability in clinical severity observed even within families (Alexander2023DOCK3Associated). 

DOCK3 is also implicated in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like phenotypes. Disruptions in the gene, such as chromosomal inversions, have been associated with behavioral and intellectual development alterations, potentially due to disrupted neuronal migration and axon pathfinding (de2003Disruption).

In the context of muscular dystrophy, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), DOCK3 expression is increased, although this is accompanied by decreased levels of activated RAC1 due to skeletal myofiber membrane instability. This suggests a role for DOCK3 in muscle cell apoptosis and differentiation, impacting muscular dystrophy symptoms (Alexander2023DOCK3Associated; Alexander2014MicroRNA486–dependent).

DOCK3 is also involved in neuroprotection, with its overexpression shown to protect against demyelination in models of multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, as well as retinal degeneration in glaucoma models (Namekata2014Dock3; Namekata2013Dock3).

## Interactions
DOCK3, also known as MOCA or presenilin-binding protein, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in neuronal development and signaling pathways. It acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rho GTPase RAC1, promoting neuronal outgrowth and cellular adhesion (Alexander2023DOCK3Associated). DOCK3 interacts with N-cadherin and F-actin, facilitating neuronal outgrowth by recruiting the WAVE1 signaling complex to the outer membrane, which stimulates RAC1 activation through BDNF signaling (Alexander2023DOCK3Associated).

DOCK3 also binds to and inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), promoting microtubule assembly and axonal outgrowth. This interaction is essential for BDNF-dependent axonal outgrowth, as DOCK3 enhances the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3β at the plasma membrane (Namekata2012Dock3). The interaction with GSK-3β does not affect the phosphorylation state or GEF activity of DOCK3 itself (Namekata2012Dock3).

DOCK3 also interacts with the NR2D subunit of the NMDA receptor, providing neuroprotection by reducing the surface expression of NR2D and inhibiting glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in retinal ganglion cells (Bai2013Dock3). These interactions highlight DOCK3's role in neuronal signaling and protection against neurodegenerative processes.
