# AFM

## Overview
The AFM gene encodes afamin, a glycoprotein that belongs to the albumin family and is primarily involved in the transport and homeostasis of vitamin E. Afamin is structurally similar to human serum albumin, featuring a heart-shaped domain arrangement that facilitates its role as a carrier protein. It is highly glycosylated, which contributes to its molecular heterogeneity, although the precise functional implications of these glycans remain to be fully elucidated. Afamin is notable for its ability to bind and stabilize lipidated Wnt proteins, thereby maintaining their solubility and biological activity, which is crucial for Wnt signaling pathways. Additionally, afamin plays a significant role in bone metabolism by acting as a chemokine for preosteoblasts, promoting their migration and differentiation. Clinically, alterations in afamin levels have been associated with various conditions, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and certain cancers, highlighting its potential importance in both physiological and pathological processes (Kim2012Afamin; Mihara2016Active; Dieplinger2015Afamin).

## Structure
Afamin (AFM) is a human glycoprotein with a molecular structure that exhibits a heart-shaped domain arrangement similar to human serum albumin (HSA). It consists of three structurally related domains, each approximately 190 residues in length. The structural similarity between afamin and albumin is notable, with root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) between domains I-II, I-III, and II-III being 2.7, 3.8, and 3.1 Å, respectively (Naschberger2017Structural). Afamin's structure is flexible, undergoing conformational changes upon ligand binding, which is influenced by crystal packing. This flexibility is particularly evident in domains I and III, which exhibit a 'breathing motion' that alters the opening of a deep primary cleft between them. This cleft serves as a major binding site, similar to the Sudlow-1 drug binding site in HSA, and is capable of accommodating lipids or acylated amino acid residues (Naschberger2017Structural).

Afamin is also characterized by its glycosylation patterns, which are more complex than those of insect cell-expressed afamin. However, these glycans are unlikely to play a significant role in Wnt3a-afamin interactions (Naschberger2017Structural). The N-glycome of afamin expressed in Sf21 cells predominantly features a paucimannose N-glycan (Man3GlcNAc2Fuc) (Naschberger2017Structural).

## Function
Afamin (AFM) is a glycoprotein primarily involved in the transport and homeostasis of vitamin E, specifically binding to α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol. It acts as a vitamin E carrier in plasma and other body fluids, particularly where the lipoprotein system is insufficient for vitamin E transport, such as in ovarian follicular and cerebrospinal fluids (Dieplinger2015Afamin; Voegele2002Characterization). Afamin is highly glycosylated, which contributes to its molecular heterogeneity, although the functional role of these glycans is not fully established (Jerkovic2005Afamin).

In addition to its role in vitamin E transport, afamin is involved in bone metabolism. It is secreted by nonresorbing osteoclasts and acts as a chemokine for preosteoblasts, promoting their migration via the Akt-signaling pathway. This function is crucial for bone remodeling, as it enhances osteoblast differentiation and increases the number of osteoblasts at the bone-forming surface (Kim2012Afamin). Afamin's activity in these processes suggests its involvement in maintaining bone health and potentially influencing bone turnover (kim2013afamin).

## Clinical Significance
Afamin (AFM) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels or interactions. Elevated levels of AFM have been associated with metabolic syndrome, which includes conditions such as high blood glucose, dyslipidemia, obesity, and high blood pressure. These associations suggest a potential role for AFM in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-eclampsia (Naschberger2017Structural). In the context of cancer, AFM expression is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, indicating a possible link between reduced AFM levels and liver dysfunction (Jerkovic2005Afamin). 

In papillary thyroid carcinoma, AFM over-expression has been shown to enhance glucose metabolism, potentially promoting tumor progression. This effect is particularly noted in the K1 thyroid cancer cell line, where AFM over-expression leads to increased activity of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and upregulation of glycolytic enzymes (Shen2016Afamin). 

AFM also plays a role in the transport and activity of Wnt proteins, which are crucial in various developmental and disease processes. Alterations in AFM's ability to bind and maintain the solubility of Wnt proteins could impact Wnt signaling pathways, potentially influencing conditions related to abnormal Wnt activity (Mihara2016Active).

## Interactions
Afamin (AFM) is known to interact with lipidated Wnt proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining their solubility and biological activity. It forms a stable 1:1 complex with Wnt3a, a member of the Wnt protein family, which is essential for the protein's solubility in aqueous solutions without the need for detergents (Mihara2016Active). This interaction is specific to afamin among the albumin family proteins, as it can bind and sequester the palmitoleic moiety of Wnt proteins, preventing their inactivation or aggregation (Mihara2016Active).

Afamin's interaction with Wnt proteins is not limited to Wnt3a; it can also solubilize and stabilize other Wnt proteins like Wnt5a, maintaining their biological activity (Mihara2016Active). The AFM-Wnt complexes are biologically active and capable of inducing signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in TCF reporter cells (Mihara2016Active). These interactions suggest that afamin acts as a secretion vehicle for Wnt proteins, enhancing their production and secretion when co-expressed in cells (Mihara2016Active). This role of afamin in Wnt protein interaction and transport highlights its potential importance in Wnt signaling pathways.
