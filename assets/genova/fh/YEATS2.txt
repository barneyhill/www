# YEATS2

## Overview
YEATS2 is a gene that encodes the protein YEATS domain containing 2, which is a critical component of the Ada-two-A-containing (ATAC) complex, a histone acetyltransferase complex involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The YEATS2 protein is characterized by its YEATS domain, which specifically recognizes acetylation on histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), facilitating the stabilization of the ATAC complex at target promoter regions and promoting gene expression. This protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication, and cell cycle progression, by influencing chromatin structure and gene activation. YEATS2 is also implicated in several cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Mi2017YEATS2; Du2024High). Additionally, mutations in YEATS2 have been linked to neurological disorders, further underscoring its biological significance (Yeetong2019TTTCA).

## Structure
The YEATS2 protein contains a YEATS domain, which is crucial for recognizing histone acetylation, specifically H3K27ac. The molecular structure of the YEATS domain was determined by crystallizing it bound to the H3 24-31 K27ac peptide, revealing an immunoglobulin β-sandwich fold composed of eight antiparallel β strands (Mi2017YEATS2). This domain features an aromatic sandwich cage formed by residues Y262 and W282, which clamp the acetylamide group of Kac, facilitating acetylation recognition (Mi2017YEATS2). The histone peptide-binding surface is formed by loops L3, L5, and L7, which are less negatively charged compared to other YEATS domains, contributing to its specific binding properties (Mi2017YEATS2).

The YEATS domain of YEATS2 is part of the ATAC complex, a histone acetyltransferase complex involved in gene activation (Mi2017YEATS2). The protein is 1422 amino acids long and is phosphorylated at three serine residues in response to DNA damage, suggesting a role in DNA repair processes (Schulze2009YEATS). The YEATS domain is located between amino acids 220 and 325, with a C-terminal folding domain involved in recruiting other ATAC complexes to promoter regions (Du2024High).

## Function
The YEATS2 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the Ada-two-A-containing (ATAC) complex, a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In healthy human cells, YEATS2 plays a role in maintaining normal transcriptional activity and cellular homeostasis. The YEATS domain of YEATS2 specifically recognizes acetylation on histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), which is associated with active transcription. This recognition helps stabilize the ATAC complex at target promoter regions, maintaining local histone acetylation and gene expression essential for cell growth and survival (Mi2017YEATS2).

YEATS2 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of essential genes, such as those encoding ribosomal proteins, and is implicated in processes like ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication, and cell cycle progression. In particular, YEATS2's interaction with acetylated histones is crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation, which may also be relevant in healthy cells (Mi2017YEATS2). The protein's function in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation is supported by its ability to bind acetylated histones, influencing chromatin structure and gene activation (Mi2017YEATS2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the YEATS2 gene have been implicated in several cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), YEATS2 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its high expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Liu2023Overexpression; Du2024High). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), YEATS2 is part of the ATAC complex, crucial for maintaining histone acetylation. Its amplification is linked to increased cancer cell growth, indicating its role as an oncogene in NSCLC (Mi2017YEATS2).

YEATS2 is also involved in pancreatic cancer, where it is a target of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α). Under hypoxic conditions, YEATS2 promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration, contributing to poor patient survival (Zeng2020YEATS2). In head and neck cancer, YEATS2 overexpression is linked to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing tumor progression (Pant2024Interplay).

Additionally, mutations in YEATS2, specifically TTTCA repeat expansions in intron 1, are associated with benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy type 4 (BAFME4), highlighting its role in neurological disorders (Yeetong2019TTTCA).

## Interactions
YEATS2 is a component of the Ada-two-A-containing (ATAC) complex, a histone acetyltransferase complex involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Within this complex, YEATS2 interacts with acetylated histone H3K27 (H3K27ac) through its YEATS domain, which is crucial for its function in promoting histone acetylation at gene promoters, particularly H3K9ac, and activating transcription of essential genes (Mi2017YEATS2). The interaction between YEATS2 and H3K27ac is characterized by a specific recognition signature, which is not present in H3K9ac, and is stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network and hydrophobic interactions (Mi2017YEATS2).

YEATS2 also plays a role in the recruitment of the ATAC complex to chromatin, maintaining histone acetylation levels necessary for gene expression and cancer cell proliferation (Mi2017YEATS2). The ATAC complex, including YEATS2, co-localizes with acetylated histones, as shown by ChIP-seq experiments, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Mi2017YEATS2). Additionally, YEATS2 has been implicated in interactions with the Myc oncoprotein, suggesting a role in regulating ribosomal protein gene expression in non-small cell lung cancer (Mi2017YEATS2).
