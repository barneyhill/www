# PTCD2

## Overview
PTCD2 is a gene that encodes the pentatricopeptide repeat domain 2 protein, which is categorized as a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein. This protein is primarily involved in the processing and regulation of mitochondrial RNA, playing a crucial role in the maturation of mitochondrial mRNA and tRNA junctions. The PTCD2 protein is essential for the proper processing of the 5' end of the Cyt b mRNA, and its disruption can lead to altered levels of mitochondrial mRNAs and precursor transcripts, thereby affecting mitochondrial gene expression and function (Lopez2011RNA). Additionally, PTCD2 influences the levels of mitochondrial long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are important for the formation of untranslated regions of mitochondrial mRNAs, further underscoring its role in mitochondrial RNA processing and stability (Rackham2011Long).

## Function
PTCD2 is a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein involved in the processing and regulation of mitochondrial RNA in human cells. It plays a significant role in the processing of mitochondrial mRNA and tRNA junctions, particularly affecting the 5' end of the Cyt b mRNA. Disruption in PTCD2 expression leads to decreased levels of Cyt b and ND5 mRNAs, while increasing the levels of the pre-processed ND5-Cyt b transcript, indicating its role in RNA processing (Lopez2011RNA).

PTCD2 also influences the levels of mitochondrial long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as ND5 lncRNA and lncND6 RNA, which are involved in forming the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of ND5 mRNA. Knockdown of PTCD2 results in decreased levels of these lncRNAs, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression by affecting precursor transcript processing (Rackham2011Long).

The protein is active in the mitochondria, where it may contribute to the stability or processing of mitochondrial lncRNAs, impacting mitochondrial function and gene expression regulation (Rackham2011Long). PTCD2's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining proper mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.
