# NEIL1

## Overview
The NEIL1 gene encodes the nei like DNA glycosylase 1, a crucial enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing oxidative DNA damage in mammalian cells. This enzyme is categorized as a DNA glycosylase and is involved in the excision of oxidized bases, such as thymine glycol and 5-hydroxyuracil, which are generated by oxidative stress (Dou2003Repair; Rosenquist2003The). NEIL1 exhibits both DNA glycosylase and β/δ lyase activities, facilitating the removal of damaged bases and the creation of single-nucleotide gaps in DNA (Tomar2023Base). The protein is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability across cellular compartments (Dizdaroglu2017Repair). NEIL1's interactions with replication-associated proteins, such as PCNA and FEN1, enhance its repair efficiency, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle (Odell2010Nonspecific). The enzyme's activity is vital for preventing mutagenesis and maintaining genomic integrity, with deficiencies leading to increased oxidative damage and mutation rates (Maiti2008Mutator).

## Structure
The NEIL1 protein is composed of two main domains: the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, connected by a linker. The N-terminal domain features an α-helix followed by a two-layer β-sandwich, each layer consisting of four antiparallel β-strands (Singh2017Human; Doublié2004The). This domain also includes a structural motif that mimics an antiparallel β-hairpin zinc finger, although it lacks the loops that bind zinc, resulting in a "zincless finger" motif crucial for its glycosylase activity (Doublié2004The).

The C-terminal domain is primarily helical and includes a helix-two-turns-helix (H2TH) DNA-binding motif, which is common among Fpg/Nei family members (Doublié2004The). This domain is intrinsically disordered and contributes to the protein's stability through intramolecular interactions. It also serves as an interaction interface with various repair proteins, enhancing NEIL1's role in DNA repair (Hegde2013The).

NEIL1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific serine residues, which are potential targets for the JNK1 kinase. These modifications do not significantly affect DNA binding or enzyme activity (Prakash2016Phosphorylation). The protein's structure is dynamic, allowing it to adopt multiple conformations, which is essential for its interactions with other proteins in the base excision repair pathway (Hegde2013The).

## Function
The NEIL1 gene encodes a DNA glycosylase enzyme that plays a critical role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is essential for repairing oxidative DNA damage in mammalian cells. NEIL1 is involved in the excision of oxidized bases such as thymine glycol, formamidopyrimidines, and 5-hydroxyuracil, which are generated by oxidative stress (Dou2003Repair; Rosenquist2003The). The enzyme exhibits both DNA glycosylase and β/δ lyase activities, allowing it to excise damaged bases and generate single-nucleotide gaps in DNA (Tomar2023Base).

NEIL1 is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, indicating its role in maintaining genomic stability across different cellular compartments (Dizdaroglu2017Repair). It is particularly active during the S phase of the cell cycle, suggesting a role in DNA replication and repair of lesions at replication forks (Odell2010Nonspecific). NEIL1 interacts with replication-associated proteins such as PCNA and FEN1, which may help recruit it to sites of damage and enhance its repair efficiency (Odell2010Nonspecific).

The enzyme's activity is crucial for preventing mutagenesis and maintaining the functional integrity of the genome, as its deficiency leads to increased oxidative damage and mutation rates (Maiti2008Mutator). NEIL1's role in protecting cells from genotoxic stress underscores its importance in cellular DNA repair mechanisms (Maiti2008Mutator).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NEIL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In gastric cancer, specific mutations such as p.Glu28del and c.936G>A have been identified, which impair DNA repair capabilities by affecting protein localization and activity. These mutations are not found in noncancerous tissues, suggesting a potential link to cancer development (Shinmura2004Inactivating). NEIL1 expression is also epigenetically silenced in several cancers, including breast invasive carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma, through promoter hypermethylation. This silencing is associated with poorer survival outcomes in some cancer types, indicating its role as a predictor of prognosis (Shinmura2016Abnormal).

In metabolic disorders, NEIL1 deficiency in mice leads to symptoms resembling metabolic syndrome, including obesity and fatty liver disease. This suggests a role for NEIL1 in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, potentially through its involvement in DNA repair and mitochondrial function (Vartanian2006The). NEIL1 mutations have also been linked to increased susceptibility to radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer patients, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms affecting the risk of developing this condition (Zheng2021Genetic).

## Interactions
NEIL1, a DNA glycosylase involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate DNA repair processes. It forms complexes with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which enhances NEIL1's enzymatic activity on DNA substrates, particularly in bubble or single-stranded regions (Dou2008Interaction). The interaction with PCNA is mediated by NEIL1's C-terminal domain, which is crucial for forming a stable complex even in the absence of DNA (Prakash2016Destabilization).

NEIL1 also interacts with replication protein A (RPA), a single-stranded DNA binding protein. This interaction regulates the excision of oxidative DNA base damage, with RPA modulating NEIL1's activity depending on the DNA structure (Theriot2010RPA). The interaction with RPA is enhanced under oxidative stress conditions, suggesting a role in responding to increased DNA damage (Theriot2010RPA).

Additionally, NEIL1 interacts with flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) in the context of long-patch BER, with PCNA further stimulating this process. This interaction is essential for NEIL1's role in replication-associated BER (Hegde2008Physical). The C-terminal domain of NEIL1, which is absent in its bacterial ortholog, is critical for these interactions, allowing NEIL1 to engage with multiple partners in the repair process (Hegde2013The).
