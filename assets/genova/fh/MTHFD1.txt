# MTHFD1

## Overview
The MTHFD1 gene encodes a trifunctional enzyme known as methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, cyclohydrolase, and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase 1, which plays a pivotal role in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. This enzyme is crucial for the synthesis of DNA bases and the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, processes essential for DNA replication and repair (Kamynina2017Arsenic; Field2014Nuclear). The MTHFD1 protein is categorized as a cytoplasmic enzyme that translocates to the nucleus during the S-phase of the cell cycle, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Field2014Nuclear). Structurally, it is a homodimer with distinct domains responsible for its enzymatic activities, and it interacts with various proteins, linking folate metabolism to broader cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation and cancer biology (Sdelci2019MTHFD1; Desai2017Computational). Mutations in the MTHFD1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, including congenital heart defects and neural tube defects, underscoring its significance in human health (Christensen2009The; Jiang2014Association).

## Structure
The MTHFD1 protein is a trifunctional enzyme involved in folate metabolism, consisting of a single polypeptide chain with 935 amino acids (Hum1988Primary). Its primary structure is encoded by a cDNA with a coding region of 2805 base pairs (Hum1988Primary). The protein is a homodimer of approximately 100 kDa, with two major domains: an N-terminal domain responsible for dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities, and a C-terminal domain for synthetase activity (Hum1988Primary; Desai2017Computational).

The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a compact, globular tertiary structure. The quaternary structure is typically monomeric, although it functions as a homodimer (Desai2017Computational). The enzyme contains a NAD(P)+-binding domain of the Rossmann fold superfamily in the C-terminal half, which is crucial for its catalytic function (Groth2016MTHFD1).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are common, affecting the enzyme's activity and stability (Buchler2024Evidence). The protein's structure is described as a mosaic of functional domains, and it can be proteolytically cleaved into active domains with specific activities (Hum1988Primary). Splice variants may exist, potentially influencing its enzymatic activity and stability (Desai2017Computational).

## Function
The MTHFD1 gene encodes a trifunctional enzyme that plays a crucial role in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, which is essential for the synthesis of DNA bases and the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (Field2014Nuclear). This enzyme catalyzes three sequential reactions: methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activities, which are vital for the conversion of tetrahydrofolate into its derivatives (Kamynina2017Arsenic; Burda2015Characterization). These reactions are critical for the de novo synthesis of purines and thymidylate, necessary for DNA replication and repair (Desai2017Computational).

In healthy human cells, MTHFD1 is active in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus during the S-phase of the cell cycle to support de novo thymidylate biosynthesis, which is crucial for maintaining a pool of deoxythymidine triphosphate nucleotides necessary for DNA synthesis (Kamynina2017Arsenic; Field2014Nuclear). This nuclear localization is particularly important during folate deficiency, as it helps protect DNA by limiting uracil misincorporation (Field2014Nuclear). Mitochondrially derived formate serves as the primary source of one-carbon units for these processes, highlighting the enzyme's role in maintaining genomic stability and normal cellular function (Kamynina2017Arsenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MTHFD1 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions due to its critical role in folate metabolism. MTHFD1 deficiency, a rare genetic disorder, is characterized by symptoms such as hyperhomocysteinemia, megaloblastic anemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This deficiency results from mutations in the MTHFD1 gene, including missense and splice site mutations, which disrupt folate metabolism and lead to severe metabolic and immune disorders (Burda2015Characterization).

The p.Arg653Gln variant of MTHFD1 has been linked to an increased risk of congenital heart defects (CHD) and neural tube defects (NTD). This variant reduces enzyme stability and activity, particularly affecting purine synthesis during embryonic development, and is associated with a higher risk of heart defects such as Tetralogy of Fallot and aortic stenosis (Christensen2009The).

The MTHFD1 G1958A polymorphism is also associated with an increased risk of NTDs, particularly in mothers with affected offspring. This polymorphism may contribute to pregnancy complications, including severe abruptio placentae and unexplained second trimester loss (Jiang2014Association; Meng2015Association).

## Interactions
MTHFD1 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular metabolism and regulation. One of the key interactions is with 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR). This interaction is supported by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses, which confirmed the presence of MTHFD1 in samples immunoprecipitated with MTHFR. The interaction is further validated by 3D modeling using AlphaFold, suggesting a potential complex where the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain of MTHFD1 is positioned adjacent to the catalytic domain of MTHFR. This spatial arrangement may facilitate the transfer of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate from MTHFD1 to MTHFR, indicating a substrate channelling mechanism (Buchler2024Evidence).

MTHFD1 also interacts with BRD4, a protein involved in transcriptional regulation. This interaction is influenced by acetylated lysine residues on MTHFD1, which affect its binding to BRD4. The interaction links folate metabolism to transcriptional regulation, as demonstrated by peptide microarrays and molecular modeling studies (Sdelci2019MTHFD1).

Additionally, MTHFD1 interacts with PRMT5, an enzyme that methylates arginine residues. This interaction enhances anoikis resistance and cancer metastasis, highlighting the role of MTHFD1 in cancer biology (Meng2022Arginine).
