# CCR1

## Overview
The CCR1 gene encodes the C-C motif chemokine receptor 1, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to the immune system's response to inflammation. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is primarily expressed on immune cells such as monocytes, T cells, and dendritic cells. CCR1 plays a pivotal role in mediating leukocyte migration to sites of tissue damage or infection by interacting with chemokines like CCL3 and CCL5. It is involved in various immune processes, including the arrest of monocytes and T cells on inflamed endothelium, T cell activation, and macrophage function. The receptor's activity is also crucial for the regulation of myeloid progenitor cell proliferation. Alterations in CCR1 expression or function have been linked to several diseases, including hepatic fibrosis, Behçet's disease, and Chagas heart disease, underscoring its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Weber2001Specialized; Seki2009CCR1; Nakano2018GWASidentified; Gladue2006The; Broxmeyer1999Dominant; Batista2018Genetic).

## Structure
The CCR1 protein is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices. These helices form the core of the receptor's secondary structure, which is typical for GPCRs (Vaidehi2006Predictions). The primary structure of CCR1 includes specific amino acid sequences that contribute to the formation of these helices, with key residues such as Tyr-113, Tyr-114, and Ile-259 playing significant roles in ligand binding (Vaidehi2006Predictions).

The tertiary structure of CCR1 involves the arrangement of these helices in a three-dimensional space, creating a binding pocket for ligands. This pocket is located between transmembrane segments 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, and is involved in the binding of antagonists like BX 471 (Vaidehi2006Predictions). The quaternary structure of CCR1 may involve dimerization or oligomerization, which is common among GPCRs, although specific details for CCR1 are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are likely to occur, influencing the receptor's function and signaling capabilities, although specific modifications for CCR1 are not detailed in the provided context. The receptor's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in immune response and as a therapeutic target.

## Function
CCR1 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in the immune system by mediating the migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. It is expressed on various immune cells, including monocytes, T cells, dendritic cells, and sometimes neutrophils (Gladue2006The). CCR1 interacts with multiple chemokines, such as CCL3 and CCL5, which are involved in chemotactic activity, guiding immune cells to areas of tissue damage or infection (Weber2001Specialized; Gladue2006The).

CCR1 is particularly important in the initial arrest of monocytes and T H 1-like/CD45RO+ T cells on inflamed endothelium, a process that is crucial for effective immune surveillance and response (Weber2001Specialized). It also plays a role in enhancing T cell activation, regulating Th1/Th2 cytokine polarization, and stimulating macrophage function and protease secretion, which are vital for managing inflammation and tissue repair (Gladue2006The).

In addition to its role in immune cell migration, CCR1 is involved in the regulation of myeloid progenitor cell proliferation and mobilization, particularly in response to macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α (Broxmeyer1999Dominant). This receptor's activity is crucial for maintaining healthy blood cell levels and ensuring an adequate immune response.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CCR1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In hepatic fibrosis, CCR1 is upregulated in both murine and human fibrotic livers, particularly in Kupffer cells, which are crucial for fibrogenesis. Blocking CCR1 activity can prevent fibrosis, and CCR1-deficient mice show reduced fibrosis markers, indicating its significant role in liver scarring (Seki2009CCR1).

In Behçet's disease (BD), CCR1 is identified as a susceptibility gene. Low expression of CCR1 is associated with increased BD risk, and BD-derived M1 macrophages exhibit higher CCR1 surface expression compared to healthy controls. This suggests that CCR1 contributes to M1 macrophage-predominant inflammation in BD, with impaired M2 macrophage function leading to persistent inflammation (Nakano2018GWASidentified).

In Chagas heart disease, CCR1+ cells, along with a genetic variant of CCL5, confer protection against chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. The CCL5-CCR1 axis is involved in cell recruitment and migration to heart tissue, influencing the pathogenesis of cardiac conditions (Batista2018Genetic). These findings highlight the diverse roles of CCR1 in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CCR1 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various chemokines and proteins, playing a significant role in immune cell signaling and inflammatory responses. CCR1 interacts with its ligand CCL15 through a complex mechanism involving multiple sites. The binding is described by a 'two-site' model, where the N terminus of CCR1 interacts with the globular core of CCL15 at CRS1, and the N terminus of CCL15 inserts into the transmembrane domain of CCR1 at CRS2. An additional interaction site, CRS3, involves the β1-β2 strands and the 30s loop of CCL15 interacting with extracellular loops and transmembrane segments of CCR1 (Shao2021Identification).

CCR1 also engages in interactions with β-arrestin-2, which is crucial for receptor desensitization and internalization. This interaction is measured using Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assays, indicating ligand-induced recruitment of β-arrestin-2 to CCR1 (Sanchez2019Evaluation). The receptor's activation leads to downstream effects such as the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and modulation of intracellular cAMP levels, highlighting its role in cellular signaling pathways (Sanchez2019Evaluation). CCR1's interactions with G proteins are assessed through G protein activation assays, which measure the dissociation of trimeric G proteins upon receptor activation (Sanchez2019Evaluation).
