# TAFA1

## Overview
TAFA1, also known as FAM19A1, is a gene that encodes the protein TAFA chemokine-like family member 1, which is part of the chemokine-like protein family. This protein is primarily involved in neuronal synapse organization and signaling, functioning as a secreted protein that interacts with presynaptic adhesion molecules such as neurexins. These interactions are crucial for the transport and stabilization of TAFA1 on the extracellular surface of neurons, where it plays a role in forming transsynaptic bridges and modulating synaptic communication (Thivaios2024A; Sarver2021FAM19A). TAFA1's involvement in these processes suggests its importance in maintaining synaptic integrity and neuronal signaling pathways. Additionally, TAFA1 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including central nervous system tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Lee2023Tumor; Minami2005Hepatitis; Climent2007Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
TAFA1, also known as TAFA-1, has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and potential involvement in pathological processes. In pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors, TAFA1 is one of the top differentially expressed genes, particularly in glioneuronal/neuronal tumors. These tumors are associated with extracellular matrix and integrin-related processes, as well as MET signaling, suggesting a role for TAFA1 in tumor biology (Lee2023Tumor; Lee2024Identifying).

In the context of liver disease, TAFA-1 expression has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases, particularly in non-tumorous tissues. This suggests a potential role in liver conditions, possibly linked to hepatitis B virus (HBV) integration and hepatocarcinogenesis (Minami2005Hepatitis).

TAFA1 has also been implicated in breast cancer progression. It is identified as a candidate gene within chromosomal regions associated with breast cancer, indicating its potential involvement in tumor development and progression (van2006ArrayCGH; Climent2007Characterization).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TAFA1 in various cancers and suggest that alterations in its expression or function may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Further research is needed to elucidate its precise role in these conditions.

## Interactions
TAFA1, also known as FAM19A1, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in neuronal synapse organization and signaling. It interacts with neurexins, which are presynaptic adhesion molecules, forming stable complexes via intermolecular disulfide bonds during biosynthesis and transport. This interaction is significant for the transport of TAFA1 to the extracellular surface of neurons and is enhanced in the presence of neurexins (Sarver2021FAM19A). TAFA1 is also part of larger assemblies with robust protein-protein interactions, including its incorporation into the NRX-T178-PTPR core module, which establishes stable transsynaptic bridges linking pre-and post-synaptic membrane proteins (Thivaios2024A). 

TAFA1 is mentioned as one of the secreted proteins that attach to the NRX-T178-PTPR core module via covalent bonding, helping stabilize the presynaptic platform and establishing linkages between the core module and components of the post-synaptic membrane (Thivaios2024A). These interactions highlight TAFA1's role in synaptic communication and organization, suggesting its involvement in the modulation of synaptic protein networks and neuronal signaling pathways.
