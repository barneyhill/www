# USP8

## Overview
USP8, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 8, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, signaling pathways, and cellular homeostasis. The protein product of USP8 is categorized as a deubiquitinating enzyme, which plays a crucial role in modulating the ubiquitination status of target proteins, thereby influencing their stability, function, and intracellular trafficking. USP8 is particularly significant in the regulation of autophagy, transporter activity, and intercellular communication. It interacts with key proteins such as SQSTM1/p62, connexin 43, and receptor tyrosine kinases, impacting processes like autophagy, cell communication, and cancer pathogenesis. Clinically, mutations in the USP8 gene are associated with Cushing's disease, highlighting its importance in endocrine disorders and potential as a therapeutic target (Ma2015Recurrent; Islam2021The; Peng2019The).

## Structure
USP8, also known as ubiquitin specific peptidase 8, is a deubiquitinating enzyme with a complex molecular structure that includes several functional domains. The catalytic domain of USP8 is located on the C-terminal side and comprises the Cys-box and His-box, which together form a single catalytic core essential for its enzymatic activity (Islam2021The). The N-terminal region of USP8 contains the microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain, Rhodanese homology (RH) domain, STAM binding motifs (SBM1, SBM2, SBM3), and a 14-3-3 binding motif (14-3-3 BM). These domains are involved in the recruitment of USP8 to the endosomal sorting machinery and in modulating its interactions with other proteins (Islam2021The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at the 14-3-3 binding motif, play a crucial role in regulating USP8's catalytic activity. Mutations in this motif can enhance deubiquitinating activity, contributing to tumor growth (Islam2021The). USP8 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its structure and interactions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and domain organization are critical for its role in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and signaling pathways.

## Function
USP8 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in regulating protein degradation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is involved in the deubiquitination of several key proteins, influencing their stability, function, and trafficking within the cell. USP8 directly interacts with SQSTM1/p62, a scaffold protein involved in autophagy, by removing ubiquitin chains, particularly at the K420 site. This action stabilizes SQSTM1 and modulates its autophagic activity, acting as a negative regulator of basal autophagy (Peng2019The).

USP8 also regulates the human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1) by deubiquitinating it, which enhances its expression and transport activity on the cell surface. This regulation is crucial for the proper functioning of hOAT1 in drug transport and pharmacokinetics (Zhang2020Ubiquitinspecific).

In addition to its role in autophagy and transporter regulation, USP8 is involved in the deubiquitination of connexin 43 (Cx43), a protein essential for intercellular communication via gap junctions. By stabilizing Cx43, USP8 supports cellular communication and may influence cancer pathogenesis (Sun2018The). USP8's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and endosomes, where it influences various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the USP8 gene are significantly associated with Cushing's disease, particularly in ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas. These mutations are often found in exon 14 and disrupt the interaction between USP8 and 14-3-3 proteins, leading to enhanced deubiquitinase activity. This results in decreased degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), increased EGFR signaling, and elevated ACTH production, contributing to the pathogenesis of Cushing's disease (Ma2015Recurrent; PerezRivas2015The). USP8 mutations are more prevalent in female patients and are associated with smaller tumor size but higher ACTH secretion (Ma2015Recurrent; Ballmann2018USP8).

These mutations are also linked to altered cortisol and ACTH responses, with some studies suggesting a favorable phenotype characterized by smaller tumors and higher clinical remission rates, although recurrence rates can be higher (Bujko2021Differential; TorresMorán2023Hotspots). The presence of USP8 mutations in corticotroph tumors suggests potential therapeutic targets, with USP8 inhibitors showing promise in reducing cell proliferation and ACTH secretion in vitro (Ma2015Recurrent; TorresMorán2023Hotspots). Additionally, a germline USP8 variant has been linked to recurrent pediatric Cushing's disease, indicating potential systemic effects of USP8 alterations (TorresMorán2023Hotspots).

## Interactions
USP8 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 8) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with SQSTM1/p62, a scaffold protein involved in autophagy, by deubiquitinating it, which suppresses its autophagic activity. This interaction is crucial for regulating SQSTM1's function in autophagy, particularly at the K420 site, which is within the UBA domain of SQSTM1 (Peng2019The).

USP8 also interacts with Connexin-43 (Cx43), a protein involved in cell communication, by deubiquitinating and stabilizing it, thereby preventing its degradation through the autophagic pathway (Sun2018The). In cancer, USP8 stabilizes receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, and MET, which are involved in promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival. This stabilization is achieved by inhibiting their ubiquitination and degradation, thus activating downstream signaling pathways like STAT3, ERK, and pAKt (Islam2021The).

USP8's interaction with the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) stabilizes it, enhancing Notch-dependent signaling pathways crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation (Islam2021The). These interactions highlight USP8's role in modulating protein stability and signaling pathways, impacting various cellular functions and disease processes.
