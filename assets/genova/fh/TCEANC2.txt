# TCEANC2

## Overview
The TCEANC2 gene encodes the protein transcription elongation factor A N-terminal and central domain containing 2, which functions as a transcription elongation factor involved in the elongation phase of transcription by RNA polymerase II. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a crucial role in modulating transcriptional processes, potentially influencing cellular functions such as growth and differentiation. While the specific roles of TCEANC2 in normal human physiology are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including Parkinson's disease, hearing loss, and bone metabolism. The gene is also associated with epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, in response to environmental factors, which may impact its expression and function (Bakulski2015Prenatal; Reyes2015Novel; Beecham2015PARK10).

## Function
The TCEANC2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcription elongation factor, which is involved in the elongation phase of transcription by RNA polymerase II. This protein plays a role in modulating transcriptional processes, potentially impacting cellular functions such as growth and differentiation. Although the specific function of TCEANC2 in healthy human cells is not well-studied, it is known to be associated with DNA methylation changes in response to environmental factors, such as prenatal mercury exposure. These methylation changes occur in a differentially methylated region (DMR) within the TCEANC2 gene, which spans over 400 base pairs and includes exon 5 and the 3' untranslated region (UTR) (Bakulski2015Prenatal). The TCEANC2 protein is located near other genes, such as mir4781 and TMEM59, which have been implicated in various biological processes, including Alzheimer's disease (Bakulski2015Prenatal). Despite its involvement in transcription regulation, the direct relationship between TCEANC2 DNA methylation and gene expression has not been established in available cord blood RNA samples, suggesting that expression changes might occur at different developmental stages or in different tissues (Bakulski2015Prenatal).

## Clinical Significance
The TCEANC2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In Parkinson's disease (PD), the TCEANC2 gene is located within the PARK10 locus, which has been associated with an increased risk of PD. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10788972 in TCEANC2 is strongly linked to PD risk, although it did not reach genome-wide significance in some studies (Beecham2015PARK10; Boros2019Assessment). 

In the context of hearing loss, a variant in TCEANC2 has been associated with better hearing thresholds, suggesting a potential protective role, although the clinical significance of this finding is not fully detailed (Lewis2023Accurate). 

TCEANC2 has also been studied in relation to bone and calcium metabolism. It is identified as a candidate gene influencing calcium absorption and bone mass in response to dietary calcium intake in mice, indicating its role in bone health (Reyes2015Novel).

Additionally, TCEANC2 is involved in epigenetic regulation related to myocardial infarction, with specific DNA methylation changes affecting its expression (WardCaviness2018Analysis). In metaplastic breast carcinomas, TCEANC2 is part of a fusion transcript, although its clinical implications remain unclear (Piscuoglio2016Abstract).
