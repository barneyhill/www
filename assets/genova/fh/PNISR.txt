# PNISR

## Overview
PNISR is a gene that encodes the PNN interacting serine and arginine rich protein, which is primarily involved in RNA splicing and processing. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor due to its role in influencing alternative splicing events, which are crucial for generating protein diversity from a single gene. PNISR is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other splicing factors and proteins, such as PNN, to regulate RNA maturation and processing. These interactions are essential for various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression and differentiation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting complex regulatory networks. The involvement of PNISR in these processes underscores its importance in normal cellular and organismal development, as well as its potential implications in disease contexts such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (Wang2022Prognostic; Wu2022The).

## Function
PNISR (PNN interacting serine and arginine rich protein) is involved in RNA splicing and processing, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. It interacts with splicing factors, influencing alternative splicing events, which are essential for generating protein diversity from a single gene. This protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the precise control of RNA maturation and processing. Through its involvement in these molecular processes, PNISR impacts various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression and differentiation. These activities are vital for normal cellular and organismal development, ensuring that cells can properly divide and differentiate into specialized types. The role of PNISR in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting the complex regulatory networks that govern cell function and development.

## Interactions
PNISR (PNN interacting serine and arginine rich protein) is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions, primarily related to RNA splicing and processing. It is known to interact with PNN (pinin), a protein associated with nuclear and cell adhesion functions, and plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing (Wang2022Prognostic). PNISR is part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes other splicing factors such as RBM39, DDX39B, SF3B1, and SRSF11, which are involved in RNA splicing or processing (Wang2022Prognostic). 

In the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), PNISR has been identified as a hub gene within a protein-protein interaction network, suggesting its involvement in the pathophysiology of PAH through interactions that may influence cell proliferation (Wu2022The). Additionally, PNISR has been identified as an interactor with the lipid phosphatase SHIP in B cells, indicating a potential role in SHIP's function or regulation, although the specific nature of this interaction is not detailed (Manno2016The). These interactions highlight PNISR's significant role in various cellular processes, particularly those involving RNA splicing and cell proliferation.
