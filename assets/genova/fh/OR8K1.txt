# OR8K1

## Overview
The OR8K1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily K member 1, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral to the olfactory system, facilitating the detection and transduction of odorant signals through their characteristic seven-transmembrane domain structure (Wang2020Genome-Wide; cvicek2015structure). OR8K1 is expressed primarily in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odor molecules, initiating a cascade of intracellular events that culminate in the perception of smell (Wang2020Genome-Wide). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR8K1 has been implicated in various cellular processes and has been noted for its potential involvement in lung cancer due to hypomethylation patterns observed in cancerous tissues (Goldmann2021DNA). Despite these associations, the precise physiological functions of OR8K1 in non-olfactory tissues remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure
The OR8K1 protein is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure allows the protein to traverse the cell membrane, facilitating its role in odor detection and signal transduction (Wang2020Genome-Wide; cvicek2015structure). The olfactory receptors, including OR8K1, are part of the largest multigene family in vertebrates, with a substantial number of coding genes organized in clusters on chromosomes, which can pose challenges in mapping due to their clustering (Stafuzza2017Single).

The primary structure of OR8K1, like other GPCRs, includes sequences that form the transmembrane helices, which are crucial for its function. These helices are involved in forming the receptor's tertiary structure, which is essential for ligand binding and signal transduction (cvicek2015structure). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its function and localization (Wang2020Genome-Wide). These modifications are common in GPCRs and play a role in their stability and activity. The OR8K1 protein does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer.

## Function
The OR8K1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Wang2020Genome-Wide). The olfactory receptors, including OR8K1, are involved in various cellular processes such as cell-cell recognition, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis, although their specific function in lung tissue remains speculative (Goldmann2021DNA). 

In the context of cancer, OR8K1 has been identified as one of the genes with hypomethylated loci in lung cancer samples, suggesting a potential role in carcinogenesis (Goldmann2021DNA). Despite its primary role in olfactory signal transduction, variations in OR genes, including OR8K1, have been associated with species-specific adaptations, indicating a broader functional significance beyond olfaction (Wang2020Genome-Wide). However, the specific function of OR8K1 in healthy human cells is not detailed in the available literature, leaving some aspects of its role in normal physiology unclear.
