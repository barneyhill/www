# FGF11

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 11 (FGF11) is a gene that encodes an intracellular protein belonging to the fibroblast growth factor family, which is known for its involvement in a variety of cellular processes, including development, growth, and repair. Unlike other members of the FGF family, the protein encoded by FGF11 does not activate fibroblast growth factor receptors and functions independently within cells (Itoh2007The). FGF11 is particularly significant in the context of hypoxic conditions, where it plays a crucial role in processes such as bone resorption and angiogenesis. It is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), which enhances its expression under low oxygen levels, thereby contributing to cellular adaptation and tissue remodeling (Knowles2017HypoxiaInduced; YANG2015Hypoxiainduced). Additionally, FGF11 has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yin2023Fibroblast; Wu2021Fibroblast).

## Function
FGF11 (fibroblast growth factor 11) is an intracellular protein that plays a role in various cellular processes, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Unlike other FGFs, FGF11 does not activate FGF receptors and functions independently within cells (Itoh2007The). In osteoclasts, FGF11 is involved in bone resorption processes under low oxygen levels, where its expression is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α). This regulation leads to increased FGF11 mRNA and protein levels, contributing to hypoxia-induced bone resorption (Knowles2017HypoxiaInduced). FGF11 localizes to the peri-nuclear region in hypoxic osteoclasts, suggesting a role in cellular organization related to microtubule arrangements (Knowles2017HypoxiaInduced).

In endothelial cells, FGF11 is upregulated under hypoxic conditions and promotes the formation of capillary-like tube structures, which are essential for angiogenesis. This process is facilitated by the increased expression of tight junction proteins, enhancing cell-cell adhesion and stabilizing capillary structures (YANG2015Hypoxiainduced). FGF11's role in these processes highlights its importance in cellular adaptation to hypoxic environments and its potential involvement in tissue remodeling and development.

## Clinical Significance
Fibroblast growth factor 11 (FGF11) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), FGF11 is overexpressed in platinum-resistant tissues, contributing to poor survival outcomes. Its upregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. The regulation of FGF11 by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) in hypoxic tumor environments further contributes to drug resistance, suggesting that targeting the HIF-1α/FGF11 signaling axis could be a therapeutic strategy (Yin2023Fibroblast).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FGF11 is upregulated and linked to poor prognosis. It promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and its expression is negatively regulated by miR-525-5p. The hypoxia signaling pathway, influenced by FGF11, plays a significant role in NSCLC progression, indicating that FGF11 could be a potential therapeutic target (Wu2021Fibroblast).

FGF11 is also associated with poor survival outcomes in HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). High levels of FGF11 correlate with worse overall and disease-specific survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in this cancer type (Flon2023High).

## Interactions
Fibroblast Growth Factor 11 (FGF11) is known to interact with the nuclear receptor FXRα, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression. FGF11 inhibits the transactivation of the HBV promoter by FXRα, which is activated by specific ligands such as GW4064 and CDCA. This interaction results in decreased expression of HBV genes, including the HBx protein, by reducing the stability of the FXRα protein and interfering with its ability to bind to DNA and regulate gene expression (Seong2023Fibroblast).

FGF11's role in endothelial cells under hypoxic conditions involves its regulation by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). HIF-1α binds to hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the FGF11 promoter region, enhancing FGF11 expression. Although the study does not provide direct evidence of physical interactions between FGF11 and other proteins or nucleic acids, it suggests that FGF11 may influence the expression of tight junction proteins such as occludin, ZO-1, and claudin-5, which are crucial for stabilizing capillary structures (YANG2015Hypoxiainduced).

In the context of cancer, FGF11 is associated with the hypoxia signaling pathway, regulated by HIF-1α, and is involved in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) (Yin2023Fibroblast; Wu2021Fibroblast).
