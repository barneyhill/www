# DYRK1A

## Overview
The DYRK1A gene encodes the protein dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A, which is a member of the CMGC group of eukaryotic protein kinases. This kinase is characterized by its ability to phosphorylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, a feature that distinguishes it as a dual-specificity kinase (Ananthapadmanabhan2023Insights). DYRK1A plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, neuronal differentiation, and apoptosis, and is involved in the assembly of the DREAM complex, which is essential for cellular quiescence (Litovchick2011DYRK1A). The protein is implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders, such as mental retardation autosomal dominant 7 (MRD7) and Down syndrome, due to its critical functions in brain development and its location on chromosome 21 (Arbones2019DYRK1A; Widowati2018Functional). DYRK1A's interactions with various proteins and its involvement in complex signaling pathways underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper neurogenesis (Soppa2014The).

## Structure
DYRK1A is a protein kinase characterized by a conserved Tyr-Xaa-Tyr motif in its catalytic domain, similar to the activation motif found in the MAP kinase family (HIMPEL2001Identification). The primary structure of DYRK1A includes a catalytic domain that spans amino acids 159-479, which shows structural conservation with ERK2, a member of the MAP kinase family (HIMPEL2001Identification). The secondary structure of DYRK1A includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with a significant insertion of 21 amino acids between the αG and αH helices (HIMPEL2001Identification).

The tertiary structure of DYRK1A forms a three-dimensional shape crucial for its function, with a conserved Pj1 specificity pocket important for substrate binding (HIMPEL2001Identification). The activation loop contains a Tyr-X-Tyr motif, with Tyr-321 being a critical autophosphorylation site necessary for enzymatic activity (Wiechmann2003Unusual). Gln-323, located near Tyr-321, is essential for maintaining the active conformation of the kinase domain (Wiechmann2003Unusual).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Tyr-321, are crucial for DYRK1A's activity (HIMPEL2001Identification). DYRK1A also contains a cluster of negatively charged amino acids, a motif conserved within the DYRK family (HIMPEL2001Identification). The protein is implicated in various cellular processes and diseases, making it a target for drug development (Li2016Insights).

## Function
The DYRK1A gene encodes a protein kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, transcription, DNA repair, and apoptosis. It is part of the CMGC group of eukaryotic protein kinases and is classified as a nuclear or Class I DYRK, localizing in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Ananthapadmanabhan2023Insights). DYRK1A is involved in the assembly of the DREAM complex, which is crucial for promoting cellular quiescence and senescence. It phosphorylates the LIN52 subunit of the MuvB core, facilitating the binding of p130 and the assembly of the DREAM complex, essential for cells to enter the G0 growth-arrested state (Litovchick2011DYRK1A).

In neuronal cells, DYRK1A promotes differentiation by inducing G1-phase arrest and G0 cell cycle exit. It phosphorylates cell cycle proteins such as p27 Kip1 and Cyclin D1, stabilizing p27 Kip1 and leading to the degradation of Cyclin D1, which contributes to cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation (Soppa2014The). DYRK1A also plays a role in regulating body growth and brain physiology, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis (Guo2010DYRK1A). Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper neurogenesis, balancing proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors (Soppa2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DYRK1A gene are associated with several neurological and developmental disorders. DYRK1A haploinsufficiency, often due to truncation mutations, microdeletions, or missense variants, leads to a condition known as mental retardation autosomal dominant 7 (MRD7). This syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, developmental delay, seizures, speech problems, and autism spectrum disorder-related deficits (Luco2016Case; Widowati2018Functional). 

DYRK1A is also implicated in Down syndrome, where its overexpression is linked to cognitive impairments. This is due to its location on chromosome 21, within the Down syndrome critical region (Arbones2019DYRK1A; Bronicki2015Ten). 

Patients with DYRK1A mutations often present with a distinct set of physical and neurological abnormalities, including facial dysmorphisms, feeding difficulties, and vision defects (Luco2016Case; Méjécase2021Ocular). The gene's role in brain development is significant, affecting neuronal proliferation and synaptic transmission, which contributes to the observed phenotypes in affected individuals (Courcet2012TheDYRK1Agene). 

Overall, DYRK1A mutations and expression alterations are linked to a broad spectrum of developmental and physical challenges, highlighting its critical role in neurodevelopmental processes.

## Interactions
DYRK1A is a protein kinase that engages in numerous interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with the adaptor protein DCAF7, which facilitates the association of DYRK1A with other proteins such as HIPK2 and the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of E1A, which is necessary for its interaction with FOXK1/2 transcription factors, thereby inhibiting oncogenic transformation (Glenewinkel2016The). DCAF7 also acts as a scaffold for protein interactions, coordinating signaling complexes and playing a role in gene expression regulation by recruiting DYRK1A to RNA Polymerase II (Ananthapadmanabhan2023Insights).

DYRK1A forms a complex with FAM53C and DCAF7/WDR68, where FAM53C binds directly to DYRK1A, inhibiting its autophosphorylation and kinase activity on substrates like MAPT/Tau (Miyata2023Identification). DYRK1A also interacts with RNF169, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is involved in the DNA damage response. This interaction is significant for the recruitment of DYRK1A to DNA damage-induced foci, suggesting a role in maintaining cell homeostasis (Roewenstrunk2019A).

DYRK1A's interactions extend to viral proteins, where it stabilizes HPV16 E7 proteins, enhancing their transforming activity, while restraining the activity of Adenovirus E1A and low-risk HPV E6 proteins (Ananthapadmanabhan2023Insights). These interactions highlight DYRK1A's involvement in complex biological roles, including post-translational modifications and signaling cascades.
