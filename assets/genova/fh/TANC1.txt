# TANC1

## Overview
TANC1 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat, and coiled-coil containing 1, which functions primarily as a scaffold protein within synaptic structures. This protein is characterized by its complex molecular architecture, including ankyrin repeats, tetratricopeptide repeat domains, and a coiled-coil region, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and synaptic organization (Han2010Regulation; Gasparini2017Dynamic). TANC1 is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus, a critical region for learning and memory, where it contributes to the regulation of dendritic spines and excitatory synapses (Gasparini2017Dynamic). The protein is involved in several signaling pathways, such as the glutamate receptor and Hippo pathways, which are essential for neuron projection and differentiation (Gasparini2017Dynamic). Clinically, mutations and altered expression of TANC1 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, liver injury, and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its significance in both neural and systemic health (Huang2022Association; Wu2021TANC1).

## Structure
The TANC1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains ankyrin (ANK) repeats, tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, and a coiled-coil region. The ANK repeats, which are conserved motifs of approximately 33 residues, form a linear solenoid structure that facilitates protein-protein interactions. TANC1 has eleven ankyrin repeats, which exhibit a regular pattern, suggesting divergent evolution from TANC2 (Gasparini2017Dynamic). The TPR domains, composed of 34 residues each, are involved in protein complex assembly and are highly conserved among orthologous sequences. TANC1 is predicted to contain three TPR repeats, with a C-terminal capping helix that stabilizes the TPR fold (Gasparini2017Dynamic).

The N- and C-terminal regions of TANC1 are intrinsically disordered, with the N-terminus containing motifs involved in ubiquitin-dependent degradation and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) docking (Gasparini2017Dynamic). The C-terminal region includes a PDZ binding motif, crucial for interactions with proteins like PSD95, and contains predicted binding sites for MAPK and WW domains (Gasparini2017Dynamic). TANC1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions.

## Function
TANC1 encodes a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and function in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of dendritic spines and excitatory synapses, which are essential for synaptic connectivity and neural communication (Han2010Regulation). TANC1 interacts with PSD-95 and other postsynaptic proteins, including glutamate receptors, and is expressed predominantly in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for learning and memory (Gasparini2017Dynamic). The protein contains multiple domains for protein-protein interactions, such as ankyrin repeats, tetratricopeptide repeats, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif, which suggest its function as a scaffold/adaptor protein (Han2010Regulation).

In terms of molecular processes, TANC1 is involved in various signaling pathways, including the glutamate receptor pathway, planar cell polarity signaling, and the Hippo pathway, which are important for neuron projection, extension, and differentiation (Gasparini2017Dynamic). Overexpression of TANC1 has been shown to increase dendritic spine density and excitatory synapse strength, indicating its role in synaptic plasticity (Yang2019Purification). TANC1 is also implicated in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of synapses, which is crucial for proper neural communication and cognitive functions (Yang2019Purification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TANC1 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ADLI), TANC1 has been identified as a hypermethylated gene with lower expression levels in affected patients. This altered expression is negatively correlated with liver enzymes ALT and AST, suggesting a potential role in liver function and indicating that TANC1 methylation could serve as a biomarker for diagnosing ADLI (Wu2021TANC1).

TANC1 is also associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and schizophrenia. Mutations in the TANC1 gene, particularly in its ankyrin repeats domain, can affect protein folding and disrupt interactions with binding partners, contributing to the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders (Yang2019Purification; Gasparini2017Dynamic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TANC1 is part of a gene signature associated with DOCK2 mutations, which are linked to poor prognosis. TANC1-regulated genes are enriched in pathways related to hepatic inflammation and tumorigenesis, suggesting its role in malignant development and potential as a target for therapy in high-risk HCC cases (Huang2022Association).

## Interactions
TANC1 is a synaptic protein that interacts with several other proteins, primarily through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. It forms complexes with PSD-95, a key scaffold protein involved in synaptic signaling, and other excitatory postsynaptic proteins such as GKAP, AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and the α subunit of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Han2010Regulation). TANC1 also interacts with MINK and TNIK, kinases from the STE20 family of MAP4Ks, which phosphorylate TANC1, suggesting a role in signaling pathways (Han2010Regulation).

The interaction between TANC1 and PSD-95 is specific and dependent on the PDZ domains of PSD-95, as well as the C-terminal residues of TANC1 (Han2010Regulation). This interaction is crucial for the synaptic localization of TANC1, as deletion of these residues significantly reduces its presence in dendritic spines (Han2010Regulation). TANC1's interactions extend to other proteins involved in synaptic function, such as glutamate receptors, indicating its role in modulating synaptic strength and plasticity (Gasparini2017Dynamic). These interactions highlight TANC1's function as a scaffold protein, organizing multiprotein complexes at synapses.
