# WBP2NL

## Overview
The WBP2NL gene encodes the WBP2 N-terminal like protein, also known as Peri-Acrosomal WW-domain binding Protein (PAWP), which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in reproductive biology and cell signaling. This protein is characterized by the presence of a Pleckstrin Homology-GRAM (PH-G) domain and a WW-domain binding domain (WWbp), which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular transport processes. WBP2NL is predominantly cytoplasmic and associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. It plays a crucial role in the establishment of neural and non-neural ectodermal fates during development and is implicated in the Hippo pathway through interactions with proteins such as YAP. In reproductive biology, WBP2NL is considered a candidate sperm-oocyte activating factor, although its exact role in human fertilization is still under investigation (Marchak2017Wbp2nl; Freour2017WBP2NLPAWP).

## Structure
The WBP2NL protein, also known as Peri-Acrosomal WW-domain binding Protein (PAWP), exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by several conserved domains and motifs. It contains a Pleckstrin Homology-GRAM (PH-G) domain and a WW-domain binding domain (WWbp). The PH-G domain is structured with approximately seven β-strands forming two β-sheets, followed by a conserved α-helix, although it is less compact compared to similar domains in other proteins and features a protruding loop (Marchak2017Wbp2nl). The WWbp domain includes two PPXY motifs, which are crucial for binding to proteins with WW domains, such as YAP, a component of the Hippo pathway involved in cell differentiation (Marchak2017Wbp2nl).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific sites like Thr45, which is essential for certain gene expressions (Marchak2017Wbp2nl). Mutations in these motifs, such as T45A, Y55F, and Y91G, have been studied to understand their functional roles in gene expression regulation (Marchak2017Wbp2nl). The WBP2NL protein is predominantly cytoplasmic, with localization signals for the endoplasmic reticulum and motifs for clathrin-mediated vesicular transport (Marchak2017Wbp2nl).

## Function
The WBP2NL gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in reproductive biology and cell signaling. In healthy human cells, WBP2NL is involved in signal transduction and gene expression regulation. The protein contains a Pleckstrin Homology-GRAM (PH-G) domain and a WW-domain binding domain (WWbp), which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins. These domains facilitate the protein's involvement in cellular transport processes, as WBP2NL is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and is predominantly cytoplasmic (Marchak2017Wbp2nl).

WBP2NL is also implicated in the establishment of neural and non-neural ectodermal fates during development. It influences the expression of genes related to neural and epidermal development, affecting the balance between these fates in the ectoderm (Marchak2017Wbp2nl). The protein interacts with components of the Hippo pathway, such as YAP, which is essential for ectopic gene expression in the neural plate (Marchak2017Wbp2nl).

In reproductive biology, WBP2NL is considered a candidate sperm-oocyte activating factor, potentially contributing to calcium release within the oocyte, a critical step for successful fertilization (Freour2017WBP2NLPAWP). However, its exact role in human fertilization remains debated (Freour2018Is).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WBP2NL gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of reproductive health, WBP2NL, also known as PAWP, has been studied for its potential role in fertilization. However, research indicates that neither the sequence nor the protein abundance of PAWP/WBP2NL is associated with fertilization failures in intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. Studies have shown that missense variants in PAWP/WBP2NL found in patients with fertilization failure were also present in fertile donors, suggesting these variants do not impact fertilization ability (Freour2018Is).

In developmental biology, WBP2NL is involved in establishing neural and non-neural ectodermal fates. Mutations affecting its interaction motifs, such as the YAP-binding motif, can alter gene expression and signaling pathways, potentially leading to developmental defects. For example, mutations that disrupt YAP binding reduce the repression of chd, a BMP antagonist, indicating a role in modulating BMP signaling (Marchak2017Wbp2nl).

While the clinical significance of WBP2NL in cancer is less clear, related genes have been studied in the context of breast cancer, suggesting potential roles in tumorigenesis and patient prognosis (Nourashrafeddin2014The).

## Interactions
WBP2NL, also known as PAWP, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It contains a WW-domain binding domain (WWbp) and a Pleckstrin Homology-GRAM (PH-G) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins. The WWbp domain includes motifs that can bind to proteins with WW domains, such as YAP, a component of the Hippo pathway. This interaction is significant for tissue-specific cell differentiation and ectodermal gene expression (Marchak2017Wbp2nl).

The protein also contains a PPXY motif, which allows interaction with group I WW domain proteins like TAZ and YAP. These interactions are important for the oncogenic properties of the PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in breast cancer (Nourashrafeddin2015Elevated). WBP2NL's interaction with YAP is crucial for its role in modulating BMP signaling and ectodermal patterning (Marchak2017Wbp2nl).

In the context of sperm function, WBP2NL is located in the postacrosomal sheath region and is considered a candidate sperm-oocyte activating factor. It shares sequence homology with WBP2 and contains PPXY motifs that interact with WW domains, which are essential for oocyte activation (Hamilton2018WBP2).
