# ZKSCAN5

## Overview
ZKSCAN5 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger with KRAB and SCAN domains 5, which is a member of the Krűppel family of zinc-finger proteins. This protein functions as a transcription factor, characterized by its KRAB domain, SCAN box, and multiple zinc finger motifs, which are essential for its role in transcriptional regulation. ZKSCAN5 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and modulates gene expression through interactions with other proteins and chromatin modifications. It is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with notable expression in the testis, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis. Additionally, ZKSCAN5 is involved in epigenetic regulation and alternative splicing, contributing to transcriptional diversity. Its involvement in breast cancer progression, particularly through the regulation of VEGFC expression, underscores its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Li2022ZKSCAN5; Kim2016Macaca).

## Function
ZKSCAN5 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is part of the Krűppel family of zinc-finger proteins and contains a KRAB domain, a SCAN box, and multiple zinc fingers, which are crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation (Kim2016Macaca). ZKSCAN5 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression observed in the testis, indicating its involvement in spermatogenesis, particularly in pachytene spermatocytes (Kim2016Macaca).

The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and modulates transcriptional networks. This activity is facilitated by its zinc finger domains, which enable DNA binding, and the SCAN domain, which supports protein-protein interactions (Li2022ZKSCAN5). ZKSCAN5 is involved in generating transcriptional diversity through alternative splicing, a process that allows for the production of various protein isoforms without significantly increasing genome size (Kim2016Macaca).

ZKSCAN5 also plays a role in epigenetic regulation by interacting with histone methyltransferases, such as SETD7, to modify chromatin structure and influence gene expression (Li2022ZKSCAN5). This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of genes involved in cellular processes like differentiation and proliferation (Li2022ZKSCAN5).

## Clinical Significance
ZKSCAN5 has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of breast cancer. Alterations in the expression of ZKSCAN5 are associated with increased VEGFC expression, which promotes lymphangiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. High levels of ZKSCAN5 expression have been observed in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues, correlating with poorer disease-free and overall survival rates (Li2022ZKSCAN5). ZKSCAN5 acts as a transcriptional factor for VEGFC by binding to its promoter and recruiting the histone methyltransferase SETD7, which enhances VEGFC transcription through histone modifications (Li2022ZKSCAN5). This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of VEGFC, leading to increased lymphatic vessel formation and cancer cell proliferation (Li2022ZKSCAN5).

Knockdown studies in breast cancer cell lines have shown that reducing ZKSCAN5 expression decreases the proliferation and migration of human lymphatic endothelial cells, effects that can be reversed by re-expressing ZKSCAN5 (Li2022ZKSCAN5). In vivo experiments further demonstrated that ZKSCAN5 knockdown significantly inhibits tumor growth and lung metastasis in mice, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment (Li2022ZKSCAN5). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZKSCAN5 in breast cancer, where its upregulation is linked to aggressive disease and poor prognosis.

## Interactions
ZKSCAN5 is involved in several interactions that play a crucial role in breast cancer progression. It specifically binds to the -658 to -608 bp region of the VEGFC promoter, facilitating transcriptional activation through histone methylation, particularly H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) and trimethylation (H3K4me3) (Li2022ZKSCAN5). This binding is mediated by the recruitment of the histone methyltransferase SETD7, which ZKSCAN5 directly interacts with, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Li2022ZKSCAN5). The interaction between ZKSCAN5 and SETD7 is crucial for the transcriptional activation of VEGFC, promoting lymphangiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis in breast cancer (Li2022ZKSCAN5).

ZKSCAN5's role as a transcription factor is further supported by its nuclear localization, which is consistent with its function in transcriptional regulation (Li2022ZKSCAN5). Knockdown experiments in breast cancer cell lines have shown that reducing ZKSCAN5 levels leads to decreased VEGFC expression and impaired lymphangiogenesis, which can be reversed by re-expressing ZKSCAN5 (Li2022ZKSCAN5). These findings highlight the importance of ZKSCAN5 in modulating VEGFC expression and its potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.
