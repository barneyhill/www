# ACSM5

## Overview
ACSM5, or acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 5, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically the activation of medium-chain fatty acids. The protein product of ACSM5 is categorized as an enzyme that facilitates the conversion of these fatty acids into acyl-CoA thioesters, a critical step for their subsequent degradation through β-oxidation in the mitochondria. This enzymatic activity is essential for energy production and maintaining metabolic homeostasis within cells. ACSM5 is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the kidney and liver, where it plays a significant role in the metabolism of fatty acids and xenobiotics, contributing to detoxification and energy balance (Cao2023ACSM5; Yazdani2021Altered). The gene's involvement in these metabolic pathways underscores its importance in normal cellular function and its potential implications in various diseases when its expression is altered.

## Structure


## Function
ACSM5 (acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 5) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by catalyzing the activation of medium-chain fatty acids. This activation involves converting these fatty acids into acyl-CoA thioesters, a necessary step for their subsequent degradation via β-oxidation in the mitochondria. This process is essential for energy production and maintaining metabolic homeostasis within cells (Cao2023ACSM5).

In healthy human cells, ACSM5 is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, which supports normal cellular functions. It is significantly expressed in tissues such as the kidney and liver, where it contributes to the activation of medium-chain fatty acids and xenobiotics for beta-oxidation and detoxification reactions (Yazdani2021Altered). This activity is vital for the synthesis of structural and storage lipids, including phospholipids and triacylglycerol, and for various fatty acid modification processes like elongation, desaturation, hydroxylation, and oxidation (Yazdani2021Altered).

ACSM5's role in these metabolic pathways highlights its importance in normal cellular metabolism and energy production, contributing to the overall metabolic balance and function of the organism.

## Clinical Significance
The ACSM5 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In lumbar ligamentum flavum hypertrophy (HLF), ACSM5 is downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, primarily regulated by DNMT1. This downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation, fibrosis, and decreased apoptosis in ligamentum flavum cells, suggesting a suppressive role of ACSM5 in HLF pathogenesis (Cao2021Integrative). Overexpression of ACSM5 in these cells inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Cao2021Integrative).

In esophageal squamous dysplasia (ESD) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), ACSM5 functions as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is lower in ESD and ESCC tissues compared to normal tissues, and mutations in ACSM5, such as p.C135delinsCMR, are associated with increased cell proliferation and tumor growth (Min2024Genomic). Low ACSM5 expression correlates with advanced cancer stages and poor survival outcomes in ESCC patients (Min2024Genomic).

In breast cancer, ACSM5 expression is significantly decreased, and its low levels are associated with poorer survival outcomes. This suggests that ACSM5 could serve as a diagnostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer (Yazdani2021Altered).
