# DCTN5

## Overview
DCTN5 is a gene that encodes the protein dynactin subunit 5, a critical component of the dynactin complex involved in dynein-mediated intracellular transport. The dynactin complex is essential for the movement of various cellular cargos along microtubules, facilitating processes such as organelle positioning, vesicle trafficking, and mitotic spindle orientation. Dynactin subunit 5, also known as p25, forms part of a heterotetrameric complex at the pointed end of the Arp1 rod within the dynactin structure, contributing to its stability and function (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). The protein is characterized by a left-handed β-helical fold, which may represent a novel protein interaction domain, suggesting potential roles beyond its established function in the dynactin complex (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). DCTN5's involvement in cellular processes extends to interactions with proteins implicated in cell division and signaling pathways, highlighting its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular integrity and function. Additionally, alterations in DCTN5 expression have been associated with various diseases, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma, underscoring its clinical significance (Ullah2022A).

## Structure
The DCTN5 gene encodes the p25 subunit of the dynactin complex, which is involved in dynein-mediated intracellular transport. The p25 subunit, along with p27, forms part of a heterotetrameric complex with p62 and Arp11 at the pointed end of the Arp1 rod, opposite CapZ. The p25 and p27 subunits are predicted to adopt a left-handed β-helical fold, which may represent a novel form of protein interaction domain. This structural motif is relatively rare in the animal kingdom (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). The p25 subunit is also found in a freely soluble pool in cells, suggesting potential functions outside of the dynactin complex, possibly serving as an adapter protein targeting dynactin to various subcellular structures (Schroer2004DYNACTIN).

The dynactin complex, including the p25 subunit, is highly conserved, indicating structural constraints that ensure the stability of this compact structure (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). The pointed end complex of dynactin, which includes p25, was constructed and refined using previous models and Alphafold predictions, although specific details about the molecular structure of DCTN5 itself are not provided (Chaaban2022Structure).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
DCTN5, a component of the dynactin complex, has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and genetic mutations. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), DCTN5 is overexpressed, which correlates with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival in patients. This overexpression is associated with advancing cancer stages and tumor grades, suggesting a role in cancer progression and prognosis (Ullah2022A). The gene's promoter shows less methylation in LIHC tissues, contributing to its increased expression (Ullah2022A). DCTN5's expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration in the LIHC microenvironment, indicating its involvement in the tumor's immune landscape (Ullah2022A).

In the context of hereditary peripheral neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, DCTN5 was screened for mutations. However, no non-synonymous variants were found to segregate with the disease phenotype, suggesting that DCTN5 is not a significant contributor to these conditions (Tey2016Mutation). Additionally, DCTN5 is involved in vesicular trafficking related to ciliome functions, which may have implications for congenital heart disease, although specific mutations in DCTN5 were not directly linked to this condition (Li2015Global).

## Interactions
DCTN5, or dynactin subunit 5, is a component of the dynactin complex, which plays a critical role in dynein-mediated intracellular transport. This protein interacts with other subunits within the dynactin complex to facilitate the movement of cargo along microtubules. The interaction between DCTN5 and the dynein motor protein is essential for the proper functioning of this transport system, as it helps in anchoring dynein to its cargo, thereby enabling efficient intracellular transport.

DCTN5 may also engage in interactions with proteins involved in cell division and signaling pathways. These interactions suggest that DCTN5 could have roles beyond cargo transport, potentially influencing cellular processes such as mitosis and signal transduction. The precise nature of these interactions and their biological implications are areas of ongoing research, highlighting the multifaceted roles that DCTN5 may play within the cell. The ability of DCTN5 to interact with a variety of proteins underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and integrity.
