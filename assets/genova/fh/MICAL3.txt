# MICAL3

## Overview
MICAL3 is a gene that encodes the protein microtubule associated monooxygenase, calponin and LIM domain containing 3, which is a member of the MICAL family of proteins. This protein is characterized as a multidomain enzyme involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, particularly influencing actin dynamics. It contains several functional domains, including a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) domain, a calponin homology (CH) domain, and a LIM domain, which contribute to its role in actin disassembly and intracellular trafficking (Liu2017Facilitating; Vanoni2017Structurefunction). MICAL3 interacts with small GTPases such as Rab8A and Rab35, playing a crucial role in vesicle docking and fusion, which is essential for cellular morphology and motility (Grigoriev2011Rab6; Zhou2011MICALs). The protein's involvement in semaphorin signaling and its expression in various tissues, including the nervous system, suggest its significance in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, such as cancer progression (Tominaga2018Semaphorin; Olson2023MICAL1).

## Structure
MICAL3 is a multidomain protein involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. It contains several key domains, including a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) domain, a calponin homology (CH) domain, a LIM domain, and a C-terminal bivalent MICAL/EHBP Rab binding (bMERB) domain (Liu2017Facilitating; Vanoni2017Structurefunction). The FMO domain features a Rossmann-fold, which is crucial for its monooxygenase activity, and includes a conserved GXGXXG motif that interacts with FAD (Kim2020Structural). The CH domain, composed of five α-helices, enhances the catalytic efficiency of MICAL3 by increasing F-actin substrate specificity (Kim2020Structural).

MICAL3's C-terminal region is characterized by Pro-rich and Glu-rich segments, and motifs for coiled-coil formation, which are part of the Rab binding domain (Vanoni2017Structurefunction). The Rab binding domain forms dimers, with each subunit similar to the MICAL-1 RBD monomer, and interacts with Rab8A (Grigoriev2011Rab6; Vanoni2017Structurefunction). MICAL3 also contains a nuclear localization signal, allowing it to be present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Vanoni2017Structurefunction).

The protein may exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and interactions. The structural arrangement and interaction domains of MICAL3 are crucial for its role in protein complexes (Liu2017Facilitating).

## Function
MICAL3 is a member of the MICAL family of proteins, which are involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, particularly affecting actin dynamics. MICAL3 plays a role in actin disassembly and intracellular trafficking, contributing to cellular morphology and motility (Giridharan2012Differential; Olson2023MICAL1). It is known to interact with Rab8A and ELKS, facilitating vesicle docking and fusion, which is crucial for vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex (Cai2018Overexpression). 

In HeLa cells, knockdown of MICAL3 results in increased cell size, indicating its distinct role in cellular morphology (Olson2023MICAL1). MICAL3 is widely expressed in the adult rat nervous system, suggesting a role in nervous system function, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains less explored (Olson2023MICAL1). MICAL3 contains a Rab-binding domain (RBD) capable of autoinhibition of enzymatic activity, which may regulate its function in actin dynamics and cellular processes (Olson2023MICAL1). Despite its involvement in various cellular functions, detailed insights into its specific roles in healthy human cells are limited.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MICAL3 gene have been implicated in the progression of breast cancer. MICAL3 is involved in semaphorin signaling, which promotes symmetric cell division, thereby expanding breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs). Higher expression levels of MICAL3 are observed in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and these elevated levels are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including worse relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients (Tominaga2018Semaphorin). Knockdown of MICAL3 has been shown to significantly reduce the tumor sphere-forming ability of breast cancer cells and decrease tumor-initiating activity, suggesting its critical role in maintaining and expanding BCSCs (Tominaga2018Semaphorin).

In the context of osteoarthritis, a study investigated the association of the SNP rs2277831 within the MICAL3 gene with the disease. Although no significant correlation was found between this SNP and MICAL3 expression levels, the study highlighted the complexity of genetic contributions to osteoarthritis and suggested that other functional effects might be responsible for the observed association (Ratnayake2012Allelic).

## Interactions
MICAL3 interacts with several proteins involved in vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics. It is known to bind with the small GTPases Rab8A and Rab35, playing a crucial role in vesicle docking and fusion. MICAL3 serves as a physical link between Rab8A and ELKS, a Rab6-interacting protein at the plasma membrane, which is necessary for vesicle docking and fusion (Grigoriev2011Rab6; Zhou2011MICALs). The interaction between MICAL3 and Rab8A is essential for the docking and fusion of exocytotic vesicles, and MICAL3's monooxygenase activity is crucial for the fusion step (Grigoriev2011Rab6).

MICAL3 also interacts with NINL, a protein involved in the transport of vesicles coated with RAB8A-MICAL3 from the trans-Golgi network to the base of the photoreceptor cilium. This interaction is important for the delivery of ciliary transmembrane proteins to the ciliary membrane (BachmannGagescu2015The). Additionally, MICAL3 is part of a complex with CC2D2A and NINL, which is involved in vesicle trafficking to the ciliary compartment (BachmannGagescu2015The).

The structural domains of MICAL3, including its flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) and calponin-homology (CH) domains, facilitate its interactions with actin, enhancing its catalytic efficiency in the presence of F-actin (Kim2020Structural).
