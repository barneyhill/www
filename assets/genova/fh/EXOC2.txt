# EXOC2

## Overview
The EXOC2 gene encodes the protein exocyst complex component 2, also known as Sec5, which is a crucial subunit of the exocyst complex. This complex is an octameric assembly involved in the tethering and fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, a process essential for exocytosis. EXOC2 is characterized by its structural features, including an N-terminal α-helical CorEx motif and a C-terminal region with antiparallel helical bundles, which facilitate its interactions within the exocyst complex (Van2020Mutations; Halim2023The). Functionally, EXOC2 is involved in various cellular processes such as protein trafficking, cell polarity, and neuronal development, and it interacts with small GTPases like RALA and RALB, which are important for cellular signaling and exocyst assembly (Van2020Mutations; Halim2024The). Mutations in the EXOC2 gene have been linked to severe developmental and neurological disorders, highlighting its critical role in normal cellular and developmental processes (Van2020Mutations; Halim2024The).

## Structure
The EXOC2 protein, also known as Sec5, is a subunit of the exocyst complex, which is essential for vesicle tethering and fusion at the plasma membrane. Structurally, EXOC2 features a long N-terminal α-helical region known as the CorEx motif, which engages in coiled-coil interactions with the CorEx motif of another subunit, facilitating the formation of heterodimers and subcomplexes within the exocyst complex (Van2020Mutations; Halim2023The). The C-terminal region of EXOC2 consists of short antiparallel helical bundles (Van2020Mutations).

In humans, EXOC2 does not have other isoforms, unlike some other exocyst subunits (Van2020Mutations). The protein is involved in binding to small GTPases RalA and RalB, which are not present in yeast, indicating a unique regulatory role in humans (Van2020Mutations). The EXOC2 protein is part of the SC1 subcomplex of the exocyst, along with EXOC1, EXOC3, and EXOC4, and is involved in the dynamic equilibrium between free subunits, subcomplexes, and the intact octamer (Van2020Mutations). The molecular function of the exocyst complex in tethering and fusion remains unknown, but mutations in EXOC2 can lead to severe developmental delays and neurological disorders (Van2020Mutations).

## Function
The EXOC2 gene encodes a subunit of the exocyst complex, an octameric protein complex essential for exocytosis, which involves the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane to deliver materials to the cell surface or release cargoes to the extracellular space (Van2020Mutations; Halim2024The). EXOC2, also known as Sec5, plays a critical role in the spatial and temporal regulation of SNARE complex assembly, which is necessary for vesicle fusion and tethering secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane (Halim2023The). 

In healthy human cells, EXOC2 is involved in various cellular processes, including protein trafficking, membrane extension, cell polarity, neurite outgrowth, and ciliogenesis (Halim2023The). It interacts with small GTPases RALA and RALB, which are involved in cellular signaling pathways related to tumor proliferation, survival, and metastasis (Halim2024The). The interaction with RALA is crucial for exocyst assembly and function in exocytosis, while the interaction with RALB is important for cellular signaling via TBK1 in host defense and oncogenic responses (Halim2023The).

EXOC2 is also vital for neuronal development, as it regulates dendrite and axon outgrowth through cytoskeletal reorganization and membrane expansion (Van2020Mutations). It is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, facilitating the transport of proteins and lipids necessary for cell migration, growth, and secretion (Van2020Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXOC2 gene are associated with severe neurological and developmental disorders. Pathogenic variants in EXOC2 have been identified in patients with conditions such as severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and brain malformations, including molar tooth midbrain malformation and Dandy-Walker malformation (Van2020Mutations; Halim2024The). These mutations can lead to a significant reduction or complete absence of the EXOC2 protein, resulting in impaired exocytosis and vesicle fusion, which are critical for normal brain development (Van2020Mutations).

In some cases, EXOC2 mutations result in nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript, leading to undetectable protein levels and severe phenotypes, such as early-onset seizures and sensorineural hearing loss (Van2020Mutations). In other instances, compound heterozygous variants may result in milder symptoms, such as borderline intellectual functioning and poor motor skills (Van2020Mutations).

EXOC2 is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like C9ORF72-related ALS/FTD, where its loss of function can rescue disease-relevant phenotypes, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Halim2024The). These findings underscore the critical role of EXOC2 in neurodevelopment and its potential involvement in neurodegenerative processes.

## Interactions
EXOC2, also known as Sec5, is a component of the exocyst complex, which is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. EXOC2 interacts with small GTPases RALA and RALB, which are crucial for the assembly and function of the exocyst complex. The interaction with RALA is essential for exocyst assembly, while RALB is involved in recruiting and activating TBK1, important for innate immunity activation upon viral infection (Halim2024The).

EXOC2 also interacts with the HIV-1 Nef protein, enhancing intercellular nanotube formation, which facilitates the spread of viral infection. This interaction is specific to wild-type Nef and is disrupted when EXOC2 is depleted, indicating its critical role in this process (Mukerji2012Proteomic).

In the context of C9ORF72-ALS/FTD, EXOC2 binds to the C9ORF72 promoter in an expanded repeats-dependent manner, suggesting a novel role in transcription regulation. Although EXOC2 lacks a nuclear localization signal, it may rely on other proteins to enter the nucleus and exert its effects (Halim2024The).

Mutations in EXOC2 can affect its interactions with other exocyst components, such as EXOC4 and EXOC7, and proteins like GEF-H1, impacting cellular processes like vesicle fusion and exocytosis (Van2020Mutations).
