# SYT15B

## Overview
The SYT15B gene encodes the protein synaptotagmin 15B, which is a member of the synaptotagmin family, known for their role in mediating calcium-dependent membrane trafficking processes. Synaptotagmin 15B is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release at synaptic junctions. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind calcium ions, which is crucial for its function in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. The precise biological roles and mechanisms of SYT15B and its encoded protein are still under investigation, but they are believed to be integral to synaptic function and plasticity, potentially influencing neurological processes and disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
