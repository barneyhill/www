# DAP3

## Overview
DAP3, or death associated protein 3, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein involved in apoptosis and mitochondrial translation. The DAP3 protein is a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome and plays a critical role in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, which is essential for protein synthesis within mitochondria (Jacques2006mtDNA). As a GTP-binding protein, DAP3 contains a conserved P-loop motif that is crucial for its pro-apoptotic activity, distinguishing it as a key player in programmed cell death pathways (Kissil1999Structurefunction). The protein's interactions with various apoptotic signaling complexes, such as those involving Fas and TNF-α receptors, underscore its role as a positive mediator of apoptosis, contributing to cellular homeostasis by facilitating the removal of damaged or unwanted cells (Kissil1999Structurefunction). DAP3's involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and its regulatory interactions with nuclear receptors further highlight its multifaceted role in cellular function and disease (Xiao2015Deathassociated; Miyazaki2001A).

## Structure
The DAP3 protein is a 46 kDa mitochondrial ribosomal protein involved in apoptosis and mitochondrial translation. It is encoded by a single 1.7-kilobase mRNA and consists of 398 amino acids (Morgan2001A; Kissil1995Isolation). The primary structure of DAP3 includes a conserved P-loop motif, which is essential for its nucleotide-binding activity and apoptotic function (Kissil1999Structurefunction; Kissil1995Isolation). This motif suggests that DAP3 may bind ATP or GTP, although it does not show similarity to known ATP- or GTP-binding protein families (Kissil1995Isolation).

The secondary structure of DAP3 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins with nucleotide-binding motifs, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D conformation necessary for its function in apoptosis, with the P-loop playing a critical role in maintaining this structure (Kissil1999Structurefunction).

DAP3 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its apoptotic function. Phosphorylation sites are located around conserved GTP-binding motifs, potentially affecting the protein's conformation and function (Miller2008Identification). The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Morgan2001A).

## Function
DAP3, or death associated protein 3, is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that plays a crucial role in apoptosis and mitochondrial function. It is a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome and is involved in mitochondrial translation and the assembly of the mitoribosome, which are essential for protein synthesis within mitochondria (Jacques2006mtDNA). DAP3 is a GTP-binding protein, and its nucleotide-binding motif, known as the P-loop, is critical for its pro-apoptotic activity (Kissil1999Structurefunction). The protein is located in the mitochondrial matrix and is not released during apoptosis, which is atypical for mitochondrial proteins involved in cell death (Jacques2006mtDNA).

DAP3 is implicated in the activation of caspases, which are essential for the execution of apoptosis, and functions downstream of receptor signaling complexes, such as those involving Fas and TNF-α receptors (Kissil1999Structurefunction). It acts as a positive mediator of apoptosis, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by eliminating damaged or unwanted cells (Kissil1999Structurefunction). The expression of DAP3 is regulated by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and its levels are directly correlated with mtDNA content, suggesting a link between mtDNA expression and programmed cell death (Jacques2006mtDNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DAP3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably Perrault syndrome and various cancers. Biallelic variants in DAP3 are associated with a Perrault syndrome-spectrum phenotype, characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and ovarian dysfunction. These variants lead to reduced assembly of the mitoribosomal small subunit, affecting mitochondrial translation and resulting in deficiencies in respiratory chain complexes, particularly complexes I and IV. This mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the clinical manifestations observed in affected individuals, including lactic acidemia, neurological dysfunction, and primary ovarian insufficiency (Smith2024Biallelic).

In cancer, DAP3 expression levels have been linked to tumor progression and patient prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), elevated DAP3 expression is associated with increased mitochondrial activity, promoting tumor growth and poor survival outcomes. DAP3 influences cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and its knockdown reduces tumor growth and alters cell cycle distribution (Tan2024DAP3). In colorectal cancer (CRC), DAP3 is aberrantly expressed, with higher levels correlating with chemoresistance and poor clinical outcomes. DAP3 interacts with DELE1, a mitochondrial stress protein, and their combined expression is linked to drug resistance and poor prognosis in CRC (Sui2022Death).

## Interactions
DAP3, or death-associated protein 3, is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in apoptosis and mitochondrial function. DAP3 directly binds to the death domains of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors, DR4 and DR5, and is essential for TRAIL-induced apoptosis. It also associates with the pro-caspase-8-binding adapter protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD), linking FADD to the TRAIL receptors in a GTP-dependent manner (Miyazaki2001A). 

DAP3 interacts with various nuclear receptors, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), androgen receptor (AR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), but not with the retinoid-X receptor alpha (RXRα). The interaction with GR is modulated by glucocorticoids and is reduced in the presence of molybdate, which stabilizes the receptor-hsp90 complex (HULKKO2000The). 

In mitochondrial dynamics, DAP3 interacts with dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), affecting its phosphorylation and retention during mitochondrial fission (Xiao2015Deathassociated). DAP3 also forms a splicing regulatory complex with SFPQ and NONO, influencing RNA splicing in cancer cells (Han2022Multilayered).
