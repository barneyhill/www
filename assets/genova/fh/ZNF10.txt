# ZNF10

## Overview
ZNF10 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 10, a member of the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger protein family, which functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor. The protein is characterized by its KRAB domain and multiple zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its binding to DNA and interaction with other proteins, such as TRIM28, to mediate transcriptional repression (Born2014The; Lorenz2022The). ZNF10 plays a crucial role in chromatin organization and gene silencing, impacting cellular processes like differentiation and proliferation. It is also involved in the repression of HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription, underscoring its significance in regulating viral gene expression (Nishitsuji2015ZNF10). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, which can influence its stability and interaction capabilities (Born2014The).

## Structure
The ZNF10 protein is characterized by its KRAB domain and zinc finger motifs. The KRAB domain is structurally well-defined, featuring characteristic alpha-helical conformations. It is composed of α-helices linked by unstructured amino acid stretches, with a distinct spatial arrangement where helix 3 is perpendicular to helix 2. This arrangement is dependent on specific amino acid interactions, such as those involving residues B13-14/LE and A29/R (Lorenz2022The). The zinc finger motifs consist of a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and an α-helix, which are stabilized by a zinc ion, facilitating DNA binding (Lorenz2022The).

The ZNF10 protein model includes regions of intrinsic disorder, particularly in the spacer between the KRAB-AB domain and the first zinc finger, which may allow for flexible DNA binding and interaction with the TRIM28 protein (Lorenz2022The). The KRAB domain is divided into two subdomains, A and B, with the KRAB-A domain being essential for transcriptional repression and interaction with TRIM28, while the KRAB-B subdomain enhances repression activity (Born2014The).

ZNF10 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, influencing its function and stability. The protein may also exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its structure and interaction capabilities.

## Function
ZNF10, also known as zinc finger protein 10, is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in transcriptional repression in human cells. It contains a KRAB domain, which is crucial for its function in gene silencing. The KRAB domain interacts with the nuclear hub protein TRIM28, facilitating chromatin-dependent transcriptional repression by recruiting histone deacetylase and methyltransferase activities, such as SETDB1, to target genes (Born2014The; Lorenz2022The). This interaction is essential for the formation of heterochromatin, leading to the transcriptional silencing of genes, which is important for maintaining cellular identity and chromatin organization (Born2014The).

ZNF10 is involved in the repression of HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription, highlighting its role in regulating viral gene expression. Knockdown of ZNF10 has been shown to enhance HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity, indicating its function as a transcriptional repressor (Nishitsuji2015ZNF10). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds DNA through its zinc finger motifs, influencing transcriptional activity and modulating the expression of target genes involved in cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation (Born2014The).

## Interactions
ZNF10, a member of the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger protein family, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor. One of the primary interactions of ZNF10 is with the TRIM28 protein, also known as KAP1, which acts as a co-repressor. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional repression activity of ZNF10, as TRIM28 recruits chromatin-modifying complexes that facilitate gene silencing (Born2014The; Lorenz2022The). The interaction between ZNF10 and TRIM28 is mediated by the KRAB domain of ZNF10, with the B-subdomain playing a critical role in enhancing this interaction (Born2014The).

ZNF10 also interacts with other proteins involved in transcriptional repression, such as SETDB1 and HP1-gamma. These interactions contribute to the repression of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by ZNF10, highlighting its role in controlling HIV-1 gene expression (Nishitsuji2015ZNF10). Additionally, ZNF10 binds to specific DNA motifs, including NF-κB and Sp1 binding sites, which are crucial for its repressive function on the HIV-1 LTR (Nishitsuji2015ZNF10).
