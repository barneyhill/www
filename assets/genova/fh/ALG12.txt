# ALG12

## Overview
The ALG12 gene encodes the enzyme alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase, which is a crucial component of the glycosyltransferase-22 family involved in the N-glycosylation pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the addition of mannose residues to oligosaccharide chains within the endoplasmic reticulum, a key step in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins. The ALG12 protein is characterized by a transmembrane domain structure, typically comprising 11 or 12 spans, and contains conserved peptide motifs essential for its function (Haeuptle2009Congenital; Oriol2002Common; AlbuquerqueWendt2019Membrane). Proper functioning of the ALG12 enzyme is vital for cellular homeostasis and organismal development, as defects in this gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, specifically CDG type Ig, which manifest in a range of clinical symptoms (Haeuptle2009Congenital; Grubenmann2002ALG12).

## Structure
The ALG12 gene encodes the enzyme alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase, which is involved in the glycosylation process. The ALG12 protein is predicted to have a transmembrane domain structure with 11 or 12 spans, as indicated by different studies (Haeuptle2009Congenital; Oriol2002Common; AlbuquerqueWendt2019Membrane). The enzyme is part of the glycosyltransferase-22 family and contains two highly conserved peptide motifs: a long motif near the amino terminus and a short motif near the carboxy terminus, separated by a conserved distance (Oriol2002Common). These motifs are flanked by specific transmembrane domains, suggesting a structured arrangement within the membrane.

The ALG12 protein is involved in the transfer of mannose residues during glycoprotein biosynthesis, and its structure is crucial for its function in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Haeuptle2009Congenital; Oriol2002Common). The presence of potential N-glycosylation sites at asparagine residues p.N250 and p.N463 indicates post-translational modifications that may affect the protein's function and stability (Haeuptle2009Congenital). The enzyme's structure and function are conserved among eukaryotes, highlighting its evolutionary importance (Oriol2002Common).

## Function
The ALG12 gene encodes an enzyme known as alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the N-glycosylation pathway, a vital process for protein folding and stability in human cells. This enzyme is responsible for adding the eighth mannose residue to the growing oligosaccharide chain on the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide precursor within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Haeuptle2009Congenital; Grubenmann2002ALG12). The proper assembly of the mature oligosaccharide core structure, GlcNAc2Man9Glc3, is essential for its transfer to nascent proteins by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase) complex, a critical step in N-linked glycosylation (Grubenmann2002ALG12).

In healthy human cells, ALG12's activity ensures the correct formation of glycoproteins, which are crucial for numerous biological processes, including protein quality control and intracellular transport (Grubenmann2002ALG12). The enzyme is predicted to have 11 transmembrane domains, with its activity localized to the ER, where it contributes to the proper folding and function of glycoproteins (Haeuptle2009Congenital). This function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organismal development, as defects in ALG12 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) (Grubenmann2002ALG12).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG12 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Ig. This condition is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiencies in the enzyme α-mannosyltransferase, leading to the accumulation of Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and resulting in hypoglycosylation of glycoproteins (Nicotera2021A; Grubenmann2002ALG12). Clinical manifestations of ALG12-CDG include developmental delays, psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, dysmorphic features, and coagulation abnormalities. Some patients may also experience respiratory impairment and feeding difficulties, while seizures and gastrointestinal symptoms are generally absent (Haeuptle2009Congenital; Grubenmann2002ALG12).

The severity of ALG12-CDG can vary significantly among patients. Some individuals may present with milder phenotypes, such as developmental delays and microcephaly, while others may experience severe symptoms, including skeletal dysplasia and audiovisual impairment, which can lead to early death (Haeuptle2009Congenital; Nicotera2021A). Novel variants in the ALG12 gene have been identified, such as c.443T>C, p.(Leu148Pro) and c.412_413insCGT, p.(Gln137_Phe138insSer), which are predicted to be deleterious and contribute to the clinical features observed in affected individuals (Hiraide2021Novel).
