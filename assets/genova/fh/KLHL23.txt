# KLHL23

## Overview
KLHL23 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 23, which is part of the Kelch-like family of proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch repeat motifs, which collectively contribute to its role as a substrate adaptor in the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The BTB domain facilitates dimerization and interaction with Cullin3, while the Kelch repeat motifs form a β-propeller structure involved in substrate recognition and binding (Shilovsky2023Regulation; Shi2019Kelchlike). KLHL23 is implicated in cytoskeletal organization through its interaction with actin, playing a significant role in cancer biology by affecting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and actin cytoskeleton remodeling (Fu2022Kelchlike). The protein's function in ubiquitination and degradation of specific proteins is crucial for maintaining cellular proteostasis, and its aberrant expression is associated with various cancers, particularly gastrointestinal tumors (Fu2022Kelchlike; Choi2016Overexpression).

## Structure
KLHL23 is a member of the Kelch-like family of proteins, characterized by the presence of specific domains that contribute to its structure and function. The protein includes a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, a BACK domain, and several Kelch repeat motifs. The BTB domain is involved in dimerization and interaction with Cullin3 (Cul3) to form part of the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is crucial for protein ubiquitination and degradation (Shilovsky2023Regulation; Shi2019Kelchlike). The Kelch repeat motifs typically form a β-propeller structure, which is involved in substrate recognition and binding (Shi2019Kelchlike).

KLHL23 is known to interact with actin, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal organization. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, where KLHL23 can hinder the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by affecting actin cytoskeleton remodeling (Fu2022Kelchlike). The protein's structure allows it to function as a substrate adaptor in the ubiquitin ligase complex, mediating the ubiquitination of specific proteins, which is essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis (Fu2022Kelchlike). Specific post-translational modifications or splice variants for KLHL23 are not detailed in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
KLHL23 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly gastrointestinal tumors. The PHOSPHO2-KLHL23 fusion, identified in gastric cancer, is associated with increased cell proliferation and resistance to anticancer drugs. This fusion leads to the overexpression of KLHL23, which correlates with clinicopathological parameters such as the Lauren classification and perineural invasion, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Choi2016Overexpression). Silencing KLHL23 in gastric cancer cells results in reduced cyclin D1 levels and increased p53 expression, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation (Choi2016Overexpression).

KLHL23 also functions as a substrate adaptor in the E3 ligase complex, mediating ubiquitination and degradation of substrates, which is crucial for maintaining proteostasis. Aberrations in KLHL23, such as fusions and aberrant expression, are frequently observed in gastrointestinal tumors and can lead to proteome alterations, contributing to tumor progression (Fu2022Kelchlike). KLHL23's interaction with substrates like actin and its role in hindering the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in liver cancer cells further highlight its potential as a drug target due to its role in tumor suppression or promotion (Fu2022Kelchlike).

## Interactions
KLHL23 is known to interact with several proteins, primarily through its role as an adaptor in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It binds to substrates via its Kelch domain, facilitating their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Actin is the only confirmed substrate of KLHL23, and this interaction is significant in hindering the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of liver cancer cells by impeding actin cytoskeleton remodeling (Fu2022Kelchlike). KLHL23 also potentially interacts with other proteins such as ANXA1, ANXA7, BNIP3L, CDKN1A, and TK1, although these interactions are not definitively established (Fu2022Kelchlike).

The protein functions as part of the Cul3-KLHL complex, where the BTB/POZ domain of KLHL23 binds to the scaffold protein Cullin3. This interaction recruits the E2 enzyme, which transfers ubiquitin molecules onto the substrates (Fu2022Kelchlike). The interactions of KLHL23 with its substrates can have varying effects on cancer progression, depending on whether the substrates act as oncoproteins or tumor suppressors (Fu2022Kelchlike). These interactions highlight the potential of KLHL23 as a target for therapeutic interventions in gastrointestinal tumors (Fu2022Kelchlike).
