# ART4

## Overview
ART4 is a gene that encodes the protein ADP-ribosyltransferase 4 (inactive), which is associated with the Dombrock blood group system. This protein is a member of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase family, although it is classified as inactive due to the absence of the R-S-EXE motif typical of active arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases (Grahnert2005Analysis). ART4 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, meaning it is attached to the cell membrane, which is crucial for its localization and potential function in cell surface interactions (Parusel2005A). Despite its lack of demonstrated enzymatic activity, ART4 is expressed in various tissues, including lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues, and may play a role in immune response and cell communication (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION; Grahnert2005Analysis). The protein's involvement in the Dombrock blood group system suggests a role in erythrocyte surface interactions, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated (Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation).

## Structure
The ART4 protein is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, meaning it is attached to the cell membrane via a GPI linkage (Parusel2005A). The primary structure of ART4 includes a single amino acid substitution (N219D) that differentiates the Dombrock blood group antigens Doa and Dob (Parusel2005A). The protein sequence features a predicted N-terminal leader and a C-terminal GPI-anchor signal sequence, with five potential N-linked glycosylation sites and four conserved cysteine residues involved in intra-chain disulfide bonds, which are crucial for its tertiary structure (Parusel2005A).

The secondary structure predictions indicate that the N-terminal portion of ART4 is mainly helical, while the C-terminal region is dominated by β-sheets, a pattern similar to the catalytic domains of ADP-ribosylating bacterial toxins (Glowacki2002The). The tertiary structure of ART4 has been modeled based on its alignment with rat ART2, highlighting the surface localization of allelic amino acids and potential glycosylation sites (Parusel2005A). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but ART4 is known to be expressed on erythrocytes and other cell types (Parusel2005A). The protein's enzyme activity has not been demonstrated, suggesting it may have a distinct substrate specificity or a different function (Parusel2005A).

## Function
ART4, also known as ADP-ribosyltransferase 4, is a member of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase family, which catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to target proteins. Unlike other members of this family, ART4 lacks the R-S-EXE motif typical of arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases, suggesting a different target specificity or function (Grahnert2005Analysis). ART4 is primarily expressed in lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues, including the spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and fetal liver, and is present on erythrocytes and HEL erythroleukemic cells (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION; Grahnert2005Analysis).

The protein is linked to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is crucial for its localization and function (Grahnert2005Analysis). ART4 is identified as the Dombrock blood group glycoprotein, playing a role in cell surface interactions and potentially influencing immune response and cell communication (Grahnert2005Analysis). Despite its classification as inactive, ART4's expression and alternative splicing suggest a regulatory role in mRNA stability and protein expression, possibly affecting cell signaling and adhesion (Grahnert2005Analysis). The specific enzymatic activities of ART4 remain undetermined, leaving its precise function in healthy human cells unclear (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION).

## Interactions
ART4, also known as ADP-ribosyltransferase 4, is associated with the Dombrock blood group system and is expressed on the surface of erythrocytes. Despite being classified as inactive in terms of enzymatic activity, ART4 may still participate in protein interactions. It is identical to the glycosylated, polymorphic Dombrock blood group antigen, suggesting a role in cell surface interactions (Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation). ART4 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, lung, liver, and spleen, and its expression can be stimulated by lipopolysaccharides, leading to the ADP-ribosylation of a 31-kD protein, which indicates potential involvement in immune responses (Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation).

Although specific interactions of ART4 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is suggested that ART4 may have roles independent of catalytic activity, possibly involving non-catalytic interactions with other cell surface proteins (Welsby2012Complex). The lack of a conserved glutamate residue in ART4, which is necessary for enzymatic activity, further supports the notion that ART4's function may be more related to structural or signaling roles rather than enzymatic modification (Koch‐Nolte2006ADP‐ribosylation).
