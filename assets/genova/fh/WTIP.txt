# WTIP

## Overview
WTIP (WT1 interacting protein) is a gene that encodes a member of the zyxin family of LIM domain-containing proteins, which are characterized by their role in protein-protein interactions. The protein product, WT1 interacting protein, is involved in various cellular processes, including podocyte differentiation and the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. It functions as a scaffold for slit diaphragm proteins and acts as a corepressor of WT1 transcriptional activity, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion and nuclear signaling pathways. WTIP is implicated in several protein interactions, notably with WT1, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and ASXL2, which are essential for its function in cellular stress response and gene expression regulation. Clinically, WTIP has been associated with cancer, particularly acute myeloid leukemia and non-small-cell lung cancer, where its altered expression levels suggest potential roles as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the context (Zhu2021WTIP; Rico2005WT1interacting; Khan2014WTIP).

## Structure
WTIP (WT1 interacting protein) is a member of the zyxin family of LIM domain-containing proteins, characterized by three carboxyl-terminal LIM domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Srichai2004A). These LIM domains are conserved zinc finger-like structures, which are crucial for mediating interactions with other proteins, such as WT1 and ASXL2 (Verhey2009The; Khan2014WTIP). The LIM domains of WTIP are closely related to those in proteins like ajuba and LIMD1, sharing about 60% identity (Srichai2004A).

WTIP also contains a proline-rich pre-LIM region, which includes two conserved SH3 binding domains and a PDZ binding domain at the carboxyl terminus, indicating its role in dynamic actin assembly and cell-cell contact formation (Srichai2004A). This region diverges significantly from other zyxin family members, suggesting unique protein-protein interactions and functional specificity (Srichai2004A).

The protein has a putative nuclear export sequence, allowing it to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus, a process inhibited by leptomycin B (Srichai2004A). WTIP's interaction with Ror2 and its ability to form homodimers via its LIM domains further highlight its complex structural and functional roles (Verhey2009The).

## Function
WTIP (WT1-interacting protein) is a member of the zyxin family of LIM domain-containing proteins and plays a significant role in podocyte differentiation, which is crucial for the normal function of the glomerular filtration barrier. In healthy human cells, WTIP is localized at cell-cell junctions, specifically colocalizing with zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in podocyte adherens junctions. It functions as both a scaffold for slit diaphragm proteins and a corepressor of WT1 transcriptional activity (Rico2005WT1interacting).

WTIP is involved in maintaining podocyte structure and function by regulating gene expression in response to cellular stress or injury. In differentiated podocytes, WTIP is primarily found in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, with reduced nuclear presence, indicating its role in cell adhesion and nuclear signaling pathways (Rico2005WT1interacting). Upon cellular stress, such as puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) treatment, WTIP translocates to the nucleus, which is associated with changes in gene expression, including the downregulation of the WT1 target gene Rbbp7 (Rico2005WT1interacting).

WTIP's function in healthy cells may involve its role in cell-cell contact and nuclear translocation, potentially influencing gene expression and cellular differentiation (Rico2005WT1interacting).

## Clinical Significance
WTIP (WT1 interacting protein) has been implicated in various cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), due to alterations in its expression levels. In AML, WTIP is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly reduced in AML cell lines and clinical specimens compared to normal controls, correlating with poor prognosis and decreased overall survival in patients. Overexpression of WTIP in AML cells inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis through the upregulation of FOXO3a and PUMA, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2021WTIP). Additionally, a fusion gene involving WTIP, known as UBA2-WTIP, has been identified in a subset of AML patients. This fusion is associated with increased cell proliferation and poor prognosis, suggesting an oncogenic role (Lu2018Identification).

In NSCLC, WTIP expression is also downregulated, often due to promoter hypermethylation. This downregulation is linked to poor prognosis and shorter survival. WTIP inhibits cell proliferation and tumorigenicity by affecting the AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest. These findings suggest that WTIP could serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in NSCLC (Wu2019WT1‐interacting).

## Interactions
WTIP (WT1 interacting protein) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) protein, acting as a corepressor of WT1 transcriptional activity. This interaction is mediated by the LIM-only region of WTIP and is independent of the KTS insert or the fourth zinc finger of WT1 (Srichai2004A). WTIP also interacts with zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) at podocyte adherens junctions, forming part of a multiprotein complex involving slit diaphragm proteins. This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays (Rico2005WT1interacting).

WTIP interacts with ASXL2, specifically through its LIM domains, as identified by yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. This interaction is specific, as ASXL2 does not interact with the LIM domains of other proteins like ZYXIN (Khan2014WTIP). WTIP also interacts with RARa in HEK293 cells, repressing RARE-dependent luciferase activity, and blocks ASXL2-mediated activation of retinoic acid signaling in HeLa cells (Khan2014WTIP).

In podocytes, WTIP shuttles between the nucleus and adhesion structures, interacting with proteins like CD2AP and Mena, linking actin assembly complexes to slit diaphragm proteins (Srichai2004A). These interactions suggest WTIP's role in regulating actin assembly and podocyte structure.
