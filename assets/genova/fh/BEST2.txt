# BEST2

## Overview
The BEST2 gene encodes the bestrophin 2 protein, which is a member of the bestrophin family of calcium-activated chloride channels. These channels are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in ion transport across cellular membranes. Bestrophin 2 is characterized by its unique structural features, including a flower vase-shaped ion conducting pathway and a pentameric assembly, which are essential for its function as an ion channel (Owji2020Structural; Owji2022Structures). The protein is primarily expressed in the eye and colon, where it contributes to ocular physiology and intestinal fluid homeostasis, respectively. Its role in regulating intraocular pressure highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for glaucoma (Marmorstein2009Functional; Owji2020Structural). Additionally, bestrophin 2's involvement in bicarbonate transport in colonic goblet cells underscores its importance in maintaining intestinal health (Ito2013LineageSpecific).

## Structure
The BEST2 gene encodes the bestrophin-2 protein, a member of the bestrophin family of calcium-activated chloride channels. The primary structure of bestrophin-2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains crucial for its function. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function as a channel (Owji2020Structural).

The tertiary structure of bestrophin-2 reveals a flower vase-shaped ion conducting pathway, with unique structural features such as a positively charged aperture-forming residue, K208, and a negatively charged E212, which form a salt bridge contributing to the channel's aperture (Owji2020Structural). This structure is crucial for its ion selectivity and calcium-independent activity (Owji2020Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, bestrophin-2 assembles into a pentameric complex, which is a common feature among bestrophin channels (Owji2022Structures). The protein also contains transmembrane domains that facilitate its function as an ion channel. The presence of splice variants can lead to different isoforms, potentially affecting the protein's function (Owji2020Structural).

## Function
The BEST2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the bestrophin family, functioning as a calcium-activated chloride channel. In healthy human cells, BEST2 is primarily localized to the basolateral plasma membrane of nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells in the eye, where it plays a crucial role in ocular physiology by influencing aqueous humor dynamics and intraocular pressure (IOP). This function is significant as high IOP is a risk factor for glaucoma, making BEST2 a potential target for glaucoma treatment (Marmorstein2009Functional; Owji2020Structural).

BEST2 is also expressed in colonic goblet cells, where it is involved in bicarbonate (HCO3-) transport, contributing to mucin release and maintaining the innate immune function of the intestinal mucosa. The expression of BEST2 is lineage-specific and is upregulated during goblet cell differentiation, indicating its role in goblet cell function and intestinal fluid homeostasis (Ito2013LineageSpecific).

Structurally, BEST2 channels exhibit both Ca2+-dependent and independent activities, with unique features such as a size-sensitive calcium-activated gate and specific residues involved in ion selectivity. These structural characteristics contribute to its distinct functionality compared to other bestrophin paralogs (Owji2020Structural).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the BEST2 gene, which encodes the bestrophin 2 protein, is primarily associated with its role in ocular physiology and potential implications for diseases such as glaucoma. Alterations in BEST2 expression can affect intraocular pressure (IOP), a major risk factor for glaucoma. Studies have shown that Best2 knockout mice exhibit reduced IOP, suggesting that BEST2 may regulate aqueous humor dynamics and could be a target for glaucoma treatment (Owji2020Structural; Owji2022Structures).

In the context of intestinal health, BEST2 is expressed in colonic goblet cells and is down-regulated in active lesions of ulcerative colitis (UC), where goblet cells are depleted. This down-regulation suggests a potential role for BEST2 in the pathophysiology of UC, as BEST2-null mice develop mild colitis, and colitis induction exacerbates inflammation (Ito2013LineageSpecific).

While specific diseases directly caused by BEST2 mutations are not well-documented, the gene's involvement in ion transport and fluid regulation in various tissues indicates its potential impact on human health, particularly in conditions affecting ocular and intestinal systems (Marmorstein2009Functional; Johnson2017Bestrophin).

## Interactions
Bestrophin 2 (BEST2) interacts with several proteins to regulate its function as a calcium-activated chloride channel. One significant interaction involves IRBIT, which activates BEST2 by increasing its surface expression and recruiting it to the endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane (ER/PM) junctions. At these junctions, IRBIT forms a complex with BEST2, AKAP11, Adenylyl cyclase 8, and PKA. This complex allows the regulation of BEST2 by the cAMP/PKA pathway, where PKA-mediated phosphorylation of BEST2 at serine 413 enhances its affinity for calcium activation (Kittredge2019Dissecting).

The structural studies of BEST2 have identified specific residues that are crucial for its ion selectivity and gating mechanisms. These include residues like K265 and H91, which are important for ion selectivity, and mutations at these sites can alter the channel's permeability to certain anions (Owji2020Structural). The neck and aperture regions of BEST2 serve as calcium-dependent gates, with the neck formed by hydrophobic residues I76, F80, and F84, and the aperture formed by a positively charged K208 and a negatively charged E212, which create a tight constriction in the ion pathway (Owji2020Structural).
