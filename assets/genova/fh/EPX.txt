# EPX

## Overview
The EPX gene encodes eosinophil peroxidase, a heme-containing glycoprotein predominantly found in eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response. Eosinophil peroxidase is categorized as a peroxidase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the body's defense mechanisms by catalyzing the formation of reactive oxygen species. These reactive species are essential for combating a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The enzyme is involved in oxidative processes, utilizing hydrogen peroxide and halide ions to produce hypohalous acids, which are toxic to pathogens. Beyond its antimicrobial functions, eosinophil peroxidase is also implicated in modulating inflammatory responses and has been associated with various diseases, including lung adenocarcinoma and allergic airway inflammation (Kroegel1994Pulmonary; Ye2019Eosinophil).

## Structure
Eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) is a heme-containing glycoprotein found in eosinophils. The enzyme consists of two subunits: a high molecular weight subunit (EPO I) and a low molecular weight subunit (EPO II), with molecular weights of approximately 50,000 and 10,500, respectively (Olsen1985Further). The primary structure of EPX includes a polypeptide chain with specific amino acid sequences, and the enzyme undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, with mannose and N-acetylglucosamine present in the large subunit (Olsen1985Further).

The secondary structure of EPX is characterized by a lack of alpha-helical structure, containing about 15-22% beta-structure and 72-80% non-periodic structure, as indicated by its circular dichroism spectrum (Olsen1985Further). The tertiary structure forms a globular shape, and the quaternary structure involves dimerization, as EPX is a 72-kDa dimer composed of a 14-kDa light chain and a 58-kDa heavy chain (Ohmori1997Eosinophil). The enzyme contains a peroxidase domain, which is common among peroxidases, and shows significant similarity to neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) (Ten1989Molecular).

## Function
Eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) is an enzyme predominantly found in the granules of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response. EPX plays a critical role in the body's defense mechanisms by catalyzing the formation of reactive oxygen species, which are essential for combating pathogens. The enzyme is involved in oxidative processes, where it utilizes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and halide ions to produce hypohalous acids, such as hypobromous acid, which are toxic to a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites (Kroegel1994Pulmonary; Kroegel1994Pulmonarya).

EPX is also involved in modulating inflammatory responses. It can enhance the toxic effects of neutrophils and macrophages by binding to target cell surfaces, facilitating the utilization of H2O2 by phagocytes, and increasing the efficacy of pathogen and tumor cell destruction (Kroegel1994Pulmonarya). In addition, EPX can form complexes with mast cell granules, retaining its bactericidal and tumoricidal activity, and can induce mast cell degranulation, leading to the release of histamine and other mediators involved in inflammation (Henderson1980Eosinophil). These activities highlight EPX's role in both direct pathogen destruction and the regulation of immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In primary lung adenocarcinoma, overexpression of EPX is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression correlates with advanced pathologic-tumor nodes metastasis stage and lymph node metastasis, leading to shorter survival times and indicating a poor prognosis for patients. EPX status is considered an independent marker for predicting poorer overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients, with a hazard ratio of 3.145, highlighting its significant impact on patient outcomes (Ye2019Eosinophil).

In the context of allergic airway inflammation, EPX plays a crucial role in protein nitration, specifically in the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT), a marker of protein nitration. Studies using EPO-deficient mice have shown decreased 3NT formation, suggesting that EPX activity is essential for this process. This indicates that EPX is a significant mediator of oxidative tissue injury during allergic inflammation, such as in asthma (DUGUET2001Eosinophil).

While the context does not provide specific diseases directly resulting from mutations in the EPX gene, its role in eosinophil-related disorders and inflammation is evident through its enzymatic activity and expression levels.

## Interactions
Eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) interacts with various proteins and cellular components, playing a significant role in immune responses. EPX binds to mast cell granules, forming a complex that enhances its bactericidal and cytotoxic activity compared to free EPX. This interaction is crucial for mast cell degranulation and histamine release, particularly when combined with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and halides like iodide and chloride (Henderson1980Eosinophil). The EPX-H2O2-halide system can induce mast cell secretion without causing cytotoxicity at lower concentrations, but at higher concentrations, it leads to cell lysis and the release of intracellular components (Henderson1980Eosinophil).

EPX also interacts with platelets, acting as a strong platelet agonist. It stimulates the secretion of platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and other granule components, even in the presence of inhibitors like indomethacin. This interaction is dose-dependent and can be inhibited by prostaglandin E1 (Rohrbach1990Activation).

In the context of immune responses, EPX is involved in the activation of eosinophils by specific IgE antibodies. This interaction leads to the release of EPX from eosinophils, particularly in the presence of specific antigens, highlighting the role of IgE in eosinophil activation and degranulation (Khalife1986Role).
