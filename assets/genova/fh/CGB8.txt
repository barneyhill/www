# CGB8

## Overview
The CGB8 gene encodes the chorionic gonadotropin subunit beta 8, a component of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone, which is a glycoprotein crucial for reproductive processes. This gene is part of a cluster responsible for producing the beta subunit of hCG, contributing significantly to the hormone's overall beta transcript pool (Nagirnaja2010Genomics). The protein encoded by CGB8 is primarily active in the placenta, where it plays a vital role in maintaining pregnancy by supporting the corpus luteum and facilitating various reproductive functions, such as angiogenesis and trophoblast invasiveness (Nagirnaja2012Structural). Structurally, the hCGβ subunit is characterized by a cystine knot and specific glycosylation patterns that are essential for its stability and function (Biskup2020N; Nagirnaja2012Structural). The CGB8 protein is involved in cell signaling pathways, including the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, which is crucial for cellular responses to external signals (Biskup2020N). Variations in the CGB8 gene have been linked to reproductive health issues, such as recurrent miscarriage, highlighting its clinical significance (Rull2008Chorionic).

## Structure
The CGB8 gene encodes the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a glycoprotein hormone. The primary structure of the hCGβ subunit includes specific amino acid sequences that are crucial for its function. The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of α-helices and β-strands, which are essential for the protein's stability and function (Nagirnaja2012Structural). The tertiary structure of the hCGβ subunit is defined by a cystine knot, formed by three disulfide bonds that hold together three hairpin loops. This structure is vital for the proper folding and assembly of the hormone (Nagirnaja2012Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, the hCG hormone is a heterodimer composed of a common alpha subunit and the hormone-specific beta subunit, which includes CGB8. The non-covalent association of these subunits is necessary for forming the functional hormone (Nagirnaja2012Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, play a significant role in the stability and function of the hCGβ subunit. Glycosylation patterns have been studied, revealing complex-type N-glycans and O-glycans, which are crucial for the protein's bioactivity (Biskup2020N).

## Function
The CGB8 gene encodes a subunit of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone, which plays a crucial role in pregnancy. The hCG hormone is essential for maintaining the corpus luteum, which in turn supports progesterone production, a hormone vital for sustaining pregnancy (Nagirnaja2012Structural). The CGB8 protein is primarily active in the placenta, where it contributes to various reproductive processes, including promoting angiogenesis, enhancing trophoblast invasiveness, and facilitating the decidualization of the endometrium (Nagirnaja2012Structural).

The CGB8 gene is part of a cluster of genes that encode the beta subunit of hCG, and it contributes significantly to the total hCG beta transcript pool, accounting for 27-64% of it (Nagirnaja2010Genomics). The protein encoded by CGB8 is involved in cell signaling pathways, such as the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, which is crucial for cellular responses to external signals (Biskup2020N). Despite minor differences in glycosylation patterns, the CGB8 protein is functionally similar to other hCG beta subunit variants, indicating its redundancy in activating signaling pathways (Biskup2020N).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CGB8 gene have been associated with recurrent miscarriage (RM) in European populations. Studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CGB8 gene that are linked to an increased risk of RM. For instance, rare promoter variants in the CGB8 gene, such as the c8EF-4 allele, have been found exclusively in RM patients, suggesting a significant role in increasing susceptibility to pregnancy loss (Rull2008Chorionic). Additionally, rare nonsynonymous substitutions like p.Arg8Trp and p.Pro73Arg in the CGB8 gene have been identified among RM patients, indicating a potential risk factor for recurrent pregnancy loss (Nagirnaja2010Genomics).

The structural and functional analysis of these mutations has shown that while some mutations, such as p.Arg8Trp, do not significantly alter the assembly or function of the hCG heterodimer, others like p.Pro73Arg can result in alternative conformations of the β-subunit, potentially affecting its biological activity (Nagirnaja2012Structural). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CGB8 gene mutations in reproductive health, particularly in relation to RM (Nagirnaja2012Structural).
