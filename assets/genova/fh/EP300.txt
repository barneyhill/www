# EP300

## Overview
EP300 is a gene that encodes the E1A binding protein p300, a transcriptional coactivator with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure, thereby facilitating transcriptional activation. As a transcriptional coactivator, p300 interacts with various transcription factors and the basal transcriptional machinery, influencing numerous biological pathways, including Wnt-beta catenin, Hippo, Hedgehog, Notch, and TGFβ signaling (Rubio2023EP300; Giles1998Conjunction). The protein is involved in essential cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and DNA repair, and it acts as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts (Zhu2023The). Mutations in the EP300 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, including Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease (Zimmermann2007Confirmation; Bemanian2018Somatic).

## Structure
The EP300 protein, also known as E1A binding protein p300, is a transcriptional coactivator with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. It contains several functional domains that are crucial for its role in regulating gene expression. These domains include the transcriptional-adaptor zinc-finger domains TAZ1 and TAZ2, the kinase-inducible domain KIX, a bromodomain, a plant homeodomain (PHD), a zinc-finger domain ZZ, and the IRF3-binding domain IBiD (Negri2014Clinical). The bromodomain is particularly significant as it is involved in recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, facilitating chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation (Garcia-Carpizo2018CREBBP/EP300).

EP300 is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which can influence its activity and interactions with other proteins. These modifications are essential for its function as a coactivator in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and tumor suppression (Garcia-Carpizo2018CREBBP/EP300). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional interactions and regulatory roles (Garcia-Carpizo2018CREBBP/EP300). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of EP300 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
EP300, also known as E1A binding protein p300, is a transcriptional coactivator with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, playing a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by acetylating histones and non-histone proteins. This acetylation modifies chromatin structure, enhancing gene accessibility and transcriptional activation (Rubio2023EP300; Giles1998Conjunction). EP300 is involved in various biological pathways, including Wnt-beta catenin, Hippo, Hedgehog, Notch, and TGFβ signaling, impacting processes such as development, differentiation, and metabolism (Rubio2023EP300).

In the nucleus, EP300 acts as a bridge between transcription factors and the basal transcriptional machinery, facilitating chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Giles1998Conjunction). It is essential for hematopoiesis, cell cycle regulation, and the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells, maintaining normal hematopoietic function and acting as a tumor suppressor (Zhu2023The). EP300 also plays a role in DNA repair, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and is involved in the regulation of transcriptional targets in the germinal center, a stage of the humoral immune response (Giles1998Conjunction; Zhu2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EP300 gene are associated with Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome (RSTS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, and distinct facial features. While most RSTS cases are linked to mutations in the CREBBP gene, EP300 mutations account for a smaller subset, often resulting in a milder phenotype with less pronounced skeletal abnormalities (Zimmermann2007Confirmation; Bartholdi2007Genetic). The clinical severity of RSTS does not significantly differ based on the type or location of the EP300 variant, although loss of function variants can lead to a range of cognitive and major organ involvement outcomes (Cohen2020EP300‐related).

EP300 mutations have also been implicated in other conditions. For instance, specific missense mutations in EP300 are associated with Menke-Hennekam syndrome, characterized by severe developmental delay and distinct facial features (Van2021RubinsteinTaybi). In the context of cancer, somatic mutations in EP300, such as the Glycine211Serine substitution, have been identified in triple-negative breast cancer, influencing survival outcomes and the presence of other somatic mutations (Bemanian2018Somatic). Additionally, EP300 mutations are linked to hematological malignancies, affecting chemoresistance and immune regulation (Zhu2023The).

## Interactions
EP300, also known as E1A binding protein p300, is a transcriptional co-activator that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. In neuroblastoma (NB) cells, EP300 physically interacts with transcription factors such as TFAP2β and GATA3, facilitating its localization to chromatin sites marked by H3K27ac, a histone modification associated with active enhancers (Durbin2022EP300). EP300 also interacts with the MYCN oncoprotein in NB cells, stabilizing MYCN expression and function (Durbin2022EP300).

In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), EP300 interacts with the C1D protein, forming part of a complex that includes HDAC1, EXOSC10, EXOSC1, and EZH2, known as the MiCEE complex. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of fibrosis progression (Rubio2019Inactivation). EP300 also plays a role in the heat shock response by interacting with heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), acetylating it to stabilize against proteasomal degradation and modulating its chromatin binding (Raychaudhuri2014Interplay).

EP300 is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with enhancers and transcription factors, such as those associated with the FoxO and WNT pathways, and is linked to super enhancer architecture (Williams2020Identifying). These interactions highlight EP300's role in modulating chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation across various cellular contexts.
