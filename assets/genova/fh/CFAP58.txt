# CFAP58

## Overview
CFAP58, or cilia and flagella associated protein 58, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella. These hair-like structures are essential for cell motility and signaling, playing a critical role in various biological processes, including spermatogenesis. The CFAP58 protein is categorized as a structural protein, contributing to the assembly and stability of axonemes, which are the core components of cilia and flagella. It is predominantly expressed in male reproductive tissues, underscoring its significance in reproductive biology and male fertility (Vandenbrouck2020The). Mutations in the CFAP58 gene have been linked to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella, a condition that affects sperm motility and can lead to infertility (Sha2020Biallelic). The protein's interactions with other ciliary proteins further highlight its role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of motile cilia (McCafferty2023An).

## Function
CFAP58, or cilia and flagella associated protein 58, is involved in the development and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for cell movement and signaling. In healthy human cells, CFAP58 plays a significant role in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. It is implicated in the assembly and stability of axonemes, the core structural component of cilia and flagella, which are crucial for the motility and sensory functions of these structures (Vandenbrouck2020The).

The protein is highly expressed in male reproductive tissues, suggesting its involvement in reproductive biology. CFAP58 has been identified as having a functional role in spermatogenesis, indicating its importance in the development of sperm cells (Vandenbrouck2020The). Although specific molecular activities of CFAP58 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its association with the axoneme suggests it may contribute to the structural integrity and function of sperm flagella, which are vital for sperm motility and fertility (Vandenbrouck2020The).

Overall, CFAP58 is a critical component in the reproductive system, particularly in the formation and function of sperm cells, highlighting its importance in male fertility.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP58 gene are associated with multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), a severe form of teratozoospermia. This condition is characterized by defects in the sperm flagellum, including absent, short, coiled, bent, or abnormally shaped tails, leading to the asthenoteratozoospermia phenotype. Biallelic mutations in CFAP58 have been identified in patients with MMAF, indicating its role as a pathogenic gene linked to this condition. These mutations result in defects in the flagellar axoneme and mitochondrial sheath, which are crucial for normal sperm motility and structure. The absence of CFAP58 expression in mutated sperm has been confirmed, highlighting its essential role in sperm flagellum development. The study of CFAP58 mutations has also demonstrated the effectiveness of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as a treatment for patients with these mutations, as evidenced by a successful pregnancy outcome in one of the patients (Sha2020Biallelic).

## Interactions
CFAP58 is involved in the structural and functional network of motile cilia, interacting with several key proteins. It forms a stable complex with CCDC39, CCDC40, and CCDC146, as revealed by cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL/MS) data. This complex is crucial for the structural integrity of motile cilia and is positioned outside the doublet microtubules (DMT) of the axoneme (McCafferty2023An). CFAP58 and CCDC146 are suggested to form a coiled-coil structure in a head-to-head conformation (McCafferty2023An).

CFAP58 is also part of a broader interaction network involving other ciliopathy proteins, such as CFAP91, which is essential for cilia beating. CFAP91 interacts with the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) and radial spoke proteins, indicating a role in ciliary motility (McCafferty2023An). The study highlights the importance of CFAP58 in the structural and functional network of motile cilia, although its precise role and position within the axoneme remain to be fully understood (McCafferty2023An).

These interactions suggest that CFAP58 plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of motile cilia, contributing to the complex network of protein interactions necessary for ciliary function.
