# MYOM3

## Overview
The MYOM3 gene encodes the protein myomesin 3, a crucial structural component of the sarcomere in striated muscle cells. Myomesin 3 is part of the myomesin family of proteins, which are integral to the M-band, a region critical for maintaining the mechanical stability and integrity of muscle fibers. The protein is characterized by a unique N-terminal domain, followed by a series of immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domains, which facilitate its role in cross-linking myosin filaments and ensuring proper muscle function (Lamber2022The; Schoenauer2008Myomesin). MYOM3 is predominantly expressed in intermediate-speed muscle fibers and is essential for the structural organization of the sarcomere, contributing to muscle contraction and resilience (Lange2020The). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with muscle-related diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophies, where alterations in MYOM3 can serve as biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic efficacy (Rouillon2015Serum; Lamber2022The).

## Structure
Myomesin 3 (MYOM3) is a structural protein localized to the M-band of the sarcomere in striated muscle. It is part of the myomesin family, which includes myomesin and M-protein, and shares a common domain organization with these proteins. The primary structure of MYOM3 consists of a unique N-terminal domain, followed by two immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, five fibronectin type III (Fn) domains, and five C-terminal Ig domains (Lamber2022The; Schoenauer2008Myomesin). The C-terminal Ig domain is responsible for homodimerization, allowing MYOM3 to form homodimers but not heterodimers with other myomesin family members (Schoenauer2008Myomesin).

The N-terminal domain of MYOM3 is highly variable and predicted to be intrinsically disordered, which may facilitate molecular recognition and binding (Schoenauer2008Myomesin). This domain is sufficient for targeting MYOM3 to the M-band, even in cell types that do not naturally express it (Schoenauer2008Myomesin). The protein's structure is conserved across species, with an 83% identity between mouse and human MYOM3, suggesting a similar three-dimensional structure and function (Schoenauer2008Myomesin). The absence of a linker between certain domains distinguishes MYOM3 from other myomesin proteins (Lamber2022The).

## Function
Myomesin 3 (MYOM3) is a structural protein primarily located in the M-band of the sarcomere in striated muscle cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the mechanical stability and integrity of muscle fibers by cross-linking myosin filaments, which is essential for muscle contraction and resilience during intense or sustained stretching (Rouillon2015Serum; Schoenauer2008Myomesin). MYOM3 is predominantly expressed in intermediate-speed muscle fibers, particularly type IIA fibers, and is involved in the structural organization of the sarcomere, contributing to the alignment and centering of the A-band during muscle contraction and relaxation (Lange2020The; Schoenauer2008Myomesin).

The protein forms homodimers through its C-terminal domain, which is crucial for its function in the M-band, and its N-terminal domain is responsible for targeting it to the M-band (Schoenauer2008Myomesin). MYOM3's interaction with other sarcomeric proteins, such as titin and filamin-C, further supports its role in stabilizing the sarcomere structure (Rouillon2015Serum). This structural role is vital for the proper function and resilience of muscle fibers, ensuring effective muscle contraction and overall muscle integrity (Lamber2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MYOM3 gene have been associated with various muscle-related diseases. A specific nonsense variant, p.Glu144Ter, in MYOM3 has been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), particularly in Asian populations. This variant is in linkage disequilibrium with a missense variant, rs149105212, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition to DCM, although further studies are needed to confirm this association in larger populations (Lamber2022The).

In the context of muscular dystrophies, MYOM3 fragments have been identified as potential biomarkers for monitoring therapeutic interventions in conditions such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2D (LGMD2D). Elevated levels of MYOM3 fragments in the serum of patients with these conditions indicate muscle damage and necrosis, which are characteristic of muscular dystrophies. These fragments correlate better with muscle integrity and therapeutic outcomes than traditional markers like creatine kinase (CK), making them valuable for assessing the effectiveness of treatments such as gene therapy (Rouillon2015Serum).

Overall, MYOM3 plays a significant role in muscle integrity, and its alterations can contribute to both cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases, highlighting the importance of further research into its clinical implications.

## Interactions
Myomesin 3 (MYOM3) is involved in several protein interactions within the sarcomere, particularly in the M-band of striated muscle. It forms homodimers via its C-terminal domain, specifically the Ig13 domain, but does not heterodimerize with other myomesin family members (Lamber2022The; Schoenauer2008Myomesin). The N-terminal domain of MYOM3 is crucial for its localization to the M-band, where it interacts with myosin filaments, contributing to the structural integrity of the sarcomere (Xu2012Functional; Schoenauer2008Myomesin).

MYOM3 is also part of a complex network of interactions involving other sarcomeric proteins. It interacts with myosin via its unique N-terminal region, which is essential for its targeting to the M-band (Lamber2022The). Although MYOM3 does not directly interact with titin or obscurin, it is part of the structural framework that includes these proteins, which are critical for maintaining sarcomeric structure and function (Fukuzawa2008Interactions).

These interactions suggest that MYOM3 plays a significant role in muscle elasticity and stability, particularly in intermediate speed muscle fibers, and may influence the mechanical properties of the thick filament lattice (Schoenauer2008Myomesin).
