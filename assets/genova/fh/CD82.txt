# CD82

## Overview
CD82, also known as KAI1, is a gene that encodes a tetraspanin protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. The CD82 protein is a type III transmembrane protein characterized by four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and short cytoplasmic tails. It plays a crucial role in the organization of membrane microdomains and interacts with integrins and other tetraspanins, influencing cell morphology and motility (Miranti2009Controlling; Unknownauthors2013Tetraspanins). CD82 is particularly noted for its function as a metastasis suppressor, modulating receptor signaling and inhibiting cancer cell invasion and proliferation (Miranti2009Controlling). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are significant in the context of various diseases, including cancer and muscle-related disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hall2020Tetraspanin; Floren2020Tetraspanin).

## Structure
CD82 is a 267 amino acid type III membrane protein that spans the membrane four times, forming tightly packed left-handed antiparallel coiled coils in its transmembrane domains (Miranti2009Controlling). The protein features short N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains, a short intracellular loop, and two extracellular loops, EC1 and EC2. The EC2 domain is particularly significant, containing three conserved sequence motifs: CCG, PXXC/PCXC, and a GC residue, which are crucial for forming disulfide bonds and distinguishing tetraspanins from other proteins (Miranti2009Controlling). The EC2 domain is predicted to have three disulfide bonds within its variable region, contributing to its structural integrity (Miranti2009Controlling).

CD82 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and palmitoylation. Glycosylation occurs at four potential sites in mice, while palmitoylation at juxtamembrane cysteine residues is crucial for protein-protein interactions and lipid raft association (Gwilt2024Characterizing; Miranti2009Controlling). Alternative splicing of CD82 can result in isoforms with structural changes, such as the shortening of the large extracellular loop, affecting its interactions (Hochheimer2019Classes). These structural features and modifications play a role in CD82's function as a metastasis suppressor and its involvement in cellular signaling and adhesion (Miranti2009Controlling; Gwilt2024Characterizing).

## Function
CD82, also known as KAI1, is a tetraspanin protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. It is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it contributes to the organization of membrane microdomains and interacts with integrins and other tetraspanins, influencing cell morphology and motility (Miranti2009Controlling; Unknownauthors2013Tetraspanins).

In T-cells, CD82 functions as a costimulatory molecule that enhances T-cell activation, adhesion, and actin polymerization. It is involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and associates with integrins such as α4β1, facilitating integrin-dependent events (Miranti2009Controlling). CD82 also plays a role in B-cell activation, forming complexes with MHCII receptors and other costimulatory molecules, although its specific role in B-cell activation is not fully understood (Miranti2009Controlling).

CD82 is involved in the trafficking and internalization of integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR and c-Met. It modulates receptor signaling by promoting receptor downregulation through endocytosis, which may involve changes in the glycosphingolipid composition of the plasma membrane (Unknownauthors2013Tetraspanins). This regulation of signaling pathways contributes to its role in suppressing tumor metastasis by inhibiting cancer cell invasion and proliferation (Miranti2009Controlling).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD82 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CD82 overexpression is associated with chemoresistance. This is due to its role in enhancing protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) signaling and β1 integrin activation, which leads to increased survival of AML cells during chemotherapy. Targeting these pathways could potentially improve treatment outcomes for patients with high CD82 expression (Floren2020Tetraspanin).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), specific polymorphisms in the CD82 gene, such as the exon 3 (-29166 C[T) polymorphism, are linked to an increased risk of developing the disease, particularly in cases with larger tumor size and advanced pathological stage (Ma2013Role).

CD82 also plays a role in muscle-related diseases. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), reduced CD82 expression is observed, which is linked to impaired muscle regeneration and increased susceptibility to muscle injury. CD82 is crucial for muscle stem cell activation, and its absence exacerbates muscle degeneration in dystrophic conditions (Hall2020Tetraspanin).

In breast cancer, CD82 acts as a metastasis suppressor. Its downregulation, through mechanisms such as alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, contributes to cancer metastasis (AlKhater2021Role).

## Interactions
CD82, also known as KAI1, is a tetraspanin protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular processes such as signaling, adhesion, and metastasis suppression. CD82 interacts with integrins, particularly β1 integrins, forming complexes that play a role in T cell signaling and costimulation. This interaction is involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins like Cas-L, which is crucial for T cell activation and migration (Iwata2002Distinctive).

CD82 also associates with other tetraspanins, such as CD9, CD81, and CD151, forming a tetraspanin network that organizes cell surface proteins and facilitates signal transduction and cell adhesion (Rubinstein1996CD9). This network is implicated in the regulation of cell-cell interactions and may influence tumor cell behavior by stabilizing cell-cell adhesion through interactions with proteins like E-cadherin and β-catenin (Miranti2009Controlling).

In the context of metastasis suppression, CD82 interacts with the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), potentially affecting tumor cell viability and proliferation (Miranti2009Controlling). CD82's interaction with cholesterol is also significant, as it influences the protein's distribution in lipid rafts and affects tumor cell movement (Huang2019Tetraspanin).
