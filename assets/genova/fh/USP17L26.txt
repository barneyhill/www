# USP17L26

## Overview
USP17L26 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 26, which is part of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family. This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein encoded by USP17L26 is implicated in various cellular processes, including inflammation, cell motility, and oxidative stress response, which are essential for normal cellular function and response to environmental changes (Almansouri2024The). Research has highlighted its role in the cellular response to viral infections and its potential involvement in genetic adaptation, particularly within specific populations (Yang2023The). Additionally, USP17L26 has been identified as a potential modulator in cancer immunotherapy, specifically in enhancing the survival of CAR T cells, which are engineered to target cancer cells (Curtis2024Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
USP17L26 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to its role in disease pathology. In the context of age-associated deep subcortical white matter lesions (DSCLs), USP17L26 is part of a gene family that shows significant dysregulation, which is linked to changes in microglial function. This dysregulation may contribute to lesion pathology by impacting inflammation, cell motility, neuronal autophagy, and oxidative stress response (Almansouri2024The).

In cancer research, USP17L26 has been identified as a gene involved in the cellular response to viral infection, with accelerated regions in the CN1 allele suggesting natural selection within the East Asian population. This highlights its potential role in genetic differences and adaptation (Yang2023The). Additionally, USP17L26 has been nominated as a positive hit in a genome-wide CRISPRa screen aimed at identifying modulators of CAR T cell survival, suggesting its potential role in enhancing T cell therapies for cancer treatment (Curtis2024Genomewide).

These findings suggest that alterations in USP17L26 expression or function may have significant implications for understanding and potentially treating various diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions and cancer.
