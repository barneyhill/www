# SHMT1

## Overview
Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) is a gene that encodes the cytosolic enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1, which is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the reversible conversion of serine to glycine, a process that involves the transfer of a one-carbon unit to tetrahydrofolate, forming 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. This reaction is crucial for nucleotide biosynthesis and cellular methylation reactions, particularly in the de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway, which is essential for DNA synthesis and repair (Anderson2009SHMT1). SHMT1 is also involved in regulating oxidative stress and osteogenic signaling, impacting vascular calcification processes (Boehme2018Role). The enzyme's structure is characterized by a homotetrameric formation with a unique β-hairpin structure, known as the 'flap motif,' which is essential for its catalytic function (Wongpituk2024Effect; Snell2000The). SHMT1's interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, as well as its involvement in nuclear de novo thymidylate biosynthesis, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Anderson2009SHMT1; Guiducci2019The).

## Structure
The human serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that functions as a homotetramer, with each monomer having a molecular mass of approximately 53 kDa (Snell2000The). The enzyme's structure includes a unique β-hairpin structure known as the 'flap motif,' which is conserved among mammalian cytosolic SHMTs and is crucial for controlling glycine release during THF-dependent catalysis (Wongpituk2024Effect). Each subunit of SHMT1 contains a PLP binding domain, with the PLP cofactor covalently bound to lysine 257 (K257) (Wongpituk2024Effect).

The quaternary structure of SHMT1 is characterized by the formation of 'tight' and 'loose' dimers, with the tight dimers burying a larger surface area, suggesting a 'dimer of dimers' architecture (Snell2000The). The enzyme's active site involves key residues such as His151, which stabilizes a negative charge on Asp228, and Arg402, which binds to the substrate amino acid carboxylate group (Snell2000The). The enzyme's structure is stabilized by interactions facilitated by the PLP cofactor, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Snell2000The). SHMT1 also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms that may affect its structural integrity and catalytic activity (Snell2000The).

## Function
Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the reversible conversion of serine to glycine. This reaction involves the transfer of a one-carbon unit to tetrahydrofolate, forming 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, which is essential for nucleotide biosynthesis and cellular methylation reactions (Anderson2009SHMT1). SHMT1 is particularly important in the de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway, where it preferentially directs methyleneTHF towards thymidylate biosynthesis, a critical process for DNA synthesis and repair (Anderson2009SHMT1).

During the S-phase of the cell cycle, SHMT1, along with thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase, undergoes sumoylation and is imported into the nucleus, where it contributes to the conversion of dUMP to dTMP, ensuring proper DNA replication and cell proliferation (Anderson2009SHMT1). This nuclear activity underscores SHMT1's role in maintaining genomic stability and supporting cell growth.

In addition to its metabolic functions, SHMT1 is involved in regulating oxidative stress and osteogenic signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells, which can impact vascular calcification processes (Boehme2018Role). This highlights SHMT1's broader role in cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SHMT1 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. The rs1979277 variant in SHMT1, a missense mutation resulting in a p.Leu474Phe change, has been linked to a decreased risk of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) in the Chilean population. This variant is thought to reduce the enzyme's activity, potentially increasing cytoplasmic folate concentrations, which may explain its protective role against orofacial clefts (Salamanca2019A).

SHMT1 is also implicated in cancer. Overexpression of SHMT1 has been observed in lung cancer, where its knockdown leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor growth. This apoptosis is linked to increased uracil accumulation during DNA replication, highlighting SHMT1 as a potential therapeutic target in lung cancer (Paone2014SHMT1). Additionally, the SHMT1 C1420T polymorphism has been associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and solid tumors, particularly in Asian populations, indicating ethnic differences in cancer susceptibility (Wang2015SHMT1).

These findings underscore the significance of SHMT1 in folate metabolism and its impact on various health conditions, including congenital anomalies and cancer.

## Interactions
SHMT1 (serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1) is known for its interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular metabolism and gene regulation. SHMT1 binds to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the SHMT2 transcript, forming RNA-protein complexes that modulate SHMT2 expression and SHMT1 enzymatic activity. This interaction is influenced by metabolites such as glycine and folate, with pentaglutamylated folate competing with RNA for binding to SHMT1, suggesting that the RNA-binding site involves the folate main binding cleft (Guiducci2019The).

SHMT1 also interacts with specific amino acid residues, such as K157, K158, and Y82, which are involved in binding with the folate substrate. Mutations in these residues affect the binding affinity of SHMT1 to RNA, indicating that the RNA and folate binding sites partially overlap (Guiducci2019The).

In addition to its RNA interactions, SHMT1 is involved in nuclear de novo thymidylate biosynthesis, where it is SUMOylated along with DHFR and TYMS, facilitating their localization to the nucleus. SHMT1 interacts with the processivity factor PCNA, which may be important for its function in DNA synthesis and repair (Anderson2009SHMT1).
