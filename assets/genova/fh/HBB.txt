# HBB

## Overview
The HBB gene encodes the hemoglobin subunit beta, a critical component of the hemoglobin protein complex responsible for oxygen transport in vertebrates. Hemoglobin is a tetrameric protein composed of two alpha and two beta subunits, with the beta subunit playing a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of the complex. The HBB gene is primarily expressed in erythroid cells, where it contributes to the formation of hemoglobin A, the predominant form of hemoglobin in adults. Mutations in the HBB gene can lead to hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, which are characterized by altered hemoglobin function and significant clinical manifestations (Fitzsimmons2016Understanding; Cai2017A). Additionally, recent studies have suggested potential roles for HBB in non-erythroid tissues, including neurons, indicating a broader functional spectrum than previously understood (Richter2009Neurons).

## Structure
The HBB gene encodes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin, which is essential for oxygen transport in the blood. The primary structure of the HBB protein consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, where a notable mutation at the sixth codon results in the substitution of glutamic acid with valine, a change that is significant in the pathology of sickle cell anemia (Fitzsimmons2016Understanding). The secondary structure of the beta-globin subunit includes alpha helices, which are integral to its function (Fitzsimmons2016Understanding).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a globular form, which is crucial for the protein's stability and function. This structure is disrupted in sickle cell anemia due to the mutation, leading to polymerization of hemoglobin under low oxygen conditions (Fitzsimmons2016Understanding). The quaternary structure of hemoglobin is a heterotetramer composed of two alpha and two beta subunits, forming a functional protein complex responsible for oxygen binding (Fitzsimmons2016Understanding).

Post-translational modifications in the beta-globin subunit include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which occur in disordered or flexible regions, indicating their functional importance (Fitzsimmons2016Understanding). These modifications can influence the protein's function and its propensity for self-aggregation, particularly in the context of sickle cell anemia (Fitzsimmons2016Understanding).

## Function
The HBB gene encodes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin, a critical protein for oxygen transport in red blood cells. Hemoglobin is a tetramer composed of two alpha and two beta chains, which facilitates the binding and release of oxygen. The beta-globin subunit is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of hemoglobin, impacting oxygen delivery throughout the body (Onda2005Decreased).

In healthy human cells, the HBB gene is primarily expressed in erythroid lineage cells, where it forms part of the hemoglobin complex (a2b2) that binds oxygen in pulmonary capillaries and releases it in distal tissues (Zheng2017Expression). The expression of HBB is regulated by the Locus Control Region (LCR), a critical regulatory element that enhances the expression of the β-globin locus and insulates it from surrounding inactive chromatin. The LCR facilitates the lineage-specific expression of globin genes and is crucial for maintaining active chromatin and gene expression (Stamatoyannopoulos2005Control).

Unexpectedly, HBB expression has also been observed in neurons of the brain, suggesting a potential novel role in neuronal function, possibly related to cellular respiration and oxidative stress regulation (Richter2009Neurons).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HBB gene are responsible for several hemoglobinopathies, including beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Beta-thalassemia is caused by over 200 different mutations in the HBB gene, leading to reduced or absent production of the beta-globin protein, resulting in severe anemia and other health issues (Cai2017A; Chan2010Comprehensive). The condition manifests in three main forms: thalassemia major, thalassemia intermedia, and thalassemia minor, with varying degrees of severity (Soremekun2020Computational). Sickle cell disease is caused by a specific point mutation in the HBB gene, where a substitution of glutamic acid to valine occurs, leading to the production of dysfunctional hemoglobin (Cai2017A).

The prevalence of these conditions varies geographically, with beta-thalassemia being common in regions such as North and Sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean, and Southeast Asia (Soremekun2020Computational). The HBB gene mutations can also lead to unstable hemoglobinopathies, which are associated with protein instability, hemolysis, and inefficient erythropoiesis (Rizzuto2021Usefulness). These genetic disorders result in symptoms like anemia, pain, and organ damage due to abnormal hemoglobin structure or reduced beta-globin production (CarlicedosReis2017Investigation).

## Interactions
The hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) is known to participate in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. In the context of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) infection, HBB has been shown to interact directly with several viral proteins, including the viral capsid protein VP60, replicase RdRp, and the viral protein translation cap substitute VPg. These interactions suggest that HBB may play a role in inhibiting RHDV replication by affecting the functioning of these viral proteins (Zhu2021Hemoglobin).

HBB also appears to activate the expression of interferon γ, which is significant in the antiviral response during RHDV infection. This activation indicates a potential role for HBB in the host's immune response against viral infections (Zhu2021Hemoglobin).

In addition to its interactions with viral proteins, HBB is involved in the formation of hemoglobin tetramers by interacting with alpha-globin subunits to form hemoglobin A, the primary oxygen transport protein in red blood cells. It also interacts with proteins involved in hemoglobin assembly and stability, such as the alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP), which assists in maintaining the stability of hemoglobin (Zhu2021Hemoglobin).
