# HADH

## Overview
The HADH gene encodes the enzyme hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a crucial component of the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. This enzyme, categorized as a dehydrogenase, is responsible for the conversion of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 3-ketoacyl-CoA, facilitating the breakdown of fatty acids for energy production. Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase functions as a homodimer, with each monomer weighing approximately 34 kDa, and exhibits a strong preference for NADH over NAD+ as a cofactor (Barycki1999Biochemical). The enzyme's structure includes a Rossmann fold for NAD+ binding and a primarily α-helical domain for dimerization, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Barycki1999Biochemical). Beyond its metabolic role, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase also influences insulin secretion by modulating glutamate dehydrogenase activity in pancreatic β-cells (Li2010Mechanism). Mutations in the HADH gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase hyperinsulinism, characterized by dysregulated insulin release and hypoglycemia (Zhang2021Genetic).

## Structure
The human hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH) is a dimeric enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 34 kDa per monomer. Its structure includes two distinct domains: the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain features an eight-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices, forming a Rossmann fold that is typical for NAD+ binding enzymes (Barycki1999Biochemical). This domain also contains a helix-turn-helix motif, which is a common structural feature in nucleotide-binding proteins (Barycki1999Biochemical).

The C-terminal domain is primarily α-helical and is involved in subunit dimerization and acyl-CoA substrate binding. This domain resembles a five-helix bundle motif, similar to the helical domain of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, suggesting a possible evolutionary relationship (Barycki1999Biochemical). The enzyme's active site is located at a consensus nucleotide-binding motif, with the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ modeled in the syn conformation (Barycki1999Biochemical).

HADH exhibits a strong preference for NADH over NAD+ and functions optimally at neutral pH (Barycki1999Biochemical). The enzyme's structure and function are crucial for its role in fatty acid metabolism, and it shares significant structural similarities with other dehydrogenases, such as malate and lactate dehydrogenases (Barycki1999Biochemical).

## Function
The HADH gene encodes the enzyme hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which plays a crucial role in the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the dehydrogenation of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 3-ketoacyl-CoA, a key step in the breakdown of fatty acids for energy production. HADH is active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it contributes significantly to energy metabolism, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the heart and skeletal muscles (Xu2014Dimerization; Barycki1999Biochemical).

HADH functions as a homodimeric enzyme, with each monomer having a molecular weight of approximately 34 kDa. The enzyme exhibits a strong preference for binding NADH over NAD+, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Barycki1999Biochemical). The structure of HADH includes a Rossmann fold in the N-terminal domain for NAD+ binding and a primarily α-helical C-terminal domain that mediates dimerization (Barycki1999Biochemical).

In addition to its role in fatty acid metabolism, HADH also regulates insulin secretion by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of glutamate dehydrogenase in pancreatic β-cells. This inhibition is crucial for maintaining normal insulin secretion, and its disruption can lead to dysregulated insulin release (Li2010Mechanism).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HADH gene, which encodes the enzyme hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, are associated with several metabolic disorders, most notably short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase hyperinsulinism (SCHAD-HI). This condition is a rare form of congenital hyperinsulinism characterized by persistent and recurrent hypoglycemia in infancy and childhood due to unregulated insulin secretion (Kapoor20093HydroxyacylCoenzyme; Zhang2021Genetic). SCHAD-HI is caused by homozygous mutations in the HADH gene, leading to deficient enzyme activity and impaired fatty acid metabolism, which affects energy production and insulin regulation (Li2010Mechanism; Zhang2021Genetic).

Patients with HADH mutations may exhibit protein-induced hypoglycemia, with some cases showing severe dietary protein sensitivity (Kapoor20093HydroxyacylCoenzyme). The condition is autosomal recessive and more prevalent in consanguineous populations (Zhang2021Genetic). Biochemical markers such as elevated 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine in blood and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid in urine are often observed, although not universally present (Rosenfeld2019Congenital; Popa20113HydroxyacylCoenzyme).

The pathogenesis of SCHAD-HI involves the loss of inhibitory regulation of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) by SCHAD, leading to increased GDH activity and insulin secretion (Li2010Mechanism). This mechanism is distinct from other mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders and does not typically result in hyperammonemia (Rosenfeld2019Congenital; Li2010Mechanism). Treatment often includes diazoxide, which helps manage hypoglycemia by reducing insulin secretion (Popa20113HydroxyacylCoenzyme).
