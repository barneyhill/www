# HNRNPD

## Overview
The HNRNPD gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNP D), also known as AUF1, which is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism. This protein is categorized as a ribonucleoprotein and plays a critical role in the regulation of mRNA stability and decay, particularly through its interaction with AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs. HnRNP D is implicated in essential cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, inflammatory responses, and telomere maintenance. It exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which influences its subcellular localization and functional properties. The protein's ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm allows it to participate in diverse cellular functions, including alternative splicing and DNA repair. Dysregulation of HNRNPD expression has been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Cui2022HnRNP; Kemmerer2017Auto; Zhou2021Identification).

## Structure
The HNRNPD gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNP D), also known as AUF1, which is involved in RNA binding and regulation. The protein is composed of several structural domains, including two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal domain containing Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) motifs (Xu2001Versatile; CHEN2004Functional). The RRMs are characterized by four β-sheets and two α-helices, which are common features in RNA-binding proteins (Geuens2016The). The RGG motifs are involved in RNA chaperone and RNA annealing activities (Cui2022HnRNP).

HNRNPD exists in four isoforms, p37, p40, p42, and p45, generated through alternative splicing, which affects the presence of exons 2 and 7 (Cui2022HnRNP; Eversole2000In). These isoforms have distinct biological properties, such as differences in nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution and RNA-binding affinity (Cui2022HnRNP). The presence of exon 7 interrupts the C-terminal domain, influencing the protein's localization and function (Cui2022HnRNP).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in modulating hnRNP D's function, particularly in its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling and mRNA stabilization activities (CHEN2004Functional). The protein's ability to form stable dimers enhances its binding specificity to mRNA targets (Geuens2016The).

## Function
The HNRNPD gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNP D), also known as AUF1, which plays a crucial role in mRNA metabolism in healthy human cells. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and decay by binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, leading to their degradation. This process is essential for the turnover of mRNAs encoding cell cycle regulators, proto-oncoproteins, and proinflammatory factors, thereby influencing cell cycle control and inflammatory responses (Kemmerer2017Auto; Xu2001Versatile).

HnRNP D is also implicated in telomere maintenance by interacting with telomeric repeat sequences, which suggests a role in facilitating telomere replication and stability (Eversole2000In). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences gene expression and cellular stress responses (Cui2022HnRNP). Additionally, hnRNP D is involved in alternative splicing and can regulate its own expression and that of its paralog hnRNP DL through mechanisms like alternative splicing coupled with nonsense-mediated decay (AS-NMD) (Kemmerer2017Auto). These functions highlight the importance of hnRNP D in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing pathological processes.

## Clinical Significance
HNRNPD, also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D, plays a significant role in the progression of invasive breast carcinoma (BRCA). Alterations in the expression levels of HNRNPD are associated with high cancer stages and lymph node metastases. Increased mRNA expression of HNRNPD correlates with poor overall survival in BRCA patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker. However, in patients with lymph node metastases, higher expression levels of HNRNPD are linked to improved recurrence-free survival (Zhou2021Identification).

The protein expression of HNRNPD is upregulated in BRCA tissues compared to normal tissues, and this upregulation is associated with advanced cancer stages. This suggests that HNRNPD may contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression, particularly in invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma (Zhou2021Identification).

While the context does not provide specific information about diseases or conditions associated with mutations in the HNRNPD gene, its dysregulation in cancer highlights its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker in breast cancer (Zhou2021Identification).

## Interactions
HNRNPD, also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the EBER1 noncoding RNA of the Epstein-Barr virus, specifically with the p40 isoform, which may sequester HNRNPD and prevent it from binding to AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNAs (Lee2012AUF1/hnRNP). HNRNPD also binds to telomeric DNA, specifically the G-rich telomeric repeat (TTAGGG), and interacts with telomerase, suggesting a role in telomere maintenance (Eversole2000In).

In the context of DNA repair, HNRNPD interacts with SAF-A (HNRNPU) and is involved in the resolution of R-loops, which are DNA:RNA hybrid structures (Alfano2019Depletion). It also binds to chromatin and relocates to sites of DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks, where it plays a role in homologous recombination by facilitating DNA end resection (Alfano2019Depletion).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma, HNRNPD interacts with proteins such as 14-3-3ζ, hnRNPK, and S100A9, forming part of complex protein networks involved in various cellular processes (Kumar2015Nuclear). These interactions highlight HNRNPD's multifaceted role in cellular function and regulation.
