# RHCE

## Overview
The RHCE gene is a critical component of the Rh blood group system, encoding the RhCE protein, which is a transmembrane protein primarily expressed on the surface of erythrocytes. This protein plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical properties of red blood cells by forming part of a complex network of interactions with other membrane proteins, such as Rh-associated glycoprotein (RhAG), CD47, and glycophorin B (GPB) (Westhoff2007The; Van2006Rh). The RhCE protein is involved in the determination of antigenic polymorphisms, specifically the C/c and E/e antigens, which are significant in blood transfusion compatibility and hemolytic disease of the newborn (Van2006Rh). While its precise role in gas transport remains to be fully elucidated, the RhCE protein is suggested to have a potential function in CO2 movement across the erythrocyte membrane (Westhoff2007The). Variations in the RHCE gene can lead to clinical challenges, particularly in transfusion medicine, due to the production of partial Rh antigens and the risk of alloimmunization (Reid2014Genomic; Pham2010Analysis).

## Structure
The RHCE gene encodes the RHCE protein, a palmitoylated membrane protein consisting of 417 amino acids organized into 12 transmembrane alpha-helix domains (Van2006Rh). The protein is not phosphorylated or glycosylated and contains six cysteine residues, with three predicted to be located at the boundary of the cytosol and lipid bilayer, contributing to its structural configuration (Van2006Rh). The RHCE protein, along with RhD, forms part of a tetrameric core complex with RhAG subunits, which is associated with other proteins like CD47, LW, and GPB through non-covalent linkages (Van2006Rh).

The RHCE protein's structure includes specific extracellular loops that determine antigenic polymorphisms, such as C/c and E/e, associated with amino acid substitutions Ser103Pro and Pro226Ala, respectively (Van2006Rh). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by the tight packing of transmembrane helices, facilitated by glycine residues and GxxxG motifs, which are crucial for membrane helix association and stability (Callebaut2006Hydrophobic). The RHCE protein is part of a larger membrane protein complex in erythrocytes, linked to the membrane skeleton through interactions involving CD47 and protein 4.2 (Westhoff2007The).

## Function
The RHCE gene encodes the RhCE protein, which is a critical component of the Rh blood group system, primarily expressed on the surface of erythrocytes (red blood cells). This protein is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and shape of red blood cells by being part of a membrane complex that interacts with the cytoskeleton through proteins such as ankyrin and protein 4.2 (Westhoff2007The; Van2006Rh). The RhCE protein, along with other Rh proteins, contributes to the mechanical properties of the erythrocyte membrane, ensuring its stability and proper function (Van2006Rh).

While the exact molecular function of RhCE in ammonia transport is not fully established, it is suggested that RhCE, along with RhD, may have a role related to CO2 movement, although this is not confirmed (Westhoff2007The). The protein is part of a larger complex that includes other glycoproteins, such as CD47 and glycophorin B, which are essential for the proper expression of Rh antigens and the overall function of the red cell membrane (Okuda2002The). The RHCE gene's role in healthy human cells is crucial for maintaining erythrocyte membrane structure and potentially participating in gas transport processes (Westhoff2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RHCE gene can lead to significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of blood transfusions and hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). Variants of the RHCE gene are associated with the production of partial Rh antigens, which can result in alloimmunization. This is a critical concern for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who undergo frequent transfusions, as they are at increased risk of developing antibodies against these partial antigens, potentially leading to hemolytic transfusion reactions (Reid2014Genomic; Pham2010Analysis).

In individuals of African origin, specific RHCE alleles such as ceAR, ceMO, and ceEK are prevalent and can lead to the absence of high-prevalence antigens like Hr S, Hr B, and Sec. This absence can trigger the production of alloantibodies, complicating transfusion therapy (Reid2014Genomic; Pham2010Analysis). In the Chinese population, a novel silent RHCE allele has been linked to HDN, highlighting the gene's role in this condition (Zhao2019A).

The complexity of RHCE variants necessitates precise molecular matching in transfusion medicine to prevent complications such as delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and to ensure the availability of compatible blood units (Cruz2019Molecular; Dezan2017RHD).

## Interactions
The RHCE gene product, part of the Rh blood group system, is involved in several critical interactions within the erythrocyte membrane. The RhCE protein interacts with other membrane proteins such as Rh-associated glycoprotein (RhAG), LW, CD47, and glycophorin B (GPB). These interactions are essential for the mechanical properties and structural integrity of the red blood cell membrane (MouroChanteloup2003Evidence; Van2006Rh).

The Rh complex, which includes RhCE, forms a non-covalent assembly with RhAG, CD47, LW, and GPB. This complex is linked to the spectrin-based skeleton through protein 4.2 and ankyrin, contributing to the stability and shape regulation of red blood cells (Nicolas2006Functional; Van2006Rh). The interaction between the Rh complex and ankyrin-R is particularly crucial, as it helps anchor the membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton, maintaining the cell's mechanical properties (Nicolas2003RhRhAGAnkyrinR).

Mutations in the RHCE gene or its associated proteins can disrupt these interactions, leading to morphological abnormalities such as stomato-spherocytosis and spherocytosis, which are linked to hemolytic anemia (Nicolas2006Functional). These interactions highlight the RHCE gene's role in maintaining red blood cell integrity and function.
