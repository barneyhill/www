# NFRKB

## Overview
NFRKB, or nuclear factor related to kappaB binding protein, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a crucial component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex. This protein is primarily involved in modulating chromatin structure, thereby influencing transcription regulation, DNA replication, and repair processes. The NFRKB protein is characterized by a novel winged-helix-like domain, which, despite its structural similarity to DNA-binding domains, is primarily involved in protein-protein interactions rather than direct DNA binding (Kumar2012Structure). Functionally, NFRKB plays a significant role in cellular processes such as the acquisition of pluripotency and the regulation of the AP1 signaling pathway, impacting immune responses and cell cycle progression (Audard2012Upregulation; Bure2023Mutual). Clinically, alterations in NFRKB expression have been linked to the progression of gastric cancer, where it interacts with long non-coding RNAs and deubiquitinases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2020LncRNA).

## Structure
The NFRKB protein is a component of the INO80 complex, which plays a role in chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, DNA replication, and repair. It is a 1299-residue protein, with approximately 65% predicted to be disordered, and structured regions primarily located in the N-terminal half (Kumar2012Structure). A specific domain within NFRKB, spanning residues 370-495, has been structurally characterized using crystallography. This domain, known as NFRKB_WHL, exhibits a novel helical structure similar to the winged-helix fold, typically associated with DNA binding, although it does not bind DNA (Kumar2012Structure).

The NFRKB_WHL domain consists of four alpha-helices, three 3_10-helices, and a short beta-sheet. It includes two protomers, a sodium ion, and 25 water molecules, with some residues disordered and not modeled (Kumar2012Structure). The domain's isoelectric point is 4.3, which is not conducive to DNA binding, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions instead (Kumar2012Structure). The NFRKB_WHL domain has been classified as a new Pfam domain, PF14465, and is present in various animal genomes and some single-cell eukaryotes (Kumar2012Structure).

## Function
NFRKB (nuclear factor related to kappaB binding protein) is a component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which is involved in several critical cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, DNA replication, and DNA repair (Kumar2012Structure). Within the INO80 complex, NFRKB modulates the deubiquitinase activity of UCHL5, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions rather than direct DNA binding (Kumar2012Structure). The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it influences DNA accessibility and stability, essential for proper cell cycle progression and response to DNA damage (Bure2023Mutual).

NFRKB has been shown to play a crucial role in the acquisition of pluripotency in human cells, enhancing the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Knockdown of the NFRKB gene affects the reprogramming process, leading to a reduced number of iPS cell colonies (Kumar2012Structure). The protein's involvement in transcriptional regulation is further supported by its role in the AP1 signaling pathway, where it upregulates c-jun expression, a component of the AP1 complex involved in various cellular processes, including immune response (Audard2012Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NFRKB gene have been implicated in the progression and severity of gastric cancer (GC). In GC tissues, NFRKB is upregulated, and this increased expression is associated with advanced tumor stages and higher rates of lymph node metastasis (Zhang2020LncRNA). The long non-coding RNA DRAIC, which is downregulated in GC, negatively regulates NFRKB at the protein level by promoting its degradation through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. This interaction suggests that DRAIC acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting NFRKB, and its downregulation leads to increased NFRKB levels, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Zhang2020LncRNA).

The interaction between NFRKB and UCHL5, a deubiquitinase, is also significant in GC. UCHL5 protects NFRKB from ubiquitination, and its high expression in GC tissues correlates with poor prognosis. The disruption of this interaction by DRAIC can lead to the degradation of NFRKB, highlighting the potential of targeting these molecular interactions for therapeutic purposes in gastric cancer (Zhang2020LncRNA).

## Interactions
The nuclear factor related to kappaB binding protein (NFRKB) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily within the context of chromatin remodeling and ubiquitination processes. NFRKB is a component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair, transcription regulation, and replication (Kumar2012Structure). Within this complex, NFRKB modulates the activity of the deubiquitinase UCHL5, influencing the stability and degradation of proteins through the ubiquitination pathway (Zhang2020LncRNA).

In gastric cancer cells, NFRKB interacts with the long non-coding RNA DRAIC, which negatively regulates NFRKB at the post-translational level. DRAIC interferes with the deubiquitination of NFRKB by UCHL5, leading to increased ubiquitination and degradation of NFRKB. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, as it affects the proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer cells (Zhang2020LncRNA).

Structurally, the NFRKB protein contains a novel winged-helix-like domain, which, despite its similarity to DNA-binding domains, is unlikely to bind DNA. Instead, this domain may facilitate protein-protein interactions, as suggested by its structural resemblance to domains involved in such interactions (Kumar2012Structure).
