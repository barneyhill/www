# NAPEPLD

## Overview
NAPEPLD is a gene that encodes the enzyme N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), a member of the zinc metallohydrolase family. This enzyme is characterized by a unique β-lactamase fold, distinguishing it from other phospholipase D enzymes (Ueda2005Nacylphosphatidylethanolaminehydrolyzing; Okamoto2004Molecular). NAPE-PLD is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) to produce N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), such as anandamide, which play significant roles in neuromodulation, inflammation, and energy homeostasis (Ueda2005Nacylphosphatidylethanolaminehydrolyzing; Okamoto2004Molecular). The enzyme is membrane-bound and predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum, with high expression in the brain, kidney, and testis, indicating its importance in various physiological functions (Ueda2005Nacylphosphatidylethanolaminehydrolyzing; Okamoto2004Molecular). NAPEPLD's activity is modulated by interactions with proteins, bile acids, and circRNAs, influencing its role in lipid signaling pathways and potential implications in neurological and metabolic disorders (Margheritis2016Bile; Ragusa2019CircNAPEPLD; Palese2021NAPEspecific).

## Structure
NAPE-PLD is a member of the zinc metallohydrolase family and features a β-lactamase fold, which is structurally distinct from other known phospholipase D enzymes (Ueda2005Nacylphosphatidylethanolaminehydrolyzing; Okamoto2004Molecular). The enzyme consists of approximately 393-396 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of around 45-46 kDa (Ueda2005Nacylphosphatidylethanolaminehydrolyzing; Okamoto2004Molecular). The primary structure shows high conservation across species, including mouse, rat, and human, indicating its evolutionary importance (Okamoto2004Molecular).

The enzyme's active site contains a dinuclear zinc center, crucial for its catalytic activity, and involves conserved histidine and aspartic acid residues for zinc coordination (Margheritis2016Bile; Okamoto2004Molecular). The crystal structure of human NAPE-PLD has been resolved, providing insights into its three-dimensional conformation and the interaction with substrates and regulators like bile acids (Margheritis2016Bile).

NAPE-PLD does not exhibit homology with other phospholipase D enzymes, highlighting its unique structural and functional characteristics (Ueda2005Nacylphosphatidylethanolaminehydrolyzing). The enzyme is membrane-bound and its activity is modulated by factors such as divalent cations and polyamines (Ueda2005Nacylphosphatidylethanolaminehydrolyzing).

## Function
NAPEPLD encodes the enzyme N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), which plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) to produce N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), including anandamide. Anandamide is a significant endocannabinoid involved in various physiological processes such as neuromodulation, inflammation, and energy homeostasis (Ueda2005Nacylphosphatidylethanolaminehydrolyzing; Okamoto2004Molecular).

NAPE-PLD is a membrane-bound enzyme primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is part of the zinc metallohydrolase family and is structurally distinct from other phospholipase D enzymes. The enzyme does not catalyze transphosphatidylation and is inactive with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, highlighting its specificity for NAPEs (Ueda2005Nacylphosphatidylethanolaminehydrolyzing; Okamoto2004Molecular).

In healthy human cells, NAPE-PLD is involved in lipid signaling pathways that regulate cellular homeostasis and signaling. It is widely expressed in various organs, with high activity in the brain, kidney, and testis, indicating its importance in maintaining physiological functions across different tissues (Ueda2005Nacylphosphatidylethanolaminehydrolyzing; Okamoto2004Molecular). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the biosynthesis of bioactive lipids that influence processes such as inflammation, pain sensation, and neuroprotection (Geurts2015Adipose).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NAPEPLD gene have been implicated in various neurological and metabolic disorders. In canines, mutations in the NAPEPLD gene are associated with leukoencephalomyelopathy (LEMP), a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the central nervous system's white matter. Specifically, a missense variant in Leonbergers and a frameshift variant in Rottweilers lead to disruptions in myelin integrity, resulting in conditions like LEMP (Minor2018Canine). These findings suggest that NAPEPLD mutations could be linked to similar myelin disorders in humans, although no direct association has been established (Minor2018Canine).

In metabolic contexts, alterations in NAPEPLD expression affect energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. In mice, the deletion of NAPEPLD in intestinal epithelial cells leads to increased susceptibility to obesity and hepatic steatosis when exposed to a high-fat diet. This is due to impaired regulation of food intake and energy expenditure, highlighting the enzyme's role in metabolic adaptations (Everard2019Intestinal). Similarly, the deletion of NAPEPLD in adipose tissue results in obesity, glucose intolerance, and inflammation, indicating its critical role in regulating energy balance and metabolism (Geurts2015Adipose). These studies underscore the potential of NAPEPLD as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
NAPEPLD (N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function and regulation. One significant interaction is with leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a protein involved in various cellular processes. NAPEPLD regulates the localization of LRRK2 to neuronal membranes. The genetic deletion of NAPEPLD results in increased NAPE levels and decreased membrane association of LRRK2, suggesting that NAPEPLD activity influences LRRK2 localization by modulating membrane NAPE levels (Palese2021NAPEspecific).

NAPEPLD also interacts with bile acids, which can modulate its enzymatic activity. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) activate NAPEPLD, enhancing its catalytic activity, while lithocholic acid (LCA) acts as an inhibitor. These interactions are influenced by the hydroxylation pattern of the bile acids, which determines their binding affinity and activation potential (Margheritis2016Bile).

In addition to protein interactions, NAPEPLD is associated with circRNAs, such as circNAPEPLD, which are highly expressed in spermatozoa and may interact with miRNAs. This interaction suggests a role in modulating pathways during reproduction (Ragusa2019CircNAPEPLD).
