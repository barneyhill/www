# VWCE

## Overview
The VWCE gene encodes the protein von Willebrand factor C and EGF domains, which is involved in the regulation of cellular growth and metabolism through its role in mTORC1 signaling. This protein functions as a negative regulator of amino acid-dependent mTORC1 signaling by interacting with the KICSTOR complex, facilitating the recruitment of GATOR1 to lysosomes, and enabling GATOR1's GAP activity towards Rag GTPases. VWCE is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its involvement in these signaling pathways. It localizes to lysosomes in an amino acid-insensitive manner, indicating its role in nutrient sensing and signaling. Beyond its regulatory functions, VWCE has been identified as a tumor suppressor in certain cancers, such as prostate cancer, where it inhibits mTORC1 signaling. Its expression levels and interactions have significant implications in cancer progression, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhao2023VWCE; Huo2021VWCE).

## Function
The VWCE gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of mTORC1 signaling, a key pathway involved in cellular growth and metabolism in response to nutrient availability. VWCE acts as a negative regulator of amino acid-dependent mTORC1 signaling by interacting with the KICSTOR complex to facilitate the recruitment of GATOR1 to lysosomes. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of mTORC1 activity, as it enables GATOR1's GAP activity towards Rag GTPases, which is essential for mTORC1 regulation (Zhao2023VWCE).

VWCE localizes to lysosomes in an amino acid-insensitive manner, indicating its role in cellular nutrient sensing and signaling. The interaction between VWCE and KICSTOR is mediated by the KPTN/ITFG2 heterodimer, and VWCE's lysosomal localization is independent of the KICSTOR complex (Zhao2023VWCE). Knockdown of VWCE results in increased mTORC1 activity even in the absence of amino acids, highlighting its role in suppressing mTORC1 under nutrient-deprived conditions (Zhao2023VWCE).

In addition to its role in mTORC1 signaling, VWCE has been identified as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer by inhibiting mTORC1 signaling, although its expression is lower in prostate cancer cells compared to normal tissues (Zhao2023VWCE).

## Clinical Significance
The VWCE gene has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression. In breast cancer, VWCE expression is notably lower compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with a better prognosis. This suggests that VWCE may serve as a potential biomarker for breast cancer, particularly in relation to immune cell infiltration and tumor microenvironment modulation (Huo2021VWCE). VWCE is co-expressed with genes like BMP2, which are linked to tumor progression, and its expression correlates with immune infiltration levels, including Th1 and M2 macrophages, indicating its role in the immune response within tumors (Huo2021VWCE).

In prostate cancer, VWCE acts as a tumor suppressor, with reduced expression in tumors compared to normal tissues. Overexpression of VWCE in prostate cancer cells has been shown to suppress mTORC1 activation and inhibit tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2023VWCE). Conversely, in liver cancer, VWCE expression remains high, and its tumor-suppressing effects may be counteracted by other oncogenic factors, suggesting a complex role in different cancer types (Zhao2023VWCE). These findings underscore the importance of VWCE in cancer development and its potential clinical significance as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The VWCE protein interacts with the KICSTOR complex, which is crucial for the regulation of mTORC1 signaling. VWCE acts downstream of GATOR2 and upstream of Rag GTPases to modulate mTORC1 activity. Immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed that VWCE associates with all components of the KICSTOR complex, including KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66, and SZT2, in an amino acid-insensitive manner. The interaction between VWCE and KICSTOR is independent of the GATOR1 and GATOR2 complexes (Zhao2023VWCE).

VWCE localizes to lysosomes, and this localization is not affected by amino acid availability or the presence of the KICSTOR complex. The lysosomal localization of VWCE is independent of SZT2, a component of KICSTOR. Knockout studies revealed that the VWCE-KICSTOR interaction is primarily mediated by the KPTN/ITFG2 heterodimer. The interactions between VWCE and KPTN or ITFG2 remain intact even when other KICSTOR components are absent, whereas interactions with C12orf66 and SZT2 are compromised without KPTN or ITFG2. This suggests that the VWCE-KICSTOR interaction relies on the KPTN/ITFG2 heterodimer (Zhao2023VWCE).
