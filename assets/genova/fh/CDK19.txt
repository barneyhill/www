# CDK19

## Overview
CDK19, or cyclin-dependent kinase 19, is a gene that encodes a protein kinase involved in the regulation of transcription and cell cycle progression. The protein, cyclin-dependent kinase 19, is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family and functions as part of the Mediator complex, a crucial multiprotein assembly that facilitates transcription by RNA polymerase II. CDK19 plays a significant role in modulating gene expression through the phosphorylation of target proteins, impacting processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and development (Chen2023CDK8). It shares a high degree of sequence homology with its paralog CDK8, suggesting some functional redundancy between the two kinases (Dannappel2022CDK8). CDK19 is also implicated in the regulation of intestinal differentiation and homeostasis, interacting with chromatin remodeling complexes to control gene expression related to intestinal lineage specification (Dannappel2022CDK8). Mutations in the CDK19 gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in normal neurological development (Chung2020De; Zarate2021CDK19related).

## Function
CDK19 (cyclin-dependent kinase 19) is a protein kinase that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression. It is a part of the Mediator complex, which is crucial for facilitating transcription by RNA polymerase II. CDK19 is involved in modulating gene expression by phosphorylating target proteins, thereby influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and development (Chen2023CDK8).

In healthy human cells, CDK19 functions as a positive regulator of signal-induced transcription and a negative regulator of Mediator complex proteins. It is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of transcriptional activity by interacting with various transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes (Chen2023CDK8). CDK19 shares a high degree of sequence homology with its paralog CDK8, and both kinases can form separate modules that regulate transcriptional processes, indicating some functional redundancy (Dannappel2022CDK8).

CDK19 is also involved in the regulation of intestinal differentiation and homeostasis. It interacts with the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF to control the expression of genes associated with intestinal lineage specification, such as ATOH1, which is essential for secretory cell differentiation (Dannappel2022CDK8). Despite its roles in transcriptional regulation, CDK19 is considered dispensable for basal intestinal homeostasis, suggesting its functions may be more critical under specific conditions or in response to certain signals (Dannappel2022CDK8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDK19 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. De novo variants in CDK19 have been linked to a syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, epileptic encephalopathy, global developmental delay, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features (Chung2020De; Zarate2021CDK19related). Specific mutations such as p.Thr196Ala and p.Tyr32His have been identified in affected individuals, and these variants are not found in control populations, suggesting their pathogenicity (Chung2020De). The p.Tyr32His variant, in particular, has been shown to increase kinase activity, while the p.Gly28Arg variant reduces it, indicating diverse pathogenetic mechanisms (Zarate2021CDK19related).

A chromosomal inversion disrupting CDK19 has been associated with bilateral congenital retinal folds, microcephaly, and mild mental retardation, suggesting haploinsufficiency as a potential mechanism (Mukhopadhyay2010CDK19). Additionally, a novel variant, p.Thr31Asn, has been linked to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with infantile spasms, classified as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 87 (DEE87) (Yang2021A). These findings underscore the critical role of CDK19 in normal neurological development and its involvement in various disorders when mutated.

## Interactions
CDK19 is a cyclin-dependent kinase that is part of the Mediator complex, a multiprotein assembly that regulates gene expression by interacting with RNA polymerase II. CDK19 interacts with other components of the Mediator complex, including MED23 and CNOT2, which are involved in gene expression regulation (Cai2021Cyclindependent). It also forms part of the kinase module of the Mediator complex, which includes MED12, MED12L, MED13, MED13L, and Cyclin C (Becker2019Increased). 

CDK19 shares high sequence similarity with CDK8, another kinase in the Mediator complex, and both exhibit similar binding affinities for certain compounds, such as those in the 3,4,5-trisubstituted pyridine series (Dale2015A). These kinases are involved in transcription regulation and have been shown to interact with the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) and positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) during hypoxia-induced gene expression (Dannappel2019Molecular).

CDK19 also plays a role in the DNA damage response pathways and is implicated in modulating the paracrine activity of chemotherapy. It is involved in the regulation of the p53 pathway and influences androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer cells (Dannappel2019Molecular; Becker2019Increased).
