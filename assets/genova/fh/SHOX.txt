# SHOX

## Overview
The SHOX gene, located in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of the sex chromosomes, encodes the SHOX homeobox protein, a transcription factor crucial for skeletal development. This protein is characterized by its homeodomain, which facilitates DNA binding, and plays a pivotal role in the growth and maturation of bones, particularly in the limbs. The SHOX protein functions as a transcriptional activator, influencing the differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes, which are essential for normal skeletal growth. Mutations or alterations in the SHOX gene are associated with various growth disorders, including Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis and Langer mesomelic dysplasia, highlighting its clinical significance in human development (Niesler2007The; Huber2006High; Fukami2016SHOX).

## Structure
The SHOX protein is a transcription factor involved in skeletal development, encoded by the SHOX gene located in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of the sex chromosomes. It is expressed in two alternatively spliced forms, SHOXa and SHOXb, which encode proteins of 292 and 225 amino acids, respectively (Niesler2007The; Niesler2002The). The SHOX protein contains several key domains: a homeodomain, an SH3 binding domain, and an OAR (aristaless) domain (Niesler2007The; Niesler2002The).

The homeodomain is a highly conserved region of 60 amino acids, featuring a helix-turn-helix motif crucial for DNA binding. Helix III of the homeodomain specifically contacts the major groove of DNA, which is essential for transcriptional activation (Schneider2005Alteration). The homeodomain also includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of the sequence AKCRK, located in the third helix, which is vital for nuclear translocation (Schneider2005Alteration).

The SHOX protein can form homo- or heterodimers, enhancing its DNA binding affinity and transactivational efficiency (Schneider2005Alteration). The C-terminal region, containing the OAR domain, is crucial for its transactivating activity, and truncations in this region result in a non-functional protein (Rao2001The). The SHOXb isoform lacks the C-terminal OAR domain, rendering it inactive as a transcriptional activator (Rao2001The).

## Function
The SHOX gene encodes a homeodomain transcription factor that plays a critical role in skeletal development, particularly in the growth and maturation of bones in the limbs. It is expressed in a specific spatiotemporal pattern during embryonic and fetal development, primarily in the middle part of the limb buds and the perichondrial layer surrounding forming bones, which is crucial for normal bone development (Durand2012The; ClementJones2000The). SHOX regulates the differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes, essential for skeletal growth, by transactivating multiple target genes (Fukami2016SHOX). It interacts with the SOX trio (SOX5, SOX6, and SOX9), major chondrogenic factors, and activates the enhancer of Agc1, a gene encoding a major component of cartilage (Fukami2016SHOX).

The SHOX protein functions as a transcriptional activator, binding to DNA in a sequence-specific manner, particularly to the P3 element, facilitated by its homeodomain (Rao2001The). It is active in the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of genes essential for chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, impacting overall stature and limb length (Niesler2007The). The gene's function is dose-dependent, with haploinsufficiency leading to short stature conditions and nullizygosity resulting in severe skeletal deformities (Fukami2016SHOX).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SHOX gene are linked to several growth-related disorders. Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD) is a condition characterized by short stature and Madelung deformity of the forearm, resulting from SHOX haploinsufficiency. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and exhibits broad phenotypic variability, with females often more severely affected than males (Huber2006High; Schiller2000Phenotypic). Langer mesomelic dysplasia (LMD) is a more severe form of mesomelic dysplasia caused by homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the SHOX gene (Blaschke2006The).

SHOX haploinsufficiency is also associated with Turner syndrome, where it contributes to short stature and skeletal anomalies (Ogata2001SHOX; Blaschke2006The). In contrast, SHOX gene duplications have been identified in individuals with idiopathic short stature (ISS) and other conditions like club foot and neurodevelopmental disorders, although their significance in some cases is questioned (Bunyan2022SHOX). The genetic complexity of SHOX-related conditions underscores the need for comprehensive genetic screening in affected individuals (Huber2006High).

## Interactions
The SHOX gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in skeletal development by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. SHOX forms homodimers and can also heterodimerize with other homeodomain proteins, which enhances its DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activity (Schneider2005Alteration; Rao2001The). The protein binds to specific DNA sequences, particularly favoring the P3 element, and acts as a transcriptional activator in a cell-type specific manner (Rao2001The).

SHOX interacts with the homeobox transcription factor HOXA9, which regulates SHOX expression differently depending on the cellular environment. In human U2OS cells, HOXA9 acts as an activator of SHOX by binding to specific sites within the SHOX promoter, leading to increased expression (Durand2012The). In contrast, in chicken micromass cultures, HOXA9 negatively regulates SHOX, highlighting the complexity of its regulatory interactions (Durand2012The).

SHOX also interacts with SHOX2, another homeobox protein, suggesting functional redundancy and potential compensatory mechanisms in skeletal development. This interaction is supported by coexpression in certain limb regions during development (AzaCarmona2014NPPB). These interactions underscore the intricate regulatory networks involving SHOX in bone growth and development.
