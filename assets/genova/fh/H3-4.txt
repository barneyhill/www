# H3-4

## Overview
The H3-4 gene encodes the histone variant H3.4, a protein that plays a critical role in the structural organization and functional regulation of chromatin. As a member of the histone protein family, H3.4 is integral to the formation of nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin, which facilitate the packaging of DNA into a compact, organized structure within the cell nucleus. The H3.4 protein is characterized by specific amino acid substitutions that distinguish it from other histone H3 variants, suggesting its unique functional roles in chromatin dynamics (Albig1996A). The histone-fold domain of H3.4, comprising three α-helices, is essential for its interaction with DNA and the assembly of the nucleosome core particle (Luger1997Crystal). Post-translational modifications of H3.4, such as methylation and acetylation, are crucial for the regulation of gene expression, highlighting its importance in cellular processes (Ramazi2020Evaluation).

## Structure
The H3-4 gene encodes the histone variant H3.4, which is involved in chromatin structure and function. The primary structure of H3.4 consists of 135 amino acids, with specific differences from the mammalian H3 consensus sequence, including alanine instead of valine at positions 24 and 111, methionine replacing valine at position 71, and serine instead of alanine at position 98 (Albig1996A). These variations suggest that H3.4 represents a distinct subtype of histone H3 (Albig1996A).

The secondary structure of H3.4 includes the histone-fold domain, characterized by three α-helices connected by two loops, forming a crescent shape that facilitates DNA binding (Luger1997Crystal). This domain is crucial for the formation of the H3-H4 tetramer, which is a key component of the nucleosome core particle (MariñoRamírez2005Histone).

H3.4 participates in the quaternary structure of the nucleosome by pairing with histone H4 to form a tetramer, which interacts with two H2A-H2B dimers to create the histone octamer around which DNA is wrapped (MariñoRamírez2005Histone). Common post-translational modifications of histone H3 variants, including H3.4, involve methylation and acetylation, which play roles in regulating gene expression (Ramazi2020Evaluation).
