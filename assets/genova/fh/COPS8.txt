# COPS8

## Overview
COPS8 is a gene that encodes the COP9 signalosome subunit 8 (CSN8), a component of the COP9 signalosome complex, which is integral to the regulation of protein degradation pathways in eukaryotic cells. The COP9 signalosome is a multi-protein complex that functions primarily in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and is involved in the deneddylation of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), thereby modulating their activity (Su2015COP9). CSN8, the protein product of COPS8, is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating the turnover of proteins and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which can lead to cellular dysfunction (Su2015COP9). The gene and its protein product are implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and signal transduction, and have been associated with pathological conditions such as cardiac dysfunction and cancer (Su2015COP9; Sun2020COPS8).

## Function
COPS8, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome (CSN), plays a crucial role in protein quality control within cells, particularly through its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. It is essential for the deneddylation process, which regulates the activity of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), a family of ubiquitin ligases responsible for approximately 20% of ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in cells (Su2015COP9; Liu2016The). This regulation is vital for various cellular processes, including cell cycle control, DNA repair, gene expression, apoptosis, and signal transduction (Su2015COP9).

In healthy human cells, COPS8 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it maintains proteostasis by promoting the degradation of misfolded proteins and regulating autophagic processes. Its activity helps prevent the accumulation of protein aggregates, which can lead to cellular dysfunction and disease (Su2013The; Su2015COP9). COPS8's role in deneddylation facilitates the exchange of substrate receptors of CRLs, thereby modulating their activity and ensuring proper protein turnover (Su2015COP9). This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against proteotoxic stress, particularly in cardiac cells (Su2015COP9).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interactions of the COPS8 gene, which encodes the CSN8 subunit of the COP9 signalosome, have been linked to several diseases. In cardiac health, COPS8 is crucial for the regulation of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Cardiac-specific knockout of COPS8 in mice leads to impaired autophagosome maturation and massive necrosis in cardiomyocytes, resulting in heart failure and cardiomyocyte necrosis (Su2011Perturbation; Abdullah2017Murine). This is due to disruptions in protein degradation and autophagic-lysosomal pathways, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cardiac function (Su2011Perturbation).

In cancer, COPS8 acts as an oncogene in cutaneous melanoma, where its upregulation promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. High COPS8 expression is associated with poor prognosis in melanoma patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sun2020COPS8). In gastric cancer, COPS8 is targeted by miR-146a, which inhibits NF-κB activation pathways, indicating its involvement in inflammation-driven tumorigenic processes (Crone2012microRNA146a). These findings underscore the significance of COPS8 in various pathological conditions, particularly in cardiac and cancer-related diseases.
