# ASB11

## Overview
The ASB11 gene encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 11, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box (ASB) family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a SOCS box domain, which is involved in the formation of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. ASB11 functions primarily as a substrate adaptor in the Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex CRL5, playing a pivotal role in the ubiquitination and degradation of specific proteins, such as BIK, particularly under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress (Chen2019BIK; Andresen2014Protein). The protein is highly conserved across chordates, underscoring its evolutionary importance (Diks2008dAsb11). ASB11's involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and its interactions with various proteins highlight its significance in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and responding to cellular stress (Diks2008dAsb11; Andresen2014Protein).

## Structure
The ASB11 protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat and SOCS box domains. The ankyrin repeat region, located at the N-terminus, consists of a series of six repeats that form a V-shaped helix-turn-helix motif. This structure facilitates specific protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for the protein's function in cellular processes (Tee2012asb11Is; Diks2008dAsb11). The SOCS box domain, found at the C-terminus, is approximately 40 to 60 amino acids long and is essential for the formation of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. It is divided into two sub-domains: the BC box, which binds to Elongin C, and the cullin box, which determines the assembly into either a Cul2-Rbx1 or a Cul5-Rbx2 module (Diks2008dAsb11; Sartori2010Essential).

ASB11 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, where it acts as a substrate receptor subunit of E3 ligases, mediating the ubiquitylation and degradation of target proteins (Tee2012asb11Is; Diks2008dAsb11). The protein is highly conserved across chordates, indicating its evolutionary significance (Diks2008dAsb11). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided, the ankyrin repeats and SOCS box are key structural features that define its function.

## Function
ASB11 is a protein that functions as a substrate adaptor in the Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex CRL5, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of specific proteins, such as BIK. This process is essential for regulating protein levels and stability within cells, particularly under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Chen2019BIK). ASB11 is upregulated in response to ER stress through the IRE1α-XBP1 signaling axis, which enhances its transcription and promotes the degradation of BIK, thereby influencing cell survival during stress (Chen2019BIK).

ASB11 is also identified as a novel endoplasmic reticulum resident ubiquitin ligase, specifically targeting Ribophorin 1 for ubiquitination. This activity is crucial for modulating the turnover of Ribophorin 1, an integral component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex involved in protein glycosylation (Andresen2014Protein). The interaction between ASB11 and Ribophorin 1 is dependent on ankyrin repeat 4, highlighting the importance of specific protein domains in its function (Andresen2014Protein). ASB11's role in ubiquitination and protein turnover underscores its significance in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and responding to cellular stress.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ASB11 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. ASB11 plays a critical role in the ubiquitination and degradation of the BIK protein, which is involved in determining cell fate during cellular stress. Under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ASB11 is upregulated, leading to increased degradation of BIK and promoting cell survival. Conversely, DNA damage results in the downregulation of ASB11, stabilizing BIK and promoting apoptosis. This dual regulation suggests that ASB11 is crucial in balancing cell survival and death, and its dysregulation could contribute to tumorigenesis (Chen2019BIK).

In cancer therapy, targeting the ASB11-dependent BIK degradation pathway has been proposed as a potential strategy. Inhibiting ASB11 can enhance the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor effects of BIK mutants, such as BIKDD, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. This approach could improve the efficacy of BIKDD-based therapies, highlighting the clinical significance of ASB11 in cancer treatment (Chen2019BIK). The manipulation of ASB11 and its regulatory pathways may offer new avenues for anticancer strategies, especially in cancers where traditional treatments are less effective (Chen2019BIK).

## Interactions
ASB11 is a novel endoplasmic reticulum resident ubiquitin ligase that interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in protein turnover and cellular stress responses. One of its primary interactions is with Ribophorin 1, a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex. This interaction is mediated by the ankyrin repeat 4 of ASB11 and is independent of the SOCS box. ASB11 promotes the ubiquitination of Ribophorin 1, potentially leading to its proteasomal degradation (Andresen2014Protein).

ASB11 also forms part of a multiprotein E3 ligase complex with Cullin 5, Elongin B, and Elongin C. This complex targets the BIK protein for ubiquitination and degradation, a process crucial for cell adaptation during endoplasmic reticulum stress. The SOCS box of ASB11 is essential for its interaction with the CRL5 complex components, facilitating BIK ubiquitination (Chen2019BIK).

ASB11's interactions extend to forming heterodimeric complexes with other proteins, such as DDB1-Cullin 4a RING ligases, indicating its involvement in broader protein interaction networks (Andresen2014Protein). These interactions highlight ASB11's role in regulating protein stability and cellular processes.
