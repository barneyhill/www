# PPM1N

## Overview
PPM1N is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1N (putative), which is a member of the protein phosphatase family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to dephosphorylate serine and threonine residues in target proteins, a critical function in cellular signaling pathways. The PPM1N-encoded protein is believed to play a role in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and interactions remain to be fully elucidated. As a putative phosphatase, it may be involved in regulating signal transduction pathways by modulating the phosphorylation status of key proteins, thereby influencing cellular responses to external stimuli. Further research is needed to clarify its precise biological roles and potential implications in health and disease.
