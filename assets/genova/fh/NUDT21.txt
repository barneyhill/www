# NUDT21

## Overview
NUDT21 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 21, which is a crucial component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. This protein plays a significant role in the regulation of pre-mRNA processing, particularly through its involvement in alternative polyadenylation (APA), which affects the length of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA. By modulating APA, nudix hydrolase 21 influences mRNA stability, localization, and translation, thereby impacting gene expression and cellular differentiation (Gao2020NUDT21; Gennarino2015NUDT21spanning). The protein is active in the nucleus and is involved in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and tumor suppression, through its interactions with other proteins and RNA (Huang2024NUDT21; AoyamaIshiwatari2020NUDT21). Alterations in NUDT21 expression have been associated with several diseases, including cancers and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal function (Nourse2020Emerging; Gennarino2015NUDT21spanning).

## Function
NUDT21 encodes a subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is crucial for pre-mRNA processing. It plays a significant role in regulating the length of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA by mediating alternative polyadenylation (APA) (Gennarino2015NUDT21spanning). This regulation affects mRNA stability, localization, and translation, influencing gene expression and cellular differentiation. In healthy human cells, NUDT21 impacts the production of different mRNA isoforms, such as those of the MECP2 gene, which is critical for brain function. By controlling the balance between long and short mRNA isoforms, NUDT21 indirectly regulates protein levels, which is essential for maintaining normal cellular and organismal function (Gennarino2015NUDT21spanning).

NUDT21 is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression by affecting the alternative splicing and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA. This activity is vital for normal cellular processes and organismal outcomes, as it ensures the proper expression and function of various genes involved in critical biological pathways (Gao2020NUDT21). The protein's role in APA and splicing is particularly important in the context of cellular energy metabolism and tumor suppression, as evidenced by its involvement in modulating the splicing of GLS1, a key enzyme in glutamine metabolism (Gao2020NUDT21).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NUDT21 gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly cancers and neuropsychiatric disorders. In cancer, NUDT21 plays a dual role, acting as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor depending on the context. Reduced expression of NUDT21 is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor survival outcomes in bladder cancer, glioblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In these cancers, downregulation of NUDT21 leads to global 3' UTR shortening, which removes miRNA target sites that normally repress oncogenes, thereby promoting tumorigenesis (Nourse2020Emerging; Xiong2019NUDT21; Xiao2023Relationship). Conversely, in gastric cancer, high levels of NUDT21 are linked to larger tumor size and poor survival, suggesting an oncogenic role (Zhu2021NUDT21).

In neuropsychiatric disorders, NUDT21 copy-number variations affect MeCP2 protein levels, which are crucial for brain function. Duplications of NUDT21 lead to increased usage of distal polyadenylation sites in the MECP2 3' UTR, resulting in longer mRNA isoforms that are less efficiently translated, thereby reducing MeCP2 protein levels. This mechanism is associated with conditions such as Rett syndrome and intellectual disabilities (Gennarino2015NUDT21spanning).

## Interactions
NUDT21, also known as nudix hydrolase 21, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It forms a complex with the mitochondrial adaptor protein IPS-1, interacting specifically with the NH2-terminal domains, including the CARD and proline-rich domains, but not the COOH-terminal domain. This interaction is crucial for the localization of IPS-1 to stress granules in response to viral infection, facilitating the activation of antiviral responses (AoyamaIshiwatari2020NUDT21).

In the context of cancer, NUDT21 interacts with NDUFS2, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, in pancreatic cancer cells. This interaction activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the physical interaction between NUDT21 and NDUFS2 in pancreatic cancer cells (Huang2024NUDT21).

NUDT21 also plays a role in regulating gene expression through its interaction with RNA. It influences alternative polyadenylation, affecting the length of the 3'-UTR of mRNA, which in turn modulates the expression of oncogenes such as ANXA2 and LIMK2 in bladder cancer (Xiong2019NUDT21).
