# KRT33A

## Overview
KRT33A is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 33A, which is a type I hair keratin. This protein is a member of the intermediate filament family, which is crucial for providing structural support and mechanical resilience to epithelial cells, particularly within the hair cortex. Keratin 33A plays a significant role in the formation and strength of hair fibers, contributing to their durability and resistance to physical stress. The expression of KRT33A is predominantly tissue-specific, being primarily active in hair, and its down-regulation has been associated with conditions such as alopecia areata, indicating its importance in maintaining hair follicle integrity and function (Ho2022Update; Subramanya2010Transcriptional).

## Function
KRT33A (keratin 33A) is a type I hair keratin gene that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of hair fibers. It is primarily active in the hair cortex, where it contributes to the formation and strength of hair fibers by providing mechanical stability and resilience to epithelial cells (Subramanya2010Transcriptional). As part of the intermediate filament family, KRT33A encodes a protein that is involved in the structural framework of hair and nails, ensuring their durability and resistance to physical stress (Ho2022Update).

In healthy human cells, KRT33A is significantly down-regulated in conditions such as alopecia areata, a non-scarring inflammatory hair loss disease with autoimmune etiopathogenesis. This down-regulation suggests its involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease, particularly affecting the structural integrity of hair follicles (Subramanya2010Transcriptional). The gene's expression is tissue-specific, predominantly in hair, and its absence or reduced expression can lead to compromised hair fiber formation and strength, highlighting its essential role in hair biology (Ho2022Update).
