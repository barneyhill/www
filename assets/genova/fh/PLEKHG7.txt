# PLEKHG7

## Overview
PLEKHG7 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology and RhoGEF domain containing G7, which is involved in intracellular signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which plays a crucial role in the regulation of Rho family GTPases. These GTPases are pivotal in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. The PLEKHG7 gene is expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting its involvement in diverse physiological functions. Mutations or dysregulation of PLEKHG7 have been implicated in certain pathological conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
