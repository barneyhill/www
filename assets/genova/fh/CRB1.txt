# CRB1

## Overview
CRB1 is a gene that encodes the protein crumbs cell polarity complex component 1, a transmembrane protein integral to the maintenance of cell polarity and adhesion, particularly in retinal cells. The CRB1 protein is a key component of the Crumbs complex, which is located at the subapical region of retinal progenitor cells and plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the retina. It is characterized by a large extracellular domain with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like and laminin A globular domain (G)-like repeats, and a short intracellular domain containing conserved protein-binding motifs. These structural features facilitate its interactions with other proteins, such as PALS1, PATJ, and MUPP1, which are essential for maintaining epithelial polarity and apical membrane size. Mutations in the CRB1 gene are associated with severe retinal dystrophies, including Leber congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa, underscoring its critical role in retinal health and function (Pellissier2013Targeted; Alves2014The; Gosens2008Composition).

## Structure
The CRB1 protein is a transmembrane protein characterized by a large extracellular domain containing several epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and laminin A globular domain (G)-like repeats. These domains are predicted to bind calcium, which may influence the protein's secondary structure by stiffening it into a rod-like form, promoting protein-protein interactions, or protecting against proteolytic cleavage (Gosens2008Composition). The intracellular domain of CRB1 is 37 amino acids long and contains conserved protein-binding motifs, including FERM and PDZ binding motifs. The PDZ motif binds to the PDZ domain of PALS1, a component of the CRB complex, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial polarity and apical membrane size (Alves2014The; Gosens2008Composition).

Post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, are present in the extracellular domain and may affect the protein's tertiary structure (Gosens2008Composition). CRB1 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in truncated forms that lack the transmembrane and intracellular parts, which are hypothesized to be secreted (Gosens2008Composition). The CRB1 protein complex includes multi-PDZ proteins like PATJ and MUPP1, which are added indirectly via the PDZ domain of MPP (Gosens2008Composition).

## Function
The CRB1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to maintaining cell polarity and adhesion in retinal cells, particularly within the Crumbs complex. This complex is located at the subapical region adjacent to adherens junctions in retinal progenitor cells and is crucial for the development and maintenance of the retina (Pellissier2013Targeted; Alves2014The). CRB1 is expressed in Müller glia cells and plays a significant role in the structural integrity of the retina by forming adherens junctions at the outer limiting membrane (OLM), which are essential for the proper organization and function of photoreceptors (Alves2014The; van2007Crb1).

In healthy cells, CRB1 helps maintain the apical-basal polarity of epithelial cells, influencing cell shape and tissue organization. It interacts with other proteins such as PALS1, PATJ, and MUPP1, linking to the actin cytoskeleton and ensuring proper cell adhesion and polarity (Quinn2017The; Alves2014The). The CRB1 protein also regulates signaling pathways, including Notch1 and the Hippo pathway, to control cell proliferation and fate decisions, which are vital for orderly retinal development (Pellissier2013Targeted). These functions are critical for maintaining the structure and function of the retina, preventing excessive proliferation of progenitor cells, and ensuring proper cell cycle progression (Pellissier2013Targeted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CRB1 gene are associated with several severe retinal dystrophies, including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and early-onset rod-cone dystrophy (EORCD). LCA, the most severe form of retinal dystrophy, is frequently linked to null alleles of CRB1, leading to severe visual impairment or blindness in infancy (saberi2019crb1; Hollander2001Leber). CRB1 mutations account for 10-15% of all LCA cases and up to 6.5% of autosomal recessive RP cases (Slavotinek2016The; Ehrenberg2013CRB1:).

A unique form of RP associated with CRB1 mutations is characterized by preserved para-arteriolar retinal pigment epithelium (PPRPE) and Coats-like exudative vasculopathy, which can lead to retinal detachment (Hollander2001Leber; den2004CRB1). CRB1 mutations are also linked to other ocular conditions such as macular atrophy, keratoconus, and nanophthalmos (Slavotinek2016The; Bujakowska2011CRB1).

The CRB1 gene's role in maintaining retinal structure is crucial, and its mutations disrupt normal retinal organization, leading to progressive vision loss (den2004CRB1). Despite extensive research, no clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been established, suggesting that additional genetic or environmental factors may influence the clinical presentation of CRB1-related diseases (Bujakowska2011CRB1; Ehrenberg2013CRB1:).

## Interactions
CRB1, a member of the Crumbs family, is involved in several critical protein interactions within the retina. It forms homo- and heteromeric complexes with CRB2, but not with CRB3, due to the absence of an extracellular domain in CRB3 (Stehle2024Human). The CRB1 protein structure includes an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The intracellular domain interacts with proteins such as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 5 (EPB41L5) through the FERM domain and Lin Seven 1 (PALS1) through the PDZ domain (Alves2014The; Stehle2024Human).

CRB1 and CRB2 co-localize at the outer limiting membrane (OLM) in the retina, forming stable interactions that are not significantly impaired by certain missense mutations (Stehle2024Human). The CRB1-CRB2 complex interacts with various proteins involved in vesicular transport, signaling, lipid metabolism, cilia homeostasis, and cytoskeleton organization (Stehle2024Human). CRB1 also interacts with the core PAR complex, which includes PAR6, PAR3, atypical protein kinase C, and CDC42, playing a role in regulating apical-basal polarity and cellular signaling pathways (Stehle2024Human).

The CRB complex, which includes CRB1, is linked to the mTOR and Hippo pathways through interactions with proteins such as PATJ, KIBRA, AMOT, and YAP/TAZ, influencing cell signaling and retinal development (Alves2014The).
