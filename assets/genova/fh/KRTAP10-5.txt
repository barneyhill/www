# KRTAP10-5

## Overview
KRTAP10-5 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 10-5, which is a member of the keratin-associated protein family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the structural composition of hair and nails, contributing to their mechanical strength and resilience. The protein encoded by KRTAP10-5 is characterized by a high content of cysteine, glycine, and tyrosine, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds essential for maintaining structural integrity. These bonds are crucial for the protein's interaction with keratin filaments, thereby playing a significant role in the architecture of hair and nails. The keratin-associated protein 10-5 is categorized as a structural protein due to its involvement in forming and maintaining the physical properties of keratinized tissues (Pease2022Transcriptomic).

## Structure
KRTAP10-5, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, plays a role in the structure of hair and nails. The primary structure of KRTAP10-5 consists of amino acid sequences rich in glycine and tyrosine, which are characteristic of keratin-associated proteins. These proteins typically have a high cysteine content, contributing to the formation of disulfide bonds that are crucial for their structural integrity. The secondary structure of KRTAP10-5 often includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in keratin-associated proteins due to their role in providing structural support. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are formed between cysteine residues, enhancing the protein's stability and rigidity. In terms of quaternary structure, KRTAP10-5 interacts with keratin filaments, contributing to the overall architecture of hair and nails. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, influencing the protein's function and interactions. These structural features enable KRTAP10-5 to fulfill its role in the formation and maintenance of hair and nail structures (Pease2022Transcriptomic).

## Clinical Significance
KRTAP10-5 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression levels and genetic variations. In prostate cancer, KRTAP10-5 is part of a prognostic risk model that predicts biochemical recurrence. It is highly expressed in the low-risk group, which correlates with a lower risk of recurrence and better clinical outcomes, including lower cancer stages and higher survival probabilities (Liu2023Comprehensive). Conversely, in the high-risk group, KRTAP10-5 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its role in cancer progression and metastasis (Liu2023Comprehensive).

In the context of bone disorders, KRTAP10-5 is among the genetic variants identified in craniometadiaphyseal dysplasia, a condition characterized by bone modeling errors. Although the specific clinical significance of KRTAP10-5 mutations in this disorder is not detailed, it is part of a group of genes highly correlated with bone development and metabolism (Hao2021Diaphyseal).

KRTAP10-5 is also mentioned as a rare variant in familial sarcoidosis, a complex disease with genetic heterogeneity. While its precise role in sarcoidosis pathogenesis is not fully understood, it is considered a candidate gene for further research (Kishore2018Wholeexome).
