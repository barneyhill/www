# HCFC2

## Overview
The HCFC2 gene encodes the host cell factor C2 (HCF-2) protein, which is a pivotal component in transcriptional regulation. HCF-2 is characterized by its complex structure, including Kelch repeats and a fibronectin type-III domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its regulatory functions. As a transcriptional co-regulator, HCF-2 is involved in modulating the activity of transcription factors such as IRF1 and IRF2, thereby influencing the expression of genes critical for immune responses, including those involved in antiviral defense mechanisms (Sun2017HCFC2). The protein's role extends to inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting differentiation, underscoring its importance in cellular growth and development (Gudkova2019HCF2). HCF-2's interactions with various proteins and its involvement in key signaling pathways highlight its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune function (Sun2017HCFC2).

## Structure
The HCFC2 gene encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The protein includes various domains that facilitate its function, notably Kelch repeats and a fibronectin type-III domain. These structural features are crucial for the protein's role in cellular processes, as they contribute to its ability to interact with other molecules and perform its regulatory functions. 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are common in HCFC2, potentially influencing its activity and interactions. These modifications can alter the protein's conformation and stability, impacting its function in transcriptional regulation. 

HCFC2 is known to exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which contribute to its functional diversity. The presence of these isoforms allows the protein to participate in a variety of cellular contexts and regulatory pathways, adapting its function to meet specific cellular needs. The diversity in isoforms underscores the protein's versatility and importance in transcriptional regulation. 

Overall, the structural complexity of HCFC2, including its domains and post-translational modifications, highlights its significant role in human cellular processes.

## Function
The HCFC2 gene encodes the HCF-2 protein, which plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation within healthy human cells. HCF-2 is involved in the regulation of transcription factors IRF1 and IRF2, which are crucial for the transcription of TLR3 and other immune response genes (IRGs). It forms a complex with IRF1 or IRF2, promoting their binding to DNA targets, potentially through inducing conformational changes that enhance DNA binding. This interaction is essential for the proper expression of genes involved in the immune response, such as those that inhibit viral components or activate immune cells (Sun2017HCFC2).

HCF-2 is also involved in inhibiting cell proliferation and activating differentiation-gene expression programs. It is localized in the nucleolus, a feature conferred by its C-terminal Fibronectin type 3 repeats. Elevated levels of HCF-2 lead to phenotypes such as inhibition of cell proliferation and mitotic defects, while activating differentiation and morphogenesis gene-expression programs (Gudkova2019HCF2). The protein is broadly present in human and mouse cells, suggesting its involvement in general cellular functions, including cell growth and division regulation (Gudkova2019HCF2). HCF-2's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and immune response.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HCFC2 gene can lead to significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of immune response to viral infections. The HCFC2 gene is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of TLR3 and other interferon-regulated genes, which are essential for mounting an effective immune response against viral pathogens. Mutations in HCFC2, such as the fls mutation, result in impaired binding of IRF1 and IRF2 to the TLR3 promoter, leading to reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. This impairment compromises the host's ability to respond to viral infections, increasing susceptibility to diseases like influenza A virus and herpes simplex virus 1 (Sun2017HCFC2).

The fls mutation specifically results in a tryptophan-to-arginine substitution at amino acid 296, which reduces protein stability and leads to degradation. This mutation disrupts TLR3-associated signaling pathways, including MAPK and NF-κB signaling, and affects the production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to poly(I:C) stimulation (Sun2017HCFC2). Mice with HCFC2 mutations exhibit increased susceptibility to viral infections, with significantly reduced survival rates compared to wild-type mice, highlighting the gene's critical role in immune defense (Sun2017HCFC2).

## Interactions
HCFC2 (host cell factor C2) is involved in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation. HCFC2 facilitates the binding of transcription factors IRF1 and IRF2 to the TLR3 promoter, which is essential for TLR3 transcription. This interaction is mediated through specific domains, including HCFC2's kelch-like repeats 5 and 6 within the β-propeller domain and the IRF association domain of IRF2 (Sun2017HCFC2). Although HCFC2 does not directly bind to DNA, it enhances the formation of IRF1/IRF-E and IRF2/IRF-E complexes, suggesting that it interacts with IRF1 and IRF2 to promote their DNA binding (Sun2017HCFC2).

Mass spectrometry of immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged HCFC2 complexes has identified several interacting partners, including histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD1A, retinoblastoma-binding protein 5 (RBBP5), and WD repeat-containing protein 5 (WDR5), which validates the experimental protocol used to study these interactions (Sun2017HCFC2). HCFC2's interaction with IRF1 and IRF2 may induce conformational changes that enhance their DNA binding ability, similar to the role of HCFC1 in forming complexes with VP16 and Oct1 to bind viral DNA (Sun2017HCFC2). These interactions are critical for the transcriptional regulation of TLR3 and other interferon-regulated genes, impacting immune responses and host defense mechanisms.
