# CNTLN

## Overview
The CNTLN gene encodes the centlein protein, which is integral to centrosome cohesion and microtubule stability. As a centrosomal protein, centlein is involved in maintaining the cohesion of centriole pairs and stabilizing microtubules, processes essential for accurate cell division and genomic integrity. It plays a critical role in regulating microtubule acetylation, thereby influencing microtubule stability and function. Centlein's interactions with other proteins, such as CEP68 and C-Nap1, are vital for the structural integrity of the centrosome linker, which is crucial for centriole cohesion. Additionally, CNTLN has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both cellular function and disease pathology (Kumari2018Regulation; Zheng2015Genomewide; Remo2020The).

## Function
Centlein (CNTLN) is a protein that plays a significant role in centrosome cohesion and microtubule stability. It is involved in maintaining the cohesion of centriole pairs from the S phase until mitosis, which is crucial for proper cell division (Remo2020The). Centlein stabilizes microtubules and regulates their acetylation, a process important for microtubule stability and function. The depletion of centlein leads to decreased levels of acetylated microtubules, indicating its role in controlling microtubule acetylation (Kumari2018Regulation).

Centlein is also implicated in the organization of microtubules, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis, which is essential for maintaining genomic integrity (Kumari2018Regulation). It is active in the centrosome, the main microtubule-organizing center in human cells, contributing to processes such as cell migration, polarity, and signal transduction (Remo2020The). The protein's function in centrosome cohesion and microtubule regulation highlights its importance in cellular and organismal development, impacting processes like intracellular transport and cell cycle regulation (Kumari2018Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
The CNTLN gene, encoding the centlein protein, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in centrosome and cilia function. Alterations in CNTLN have been associated with psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD+P). A deletion on chromosome 9p22.2 affecting CNTLN was found exclusively in AD+P subjects, suggesting a potential link between this genetic alteration and the development of psychosis in Alzheimer's patients (Zheng2015Genomewide).

In the context of cancer, CNTLN has been identified as recurrently mutated in non-small-cell lung cancer patients who developed resistance to afatinib treatment, indicating its possible role in drug resistance mechanisms (van2017Overall). Additionally, a deletion encompassing CNTLN was observed in a genomic study of desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), highlighting its involvement in this rare and aggressive cancer (Ferreira2016A).

Research using a 5 × FAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease has also linked CNTLN-derived circRNAs to cognitive decline, emphasizing the gene's potential involvement in neurodegenerative processes (Sun2022Comprehensive). These findings suggest that CNTLN may play a significant role in various diseases, particularly those involving genomic instability and neurodegeneration.

## Interactions
Centlein (CNTLN) is involved in several interactions crucial for centrosome cohesion and stability. It is known to interact with proteins such as CEP68 and C-Nap1, contributing to the centrosome linker structure, which is essential for maintaining centriole cohesion from the G1 phase until mitotic entry (Remo2020The). Centlein may also form alternative linker filaments or act as connectors for rootletin/CEP68 filaments, depending on the cell type (Remo2020The).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, CNTLN is suggested to interact with the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 as part of a signaling cascade at the centrosome that regulates the cell cycle (Hohman2016Genetic). This interaction indicates a potential role in Alzheimer's disease pathology through its involvement in centrosome-related processes.

Additionally, CNTLN has been associated with the sperm head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), where it interacts with CCDC113 and SUN5. These interactions are crucial for the proper docking of CCDC113 to the sperm head, ensuring the integrity of the HTCA (Wu2024CCDC113). Despite these known interactions, specific details on the physical interactions of CNTLN with other proteins or nucleic acids remain limited (Kumari2018Regulation).
