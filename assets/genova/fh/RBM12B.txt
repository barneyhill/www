# RBM12B

## Overview
RBM12B is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 12B, which is involved in various cellular processes related to RNA metabolism. The protein is characterized by its RNA-binding motifs, which suggest a role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Although the specific functions of RBM12B are not fully elucidated, proteins with RNA-binding motifs are typically involved in processes such as RNA splicing, transport, stability, and translation. The study of RBM12B and its protein product is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential implications in cellular function and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
