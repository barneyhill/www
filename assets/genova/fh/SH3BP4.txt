# SH3BP4

## Overview
SH3BP4 is a gene that encodes the SH3 domain binding protein 4, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). As an endocytic adaptor protein, SH3BP4 plays a critical role in the internalization of receptors such as neuropilin-1 and α5-integrin, which are vital for cell-matrix interactions and signaling pathways (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4). The protein is regulated by phosphorylation through the Akt signaling pathway, which modulates its localization and function in endocytosis (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4). Beyond its role in endocytosis, SH3BP4 is involved in integrin homeostasis, semaphorin-3a signaling, and fibronectin extracellular matrix remodeling (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4). It also influences melanogenesis by interacting with miR-125b and MITF, affecting melanin content in melanocytes (Kim2017SH3BP4). The gene's involvement in cancer pathogenesis and viral interactions underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Schmotz2019MC159).

## Function
SH3BP4, also known as transferrin receptor trafficking protein (TTP), is an endocytic adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in human cells. It is involved in the endocytosis of neuropilin-1 and α5-integrin receptors, which are essential for cell-matrix interactions. SH3BP4 interacts with proteins such as clathrin, dynamin-2, and Eps15, facilitating the assembly and function of the clathrin coat (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4). The protein is regulated by Akt, which phosphorylates it at S246, inhibiting its localization to clathrin-coated pits and thus its endocytic activity (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4).

SH3BP4 also plays a role in the regulation of integrin homeostasis by reducing integrin exposure on the cell surface, thereby modulating cell adhesion. It is involved in semaphorin-3a signaling, which activates SH3BP4 via PTEN, promoting cell contraction through endocytosis (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4). Additionally, SH3BP4 is implicated in fibronectin extracellular matrix remodeling, as its knockout leads to reduced fibronectin fibrillogenesis (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4).

In the context of pigmentation, SH3BP4 is inversely regulated by miR-125b and MITF, playing a role in melanogenesis by influencing melanin content and TYR expression in melanocytes (Kim2017SH3BP4).

## Clinical Significance
SH3BP4 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer pathogenesis. It has been identified as a significant factor in laryngeal and metastatic prostate cancer. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3' untranslated region of SH3BP4 is associated with laryngeal cancer survival, and SH3BP4 is differentially expressed in metastatic prostate cancer (Schmotz2019MC159). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SH3BP4 is involved in the endocytosis of neuropilin-1 and α5-integrins, processes regulated by Akt signaling. The loss of PTEN and increased Akt activity can lead to resistance to semaphorin-3A signaling due to the phosphorylation of SH3BP4, which inhibits its endocytic function. This resistance mechanism is significant in NSCLCs with PTEN mutations (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4).

SH3BP4 also plays a role in the suppression of autophagy by the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) through its interaction with the viral protein MC159. This interaction is crucial for the virus's ability to inhibit autophagy, a process that could be relevant to the virus's immunoevasion strategies (Schmotz2019MC159). The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and viral infections.

## Interactions
SH3BP4, also known as transferrin receptor trafficking protein (TTP), is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes such as endocytosis and signal transduction. It interacts with clathrin, dynamin-2, and Eps15, which are essential components of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4). SH3BP4's interaction with Eps15 is regulated by phosphorylation at serine-246 (S246) by Akt, which promotes binding to 14-3-3 proteins and inhibits its recruitment to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4).

SH3BP4 also binds to GIPC1, a PDZ domain-containing protein, enhancing the interaction with the cytoplasmic tail of neuropilin-1 (NRP1) (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4). This interaction is crucial for the endocytosis of NRP1 and α5-integrin, with SH3BP4 knockout cells showing reduced internalization of these proteins (Burckhardt2021SH3BP4). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, SH3BP4 interacts with Ciz1, Plekha1, TTC1, and Txl-1, influencing cell cycle progression and signaling pathways (Thalappilly2008Identification).

Additionally, SH3BP4 is targeted by miR-125b, which inversely regulates its expression, and is also regulated by MITF, a master regulator of melanocytic lineage-specific genes (Kim2017SH3BP4). In the context of viral interactions, SH3BP4 binds to the MC159 protein of the molluscum contagiosum virus, affecting autophagy by interacting with Rag GTPases (Schmotz2019MC159).
