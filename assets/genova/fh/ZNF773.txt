# ZNF773

## Overview
ZNF773 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 773, which is a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate its role as a transcription factor by enabling specific DNA-binding capabilities. Zinc finger protein 773 is involved in various cellular processes, including gene regulation and chromatin remodeling, through its interaction with DNA. The gene's expression and methylation status have been linked to several diseases, such as cancer and schizophrenia, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (van2021GenNet; Ren2018Discovery; Burkitt2023Role).

## Structure
ZNF773 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capabilities. The primary structure of ZNF773 is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which are essential for the formation of zinc finger motifs. These motifs typically consist of a conserved sequence that coordinates zinc ions, stabilizing the structure of the protein.

The secondary structure of ZNF773 includes alpha helices, which are stabilized by the coordination of zinc ions. These helices are integral to the protein's ability to interact with DNA, allowing it to perform its regulatory functions effectively. The tertiary structure of ZNF773 is defined by the folding of these alpha helices, which creates a compact and functional domain capable of binding to specific DNA sequences.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the function of ZNF773, potentially altering its activity or interactions with other molecules. Additionally, splice variants of ZNF773 may exist, leading to differences in the protein's structure and function. These variants can result in proteins with altered DNA-binding properties or regulatory roles, contributing to the diversity of functions that ZNF773 can perform.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF773 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its methylation and expression levels. In human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), ZNF773 is identified as a differentially methylated region (DMR) with significant hypermethylation in tumors compared to normal tissues. This hypermethylation is associated with high specificity and sensitivity in distinguishing tumor from normal tissue, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for HPV-positive OPSCC detection (Ren2018Discovery; Burkitt2023Role).

In gastric cancer, ZNF773 is downregulated and hypermethylated in cisplatin-resistant cancer cells, indicating a possible role in chemotherapy resistance. This suggests that alterations in ZNF773 methylation may contribute to the development of drug resistance in gastric cancer (Choi2017Alteration).

ZNF773 is also associated with schizophrenia, where it is one of the top genes identified by the GenNet framework for its predictive value. The gene's significant weight in the neural network model highlights its potential involvement in the polygenic nature of schizophrenia (van2021GenNet; van2020GenNet).

In colon cancer, ZNF773 is differentially expressed in CIMP-high tumors, indicating its involvement in specific molecular phenotypes of the disease (Slattery2015Gene).
