# MGRN1

## Overview
MGRN1 (mahogunin ring finger 1) is a gene that encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase protein, mahogunin ring finger 1, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in maintaining cellular homeostasis. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins and regulating endosomal and lysosomal trafficking. MGRN1 is involved in critical cellular pathways, including ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and mitochondrial maintenance, by modulating interactions with other proteins such as GP78 and TSG101. These interactions are essential for processes like vesicular fusion and calcium signaling. The gene's dysfunction is linked to neurodegenerative diseases and developmental abnormalities, highlighting its significance in cellular quality control and stress response mechanisms (Mukherjee2018Calmodulin; Sun2007Mitochondrial; Chhangani2013Mahogunin).

## Structure


## Function
MGRN1 (mahogunin ring finger 1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through various molecular processes. In healthy human cells, MGRN1 is involved in the regulation of endosomal and lysosomal trafficking, particularly affecting the morphology and function of these organelles. Depletion of MGRN1 leads to morphological changes in endosomes and lysosomes, suggesting its role in multivesicular body formation and late endosome/lysosome biogenesis (Kim2007Spongiform).

MGRN1 also regulates the degradation of misfolded proteins by interacting with the Hsp70 chaperone, facilitating their degradation through autophagy. This function is essential for protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining mitochondrial integrity, as MGRN1 overexpression prevents mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis (Chhangani2013Mahogunin).

Additionally, MGRN1 modulates the interaction with GP78, another E3 ligase, to regulate ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and maintain ER-mitochondria junctions. This interaction is crucial for cellular homeostasis, particularly in response to calcium signaling, as it prevents excessive mitophagy and maintains mitochondrial function (Mukherjee2016Ubiquitin; Mukherjee2018Calmodulin). MGRN1's activity in these pathways underscores its importance in cellular quality control and stress response mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the MGRN1 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative conditions. MGRN1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and its loss leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly affecting complex IV, resulting in reduced ATP levels and increased oxidative stress. These mitochondrial impairments are associated with spongiform neurodegeneration, characterized by neuronal vacuolation and cell death, as observed in Mgrn1 null mutant mice (Sun2007Mitochondrial; Gunn2019Chronic). 

The absence of MGRN1 also disrupts mitophagy, a critical process for mitochondrial maintenance, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and depolarization (Gunn2019Chronic). This dysfunction is linked to conditions such as spongiform encephalopathy, which involves vacuolation, demyelination, and gliosis (Gunn2019Chronic). 

Additionally, MGRN1 mutations can cause abnormal left-right body axis patterning, resulting in congenital heart defects and high mortality rates in mice (Cota2006Mice). The gene's role in protein ubiquitination is crucial for preventing the accumulation of neurotoxic substrates, and its dysfunction may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases (Sun2007Mitochondrial; Chhangani2013Mahogunin).

## Interactions
MGRN1 (mahogunin ring finger 1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. It interacts with GP78, another E3 ligase involved in ER-associated protein degradation. This interaction is modulated by cytosolic calcium levels, with calmodulin (CaM) acting as an adapter protein. Under low calcium conditions, MGRN1 interacts with GP78, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. Elevated calcium levels weaken this interaction, stabilizing GP78 (Mukherjee2018Calmodulin).

MGRN1 also interacts with TSG101, a component of the ESCRT-I complex, through a bimodal interaction involving the UEV domain of TSG101 and the PSAP motif of MGRN1. This interaction facilitates the monoubiquitination of TSG101, which is crucial for vesicular fusion between amphisomes/multivesicular bodies and lysosomes (Majumder2015Mahogunin).

Additionally, MGRN1 interacts with the Hsp70 chaperone and co-localizes with perinuclear inclusion bodies and misfolded proteins when autophagy is inhibited. This interaction is significant for the degradation of misfolded proteins and cellular stress responses (Chhangani2013Mahogunin). MGRN1's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress response.
