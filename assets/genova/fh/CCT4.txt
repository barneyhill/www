# CCT4

## Overview
CCT4 is a gene that encodes the protein chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 4, which is a critical component of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT or TRiC). This complex is a type of molecular chaperone that plays a pivotal role in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin and tubulin, which are essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Dekker2008The; Ghozlan2022The). The CCT4 protein is categorized as a chaperonin and is involved in ATP-dependent protein folding processes, contributing to the energy-dependent folding mechanism of the CCT complex (Cuéllar2019Structural). CCT4's function is crucial for cellular homeostasis, impacting processes such as cell cycle progression and cytoskeletal organization (Dekker2008The; Ghozlan2022The). Mutations in the CCT4 gene have been linked to hereditary sensory neuropathy and are implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Narayanan2016The; Zheng2023A).

## Structure
The CCT4 protein is a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), which is essential for the folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin. CCT4, along with other subunits, forms a double-ringed barrel structure composed of two stacked eight-membered hetero-oligomeric rings (Collier2021Native; Grantham2020The). Each subunit, including CCT4, has a domain architecture consisting of an equatorial domain with a nucleotide-binding pocket, a flexible linker domain, and an apical substrate-binding domain (Grantham2020The).

CCT4 undergoes N-terminal processing, which includes the removal of the initiator methionine and N-terminal acetylation. These modifications are consistent with in vivo data and may influence the assembly or function of the TRiC complex (Collier2021Native). The N-termini of CCT subunits, including CCT4, are less conserved and primarily interact with adjacent subunits within the ring (Kalisman2013The).

CCT4 is involved in ATP hydrolysis, acting as a 'power-subunit' within the CCT complex, which is crucial for its function in protein folding (Kalisman2013The). The quaternary structure of CCT4 involves its integration into the CCT complex, where it can form non-canonical homo- and hetero-oligomeric assemblies (Collier2021Native).

## Function
CCT4, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), plays a crucial role in protein folding within healthy human cells. This complex is essential for the proper folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are vital for maintaining cellular structure and function (Dekker2008The; Ghozlan2022The). CCT4 is involved in the ATPase cycle of the CCT complex, where it exhibits high affinity for ATP, contributing significantly to the energy-dependent folding process of proteins (Cuéllar2019Structural; Ghozlan2022The). 

CCT4 is part of the CCT2 hemisphere of the complex, which is characterized by strong ATP binding and hydrolysis, indicating its role in the energy-dependent folding process (Cuéllar2019Structural). The subunit is also involved in the assembly and potential disassembly of the CCT complex, which is crucial for its function in protein folding and cell function (Ghozlan2022The). 

In terms of cellular localization, CCT4 operates in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the folding and assembly of proteins, impacting cell division and stability (Ghozlan2022The). The proper functioning of CCT4 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and cytoskeletal organization (Dekker2008The; Ghozlan2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCT4 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative conditions and cancer. Mutations in CCT4 are associated with hereditary sensory neuropathy, a condition characterized by nerve damage that affects sensation (Narayanan2016The; Minegishi2016CCT2). This mutation leads to structural instability and failure to form the CCT ring complex, which is crucial for its function in protein folding and maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Minegishi2016CCT2).

In the context of cancer, CCT4 is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissues, suggesting a role in tumor progression and potentially serving as a biomarker for this aggressive cancer subtype (Zheng2023A). The overexpression of CCT4 and other CCT subunits in cancer is linked to increased cell proliferation and poor prognosis, indicating its involvement in cancer cell survival and growth (Zheng2023A).

The dysfunction of the CCT complex, including CCT4, is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. The complex is involved in the folding and stabilization of proteins like tau, which accumulates in Alzheimer's disease. Repression of mRNA levels of the TRiC complex, which includes CCT4, has been observed in Alzheimer's disease patient brain samples, suggesting a broader implication of CCT complex dysfunction in neurodegenerative conditions (Pavel2016CCT).

## Interactions
CCT4, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT or TRiC), participates in various protein interactions essential for cellular functions. It is involved in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are critical for maintaining cell structure and function (Grantham2020The). CCT4 also interacts with the dynactin complex protein p150 Glued, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal organization and intracellular transport (Grantham2020The).

CCT4 is part of the CCT complex's interactome, which includes interactions with WD-repeat proteins, protein kinases, and cytoskeletal proteins. These interactions are crucial for processes like protein synthesis, folding, and degradation (Narayanan2016The). The CCT complex, including CCT4, is implicated in the assembly and function of the mTOR complex by interacting with subunits such as mLST8, which binds between the chaperonin rings (Cuéllar2019Structural).

Mutations in CCT4 are associated with hereditary sensory neuropathy, highlighting its medical significance (Narayanan2016The). CCT4's involvement in protein aggregation and autophagy is also noted, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases (Pavel2016CCT).
