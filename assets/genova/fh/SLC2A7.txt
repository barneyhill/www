# SLC2A7

## Overview
SLC2A7 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 7 (GLUT7), which is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of membrane transporters. GLUT7 is classified as a Class II glucose transporter and is primarily involved in the transport of hexoses, such as glucose and fructose, across cell membranes. This protein is predominantly expressed in the apical membranes of the small intestine and colon, where it plays a crucial role in nutrient absorption. GLUT7 is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domain topology, which is typical of GLUT proteins, and exhibits a high affinity for glucose and fructose, although it does not transport galactose. The gene's expression and the protein's function are subject to regulation by dietary sugars, which can influence their levels in response to sugar availability (Jafri2023Molecular; Mueckler2013The; Cheeseman2015Structure).

## Structure
The SLC2A7 gene encodes the GLUT7 protein, a member of the solute carrier family 2, which is part of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of membrane transporters. GLUT7 is characterized by a 12 transmembrane domain topology, a common feature among GLUT proteins, facilitating the transport of hexoses across cell membranes (Jafri2023Molecular; Cheeseman2015Structure). 

Classified as a Class II GLUT, GLUT7 shares structural similarities with other members of this class, such as the absence of the tryptophan residue following the GPXXXP motif on TM10 and the QLS motif, which are present in Class I GLUTs. Instead, it features a unique isoleucine residue in TM7, contributing to its substrate specificity for fructose and glucose (Jafri2023Molecular; Cheeseman2015Structure). 

GLUT7 is expressed predominantly in the apical membranes of the small intestine and colon, where it plays a role in nutrient absorption. Despite its high affinity for fructose and glucose, the physiological substrates of GLUT7 remain uncertain due to its low turnover rates (Mueckler2013The). The protein's structure and function are influenced by its sequence identity with other fructose transporters, such as GLUT5, with which it shares 40-50% sequence identity (Mueckler2013The).

## Function
SLC2A7 encodes the glucose transporter protein GLUT7, which is primarily expressed in the small intestine, particularly in the ileum, and plays a significant role in nutrient absorption. GLUT7 is involved in the transport of glucose and fructose across the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, facilitating the uptake of these sugars from the intestinal lumen into the cells (Cura2012Role; Gauer2018Differential). This transporter has a high affinity for both glucose and fructose, but it does not transport galactose, indicating its specific role in scavenging luminal glucose and fructose, especially under conditions of low sugar abundance (Cura2012Role; Mueckler2013The).

GLUT7 is localized to the apical membrane of differentiated intestinal cells, suggesting its involvement in the initial stages of sugar absorption during digestion (Gauer2018Differential). The expression of GLUT7 can be modulated by dietary sugars, with fructose supplementation leading to an increase in GLUT7 mRNA and protein levels, indicating a regulatory mechanism responsive to sugar availability (Gauer2018Differential). This regulation is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis and efficient nutrient absorption in the human body.

## Clinical Significance
The SLC2A7 gene, encoding the glucose transporter GLUT7, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SLC2A7 is part of a prognostic signature alongside SLC2A1 and SLC2A11. High expression levels of SLC2A7 are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its role as a risk factor in LUAD. The study by Zhang et al. highlights that SLC2A7, when overexpressed, correlates with advanced tumor stages and poor survival outcomes in LUAD patients (Zhang2022SLC2As).

SLC2A7 is also subject to hypermethylation, which may contribute to its aberrant expression in LUAD. This altered expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and may influence the tumor microenvironment, suggesting potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for evaluating immunotherapy effectiveness (Zhang2022SLC2As).

In the context of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), SLC2A7 polymorphisms, when combined with other gene variations, have been associated with RPL risk, although individual polymorphisms were not directly linked to the condition. This suggests a potential role in pregnancy-related conditions due to its involvement in nutrient transport (Lee2018Association).
