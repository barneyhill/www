# TMEM229A

## Overview
TMEM229A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 229A, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. TMEM229A has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor, particularly in the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its expression is often downregulated. The protein plays a critical role in modulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the ERK signaling pathway, both of which are crucial in cancer progression (Zhang2021TMEM229A). Additionally, specific mutations in TMEM229A, such as the Q200del mutation, have been associated with protective effects against tumorigenesis in lung adenocarcinoma (Liang2023Clinical).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM229A has been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Studies have shown that TMEM229A expression is significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to normal lung tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung carcinoma, as evidenced by shorter overall survival in patients with low TMEM229A expression (Zhang2021TMEM229A). Overexpression of TMEM229A has been found to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. Mechanistically, TMEM229A overexpression increases E-cadherin expression and reduces N-cadherin, Snail1, and MMP2 expression, indicating suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It also reduces phosphorylated ERK and AKT levels, suggesting that its tumor-suppressive effects are mediated through inactivation of the ERK signaling pathway (Zhang2021TMEM229A).

In lung adenocarcinoma, the TMEM229A Q200del mutation has been identified, particularly in the lepidic subtype. This mutation is associated with a protective role in tumorigenesis, as it inhibits cell proliferation and migration by inactivating the ERK pathway (Liang2023Clinical).
