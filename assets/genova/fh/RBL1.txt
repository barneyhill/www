# RBL1

## Overview
RBL1, also known as RB transcriptional corepressor like 1 or p107, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family, which includes RB1 and RBL2. The RBL1 protein functions as a transcriptional corepressor and plays a pivotal role in regulating the cell cycle, acting as a tumor suppressor. It is characterized by its ability to interact with E2F transcription factors and form complexes such as the DREAM complex, which are crucial for controlling the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (Ventura2021RBL1p107). The protein is subject to regulation by cyclin-dependent kinases, which modulate its activity through phosphorylation (Ventura2021RBL1p107). RBL1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and maintaining tissue homeostasis, and its dysfunction is implicated in the development of several cancers (Flores2022Retinoblastoma; Naert2019RBL1).

## Structure
RBL1, also known as p107, is a member of the retinoblastoma protein family, which plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. The protein shares structural similarities with other family members, such as pRB and p130, particularly in the conserved pocket domain. This domain is essential for binding E2F transcription factors and interacting with viral oncoproteins through the LXCXE motif (Henley2012The). The pocket domain consists of two subdomains, A and B, separated by a flexible spacer, and forms part of the larger pocket, which includes the C-terminal domain. This large pocket is the minimal growth-suppressing domain capable of binding E2F transcription factors (Henley2012The).

RBL1 also contains unique structural features not present in pRB, such as insertions in the B domain and longer spacer regions, which allow stable interactions with cyclin-dependent kinase complexes. The N-terminal region of RBL1 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases, contributing to its regulatory functions in the cell cycle (Henley2012The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, influence the activity of RBL1, affecting its interactions and regulatory capabilities (Henley2012The). Multiple splice variants of RBL1 exist, which may alter its functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
RBL1, also known as RB transcriptional corepressor like 1, is a member of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family, which includes RB1 and RBL2. These proteins are crucial regulators of the cell cycle and act as tumor suppressors. RBL1/p107 interacts with E2F transcription factors and forms the DREAM complex, which represses transcription, particularly during the G1-to-S phase transition. It is hyperphosphorylated and inactivated during the S phase by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes (Ventura2021RBL1p107).

RBL1/p107 is involved in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and maintaining homeostasis in various tissues. In the epidermis, it is expressed in basal and lower spinous cells, exerting a strong inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. Its loss, along with Rb1, can lead to aggressive skin tumors in the presence of oncogenic mutations (Flores2022Retinoblastoma). In the intestine, RBL1 is expressed in proliferating crypt cells, and its loss exacerbates hyperplasia and differentiation issues (Flores2022Retinoblastoma).

RBL1/p107 is also involved in the development of the organ of Corti in the inner ear, where it regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. Its deficiency leads to increased proliferation and altered differentiation, affecting auditory function (Walsh2012Lack). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in maintaining cellular quiescence and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RBL1 gene, also known as p107, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. RBL1 functions as a tumor suppressor in glioblastoma and small-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (SC-PaNEC). In glioblastoma, while direct genetic inactivation of RBL1 is rare, its tumor-suppressing role can be compromised through prolonged phosphorylation by Cyclin/CDK complexes, leading to cancer initiation (Naert2019RBL1). The inactivation of both RBL1 and RB1 is sufficient to initiate glioma, and the presence of TP53 mutations can facilitate the progression to high-grade glioblastoma (Naert2019RBL1).

In SC-PaNEC, RBL1, along with RB1, is crucial for tumor suppression. The inactivation of both genes leads to a high penetrance of SC-PaNEC, indicating that RBL1 mutations, particularly when combined with RB1 mutations, are significant in the development of this cancer (Naert2019RBL1). In lung cancer, the deletion of RBL1, along with RB1, results in non-small cell lung cancers, highlighting RBL1's unique role in lung tumor suppression (Flores2022Retinoblastoma). These findings underscore the importance of RBL1 in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
RBL1, also known as p107, is a member of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family and plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation through its interactions with various proteins. RBL1 interacts with E2F transcription factors, particularly E2F4 and E2F5, to regulate the expression of E2F-responsive genes, which are crucial for cell cycle progression (Hurford1997pRB). It can form the DREAM complex with RBL2/p130, acting as a transcriptional repressor (Ventura2021RBL1p107). In the absence of RBL2/p130, RBL1 can assemble into DREAM-like complexes, although the functionality of these complexes is not well-defined (Ventura2021RBL1p107).

RBL1 is phosphorylated by cyclinD-CDK4/CDK6 complexes, which modulates its interaction with E2F transcription factors and affects cell cycle progression (Ventura2021RBL1p107). The stability and activity of RBL1 are influenced by calcium-dependent signaling pathways, including CaMKs and calpain, which affect its phosphorylation status and protein degradation (Ventura2021RBL1p107). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving RBL1 and its role in controlling cell cycle transitions and gene expression.
