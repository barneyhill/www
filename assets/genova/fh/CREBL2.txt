# CREBL2

## Overview
CREBL2 (cAMP responsive element binding protein like 2) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, particularly adipogenesis and glucose metabolism. The protein product of CREBL2, also referred to as cAMP responsive element binding protein like 2, functions by interacting with the CREB protein to regulate the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors, thereby playing a crucial role in adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis (Ma2011CREBL2). This transcription factor is active in the nucleus and is known to form complexes with other proteins, influencing metabolic processes and cellular responses to environmental changes (Ma2011CREBL2). Beyond its metabolic functions, CREBL2 has been implicated in various diseases, including certain cancers, due to its altered expression or genetic mutations, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and its significance in broader physiological and pathological contexts (Al‐Shehhi2012Abnormalities; Kibel2004Expression).

## Function
CREBL2 (cAMP responsive element binding protein like 2) is a transcription factor involved in adipogenesis, the process by which preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes. It functions by interacting with CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein) to regulate the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors such as PPARγ and C/EBPα. This interaction enhances CREB's protein stability and transcriptional activity, which is crucial for adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis (Ma2011CREBL2). CREBL2 is active in the nucleus, where it forms a complex with CREB, confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy (Ma2011CREBL2).

In addition to its role in adipogenesis, CREBL2 is involved in glucose uptake by up-regulating glucose transporters such as GLUT1 and GLUT4, which are essential for lipogenesis in adipocytes (Ma2011CREBL2). CREBL2's expression is up-regulated during the differentiation of preadipocytes and remains high throughout the differentiation period, indicating its significant role in adipose tissue development (Ma2011CREBL2). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, suggesting its involvement in broader metabolic processes (Ma2011CREBL2).

## Clinical Significance
CREBL2 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or genetic mutations. In advanced prostate carcinoma, CREBL2 is located within a region of deletion associated with the disease, suggesting its potential role as a tumor-suppressor gene (Kibel2004Expression). In childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), CREBL2 is part of a centromeric deletion on the der(12)t(12;21) chromosome, which may contribute to leukemogenesis through mechanisms such as haploinsufficiency of tumor suppressor genes (Al‐Shehhi2012Abnormalities).

In multiple myeloma, CREBL2 is among the genes with decreased expression in samples with deletions on chromosome 12, although no prognostic value was found in the limited dataset analyzed (Walker2010A). CREBL2 is also expressed in a significant number of cases involving myeloid malignancies, indicating its potential significance in these conditions (Haferlach2011CDKN1B).

Additionally, CREBL2 has been identified as one of the genes with a significant negative correlation with miR-21-3p expression, which may influence mTOR pathway activity in metastatic pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL) (Calsina2019Integrative). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various cancers and its potential as a target for further research.

## Interactions
CREBL2, a transcription factor, interacts with the CREB protein in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation analysis, where Myc-tagged CREBL2 pulls down FLAG-tagged CREB, indicating a binding interaction. Endogenous co-immunoprecipitation analysis further validates that CREBL2 can bind to CREB under physiological conditions (Ma2011CREBL2). CREBL2 and CREB co-localize in the nucleus, suggesting they may form a functional complex that influences adipocyte differentiation and metabolic processes (Ma2011CREBL2).

CREBL2 modulates the transcriptional activity and phosphorylation of CREB, as shown by increased CREB reporter gene activity and phosphorylation at Ser 133 when CREBL2 is overexpressed. Conversely, knockdown of CREBL2 reduces CREB activity and phosphorylation (Ma2011CREBL2). The interaction between CREBL2 and CREB also affects their protein stability, as depletion of one protein reduces the protein level of the other, although it does not affect mRNA levels (Ma2011CREBL2).

CREBL2 also interacts with Crebrf, forming a transcriptional complex similar to the Drosophila REPTOR and REPTOR-BP, which is involved in the transcriptional response to mTORC1 inhibition (Tiebe2019Crebl2).
