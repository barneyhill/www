# PRDM2

## Overview
PRDM2 is a gene that encodes the PR/SET domain 2 protein, which is a member of the PR domain-containing family of proteins. This protein functions primarily as a histone methyltransferase, specifically targeting lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9), and plays a significant role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling (Sorrentino2018Human). The PRDM2 gene produces multiple isoforms, including RIZ1 and RIZ2, through alternative splicing and promoter usage, each with distinct structural and functional characteristics (Sorrentino2018Human). RIZ1, a phosphoprotein with nuclear localization, contains a PR domain and several zinc-finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding and protein interactions (Sorrentino2018Human). PRDM2 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor (Casamassimi2020Multifaceted; Sorrentino2018Human).

## Structure
The PRDM2 gene encodes multiple protein isoforms, including RIZ1 and RIZ2, which have distinct structural features. RIZ1 is a phosphoprotein with nuclear localization, consisting of 1718 amino acids and a molecular weight of 188.9 kDa. It contains a PR domain located at residues 28-141, which is structurally similar to the SET domain but lacks some conserved residues essential for enzymatic activity. This domain has a typical SET fold and a pseudo-knot at the C-terminus, with a hydrophobic core formed by conserved residues (Sorrentino2018Human). RIZ1 also includes six Cys2His2-type zinc-finger domains that mediate DNA binding (Sorrentino2018Human).

RIZ2, another isoform, lacks the N-terminal PR domain of RIZ1 and is regulated by an estrogen-dependent promoter (Sorrentino2018Human). The PRDM2 gene undergoes alternative splicing and promoter usage, resulting in different isoforms with distinct pathophysiological roles (Sorrentino2018Human). The protein's structure is further characterized by zinc-finger motifs, which may be involved in DNA binding and protein interactions (Sorrentino2018Human). PRDM2 proteins can also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Sorrentino2018Human).

## Function
The PRDM2 gene, also known as RIZ1, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a histone methyltransferase, specifically targeting lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9), which is associated with transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling (Sorrentino2018Human). PRDM2 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis. It acts as a transcriptional repressor of the c-Myc gene, inhibiting cell proliferation by inducing G2-M cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, independent of Rb and p53 expression (Sorrentino2018Human).

In muscle stem cells, PRDM2 maintains cellular quiescence by regulating histone methylation at key promoters, such as Myogenin and CyclinA2, thereby preserving the balance between myogenesis and the cell cycle (Cheedipudi2015A). It is also involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, interacting with estrogen receptors and influencing cellular growth and proliferation in response to hormonal signals (Sorrentino2018Human).

PRDM2 is expressed in T lymphocytes, where it interacts with the GATA-3 transcription factor, playing a role in lymphocyte activation and differentiation (Di2023Exploring). Its activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it impacts transcription regulation and cellular homeostasis (Sorrentino2018Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRDM2 gene, also known as RIZ1, are implicated in various cancers. PRDM2 is located on chromosome 1p36, a region frequently altered in malignancies, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. In many cancers, there is an imbalance between its protein products, RIZ1 and RIZ2, with RIZ1 often downregulated and RIZ2 upregulated, contributing to oncogenesis (Casamassimi2020Multifaceted; Sorrentino2018Human). 

PRDM2 mutations, particularly frameshift mutations, are common in microsatellite instability (MIN) positive cancers such as colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. These mutations often result in truncated forms of PRDM2, impairing its tumor-suppressive functions (Casamassimi2020Multifaceted; Sorrentino2018Human). Epigenetic silencing through promoter methylation is another mechanism of RIZ1 inactivation, observed in cancers like breast, liver, colon, and lung (Tan2018The; Casamassimi2020Multifaceted).

PRDM2 also interacts with the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway and is influenced by estrogen, affecting cancer cell proliferation and differentiation. Alterations in these interactions can lead to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, contributing to cancer progression (Casamassimi2020Multifaceted; Sorrentino2018Human).

## Interactions
PRDM2, also known as RIZ1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation (Sorrentino2018Human). PRDM2 also interacts with estrogen receptors (ERs), promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis upon estradiol treatment (Sorrentino2018Human). 

The PR domain of RIZ1 is crucial for its tumor suppressor function, involving methyltransferase activity that regulates downstream molecules like c-Myc and TXNIP (Sorrentino2018Human). PRDM2 interacts with the histone H4 lysine 20 monomethyltransferase PR-Set7/Set8/KMT5a, establishing a 'histone code' that marks silent chromatin regions (Sorrentino2018Human). 

PRDM2 is also involved in epigenetic regulation through its interaction with EZH2, a component of the PRC2 complex. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the bivalent status of the CCNA2 gene's PRE-like element in the G0 phase by influencing histone marks (Cheedipudi2015A). PRDM2's interaction with EZH2 helps sequester it, limiting H3K27 mark deposition and maintaining CCNA2 in a poised state during quiescence (Cheedipudi2015A). 

In T lymphocytes, PRDM2 interacts with GATA-3, a transcription factor essential for T cell development and Th2 lymphocyte differentiation (Di2023Exploring). These interactions highlight PRDM2's multifaceted role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability.
