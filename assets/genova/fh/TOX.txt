# TOX

## Overview
TOX is a gene that encodes the thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box protein, a member of the high mobility group (HMG) box family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its DNA-binding domain, which plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression through DNA bending and unwinding. The TOX protein is primarily involved in the development and differentiation of T lymphocytes, which are critical components of the immune system. It functions as a nuclear protein that influences immune cell effector functions and immune checkpoints, thereby playing a role in immune response regulation and T cell exhaustion (Sekine2020TOX; Niu2023TOX). The gene's expression is modulated by various factors, including cytokines and T cell receptor signaling, and is implicated in several clinical conditions, including lymphomas and gliomas, where it serves as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Maestre2020Highmobility; Zhang2020Clinical).

## Structure
The TOX protein is a member of the high mobility group (HMG) box family, characterized by a 70-80 amino acid DNA-binding domain known as the HMG-box. This domain is involved in DNA bending and unwinding, primarily through interactions with the minor groove of the DNA helix (O’Flaherty2003TOX). The HMG-box motif in TOX forms three α-helices in a characteristic L-shaped structure, which is common among HMG-box proteins (O’Flaherty2003TOX). The TOX protein is 526 amino acids long and includes an acidic N-terminal domain, a bipartite nuclear localization signal sequence, and a single centrally located HMG-box motif (O’Flaherty2003TOX).

The TOX protein aligns more closely with sequence-independent HMG-box proteins, as indicated by specific amino acid positions that influence DNA binding. For instance, TOX has a phenylalanine at position 32, a hydrophobic residue that can intercalate into DNA, and a tyrosine at position 65, which is involved in DNA contact (O’Flaherty2003TOX). The absence of a proline at position 70, which is present in sequence-specific HMG-box proteins, further supports its classification as sequence-independent (O’Flaherty2003TOX). The TOX protein also contains conserved lysine residues at the NH2-terminus of the HMG-box motif, which may play a role in its function (O’Flaherty2003TOX). The specific details on the quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of the TOX protein are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The TOX gene encodes a nuclear high mobility group (HMG) protein known as thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box protein, which plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of T lymphocytes, essential components of the immune system (Niu2023TOX). In healthy human cells, TOX is expressed in activated CD8+ T lymphocytes, including memory T cell subsets such as effector memory (TEM) T cells and terminal differentiation effector memory T cells (TEMRA) (Niu2023TOX). TOX is involved in the regulation of immune cell effector functions and immune checkpoints, indicating its role in the immune response and potential exhaustion of T cells (Sekine2020TOX).

TOX expression is associated with the expression of functional molecules like granzyme B, perforin, and cytokines such as IFN and TNF, indicating its role in effective T lymphocyte function (Niu2023TOX). It is also involved in the differentiation and maturation of T cells, with higher expression linked to more mature differentiation states (Niu2023TOX). The gene's expression is influenced by various factors, including cytokines and persistent TCR signal activation, which can upregulate TOX and PD-1 expression in CD8+ T memory cells (Niu2023TOX). TOX is crucial for maintaining the balance between effective immune function and preventing overactivation that could lead to autoimmunity (Niu2023TOX).

## Clinical Significance
The TOX gene is implicated in various lymphomas and gliomas due to its altered expression and mutations. In lymphomas, TOX is highly expressed in T-cell lymphomas such as mycosis fungoides (MF) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), suggesting a role in tumor formation and survival of malignant T cells (Maestre2020Highmobility). In B-cell lymphomas, TOX expression is noted in precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LBL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and follicular lymphoma (FL), with mutations, particularly truncating mutations, associated with poorer prognosis in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) (Maestre2020Highmobility).

In gliomas, TOX expression is generally upregulated compared to normal brain tissue, with higher levels in low-grade gliomas (LGG) than in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). High TOX expression correlates with better survival outcomes and is associated with specific genomic alterations, such as IDH mutations, which are linked to improved prognosis (Zhang2020Clinical). TOX is also involved in immune processes, influencing B cell activation and T cell receptor signaling, while negatively associated with lymphocyte migration and natural killer cell activation (Zhang2020Clinical). These findings suggest TOX's potential as a prognostic marker and its influence on therapeutic responses, particularly in the context of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (Maestre2020Highmobility).

## Interactions
The TOX protein, also known as thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box, is involved in specific interactions with DNA, particularly at the protein-DNA interface on its HMG-box domain. Computational modeling has identified that TOX interacts with specific residues such as Gln262, Pro264, Arg273, Lys313, Glu320, and Gln324 through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. These interactions are crucial for its function and have been targeted in drug discovery efforts. The binding of small molecules to these hot spots can inhibit the viability of TOX-dependent cells. The binding is selective due to unique interactions with the Gln324 residue, which is not conserved in other TOX family proteins. The identified active compounds share common structural features, such as diazole, triazole, and imidazolidinedione moieties, which facilitate these interactions (Radaeva2021Drugging).

TOX is also a key pathogenic driver and therapeutic target in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), where its suppression leads to apoptosis and impaired tumor growth. However, specific interactions of TOX with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Radaeva2021Drugging).
