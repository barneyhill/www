# PUM1

## Overview
PUM1 is a gene that encodes the pumilio RNA binding family member 1, a protein belonging to the Pumilio family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in post-transcriptional regulation by binding to specific sequences in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of target mRNAs, thereby influencing their stability and translation. PUM1 is characterized by a conserved Pumilio homology domain (PUM-HD), which facilitates its RNA-binding capabilities through a series of α-helical Pum repeats. These structural features enable PUM1 to participate in a wide array of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, development, differentiation, and genomic stability maintenance (Enwerem2021Human; Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional). The protein's interactions with other RNA-binding proteins and its involvement in complex regulatory networks underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as neurological disorders and cancer (Liu2021PUM1; Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional).

## Structure
The PUM1 protein is a member of the Pumilio family of RNA-binding proteins, characterized by a conserved Pumilio homology domain (PUM-HD) that facilitates RNA binding. The primary structure of PUM1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its RNA-binding capabilities (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional). The secondary structure includes α-helical Pum repeats, which are crucial for the protein's function. These repeats form a curved structure, with highly conserved amino acid residues lining the inner concave surface of the PUM-HD, allowing for specific RNA interactions (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional).

The tertiary structure of PUM1 involves the folding of the PUM-HD into a specific three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its role in RNA recognition. This structure is characterized by a tripartite recognition motif (TRM) that interacts with RNA bases through hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional). PUM1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional).

PUM1 also exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity and allowing it to participate in various biological processes (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional).

## Function
PUM1 (pumilio RNA binding family member 1) is a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in human cells. It primarily functions by binding to specific sequences in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of target mRNAs, known as PUM response elements (PREs), to regulate mRNA stability and translation. PUM1 promotes mRNA decay by recruiting the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, which shortens the poly(A) tail of mRNAs, leading to their degradation (Enwerem2021Human; Van2012Human). This process is essential for controlling the levels of various mRNAs involved in cell cycle regulation, development, and differentiation (Yamada2020Systematic).

PUM1 is ubiquitously expressed in somatic cells and plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability. It interacts with non-coding RNAs, such as NORAD, to modulate cellular responses to DNA damage (Nishanth2019Functions). PUM1 is also involved in the regulation of stem cell fate, particularly in embryonic stem cells, where it promotes differentiation by repressing pluripotency transcription factors (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional). In the context of neurological functions, PUM1 is expressed in neural stem cells and neurons, influencing spatial learning, memory, and synaptic transmission (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the PUM1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders and conditions. PUM1 mutations have been linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 47 (SCA47), which manifests in two clinical forms: Pumilio1-related cerebellar ataxia (PRCA) and Pumilio1-associated developmental disability, ataxia, and seizure syndrome (PADDAS). PRCA is characterized by adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, while PADDAS presents with early-onset developmental delay, intellectual disability, ataxia, and seizures (Lai2019Investigating; Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional). Specific PUM1 mutations, such as the T1035S missense mutation, are associated with cerebellar degeneration and ataxia (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional).

PUM1 is also implicated in epilepsy, with mutations potentially leading to increased susceptibility to seizures. A de novo missense variant in PUM1 has been associated with a Dravet-like syndrome, characterized by developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (Bonnemason‐Carrere2019PADDAS; Ye2022A).

In cancer, PUM1 is overexpressed in cetuximab-resistant colon cancer cells, promoting cell proliferation and contributing to drug resistance. This overexpression is linked to the regulation of DDX5 mRNA, suggesting a role in the development of resistance to cetuximab therapy in colorectal cancer (Liu2021PUM1).

## Interactions
PUM1, a member of the Pumilio family of RNA-binding proteins, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids to regulate mRNA stability and translation. PUM1 is known to bind to specific sequences in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, influencing their stability and translation. It interacts with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, recruiting it to target mRNAs to promote deadenylation and subsequent mRNA decay. This interaction involves multiple subunits of the complex, including CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT6, CNOT6L, CNOT7, and CNOT8, with a particular emphasis on the Pop2-type deadenylases CNOT7 and CNOT8 (Enwerem2020Human; Van2012Human).

PUM1 also interacts with other RNA-binding proteins, such as FMRP, and may interface with microRNA-mediated regulation, as miRNA binding sites are enriched near PUM recognition elements (PREs) in some target mRNAs (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional). Additionally, PUM1 can engage in auto- and cross-regulation by binding to its own and PUM2's mRNAs, forming a complex regulatory network (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional). These interactions highlight PUM1's role in a sophisticated network of post-transcriptional regulation, involving both stable and transient interactions with various molecular partners.
