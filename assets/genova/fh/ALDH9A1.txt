# ALDH9A1

## Overview
The ALDH9A1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family member A1, which is a crucial component of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids, playing a vital role in detoxifying harmful aldehydes and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Vasiliou2013Aldehyde). ALDH9A1 is particularly significant in the metabolism of γ-aminobutyraldehyde and aminoaldehydes derived from polyamines, as well as in the biosynthesis of carnitine, which is essential for fatty acid transport into mitochondria (Wyatt2020Inhibition). The protein is predominantly active in the cytosol and mitochondria, influencing energy production and cellular detoxification processes. Additionally, ALDH9A1 has been implicated in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and oxidative stress response, and its dysregulation is associated with several diseases, including cancer (Tan2024N6methyladenosinemodified; Jung2022ALDH9A1).

## Structure
The ALDH9A1 protein is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily and exhibits a 3-domain architecture typical of this group. Its molecular structure includes a NAD+ binding domain characterized by a 5-stranded Rossmann dinucleotide-binding fold, which is crucial for its active conformation (Wyatt2020Inhibition). The catalytic domain of ALDH9A1 features an α/β fold and contains a catalytic cysteine residue, Cys288, essential for its enzymatic activity (Wyatt2020Inhibition). The oligomerization domain adopts a β-substructure that protrudes from the NAD+ binding domain, contributing to the protein's quaternary structure (Wyatt2020Inhibition).

In solution, ALDH9A1 forms a dimer-of-dimers tetramer, a common quaternary structure within the ALDH superfamily (Wyatt2020Inhibition). This tetrameric form is stable and consistent across different experimental methods, such as sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (Wyatt2020Inhibition). The protein can exist in both active and inactive conformations, with the active form featuring a fully ordered Rossmann domain and a canonical β-hairpin inter-domain linker that facilitates substrate access and NAD+ binding (Wyatt2020Inhibition).

## Function
ALDH9A1 encodes an enzyme that plays a significant role in the oxidation of various aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids, a process crucial for detoxifying potentially harmful aldehydes and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Vasiliou2013Aldehyde). This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of γ-aminobutyraldehyde and aminoaldehydes derived from polyamines, contributing to the catabolism of these compounds and preventing their toxic accumulation (Vasiliou2013Aldehyde; Muzio2012Aldehyde). ALDH9A1 also catalyzes the conversion of betaine aldehyde into betaine, an osmolyte that aids in osmoregulation, and γ-aminobutyraldehyde into γ-aminobutyrate, a neurotransmitter, indicating its role in neurotransmission (Ahmed2019Aldehyde).

In addition to its catalytic functions, ALDH9A1 is involved in the biosynthesis of carnitine by oxidizing 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde to 4-N-trimethylaminobutyrate, facilitating the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation (Wyatt2020Inhibition). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytosol and mitochondria, where it influences energy production and cellular detoxification processes (Wyatt2020Inhibition). ALDH9A1's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and oxidative stress response (Vasiliou2013Aldehyde).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ALDH9A1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. ALDH9A1 deficiency, particularly when combined with deficiencies in the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway, leads to increased endogenous DNA damage, apoptosis, and a higher incidence of solid tumors, especially ovarian tumors in aged female mice. This suggests that ALDH9A1 mutations may be associated with hematopoietic deficiencies and an increased risk of certain cancers due to the accumulation of endogenous aldehydes and subsequent DNA damage (Jung2022ALDH9A1).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ALDH9A1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is linked to enhanced tumor progression and lipid accumulation. The deficiency of ALDH9A1 triggers the AKT-mTOR pathway, promoting tumor growth and lipid metabolism alterations. Restoring ALDH9A1 expression has been shown to reduce tumor size and metastasis in vivo, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tan2024N6methyladenosinemodified).

ALDH9A1 is also involved in modulating lipid accumulation and tumor progression through the NPM1/IQGAP2/AKT signaling pathway. Alterations in this pathway due to ALDH9A1 deficiency can lead to increased tumor progression and metabolic reprogramming in ccRCC (Tan2024N6methyladenosinemodified).

## Interactions
ALDH9A1 interacts with several proteins, notably NPM1, in the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This interaction influences the transcription of IQGAP2, a downstream molecule in the signaling pathway. The interaction between ALDH9A1 and NPM1 was validated through co-immunoprecipitation assays in various cell lines, including HEK293T, A498, and CAKI-1 cells. The interaction primarily involves the N-terminus domain of NPM1, as predicted by the ZDOCK server (Tan2024N6methyladenosinemodified).

ALDH9A1 overexpression enhances the accumulation of NPM1 in the cytoplasm while reducing its nuclear localization. Conversely, ALDH9A1 knockdown accelerates NPM1's nuclear translocation. This interaction does not affect the total amount of NPM1 protein but alters its subcellular distribution (Tan2024N6methyladenosinemodified). The forced expression of NPM1 can offset the elevated levels of IQGAP2 in ALDH9A1-overexpressing ccRCC cells, indicating a regulatory relationship between these proteins (Tan2024N6methyladenosinemodified).

The study also highlights the role of ALDH9A1 in modulating the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, suggesting that ALDH9A1 may regulate IQGAP2 expression in an NPM1-dependent manner, impacting tumor progression and lipid accumulation in ccRCC (Tan2024N6methyladenosinemodified).
