# TSPAN2

## Overview
TSPAN2 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 2, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, which is characterized by its role as a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. Tetraspanin 2 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and is implicated in the development and maintenance of the myelin sheath, a critical component for efficient nerve conduction (Yaseen2017Tspan2:; Monasterio2024Characterization). Beyond its neurological functions, tetraspanin 2 is involved in cellular signaling and adhesion, forming complexes with integrins and other proteins, which are essential for cellular interactions and motility (Yaseen2017Tspan2:; Monasterio2024Characterization). Additionally, TSPAN2 has been associated with immune response modulation and cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases, including neuroinflammatory conditions and certain cancers (Wang2022Potential; Reynolds2019Transmigration).

## Function
TSPAN2, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS). It plays a role in oligodendrocyte development and myelination, contributing to the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath, which is crucial for efficient nerve conduction (Yaseen2017Tspan2:; Monasterio2024Characterization). TSPAN2 is expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells and is thought to stabilize mature myelin sheaths, although its exact role in myelination is not fully understood (Yaseen2017Tspan2:).

TSPAN2 is also implicated in cellular signaling and adhesion, forming complexes with other proteins such as integrins and CD81, which are important for cellular interactions and signaling (Yaseen2017Tspan2:; Monasterio2024Characterization). These interactions suggest that TSPAN2 may regulate membrane expression and trafficking, influencing cell adhesion and motility (Yaseen2017Tspan2:).

In addition to its role in the CNS, TSPAN2 is involved in immune response modulation. It affects the expression of immune mediators and cytokines in microglial cells, indicating a role in neuroinflammatory processes (Reynolds2019Transmigration). This function highlights its potential involvement in regulating immune responses within the CNS.

## Clinical Significance
TSPAN2 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of neuroinflammatory conditions, TSPAN2 expression in microglial cells can influence immune responses. Knockdown of TSPAN2 using siRNA delivered via exosomes leads to decreased expression of immune mediators like CXCL12 and CXCR4, and an increase in pro-inflammatory markers such as FCGR2A and TNF-α. This modulation of immune responses suggests a potential role for TSPAN2 in neuroinflammatory diseases and highlights its therapeutic targeting potential (Reynolds2019Transmigration).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), TSPAN2 is identified as a prognostic marker. Its expression is associated with lymph node metastasis and overall survival, indicating its role in tumor progression and potential as a target for immunotherapy (Wang2022Potential). TSPAN2 is also involved in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease, where decreased expression may contribute to abnormal smooth muscle proliferation in intracranial arteries (Kanamori2021Transcriptomewide).

In cancer, particularly lung cancer, TSPAN2 enhances cell motility and invasiveness, suggesting its involvement in metastasis. This role in promoting cancer cell migration and invasion underscores its significance in cancer progression (Zhang2024Tspan).

## Interactions
TSPAN2, a member of the tetraspanin family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the pY-reader proteins GRB2 and PIK3R3 through its phosphorylated tyrosine residue Y124. These interactions are crucial for cellular phenotypes related to cancer, as mutations at Y124 disrupt these interactions, highlighting its critical role (Grossmann2015Phospho‐tyrosine). The GRB2-TSPAN2 interaction occurs at the plasma membrane and promotes membrane extensions, while the PIK3R3-TSPAN2 interaction is mainly cytoplasmic and appears to inhibit this phenotype (Grossmann2015Phospho‐tyrosine).

TSPAN2 also interacts with CD44, a protein involved in oxidative stress response, enhancing CD44's ROS-scavenger function and promoting cancer cell invasiveness (Yaseen2017Tspan2:). Additionally, TSPAN2 is associated with other proteins such as MT1-MMP, ADAM-10, and integrins, which are implicated in cancer progression (Yaseen2017Tspan2:). In the context of extracellular vesicles (EVs), TSPAN2 demonstrates strong EV-sorting abilities, largely operating independently of other tetraspanins like CD63 (Zheng2023Identification). These interactions underscore TSPAN2's role in cellular signaling and its potential impact on cancer and other diseases.
