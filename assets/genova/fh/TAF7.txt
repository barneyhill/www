# TAF7

## Overview
TAF7 is a gene that encodes the TATA-box binding protein associated factor 7, a crucial component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. This protein plays a significant role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, acting as a dynamic regulator within the TFIID complex. TAF7 is involved in the formation of a stable TAF1-TAF7 complex, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the TFIID complex through its interactions with other transcription-associated factors. The protein is characterized by its involvement in forming a triple barrel core with TAF1, which is essential for the assembly and function of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) during transcription initiation (Wang2014Crystal; Louder2016Structure). TAF7's regulatory functions include modulating the interactions of TFIID with promoter DNA and potentially influencing TAF1's histone acetyltransferase activity, although the latter remains to be conclusively demonstrated (Wang2014Crystal).

## Structure
The TAF7 protein is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, playing a crucial role in transcription regulation. Structurally, TAF7 contributes significantly to the TAF1-TAF7 complex, which has a compact, pyramid-shaped architecture. The primary structure of TAF7 includes a central 19-amino acid region with a conserved Arg-rich motif, essential for its association with TAF1 (Wang2014Crystal). 

In terms of secondary structure, TAF7 is involved in forming a triple barrel core with TAF1, consisting of 15 β-strands that create three continuous β-barrels. The N-terminal fragment of TAF7 is primarily responsible for constructing this core, while the C-terminal region forms an independent coiled structure (Wang2014Crystal). A unique feature of TAF7 is a long β-hairpin that traverses the complex, interacting with conserved salt bridges in the TAF1 barrel (Wang2014Crystal).

The tertiary structure of TAF7 involves its interaction with the TAF1 C-terminal helical region, forming a significant interface outside the triple barrel core (Wang2014Crystal). Quaternary interactions include its role as a dissociable regulator of TAF1, aiding in the solubilization and purification of the TAF1 DUF3591 domain (Wang2014Crystal). The TAF7 protein may also modulate TAF1's DNA-binding activity, indicating its dynamic regulatory function (Wang2014Crystal).

## Function
TAF7 is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Within the TFIID complex, TAF7 interacts with TAF1 and TAF2, forming part of the downstream promoter-binding module. This module is crucial for binding to promoter DNA and facilitating the assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (Louder2016Structure). TAF7 plays a regulatory role by modulating the interactions of TFIID with promoter DNA, particularly during the transition from transcription initiation to elongation. The release of TAF7 from TFIID following PIC assembly is necessary for transcription initiation, as it prevents the re-engagement of promoter DNA by TAF1 and TAF2 after the first round of transcription initiation (Louder2016Structure).

TAF7 also interacts with the TAF1 DUF3591 domain, which is involved in promoter DNA binding. This interaction is essential for the structural integrity and function of the TAF1-TAF7 complex, which may undergo conformational changes during transcription initiation (Wang2014Crystal). TAF7's role as a dynamic regulator of TAF1 suggests it may inhibit TAF1's histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, although this remains inconclusive (Wang2014Crystal).

## Interactions
TAF7 is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Within this complex, TAF7 interacts specifically with TAF1, forming a stable TAF1-TAF7 complex. This interaction is characterized by a triple barrel structure, where the TAF7 N-terminal fragment contributes to the core, and its C-terminal region interacts with both the triple barrel and TAF1 C-terminal α-helical regions (Wang2014Crystal). The interaction between TAF1 and TAF7 involves a Gly-rich motif in TAF1 and an Arg-rich motif in TAF7, forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, which are crucial for the structural integrity of the complex (Wang2014Crystal).

TAF7 also plays a role in the co-translational assembly of the TFIID complex. It is recruited to the nascent TAF1 polypeptide, suggesting a co-translational interaction that is essential for the hierarchical assembly of TFIID. This interaction is sensitive to translation disruption, indicating that TAF7's association with TAF1 is dependent on ongoing protein synthesis (Bernardini2023Hierarchical). TAF7's interaction with TAF1 is part of a larger network of interactions within TFIID, which includes other TAF proteins, highlighting its role in the structural and functional organization of the complex (Bernardini2023Hierarchical).
