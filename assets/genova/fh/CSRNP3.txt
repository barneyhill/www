# CSRNP3

## Overview
CSRNP3, or cysteine and serine rich nuclear protein 3, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein, characterized by its serine-rich and cysteine-rich regions, functions as a transcription factor, binding to specific DNA motifs to modulate gene expression (Kato2018P6281Identification; Gingras2007Characterization). Predominantly expressed in the brain, with lower levels in the kidney and ovary, CSRNP3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell differentiation (Mulari2021Ischemic; Gingras2007Characterization). While its precise physiological roles remain to be fully elucidated, CSRNP3 has been associated with several clinical conditions, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma, metabolic syndrome, intellectual disability, and epilepsy, highlighting its potential significance in human health and disease (Lindstrand2019From; Kato2018P6281Identification; Zhang2021The).

## Function
CSRNP3 (cysteine and serine rich nuclear protein 3) is a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily through its DNA-binding activity. It is characterized by a serine-rich amino-terminal region and a cysteine-rich region with conserved cysteine residues, which are indicative of its potential role as a transcription factor (Gingras2007Characterization). CSRNP3 binds to a specific DNA sequence motif, AGAGTG, suggesting its involvement in modulating gene expression (Kato2018P6281Identification).

In healthy human cells, CSRNP3 is expressed predominantly in the brain, with lower levels in the kidney and ovary, indicating a role in neural tissues and possibly in other organ systems (Gingras2007Characterization). The protein's nuclear localization supports its function in transcriptional regulation, where it may influence cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell differentiation (Mulari2021Ischemic). Despite its potential importance, the exact physiological functions of CSRNP3 in healthy cells remain unclear, as studies have not identified significant phenotypic changes in CSRNP3-deficient mice, suggesting possible redundancy with other genes (Gingras2007Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
CSRNP3 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CSRNP3 is part of a gene family that serves as a prognostic biomarker. Lower expression levels of CSRNP3 are associated with worse overall survival in ccRCC patients, indicating its role as a protective factor (Zhang2021The). Genetic alterations in CSRNP3, although rare, have been observed in approximately 0.8% of ccRCC cases (Zhang2021The).

In the context of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CSRNP3, rs1007732, has been identified as protective against MetS in Japanese individuals, suggesting a potential role in metabolic pathways (Kato2018P6281Identification). Additionally, CSRNP3 has been involved in intellectual disability and epilepsy. A complex genomic rearrangement affecting CSRNP3 was identified in a patient with severe epilepsy, highlighting its potential involvement in neurological conditions (Lindstrand2019From).

CSRNP3 has also been linked to apoptosis in renal calcification, as observed in a mouse model of nephrocalcinosis, where altered expression of CSRNP3 was associated with increased apoptosis in renal cells (Gorvin2019Mice). These findings underscore the gene's clinical significance across various conditions.
