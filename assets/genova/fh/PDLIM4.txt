# PDLIM4

## Overview
PDLIM4 is a gene that encodes the PDZ and LIM domain protein 4, a multifunctional protein involved in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization. The protein is characterized by the presence of both PDZ and LIM domains, which facilitate its role as an adaptor or scaffold protein, linking receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating processes such as cell migration and immune response. PDLIM4 is implicated in various cellular functions, including T cell migration and dendritic cell function, through its interactions with proteins like sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) and α-actinin. Clinically, PDLIM4 has been associated with several cancers, where its altered expression is linked to tumor progression and metastasis, and it is considered a potential tumor suppressor. Additionally, genetic variations in PDLIM4 have been connected to osteoporotic fracture risk, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Jia2019PDZ; Fu2019JMJD3; Chen2019Associations).

## Structure
PDLIM4, also known as RIL, is a protein characterized by the presence of both PDZ and LIM domains, which are prominent in protein-protein interaction scaffolding. The PDZ domain is located at the N-terminus and is known for binding to distinct classes of PDZ-binding motifs, including those found in α-actinin and other actin-associated proteins (healy2023pdlim). The LIM domain, located at the C-terminus, adopts a zinc finger fold that facilitates protein-protein interactions, although its specific ligand interactions are not fully understood (healy2023pdlim).

The protein also contains a central unstructured linker region, which is predicted to interact with actin and α-actinin proteins, suggesting a role in scaffolding and cytoskeletal organization (healy2023pdlim). PDLIM4 is associated with actin-rich domains such as focal adhesions and stress fibers, indicating its involvement in actin cytoskeleton organization (healy2023pdlim).

An alternatively spliced isoform of PDLIM4, known as RILaltCterm, results from the skipping of exon 6, leading to a protein that is 84 amino acids shorter and lacks the LIM domain. This isoform is characterized by a PEST-like disordered protein structure in the C-terminal segment, which contributes to its instability (Guryanova2011Actin). The alternative splicing causes a frameshift, resulting in a different C-terminal sequence (Guryanova2011Actin).

## Function
PDLIM4, also known as RIL, is a protein that plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton organization and cellular signaling. It contains both PDZ and LIM domains, which facilitate its function as an adaptor or scaffold protein, linking receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is crucial for proper membrane localization and cellular structure maintenance (healy2023pdlim).

In T cells, PDLIM4 interacts with the sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) and F-actin, facilitating T cell migration by enhancing F-actin formation. This process is essential for T cell egress from the thymus and migration to peripheral lymphoid organs (Fu2019JMJD3). The PDZ domain of PDLIM4 is necessary for interacting with S1P1, while the C-terminal LIM domain is required for binding F-actin (Fu2019JMJD3).

In dendritic cells, PDLIM4 is involved in CCR7-JNK-mediated migration and F-actin-related dendrite formation. It supports the structural and functional integrity of dendritic cells, which is vital for their role in immune responses (Yoo2019Pdlim4). PDLIM4's interaction with α-actinin enhances actin bundling, which is crucial for maintaining cell structure and facilitating cell migration (Guryanova2011Actin).

## Clinical Significance
PDLIM4 has been implicated in various cancers, including ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer, primarily due to alterations in its expression levels. In ovarian cancer, PDLIM4 is frequently downregulated, which is associated with advanced tumor stages, lymph node metastasis, and shorter overall survival. Overexpression of PDLIM4 in ovarian cancer cells suppresses proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting STAT3 signaling (Jia2019PDZ).

In breast cancer, low PDLIM4 expression is linked to poor prognosis, particularly in aneuploid tumors, and is associated with unfavorable prognostic factors such as large tumor size and lack of hormone receptors. PDLIM4 methylation correlates with hormone receptor status, indicating its potential role in treatment response (Kravchenko2016Role).

In prostate cancer, PDLIM4 is often silenced due to promoter hypermethylation, leading to its downregulation. This silencing is associated with the loss of tumor suppressor functions, as PDLIM4 overexpression inhibits cancer cell growth and invasion. The gene's hypermethylation serves as a potential biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis (Vanaja2009PDLIM4; Vanaja2006PDLIM4).

PDLIM4 polymorphisms have also been linked to osteoporotic fracture risk, with certain SNPs affecting bone turnover markers and bone mineral density (Chen2019Associations).

## Interactions
PDLIM4, also known as PDZ and LIM domain protein 4, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. PDLIM4 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, specifically binding to filamentous actin (F-actin) and α-actinin, which enhances actin filament dynamics and stress fiber formation (Guryanova2011Actin; Vanaja2009PDLIM4). This interaction is essential for cytoskeleton remodeling and cellular structure maintenance.

PDLIM4 also interacts with the sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) through its PDZ domain, which is critical for T cell migration and actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Fu2019JMJD3). The interaction between PDLIM4 and S1P1 is dependent on the C-terminal helix structure of S1P1, specifically the helix-8 motif, which is crucial for PDZ domain recognition (Fu2019JMJD3).

Additionally, PDLIM4 is part of a complex regulatory network involving JMJD3, a histone demethylase, which influences PDLIM4 expression through interactions with transcription factors like KLF2 and components of the H3K4 methyltransferase complex (Fu2019JMJD3). These interactions highlight PDLIM4's role in modulating actin dynamics and cellular migration processes.
