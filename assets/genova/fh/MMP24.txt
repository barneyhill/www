# MMP24

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 24 (MMP24), also known as MT5-MMP, is a gene that encodes a membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase. This protein is primarily expressed in neuronal cells within the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it plays a crucial role in the degradation of proteoglycans, key components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain. As a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, MMP24 is involved in various physiological processes, including neurite outgrowth, neuronal plasticity, and ECM remodeling. It is also implicated in the activation of proMMP-2 on the cell surface, although its precise role in this activation in vivo remains to be fully elucidated (Itoh2015Membrane-type). MMP24's activity is tightly regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), ensuring a balance in ECM turnover and cellular behavior (Khasigov2001Matrixmetalloproteinasesofnormalhumantissues). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in both physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression and neuropathic pain (Cloud2022Loss; Ma2021MMP24).

## Function
MMP24, also known as MT5-MMP, is a membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase primarily expressed in neuronal cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems. It plays a significant role in the degradation of proteoglycans, which are major components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain. This activity promotes neurite outgrowth by overcoming the inhibitory effects of proteoglycans on neurite growth (Itoh2015Membrane-type). MMP24 is also involved in the activation of proMMP-2 on the cell surface, although its role as a proMMP-2 activator in vivo is not fully understood (Itoh2015Membrane-type).

In terms of cellular processes, MMP24 is implicated in neuronal plasticity, as evidenced by the lack of mechanical allodynia and Aβ-fiber sprouting in MT5-MMP null mice following sciatic nerve injury (Itoh2015Membrane-type). It also mediates peripheral thermal nociception and inflammatory hyperalgesia through the shedding of N-cadherin, a process that is crucial for regulating adult neural stem cell function and quiescence (Itoh2015Membrane-type). MMP24's activity is regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which help maintain a balance in ECM turnover and cellular behavior (Khasigov2001Matrixmetalloproteinasesofnormalhumantissues).

## Clinical Significance
MMP24, or matrix metallopeptidase 24, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, MMP24 is associated with prolonged survival time, suggesting a potential protective role when expressed at higher levels (Cheng2022Landscape). Conversely, lower expression levels of MMP24 are linked to poorer prognosis in multiple cancer types, indicating its significance in cancer progression (Gobin2019A). In colorectal cancer, MMP24 is significantly downregulated, although its specific impact on prognosis is not highlighted (Yu2021Comprehensive).

In uveal melanoma, MMP24 is altered in 10% of patients, but it is not directly associated with overall survival. However, it is positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, which is significant for cancer-related inflammation and clinical outcomes (Wang2021MMP1). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, MMP24's expression is negatively correlated with neutrophil infiltration and positively correlated with B cell infiltration, suggesting a role in modulating immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (Liu2023Identification).

Overall, MMP24's expression and alterations are linked to its role in tumor invasion, metastasis, and immune modulation, impacting the clinical outcomes in various cancers.

## Interactions
Matrix metallopeptidase 24 (MMP24) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in physiological and pathological processes. MMP24 interacts with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), a pro-fibrotic factor that increases MMP24 expression. This interaction is significant in the context of lung fibrosis, where MMP24 acts as a pro-fibrotic mediator (Gazdhar2024Matrix). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) can counteract the effects of TGF-β1 by reducing MMP24 expression, thereby mitigating fibrosis (Gazdhar2024Matrix).

In breast cancer, MMP24 is regulated by the RE1-Silencing Transcription factor (REST). REST binds to specific sites within the MMP24 gene, and its loss leads to increased MMP24 expression, contributing to cancer progression through extracellular matrix remodeling (Cloud2022Loss). MMP24 is also known to cleave extracellular matrix proteins such as CD44 and MMP2, facilitating cell invasion and metastasis (Cloud2022Loss).

In the context of neuropathic pain, MMP24 interacts with inflammatory mediators like IL-1β and TNF-α, potentially activating ERK signaling pathways in the spinal cord (Ma2021MMP24). These interactions highlight MMP24's role in central sensitization and nociceptive hyperalgesia (Ma2021MMP24).
