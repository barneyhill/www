# SPATA31D3

## Overview
SPATA31D3 is a gene located on chromosome 9 that encodes the protein SPATA31 subfamily D member 3, which is primarily involved in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. This protein is part of the SPATA31 gene family, which is highly specific to the testis and plays a crucial role in male fertility. SPATA31 subfamily D member 3 is implicated in DNA damage repair and stress response pathways, contributing to genomic stability and integrity during spermatogenesis (Pini2021Liquid). The protein is also associated with cellular motility and reproduction, particularly in relation to cilium and cytoskeleton components (Jumeau2015Human). The gene has undergone a hard selective sweep across multiple human populations, indicating its importance in recent human adaptation (Schrider2016Soft). Despite its recognized roles, further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific functions and clinical significance of SPATA31D3 in human health and disease.

## Function
SPATA31D3 is a gene that plays a significant role in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. It is part of the SPATA31 gene family, which is highly specific to the testis and is crucial for male fertility. The gene is located on chromosome 9 and has been associated with a hard selective sweep across multiple human populations, suggesting its importance in recent human adaptation (Schrider2016Soft).

In terms of molecular function, SPATA31D3 is involved in sperm structure and function, particularly in response to DNA damage. Proteomic studies have identified SPATA31D3 as one of the proteins differentially abundant in sperm with high DNA fragmentation, indicating its potential role in DNA damage repair and stress response pathways (Pini2021Liquid). The protein's involvement in these processes suggests it may contribute to maintaining genomic stability and integrity during spermatogenesis.

SPATA31D3 is also linked to cellular motility and reproduction, as indicated by its association with biological processes related to cilium and cytoskeleton components (Jumeau2015Human). However, specific functional details about SPATA31D3 in healthy human cells remain limited, necessitating further research to fully elucidate its role in male reproductive health.

## Clinical Significance
SPATA31D3 has been implicated in several conditions related to genomic stability and reproductive health. In human spermatozoa, SPATA31D3 is significantly more abundant in samples with high DNA fragmentation, suggesting its involvement in structural and functional changes that may impact fertility (Pini2021Liquid). The gene is part of a region on chromosome 9 that shows evidence of a selective sweep, indicating its potential role in human adaptation and its importance in spermatogenesis, as male mice lacking Spata31 are infertile (Schrider2016Soft).

Mutations in SPATA31D3 have been identified in a NOTCH1-independent T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell line, suggesting a possible link to cancer, although the specific clinical significance in this context remains unclear (Tosello2018A). Additionally, SPATA31D3 was identified as a 'missing protein' in human spermatozoa, with its identification complicated by sequence similarities to other proteins, highlighting the need for further research to understand its role in male reproduction and infertility (Jumeau2015Human). The gene also shows a high number of variants between the Steller sea lion and the California sea lion, though the clinical implications of these variants are not discussed (Kwan2019The).
