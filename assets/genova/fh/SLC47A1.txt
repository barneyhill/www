# SLC47A1

## Overview
The SLC47A1 gene encodes the Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion Protein 1 (MATE1), a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the transport and excretion of organic cations and xenobiotics. MATE1 is predominantly expressed in the kidney and liver, where it facilitates the renal and hepatic elimination of various drugs and toxins. As a member of the solute carrier family, MATE1 functions as an antiporter, exchanging intracellular organic cations with extracellular protons, thus contributing to the body's detoxification processes. The protein's activity is essential for maintaining drug pharmacokinetics and response, and it interacts with other transporters, such as the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), to mediate the vectorial transport of drugs across renal tubular cells. Variants in the SLC47A1 gene have been associated with altered drug response and renal function, highlighting its clinical significance in pharmacogenomics and disease states (Meyer2010Human; Avsar2022Analysis; Nies2016Structure).

## Structure
The SLC47A1 gene encodes the Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion Protein 1 (MATE1), a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of organic cations and zwitterions. MATE1 is predicted to have 13 transmembrane helices, with the first 12 forming the functional core of the protein. The 13th helix may play a role in protein turnover (Meyer2010Human; Nies2016Structure). The secondary structure of MATE1 has been predicted using the TMpred program, confirming the presence of these 13 transmembrane domains (Meyer2010Human).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and N-terminal acetylation have been identified, although their functional consequences are not fully understood (Nies2016Structure). MATE1 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, liver, and intestine, and is localized in the brush-border membrane of proximal tubule epithelial cells in the kidney (Lee2014Multidrug; Nies2016Structure).

The SLC47A1 gene has two transcript variants detected in liver and kidney tissues, predicted to encode proteins of 466 and 511 amino acids, although their expression has not been demonstrated (Nies2016Structure). The three-dimensional structure of human MATE1 is not available, but homology modeling using bacterial X-ray structures has been used to predict its structure (Nies2016Structure).

## Function
The human gene SLC47A1 encodes the Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion Protein 1 (MATE1), which functions as a transporter involved in the excretion of organic cations and xenobiotics. MATE1 is primarily expressed in the kidney and liver, where it plays a crucial role in the renal and hepatic elimination of various drugs and toxins. In the kidney, MATE1 is located on the brush-border membrane of proximal tubule epithelial cells, facilitating the efflux of organic cations into the urine. This process is proton-coupled, meaning MATE1 operates as an antiporter, exchanging intracellular organic cations with extracellular protons (Damme2011Mammalian; Nies2016Structure).

In the liver, MATE1 is found on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, contributing to the excretion of drugs and toxins into bile (Nies2016Structure). MATE1 works in concert with other transporters, such as the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), to mediate the renal excretion process, which is essential for maintaining drug pharmacokinetics and response (Meyer2010Human; Nies2016Structure). The transporter is also involved in the cellular accumulation of flavonoids, such as quercetin, enhancing their bioavailability and biological activity in human cells (Lee2014Multidrug).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC47A1 gene, which encodes the MATE1 protein, have significant clinical implications. Variants in SLC47A1, such as missense mutations, can lead to a loss of function by affecting the protein's structure and function, impacting drug transport and disposition. For instance, certain SLC47A1 variants are associated with reduced response to metformin, a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (Avsar2022Analysis; Nies2016Structure). The variant rs111653425 has been linked to increased serum creatinine levels, indicating potential clinical significance in renal function (Nies2016Structure).

Altered expression of MATE1 has been observed in conditions like chronic renal failure, acute kidney injury, and liver diseases, affecting drug disposition and clearance (Nies2016Structure). In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the SLC47A1 variant 17:19571562C>T (p.Ala465Val) is significantly associated with the disease, potentially leading to elevated serum creatinine levels and kidney damage (Hussain2023Genetic).

Additionally, MATE1-mediated drug-drug interactions can influence drug clearance and exposure, with certain drugs inhibiting MATE1 more potently than OCT2, affecting the pharmacokinetics of drugs like metformin (Meyer2010Human; Nies2016Structure).

## Interactions
The SLC47A1 gene encodes the MATE1 protein, which is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of drug transport and elimination. MATE1 interacts with the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), encoded by the SLC22A2 gene, to facilitate the renal elimination of organic cationic drugs. This interaction is crucial for the vectorial transport of drugs across renal tubular cells, with OCT2 mediating the uptake of cations at the basolateral membrane and MATE1 facilitating their efflux at the apical membrane (Meyer2010Human).

MATE1 also participates in drug-drug interactions, where certain inhibitors can affect its transport activity. For instance, inhibitors like cimetidine and ranitidine can lead to increased plasma levels of substrate drugs by inhibiting both MATE1 and OCT2, impacting drug pharmacokinetics and potentially leading to side effects (Meyer2010Human).

Additionally, MATE1 is involved in the transport of flavonoids, such as quercetin, and its activity can be modulated by inhibitors like pyrimethamine, which significantly reduces flavonoid accumulation in cells overexpressing MATE1 (Lee2014Multidrug). These interactions highlight the broad substrate specificity and regulatory mechanisms of MATE1 in drug and metabolite transport.
