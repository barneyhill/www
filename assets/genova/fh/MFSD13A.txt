# MFSD13A

## Overview
MFSD13A is a gene that encodes the protein major facilitator superfamily domain containing 13A, which is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters. This protein is characterized by its typical MFS structure, featuring 12 transmembrane segments organized into two six-helix bundles, which are connected by a long intracellular loop (Perland2017Characteristics; Drew2021Structures). The MFSD13A protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. It has been implicated in the regulation of blood pressure and cancer pathogenesis, particularly in pancreatic cancer, where it may act as a tumor suppressor (Mei2019A; Wang2024A). The gene's expression and genetic variations have been associated with disease risk, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Vicente2022Cutaneous; IñiguezMuñoz2024Hidden).

## Structure
MFSD13A is a protein that belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), which typically features a structure with 12 transmembrane segments (TMS) organized into two six-helix bundles. These bundles are connected by a long intracellular loop, forming a characteristic fold common to MFS transporters (Drew2021Structures). Initially, the MFSD13A protein was predicted to have 9 TMS by the CCTOP topology prediction tool. However, homology models using known MFS protein structures as templates later predicted the presence of the expected 12 TMS, aligning with the typical MFS structure (Perland2017Characteristics). This discrepancy was attributed to the amphipathic nature of some TMS in MFSD13A, which may have led to their exclusion in initial predictions (Perland2017Characteristics).

The primary structure of MFSD13A consists of 400-600 amino acids, a common size range for MFS proteins (Perland2017Characteristics). The protein's tertiary structure was modeled using the bacterial sodium symporter MelB as a template, resulting in a moderate reliability score (GMQE of 0.47) (Perland2017Characteristics). There is no specific information available on post-translational modifications, splice variant isoforms, or quaternary structure for MFSD13A.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MFSD13A gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly pancreatic cancer. A functional variant, rs2001389, located at the boundary of a topological association domain (TAD), has been linked to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The G allele of this variant weakens the binding of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), leading to reduced expression of MFSD13A, which is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor gene. This reduction in expression is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation, indicating a potential role in pancreatic cancer development (Mei2019A; IñiguezMuñoz2024Hidden).

The MFSD13A gene is also implicated in the regulation of blood pressure through gene-sleep duration interactions, although its direct link to specific cardiovascular diseases remains unclear (Wang2024A). In cutaneous melanoma, MFSD13A has been identified as having hypomethylated CpGs, which may have prognostic value, although specific diseases linked to these methylation patterns are not detailed (Vicente2022Cutaneous). These findings suggest that MFSD13A plays a significant role in cancer pathogenesis and potentially other conditions through its altered expression and genetic variations.
