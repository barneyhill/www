# SLCO4A1

## Overview
The SLCO4A1 gene encodes the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4A1, commonly referred to as OATP4A1. This protein is a member of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) superfamily, which is characterized by its role in the transmembrane transport of a wide array of organic anions, including hormones, drugs, and signaling molecules. OATP4A1 is a transmembrane protein with 12 transmembrane domains and is expressed in various tissues, such as the heart, placenta, lung, liver, and skin, where it facilitates the uptake and distribution of its substrates (Hagenbuch2013The; Roth2012OATPs). The protein's structure includes specific N-glycosylation sites that are crucial for its function and stability (Hagenbuch2004Organic). SLCO4A1 has been implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels may influence cancer progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2024SLCO4A1; Koller2022SLCO4A1).

## Structure
The SLCO4A1 gene encodes the OATP4A1 protein, which is a member of the solute carrier organic anion transporter family. The protein is characterized by a structure that includes 12 transmembrane domains, a common feature among organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) (Liu2019SLC; Buxhofer‑Ausch2020Two). These transmembrane domains facilitate the transport of organic anions across cell membranes. The OATP4A1 protein also contains a large extracellular domain between transmembrane domains 9 and 10, which is crucial for its transport function (Liu2019SLC; Hagenbuch2004Organic).

The protein's structure includes specific N-glycosylation sites located in extracellular loops 2 and 5, which are important for its function and stability (Hagenbuch2004Organic). The sequence defining the OATP superfamily is located at the boundary of the extracellular loop 3 and transmembrane domain 6 (Buxhofer‑Ausch2020Two). The SLCO4A1 protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its transport activity and localization.

The SLCO4A1 gene can produce different splice variant isoforms, which may result in variations in the protein's structure and function, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including colorectal and ovarian cancer cells, where it plays a role in transporting a range of substrates, including estrogens and prostaglandins (Liu2019SLC; Koller2022SLCO4A1).

## Function
The SLCO4A1 gene encodes the OATP4A1 protein, a member of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) superfamily. This protein is involved in the transport of a wide range of organic anions across cell membranes, including hormones, drugs, and other signaling molecules. OATP4A1 is expressed in various tissues such as the heart, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, indicating its role in facilitating the uptake of these compounds in multiple organ systems (Hagenbuch2013The; Roth2012OATPs).

At the cellular level, OATP4A1 is localized to the apical membrane of syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta, suggesting a specific role in the transport processes within this tissue (Roth2012OATPs). The protein is also highly expressed in human skin, where it may play a significant role in the absorption and distribution of topically applied drugs, potentially affecting drug-drug interactions and bioavailability (Alriquet2015Characterization).

While the specific function of OATP4A1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its widespread expression and involvement in the transport of diverse substrates imply a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes (Hagenbuch2013The; Roth2012OATPs).

## Clinical Significance
The SLCO4A1 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In colorectal cancer (CRC), two common polymorphic variants, G209>A and G232>A, were investigated as potential risk factors. Although these variants were present in the population, the study found no significant association with CRC risk or patient characteristics (Buxhofer‑Ausch2020Two). However, the overexpression of SLCO4A1 has been noted in CRC, suggesting a possible role in cancer physiology (Buxhofer‑Ausch2020Two).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SLCO4A1 is identified as a prognostic biomarker. High expression levels are associated with poor prognosis, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. SLCO4A1 influences the MAPK signaling pathway and affects the tumor immune microenvironment, potentially impacting immunotherapy efficacy (Li2024SLCO4A1).

In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), SLCO4A1 expression is linked to inflammatory pathways, which may contribute to cancer progression. The gene's expression correlates with pathways like NF-κB and TNFR2, suggesting a role in inflammation and cancer cell metabolism (Koller2022SLCO4A1). These findings highlight SLCO4A1's potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in various cancers.
