# CPS1

## Overview
CPS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1, a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the urea cycle, which is essential for detoxifying ammonia in the liver. The CPS1 protein is a large, complex enzyme categorized as a synthetase, and it catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of the urea cycle by converting ammonia and bicarbonate into carbamoyl phosphate. This process is crucial for the removal of excess nitrogen from the body, thereby preventing hyperammonemia, a condition that can lead to severe neurological damage if untreated (Martínez2010Genetic). The enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and requires N-acetyl-L-glutamate as an allosteric activator to function effectively (DíezFernández2014Understanding). Mutations in the CPS1 gene can result in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 deficiency, a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired ammonia detoxification and associated with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations (Yan2019Novel; Häberle2011Molecular).

## Structure
The human carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) protein is a large, complex enzyme involved in the urea cycle, primarily expressed in the liver. It is a 1462-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 160 kDa, composed of N-terminal and C-terminal moieties (Häberle2011Molecular; DiezFernandez2013Molecular). The N-terminal moiety includes an inactive glutamine amidotransferase/glutaminase-like domain, while the C-terminal moiety contains four domains: L1, L2, L3, and L4 (de2015Structure). L1 and L3 are catalytic domains responsible for phosphorylating bicarbonate and carbamate, respectively, and are linked by L2, an integrating domain with a unique fold of seven α-helices and two β-strands (de2015Structure). The L4 domain, which has a methylglyoxal synthase-like fold, binds N-acetylglutamate (NAG) and is involved in allosteric regulation (de2015Structure).

CPS1 functions as a monomer-dimer system, with the monomer being the predominant and active form when NAG is present (de2015Structure). The enzyme undergoes significant conformational changes upon NAG binding, which stabilizes its active conformation and facilitates the migration of the carbamate intermediate (de2015Structure). CPS1 is synthesized with a mitochondrial targeting leader peptide, which is cleaved upon mitochondrial entry (Häberle2011Molecular). The enzyme's structure and function are affected by post-translational modifications, such as acylation and deacylation, and are regulated by proteins like Sirt5 (de2015Structure).

## Function
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in the urea cycle, the primary pathway for detoxifying ammonia in the liver. CPS1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of the urea cycle, converting ammonia and bicarbonate into carbamoyl phosphate, which is essential for the subsequent production of urea. This process is vital for removing excess nitrogen from the body, thereby preventing hyperammonemia, a condition characterized by elevated ammonia levels that can lead to neurological damage if untreated (Martínez2010Genetic).

CPS1 is highly abundant in hepatic mitochondria, constituting about 20% of the matrix protein mass. The enzyme requires N-acetyl-L-glutamate (NAG) as an allosteric activator to function properly, enhancing its affinity for ATP and its ionic activators, K+ and Mg2+ (Martínez2010Genetic; DíezFernández2014Understanding). CPS1 is primarily expressed in liver and intestine cells, with lower expression in kidney tissue and fibroblasts (Martínez2010Genetic). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal ammonia levels and ensuring the efficient excretion of nitrogenous waste through the urea cycle (Martínez2010Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CPS1 gene can lead to carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 deficiency (CPS1D), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hyperammonemia due to impaired ammonia detoxification. This condition can present as severe neonatal-onset, which is often lethal, or as a less severe late-onset form. The deficiency results from a variety of genetic alterations, including missense, nonsense, and splicing site mutations, which can lead to nonfunctional proteins and severe clinical manifestations (Yan2019Novel; Häberle2011Molecular). 

CPS1D is associated with a wide spectrum of mutations, many of which are unique to individual families, indicating a high degree of genetic variability (DíezFernández2014Understanding). The mutations are unevenly distributed across the CPS1 gene, with certain regions being more critical for enzyme stability and function (Häberle2011Molecular). 

Clinical symptoms of CPS1D include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, and severe hyperammonemia, which can lead to encephalopathy and developmental delays if untreated (Ali2015Carbamoylphosphate). Management of the condition often involves dietary protein restriction and the use of ammonia-scavenging drugs to control blood ammonia levels (Ali2015Carbamoylphosphate; Dong2024Clinical).

## Interactions
Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1) is involved in the urea cycle and interacts with several proteins within the mitochondria. CPS1 is known to interact with N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), which is essential for its activation. This interaction is crucial for the conversion of ammonia and bicarbonate into carbamoyl phosphate, a key step in the urea cycle (Caldovic2022Assessing). CPS1 also interacts with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), another enzyme in the urea cycle. These interactions, however, are not strong or stable enough to be easily detected using traditional methods, as they are transient and weak (Caldovic2022Assessing).

Studies have shown that CPS1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with NAGS and OTC from isolated liver mitochondria, suggesting a potential clustering of these enzymes within the mitochondria (Caldovic2022Assessing). Despite these interactions, stable complexes among these enzymes have not been conclusively demonstrated in vitro, indicating that the interactions may be more dynamic and context-dependent (Caldovic2022Assessing).

CPS1 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as O-GlcNAcylation, which enhances its catalytic efficiency for ammonia and promotes ureagenesis. This modification does not directly involve interactions with other proteins but affects CPS1's activity and function (Soria2022OGlcNAcylation).
