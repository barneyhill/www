# LRRC32

## Overview
LRRC32 is a gene that encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 32 (GARP), a type I transmembrane protein predominantly expressed on the surface of regulatory T cells (Tregs). GARP is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions, particularly with latency-associated peptide (LAP) molecules, to regulate the activation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) (HexnerErlichman2022A; Chan2011Signal). This protein is integral to immune regulation, as it modulates the bioavailability of TGF-β1, a cytokine crucial for Treg function and immune homeostasis (Stockis2009Membrane; Lehmkuhl2021Dysregulated). GARP's interactions and regulatory mechanisms are essential for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmune responses, making it a significant focus in studies of immune-related disorders and potential therapeutic interventions (Stockis2009Membrane; Lehmkuhl2021Dysregulated).

## Structure
The LRRC32 gene encodes the GARP protein, a type I transmembrane protein characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. The protein is composed of 662 amino acids and includes 20 LRRs, which contribute to its solenoid horseshoe structure. These repeats are capped by N- and C-terminal motifs, which are crucial for the protein's stability and function (HexnerErlichman2022A; Chan2011Signal).

The extracellular domain of GARP is primarily involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with latency-associated peptide (LAP) molecules, through intermolecular disulfide bonds. This interaction is essential for the maturation and activation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) (HexnerErlichman2022A). The protein also features a 19 amino acid transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain, which are important for its localization and function on the cell surface (Chan2011Signal).

Post-translational modifications of GARP include N-linked glycosylation, which is involved in its processing and surface expression. The presence of a signal peptide at the N-terminus, cleaved after residue 17, is crucial for the protein's translocation to the cell surface (Chan2011Signal). The protein's structure and modifications are vital for its role in immune regulation and TGF-β activation.

## Function
LRRC32, also known as GARP, is a protein that plays a significant role in the immune system, particularly in regulatory T cells (Tregs). It is primarily expressed on the surface of activated Tregs and is crucial for their suppressive function. GARP is involved in the regulation of the bioavailability of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), a cytokine essential for the development and function of Tregs. It achieves this by binding to latent TGFβ1 on the Treg surface, facilitating its activation and release in an autocrine manner, which is vital for maintaining Treg stability and function (Stockis2009Membrane; Lehmkuhl2021Dysregulated).

The presence of GARP on Tregs enhances their suppressive capacity by promoting the expression of the transcription factor Foxp3, which is critical for Treg function. GARP and Foxp3 form a positive feedback loop, where the expression of one enhances the other, further stabilizing the regulatory phenotype of Tregs (ProbstKepper2010FOXP3; Chan2011Signal). GARP's role in TGFβ1 activation is essential for immune homeostasis, preventing autoimmune responses, and maintaining self-tolerance (Stockis2009Membrane; Lehmkuhl2021Dysregulated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRRC32 gene, which encodes the glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP), have been linked to several clinical conditions. In patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID), mutations in LRRC32 result in reduced GARP expression on regulatory T cells (Tregs), leading to dysregulated immune responses and increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. This is due to impaired Treg function, which is crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing chronic inflammation (Lehmkuhl2021Dysregulated).

LRRC32 mutations have also been associated with developmental disorders. A homozygous stop-gain variant in the gene has been linked to developmental delay, cleft palate, and proliferative retinopathy, highlighting its role in palatogenesis and retinal development (Harel2019Homozygous). Another study identified a novel homozygous missense variant associated with a syndrome characterized by cleft palate, progressive vitreoretinopathy, growth retardation, and developmental delay, further emphasizing the gene's significance in developmental processes (HexnerErlichman2022A).

Alterations in LRRC32 expression levels have been implicated in asthma, where increased expression is associated with the disease. This is potentially influenced by genetic variations such as the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs6592645, which affects LRRC32 expression and may contribute to asthma pathogenesis (Li2023Single‑nucleotide).

## Interactions
LRRC32, also known as GARP, is a cell surface protein that plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly in regulatory T cells (Tregs). One of the primary interactions of LRRC32 is with latent transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1). This interaction is crucial for the activation of TGFβ1, which is essential for the suppressive function of Tregs. The binding of LRRC32 to latent TGFβ1 facilitates the release of active TGFβ1 upon interaction with integrin αVβ8, thereby contributing to the immunosuppressive capacity of Tregs (Lehmkuhl2021Dysregulated).

LRRC32 is also involved in the regulation of Foxp3, a key transcription factor for Treg function. The expression of LRRC32 is induced by Foxp3, and it acts as a downstream effector of Foxp3 expression. Silencing Foxp3 reduces LRRC32 expression, highlighting the regulatory relationship between these proteins (Wang2008Identification). Additionally, LRRC32's extracellular region is necessary for its function, suggesting it may interact with other signaling receptors on the cell surface (Wang2008Identification).

These interactions underscore the importance of LRRC32 in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential implications in therapeutic strategies targeting immune regulation.
