# LMF2

## Overview
Lipase maturation factor 2 (LMF2) is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the maturation and functionality of lipases, which are enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. The LMF2 protein is categorized as a maturation factor and is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it assists in the proper folding and stabilization of lipase enzymes, thereby ensuring their effective role in lipid processing and energy balance within cells (Wang2014Insights). The expression of LMF2 varies across different cell types, with notable expression in adult skin fibroblasts, suggesting its involvement in specific cellular environments and processes (Kobayashi2016Development; Al2020Comparative). Clinically, alterations in LMF2 expression and methylation have been linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and its significance in neurological health (Shah2023Brain; Qazi2017Epigenetics).

## Function
LMF2 (lipase maturation factor 2) is involved in the maturation and proper functioning of lipases, which are enzymes essential for lipid metabolism. In healthy human cells, LMF2 plays a critical role in the folding and stabilization of lipase enzymes, ensuring their activity in lipid processing. This protein is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the correct assembly and secretion of lipases, impacting lipid homeostasis and energy balance within the organism (Wang2014Insights).

The gene's expression has been studied in various contexts, including its differential expression in fibroblasts compared to other cell types. LMF2 is notably expressed in adult skin fibroblasts (ASFs) and neonatal foreskin fibroblasts (NFFs), with higher expression levels in ASFs (Al2020Comparative). This differential expression pattern suggests a role in specific cellular environments, potentially linked to the maturation and transport of lipoprotein lipases (Kobayashi2016Development).

While the exact function of LMF2 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in lipase maturation indicates its importance in maintaining lipid metabolism and cellular energy balance (Wang2014Insights).

## Clinical Significance
The LMF2 gene, known for its role in lipase maturation, has been implicated in several clinical conditions through alterations in its expression and methylation. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), significant decreases in DNA methylation levels in the NCAPH2/LMF2 promoter region have been observed. These changes are associated with cognitive impairment and are considered potential biomarkers for diagnosing these neurodegenerative conditions (Stoccoro2018Role; Kobayashi2016Development; Qazi2017Epigenetics). 

In the context of intellectual disability, LMF2 has been identified as a candidate gene associated with this condition due to its co-expression with known intellectual disability genes in the 22q13 region (Shah2023Brain). Although specific mutations in LMF2 have not been directly linked to diseases, its expression correlation with other genes suggests a potential role in neurological disorders (Shah2023Brain).

Additionally, LMF2 has been noted in studies investigating rare copy number variations in patients with atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), although no direct association with LMF2 mutations was established (Hu2023Rare). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in various clinical conditions through epigenetic and expression changes.
