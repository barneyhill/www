# APPL1

## Overview
APPL1 is a gene that encodes the adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interacting with PH domain and leucine zipper 1, which is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. The APPL1 protein is characterized by its multidomain structure, including a BAR domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, which facilitate its role in signal transduction, endosomal trafficking, and cell survival (Diggins2017APPL1; Zhu2007Structure). As an adaptor protein, APPL1 interacts with several key signaling molecules, such as the small GTPase Rab5, insulin receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor, influencing pathways like NF-kB and insulin signaling (Ryu2014APPL1; Hupalowska2012APPL1). Clinically, mutations in the APPL1 gene have been associated with metabolic disorders, including diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in human health (Prudente2015LossofFunction; Kim2015Evidence).

## Structure
The APPL1 protein is a multidomain protein composed of 709 amino acids. It features an N-terminal BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (Diggins2017APPL1; Zhu2007Structure). The BAR domain consists of three long kinked alpha-helices that form a six-helix bundle, which acts as a membrane-curvature sensor or stabilizer (Zhu2007Structure). The PH domain, spanning residues Asn276 to Leu379, is characterized by two nearly orthogonal beta-sheets and a C-terminal alpha-helix (Zhu2007Structure). The BAR and PH domains together form a crescent-shaped, symmetrical dimer, which is crucial for binding the small GTPase Rab5 (Zhu2007Structure).

APPL1 can form homodimers or heterodimers with APPL2, another protein with a similar domain structure (Diggins2017APPL1). The PTB domain allows APPL1 to interact with various receptor proteins, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin receptor (IR) (Diggins2017APPL1). An alternative splicing variant, APPL1sv, lacks the PTB domain and is involved in inhibiting adiponectin signaling (GalanDavila2018Alternative).

## Function
APPL1 is a multifunctional adaptor protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, endosomal trafficking, and cell survival. In healthy human cells, APPL1 is involved in the regulation of the NF-kB signaling pathway, where it interacts with TRAF2 to enhance NF-kB activation. This interaction is crucial for both basal and TRAF2-stimulated NF-kB activity, positioning APPL1 upstream of the IKK complex (Hupalowska2012APPL1). APPL1 also modulates the expression of NF-kB target genes, particularly those involved in inflammatory responses, by stabilizing NIK and influencing both canonical and noncanonical NF-kB pathways (Hupalowska2012APPL1).

In the context of insulin signaling, APPL1 enhances insulin sensitivity by facilitating the interaction between insulin receptor substrate proteins (IRS1/2) and the insulin receptor (IR). This interaction is essential for insulin-stimulated Akt activation and glucose metabolism, with APPL1 acting downstream of the IR to sensitize insulin signaling (Ryu2014APPL1). APPL1 is also involved in adiponectin signaling, mediating its insulin-sensitizing effects in muscle and endothelial cells (Ryu2014APPL1).

APPL1 localizes to early endosomes through interactions with Rab5, playing a role in endocytic trafficking and receptor signaling. It influences the internalization and degradation of receptors like EGFR, impacting signal transduction and cellular responses to growth factors (Diggins2017APPL1; Zoncu2009A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the APPL1 gene have been linked to various forms of diabetes, particularly familial diabetes mellitus and maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 14 (MODY14). Two specific loss-of-function mutations, p.Leu552* and p.Asp94Asn, have been identified in families with a high prevalence of diabetes. These mutations disrupt APPL1's role in insulin signaling, leading to impaired glucose homeostasis and contributing to the development of diabetes (Prudente2015LossofFunction). The p.Leu552* mutation results in a complete lack of APPL1 protein expression, while the p.Asp94Asn mutation affects the structural stability of the protein, impairing its function in insulin signaling (Prudente2015LossofFunction).

APPL1 is also implicated in the pathophysiology of Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. It mediates endosomal dysfunctions associated with these conditions, particularly through its interaction with the rab5 effector and the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. In Alzheimer's disease, APPL1's recruitment to rab5-positive endosomes is increased, contributing to endosomal anomalies (Kim2015Evidence).

Alterations in APPL1 expression or function can also affect insulin and adiponectin signaling pathways, leading to insulin resistance and metabolic disorders (Jiang2016APPL1; Ivanoshchuk2020Analysis). These findings highlight the clinical significance of APPL1 in various diseases related to metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
APPL1 is a multifunctional adaptor protein that participates in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the NuRD co-repressor complex, specifically associating with HDAC2, which is crucial for its binding to the complex. This interaction influences the nuclear localization of APPL1 and affects the expression of HDAC1 target genes like p21 WAF1/CIP1 (BanachOrlowska2009Functional). APPL1 also interacts with HDAC1 independently of the NuRD complex, potentially through an association with Reptin, a transcriptional repressor in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (BanachOrlowska2009Functional).

APPL1 binds to the small GTPase Rab5 through its BAR-PH domain, which is essential for its localization to endosomes and its functional cycle (Zhu2007Structure). It also interacts with the TrkA receptor and GIPC1, forming complexes that are crucial for nerve growth factor-mediated signal transduction. These interactions occur in endosomal fractions, indicating a role in endosomal signaling (Lin2006APPL1).

APPL1 associates with various other proteins, including Akt2, the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K, and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, highlighting its role in organizing signaling networks (Nechamen2007APPL1).
