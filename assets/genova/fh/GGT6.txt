# GGT6

## Overview
Gamma-glutamyltransferase 6 (GGT6) is a gene that encodes the enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase 6, a member of the gamma-glutamyltransferase family. This enzyme is involved in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, which is crucial for glutathione metabolism, amino acid transport, and detoxification processes. GGT6 is predominantly expressed in the colon, kidney, duodenum, and small intestine, indicating its potential role in these tissues in maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress. The enzyme is typically active in the cell membrane, where it contributes to the breakdown and reabsorption of glutathione, thus playing a vital role in sustaining intracellular glutathione levels (Heisterkamp2008The; GelenGüngör2020mRNA).

## Function
Gamma-glutamyltransferase 6 (GGT6) is part of the gamma-glutamyltransferase family, which plays a significant role in glutathione metabolism. GGT6 is involved in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, facilitating the transfer of gamma-glutamyl functional groups. This process is crucial for amino acid transport and detoxification, contributing to the maintenance of cellular redox balance and protection against oxidative stress (Heisterkamp2008The; GelenGüngör2020mRNA).

GGT6 is typically active in the cell membrane, where it influences the cellular environment by participating in the breakdown and reabsorption of glutathione and its component amino acids. This activity is essential for maintaining intracellular glutathione levels, which are critical for normal physiological function and protection against oxidative damage (Heisterkamp2008The).

While the specific enzymatic function of GGT6 in humans is not fully described, it is most abundantly expressed in the colon, kidney, duodenum, and small intestine in normal tissues, suggesting a role in these organs related to glutathione metabolism and possibly leukotriene catabolism (Heisterkamp2008The; GelenGüngör2020mRNA).
