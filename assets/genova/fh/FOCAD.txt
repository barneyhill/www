# FOCAD

## Overview
FOCAD is a gene that encodes the protein focadhesin, which is primarily involved in cellular adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Focadhesin is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in localizing to the ends of actin filaments and colocalizing with vinculin at focal adhesions, which are critical for cell-extracellular matrix interactions and signal transduction. The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with notable expression in the brain and heart, where it plays a role in responding to biomechanical stress and facilitating structural changes. FOCAD is also implicated in inter-tissue communication and has been associated with various physiological traits, including cardiac and pulmonary functions. Additionally, it has been linked to craniofacial development and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Brand2019FOCAD; Long2016Inter-tissue; Liu2021PRICKLE1).

## Function
The FOCAD gene, also known as focadhesin, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Focadhesin is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels found in the brain, and is also present in other tissues such as the heart. The protein localizes to the end of actin filaments and colocalizes with vinculin, a major component of focal adhesions. Focal adhesions are critical sites where cells interact with the extracellular matrix, facilitating signal transduction from the outside to the inside of the cell. In the heart, focal adhesions are essential for responding to biomechanical stress, enabling structural changes in the myocardium (Long2016Inter-tissue).

FOCAD's role extends to inter-tissue communication, as suggested by its expression in the heart correlating with integrin α5 (ITGA5) and paxillin (PXN), which are involved in focal adhesion signaling. Genome-wide association studies have linked FOCAD variants to cardiac and pulmonary traits, including heart rate, heart failure, and pulmonary function measures, indicating its broader physiological significance (Long2016Inter-tissue). Additionally, FOCAD has been implicated in craniofacial development, with studies suggesting its involvement in craniofacial malformations and facial morphology variations (Liu2021PRICKLE1).

## Clinical Significance
The FOCAD gene, also known as KIAA1797, is implicated in several cancers, including malignant gliomas, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. In astrocytic gliomas, particularly those with IDH mutations, the loss of FOCAD is associated with poorer patient outcomes and increased tumor aggressiveness. This is due to its role in microtubule assembly and cell cycle regulation, where its loss accelerates G2/M phase progression, potentially enhancing tumor growth and reducing genomic integrity (Brand2019FOCAD). FOCAD is frequently deleted in high-grade tumors, such as IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, where its loss is linked to increased microtubule assembly rates, contributing to the invasive phenotype of these tumors (Brand2019FOCAD).

FOCAD's interaction with tubulin proteins and its localization to centrosomes are crucial for its function in reducing cell migration and proliferation. Alterations in its expression or function can disrupt these processes, promoting tumor growth (Brand2019FOCAD). The gene is located near the CDKN2A/B tumor suppressor locus on chromosome 9p21.3, a region often deleted in various cancers, suggesting that FOCAD haploinsufficiency or inactivation may predispose individuals to cancer and influence tumor progression (Brand2019FOCAD).

## Interactions
FOCAD, also known as focadhesin, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with several tubulin subfamilies, including tubulin beta-6 (TUBB6), tubulin beta-3 (TUBB3), and tubulin gamma-1 (TUBG1), but not with tubulin alpha-1A (TUBA1A). These interactions suggest a role for FOCAD in microtubule assembly and cell cycle progression (Brand2019FOCAD). FOCAD also interacts with SLAIN2, a component of the microtubule plus-end tracking protein network, affecting microtubule regrowth and dynamics by modulating SLAIN2 activity (Brand2019FOCAD).

FOCAD has been shown to interact with heat shock protein 90 alpha family class B member 1 (HSP90AB1), although the functional relevance of this interaction is not fully understood (Brand2019FOCAD). In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FOCAD is involved in the FOCAD-FAK signaling pathway, where it enhances the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), influencing mitochondrial function and sensitivity to ferroptosis (Liu2020NRF2). Additionally, FOCAD is implicated in a gene-gene interaction with PRICKLE1, affecting craniofacial development, as evidenced by studies in mouse models (Liu2021PRICKLE1). These interactions highlight FOCAD's role in cellular adhesion, signaling, and structural organization.
