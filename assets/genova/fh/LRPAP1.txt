# LRPAP1

## Overview
LRPAP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein associated protein 1) is a gene that encodes a chaperone protein involved in the folding and trafficking of LDL receptor-related proteins. The protein, also known as LDL receptor related protein associated protein 1, is primarily active within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a critical role in ensuring the proper translocation of these receptors to the plasma membrane. By preventing premature ligand binding and denaturation, LRPAP1 maintains cellular homeostasis and influences lipid metabolism (Reid2023LRPAP1). Additionally, LRPAP1 functions as an inhibitor of LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and other related receptors, impacting processes such as endocytosis and cellular uptake of lipoproteins (Reid2023LRPAP1). The protein is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and viral pathogenesis, highlighting its diverse biological roles (Li2023Secreted; Reid2023LRPAP1).

## Function
LRPAP1 (LDL receptor related protein associated protein 1) encodes a chaperone protein that plays a crucial role in the proper folding and trafficking of LDL receptor-related proteins. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it assists in the translocation of these receptors to the plasma membrane, preventing their denaturation or premature ligand binding (Reid2023LRPAP1). LRPAP1 functions as an inhibitor of LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and related receptors, influencing processes such as endocytosis and cellular uptake of lipoproteins and other molecules (Reid2023LRPAP1).

In microglial cells, LRPAP1 is released upon activation by inflammatory stimuli or ER stress, where it can inhibit microglial phagocytosis and amyloid beta aggregation, suggesting a regulatory role in microglial activity and potentially impacting neurodegenerative disease processes (Reid2023LRPAP1). The presence of LRPAP1 on the surface of microglia and its ability to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis further highlight its role in modulating cellular functions (Reid2023LRPAP1). These activities underscore LRPAP1's involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing lipid metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRPAP1 gene are associated with several ocular conditions, particularly high myopia. Studies have identified homozygous frameshift mutations in LRPAP1 that are linked to early-onset high myopia, suggesting a genetic basis for this condition (Jiang2014Detection). In zebrafish models, LRPAP1 deficiency leads to myopia through mechanisms involving TGF-β-induced apoptosis, highlighting the gene's role in eye development and its potential impact on myopia (Liu2022Lrpap1).

LRPAP1 mutations are also implicated in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) in individuals with high myopia. A study found that 42% of children with recessive LRPAP1 mutations developed RRD, emphasizing the gene's role in retinal health and the risk of retinal detachment (Magliyah2020Rhegmatogenous).

Beyond ocular conditions, LRPAP1 is involved in viral infections. It interacts with viral proteases, such as those from EV71 and SARS-CoV-2, facilitating viral evasion of the host's immune response by degrading IFNAR1, a receptor crucial for interferon signaling. This interaction suggests that LRPAP1 could be a target for antiviral strategies (Li2023Secreted).

## Interactions
LRPAP1 interacts with several proteins and receptors, playing a significant role in various biological processes. It binds to receptors of the LDL receptor family, such as LRP1, LRP2, ApoER2, and VLDLR, potentially regulating their activity by preventing the binding of other ligands. This interaction can inhibit endocytosis or phagocytosis mediated by these receptors (Reid2023LRPAP1). LRPAP1 also interacts with amyloid beta (Ab), inhibiting its uptake and aggregation by microglia, which is relevant in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Reid2023LRPAP1).

In the context of viral infections, LRPAP1 binds to the extracellular domain of the interferon alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1), leading to its degradation. This interaction facilitates viral evasion from the host's innate immune response by downregulating IFNAR1, a key component of the type I interferon signaling pathway (Li2023Secreted). LRPAP1 also competes with other ligands such as alpha-2-macroglobulin (α2M) and lactoferrin (LF) in the extracellular environment, with α2M shown to upregulate IFNAR1 and inhibit viral propagation (Li2023Secreted). These interactions highlight LRPAP1's role in both neurodegenerative diseases and viral pathogenesis.
