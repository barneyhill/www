# C18orf63

## Overview
C18orf63 is a gene located on chromosome 18 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 18 open reading frame 63. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. It is categorized as a non-kinase protein, and current research is exploring its potential roles in cellular signaling pathways and interactions with other proteins. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of interest due to their implications in certain biological pathways and potential links to disease states, although further studies are needed to fully understand these associations (Qiu2020aarFDC).
