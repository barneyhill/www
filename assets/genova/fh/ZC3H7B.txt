# ZC3H7B

## Overview
ZC3H7B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type containing 7B protein, also known as RoXaN. This protein is primarily located in the nucleus and is characterized by its involvement in protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, facilitated by its structural domains, including tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and zinc finger motifs. These features enable the protein to participate in complex cellular processes such as miRNA processing and transcriptional regulation. ZC3H7B is particularly noted for its role in recognizing specific miRNA hairpins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular functions. Clinically, ZC3H7B is significant due to its involvement in gene fusions, notably with the BCOR gene, which is associated with certain tumors, including endometrial stromal sarcomas and ossifying fibromyxoid tumors. These fusions suggest a role in oncogenesis, potentially through alterations in epigenetic regulation (Panagopoulos2013Fusion; Madarász2024BCORRearranged).

## Structure
The ZC3H7B protein, also known as RoXaN, is characterized by several domains that facilitate protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. It contains three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) near the amino terminus, which are motifs involved in protein-protein interactions (Panagopoulos2013Fusion). The protein also features four Cys-X8-Cys-X5-Cys-X3-His (C3H1) zinc finger motifs and one C2H2-type zinc finger motif, both of which are involved in RNA and DNA binding (Panagopoulos2013Fusion). A specific cluster of amino acids (aa 257-271) matches the LDxLLxxL motif, commonly found in proteins of the paxillin superfamily, indicating a role in protein-protein interactions (Panagopoulos2013Fusion). The C-terminal region (904-941 aa) of ZC3H7B forms a coil structure (Panagopoulos2013Fusion). ZC3H7B is primarily a nuclear protein, and its LD domain functions as a nuclear export signal for the CRM1 nuclear export pathway, which is involved in the nuclear export of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABP-C1) (Panagopoulos2013Fusion). The protein's structure and domains suggest its involvement in complex cellular processes, including interactions within multiprotein complexes.

## Function
ZC3H7B encodes a protein that plays a significant role in miRNA processing, particularly by binding to specific miRNA molecules. It contains TPR and LD motifs, and its activity is primarily located in the nucleus, where it likely participates in transcriptional regulation by interacting with RNA molecules (Madarász2024BCORRearranged). The protein is involved in recognizing the hairpins of miR-7-1, miR-16-2, and miR-29a, which suggests its role in regulating miRNA levels and influencing gene expression and cellular processes (Treiber2017A; Madarász2024BCORRearranged).

ZC3H7B contains several domains that facilitate its function, including tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) for protein-protein interactions and zinc finger motifs for RNA and DNA binding (Panagopoulos2013Fusion). These structural features enable ZC3H7B to participate in various cellular processes, including nuclear export and interactions within multiprotein complexes (Panagopoulos2013Fusion). The protein's involvement in miRNA processing and its ability to bind specific sequences in miRNA hairpin structures suggest a role in posttranscriptional regulation, influencing miRNA processing and maturation (Treiber2017A).

## Clinical Significance
The ZC3H7B gene is implicated in several diseases through its involvement in gene fusions, particularly with the BCOR gene. The ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion is notably associated with high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas, a rare type of uterine sarcoma characterized by aggressive clinical behavior and distinct histological features. These tumors often present with higher stage disease and are marked by spindle cells in a myxoid matrix, brisk mitotic activity, and a high degree of nuclear atypia (Lewis2018ZC3H7BBCOR). The fusion is also found in ossifying fibromyxoid tumors, a rare type of soft tissue neoplasm, where it serves as a molecular marker for diagnosis, especially in cases that are difficult to distinguish from other lesions (Antonescu2013Novel).

The presence of the ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion in these tumors suggests a role in tumorigenesis, potentially through epigenetic mechanisms. The fusion protein may affect normal cellular processes by altering gene expression patterns, contributing to the development and progression of these malignancies (Panagopoulos2013Fusion). The clinical significance of ZC3H7B mutations is underscored by their association with aggressive tumor behavior and potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications (Specht2016Novel).

## Interactions
The ZC3H7B protein, also known as RoXaN, is involved in various protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. It contains several domains that facilitate these interactions, including three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) near the amino terminus, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions, and zinc finger motifs that are involved in RNA and DNA binding (Panagopoulos2013Fusion). ZC3H7B also has a cluster of amino acids that match the LDxLLxxL motif, found in proteins of the paxillin superfamily, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Panagopoulos2013Fusion).

In the context of gene fusions, ZC3H7B forms a chimeric protein with BCOR in certain tumors, such as endometrial stromal sarcomas and ossifying fibromyxoid tumors. This fusion protein retains the TPRs and LD motif from ZC3H7B, suggesting it may participate in multiprotein complexes and affect epigenetic regulation (Antonescu2013Novel; Panagopoulos2013Fusion). The ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion protein is implicated in oncogenesis, potentially through alterations in the epigenetic machinery, particularly polycomb-mediated gene silencing (Panagopoulos2013Fusion). Additionally, ZC3H7B interacts with the rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP3, indicating its role in viral protein interactions (Panagopoulos2013Fusion).
