# AP5M1

## Overview
The AP5M1 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 5 subunit mu 1, a critical component of the adaptor protein complex 5 (AP-5). This protein is involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly within the endosomal-lysosomal system, where it plays a pivotal role in sorting and transporting proteins between cellular compartments. As a subunit of the AP-5 complex, AP5M1 is integral to the retrieval of proteins from late endosomes/lysosomes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and the regulation of protein degradation pathways (Fuentes2023Maternal; Alford2016Human). The protein's function is essential for maintaining proper cellular function and preventing lysosomal storage disorders. Mutations in the AP5M1 gene have been linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative diseases (Khundadze2013A). Additionally, AP5M1, also known as MuD, has been implicated in cancer prognosis, particularly in glioblastoma multiforme, where its expression levels correlate with patient survival outcomes (Shin2019MUDENG).

## Structure
The AP5M1 protein, a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 5 (AP-5), is involved in intracellular trafficking processes. In zebrafish, the AP5M1 protein consists of an N-terminal alpha-helical domain (residues 1-205) and a beta-sheet structured C-terminal domain (residues 206-492) (Fuentes2023Maternal; Fuentes2024Maternal). The N-terminal domain is responsible for interactions with other subunits of the AP5 complex, while the C-terminal domain is involved in specific cargo recognition and interaction, suggesting a role in endosomal trafficking (Fuentes2023Maternal; Fuentes2024Maternal).

The C-terminal domain of AP5M1 shows high conservation with the human AP4m1 C-terminal domain, indicating structural similarities and potential functional parallels in vesicle trafficking (Fuentes2023Maternal; Fuentes2024Maternal). The structural alignment between zebrafish AP5M1 and human AP4M1 C-terminal domains reveals an overall 3D structural identity with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.45 Å, highlighting the conserved nature of these domains (Fuentes2023Maternal).

A missense mutation in the AP5M1 gene, changing threonine 27 to lysine, is known to cause a conformational change that affects binding activity, particularly impacting a peptide loop in the N-terminal domain (Fuentes2024Maternal). This mutation underscores the importance of the protein's structural integrity for its function.

## Function
The AP5M1 gene encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 5 (AP-5), which is involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly within the endosomal-lysosomal system. AP-5 is a heterotetramer complex that localizes to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments and plays a crucial role in sorting endosomes back to the Golgi apparatus. This function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the movement of proteins to lysosomes for degradation or recycling (Fuentes2023Maternal; Alford2016Human).

In healthy human cells, AP5M1 is implicated in the retrieval of proteins from late endosomes/lysosomes, a process that is vital for proper protein sorting and trafficking. The AP-5 complex, including AP5M1, interacts with other proteins such as SPG11 and SPG15/Spastizin, which are associated with Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) in humans. This interaction suggests a role in the regulation of lysosomal function and protein degradation pathways (Fuentes2023Maternal).

AP5M1's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular function, particularly in the context of endosomal trafficking and protein sorting, which are critical for the proper functioning of various cellular pathways and the prevention of lysosomal storage disorders (Fuentes2024Maternal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP5M1 gene have been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the legs. The AP5M1 gene encodes a component of the adaptor protein complex 5 (AP5), which is involved in intracellular trafficking. Disruptions in this complex can lead to defects in cargo sorting within cells, contributing to neurodegenerative conditions such as HSP (Khundadze2013A). Specifically, the AP5 complex, including AP5M1, is implicated in the endolysosomal system, and defects in this system can result in axon degeneration and neuronal death, which are observed in conditions like SPG15, a subtype of HSP (Khundadze2013A).

Alterations in the expression of AP5M1, also known as MuD, have been studied in the context of cancer, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Differential expression of MuD is correlated with survival rates in specific GBM subtypes. High expression of MuD is associated with higher survival in proneural GBM but lower survival in classical GBM, suggesting its potential role as a cancer prognosis biomarker (Shin2019MUDENG). These findings highlight the clinical significance of AP5M1 in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

## Interactions
AP5M1 is a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 5 (AP-5), which is involved in intracellular trafficking processes. AP5M1 interacts with other subunits of the AP-5 complex, including AP5B1, AP5Z1, and AP5S1, forming a heterotetrameric complex that functions in endosomal trafficking (Fuentes2023Maternal; Fuentes2024Maternal). This complex is involved in sorting late endosomes back to the Golgi and is associated with proteins such as SPG11 and SPG15/Spastizin, which are linked to Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) (Fuentes2023Maternal; Fuentes2024Maternal).

AP5M1 is also implicated in the trafficking of HIV-2 Gag protein, where it plays a role in the retrieval of the protein from late endosomes/lysosomes, affecting its localization and degradation (Alford2016Human). The AP-5 complex, including AP5M1, is involved in cholesterol trafficking within the endolysosomal pathway and does not rely on the small GTPase ARF1 for membrane recruitment, instead depending on phosphoinositides like PI(3,5)P2 (Nahalka2021Theoretical). 

Spatacsin, a protein associated with lysosomal function, has been shown to promote the degradation of AP5M1, suggesting a regulatory interaction that affects lysosome trafficking and function (Pierga2023Spatacsin).
