# ZNF517

## Overview
ZNF517 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 517, a member of the KRAB-ZNF subfamily, which is characterized by its role in transcriptional repression. The protein functions as a transcription factor, binding to DNA through its zinc finger motifs to regulate gene expression (Lorenz2010The). ZNF517 is expressed in various human tissues, indicating its potential involvement in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development (Lorenz2010The). The gene's promoter region contains unique elements that contribute to its regulatory functions, highlighting its role in modulating gene expression (Lorenz2010The). While the precise physiological roles of ZNF517 remain to be fully elucidated, its stable expression and involvement in transcriptional regulation suggest it plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and developmental processes. Additionally, ZNF517 has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, and may influence stem cell differentiation through interactions with the KRAB/TRIM28 module (AlNaama2020C2H2Type; Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).

## Function
ZNF517 is a zinc finger protein that is part of the KRAB-ZNF subfamily, which is known for its role in transcriptional repression. This protein is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to DNA through its zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor (Lorenz2010The). ZNF517 is expressed across various human tissues, exhibiting relatively stable expression levels, which suggests a broad role in cellular processes (Lorenz2010The).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences the expression of target genes, potentially impacting cell differentiation and development (Lorenz2010The). The promoter region of ZNF517 contains atypical motifs such as the motif ten element (MTE) and the X core promoter element (XCPE1), which are involved in transcription regulation, indicating its role in modulating gene expression (Lorenz2010The).

Although the specific function of ZNF517 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its stable expression across tissues and involvement in transcriptional regulation suggest it may play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and contributing to the regulation of developmental processes (Lorenz2010The).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF517 has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Although specific details about its clinical significance in these disorders are not extensively documented, ZNF517 is listed among zinc finger proteins contributing to ASDs (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). The involvement of C2H2-type zinc finger proteins, such as ZNF517, in neurodevelopmental disorders suggests that alterations in its expression or function could impact neural development and contribute to the pathogenesis of these conditions (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

In the context of pluripotent stem cells, ZNF517 is associated with the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with the KRAB/TRIM28 module. This module is known to repress genes involved in differentiation by inducing promoter hypermethylation, which could potentially affect cellular differentiation processes. Although ZNF517 is not specifically highlighted in the study, it is mentioned among other KRAB-ZNF genes that may play a role in this regulatory mechanism (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28). These interactions suggest that dysregulation of ZNF517 could have implications for stem cell differentiation and related disorders.
