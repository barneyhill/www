# LRRC66

## Overview
The LRRC66 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing 66 protein, which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of LRR motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are crucial for various cellular processes. The LRRC66 protein is implicated in several biological functions, although its precise role remains to be fully elucidated. It is thought to participate in cellular signaling pathways and may have a role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential involvement in certain pathological conditions, although further research is needed to clarify these associations.
