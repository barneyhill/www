# OR1E2

## Overview
OR1E2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily E member 2, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. These receptors are a subset of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play a crucial role in the detection of odorants, facilitating the sense of smell. The protein encoded by OR1E2 is a transmembrane receptor, characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of GPCRs, which allows it to traverse the cell membrane and interact with odorant molecules. This interaction initiates a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in the perception of smell. The OR1E2 gene is located on chromosome 17, and like other olfactory receptors, it is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the vast repertoire of olfactory receptors responsible for detecting a wide array of odorant molecules (Siddiqui2018Chromosome; Saeed2023Smell).

## Interactions
OR1E2, an olfactory receptor, has been studied for its potential interactions with other proteins, although specific partners are not extensively detailed. Evidence from affinity purification experiments suggests that OR1E2 may engage in either direct or indirect interactions, similar to other olfactory receptors like OR1D4, which have been shown to interact with transmembrane proteins in yeast two-hybrid assays (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). This implies that OR1E2 could participate in protein-protein interactions, although the exact partners remain unspecified.

The challenges in identifying interactions involving OR1E2 are partly due to the hydrophobic nature and low transcript expression levels of olfactory receptors, which complicate their detection in proteomic analyses. Yeast two-hybrid assays are suggested as a promising method for identifying interactions involving membrane proteins like OR1E2, as these assays can circumvent the difficulties associated with membrane solubilization in mass spectrometry-based approaches (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

In a study on the genetics of schizophrenia, OR1E2 was mentioned in the context of unique variants found in a single family, but specific protein interactions were not detailed (Saeed2023Smell). Overall, while OR1E2 is implicated in potential interactions, further research is needed to elucidate its specific interaction partners.
