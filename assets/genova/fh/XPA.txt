# XPA

## Overview
The XPA gene encodes the XPA protein, a critical DNA damage recognition and repair factor involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by identifying and facilitating the repair of DNA lesions, particularly those induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation and chemical mutagens. As a scaffold protein, XPA coordinates the assembly of the NER complex by interacting with various proteins, including replication protein A (RPA), ERCC1-XPF, and TFIIH, to ensure efficient DNA repair. Structurally, XPA is characterized by a zinc-binding domain essential for its DNA-binding capability, and it forms a multiprotein complex with other NER components to execute its function. Mutations in the XPA gene are linked to xeroderma pigmentosum, a disorder marked by heightened UV sensitivity and increased cancer risk, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in DNA repair and disease prevention (Kindil2017Genetic; Fadda2016Role; Krasikova2022The).

## Structure
The XPA protein is a crucial component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, responsible for recognizing and repairing DNA damage. Structurally, XPA consists of several domains that contribute to its function. The primary structure of XPA includes a sequence of 273 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 40 kDa (Fadda2016Role).

The secondary structure of XPA features a zinc-binding domain, which is essential for its DNA-binding capability. This domain includes an antiparallel β-sheet and an α-helix, similar to the zinc-binding domain of the chicken erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 (Buchko1998Structural). The central domain of XPA, spanning residues 98 to 219, is crucial for binding to damaged DNA and the RPA70 protein. This domain includes a zinc-binding sequence and is composed of a zinc-containing subdomain (residues 102-129) and a C-terminal subdomain (residues 138-209), connected by a linker sequence (Ikegami1998Solution).

The tertiary structure of XPA is organized into distinct subdomains, forming a clamp-like structure with a positively charged inner surface that fits well with the diameter of standard B-form dsDNA (Krasikova2022The). The protein's interaction with DNA is further stabilized by stacking interactions involving specific residues, such as Trp175 (Krasikova2022The).

XPA's quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins in the NER pathway, such as RPA, ERCC1, and TFIIH, forming a multiprotein complex essential for DNA repair (Fadda2016Role). The protein's activity and expression are regulated through various mechanisms, including post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context (Krasikova2022The).

## Function
The XPA gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, a key mechanism for repairing DNA damage in cells. XPA is involved in the recognition and verification of DNA lesions, particularly those caused by UV radiation and chemical mutagens. It acts as a scaffold, organizing the NER complex by interacting with various proteins, including replication protein A (RPA), ERCC1-XPF, and TFIIH, to facilitate the repair process (Li1995An; Fadda2016Role; Krasikova2022The).

XPA's DNA-binding domain allows it to recognize and bind to damaged DNA, particularly at single-strand and double-strand DNA junctions, which is essential for the NER process (Krasikova2022The). The protein's interactions with RPA are critical for anchoring it to the DNA bubble and recruiting other repair factors, such as the ERCC1-XPF endonuclease, to the site of damage (Fadda2016Role). XPA's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which enhance its activity in NER (Krasikova2022The).

In healthy human cells, XPA is primarily active in the nucleus, where it maintains genomic stability by ensuring efficient DNA repair, thus preventing mutagenesis and reducing the risk of diseases like xeroderma pigmentosum (Krasikova2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the XPA gene are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light, increased risk of skin cancers, and potential neurological impairments. XP results from defects in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, where XPA plays a crucial role. Specific mutations, such as the c.682C>T (p.Arg228X) mutation, are prevalent in certain populations, like Moroccan patients, and are linked to moderate clinical phenotypes (Kindil2017Genetic). Other mutations, such as p.Arg207Ter, affect the DNA binding region, leading to impaired DNA damage recognition and repair (Santiago2015Xeroderma).

Alterations in XPA expression levels have been implicated in cancer susceptibility. In bladder cancer, reduced XPA levels correlate with increased chromosomal aberrations and genomic instability, suggesting that downregulation of XPA may promote carcinogenesis by impairing DNA repair (Zhi2017Downregulated). Additionally, mutations affecting XPA's interaction with other proteins, such as the damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB), can impact the efficiency of NER, particularly in the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (Wakasugi2008Physical). These findings highlight the clinical significance of XPA in maintaining genomic stability and its potential role in various DNA repair-related disorders.

## Interactions
The XPA protein is a key component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate DNA repair. XPA acts as a scaffold at the DNA damage site, coordinating the assembly of NER core factors. It directly interacts with all NER core factors except XPG (Fadda2016Role). XPA binds to replication protein A (RPA), specifically interacting with the RPA32C and RPA70AB subunits. The interaction with RPA32C is mediated by residues 29-46, while the zinc-binding motif of XPA interacts with RPA70AB (Kim2022Two). These interactions are crucial for organizing the preincision complex and enhancing the repair efficiency of UV-induced DNA lesions (Kim2022Two).

XPA also interacts with the ERCC1-XPF endonuclease, which is responsible for cleaving damaged ssDNA. The minimum ERCC1 binding motif of XPA is located between residues 67 and 80 (Fadda2016Role). Additionally, XPA interacts with TFIIH, with the C-terminal region of XPA being involved in this interaction (Saijo2011Nucleotide). XPA's interaction with damaged DNA is enhanced by its interactions with other NER components, which helps coordinate the early stages of NER (Saijo2011Nucleotide).
