# STX16

## Overview
The STX16 gene encodes syntaxin 16, a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) protein family, which is integral to vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion processes within cells. Syntaxin 16 is primarily localized at the trans-Golgi network and plays a pivotal role in retrograde transport from endosomes to the Golgi, essential for cellular homeostasis and protein sorting (Chen2010Syntaxin). In addition to its role in intracellular transport, syntaxin 16 is involved in various cellular processes, including dendritic growth in neurons, epithelial cell adhesion, cytokinesis, and autophagy (Neto2013Syntaxin; Chua2008Syntaxin; Jung2013Syntaxin; Tang2019Syntaxin). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with autosomal dominant pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b, a disorder linked to epigenetic defects affecting hormone signaling (Linglart2005A; Turan2012De).

## Function
Syntaxin 16 (STX16) is a member of the SNARE protein family, playing a critical role in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion processes within cells. It is primarily localized at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is involved in retrograde transport from endosomes to the TGN, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein sorting (Chen2010Syntaxin). In neuronal cells, STX16 is enriched in dendrites and is associated with Golgi outposts, contributing to dendritic growth and neuronal polarity by facilitating protein trafficking (Chua2008Syntaxin).

STX16 is also crucial in epithelial cells, where it regulates the trafficking of E-cadherin, a protein vital for cell-cell adhesion. Its depletion leads to impaired epithelial barrier function and reduced E-cadherin at cell junctions, highlighting its role in maintaining cell junction integrity (Jung2013Syntaxin). In cytokinesis, STX16 is necessary for the recruitment of recycling endosomes and the Exocyst complex to the midbody, ensuring successful cell division (Neto2013Syntaxin).

Additionally, STX16 is involved in autophagy, particularly in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, where it can potentially replace STX17 in forming a functional SNARE complex (Tang2019Syntaxin). These diverse roles underscore STX16's importance in various cellular processes and its impact on organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deletions in the STX16 gene are associated with autosomal dominant pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b (AD-PHP1B), a condition characterized by resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. This disorder is often linked to epigenetic defects, specifically the loss of methylation at the GNAS locus, which is crucial for proper hormone signaling (Linglart2005A; Turan2012De).

Several studies have identified different deletions within the STX16 gene that contribute to AD-PHP1B. A common finding is a 3-kb microdeletion, which is maternally inherited and leads to the loss of methylation at GNAS exon A/B (Turan2012De). Other deletions, such as a 4.4-kb microdeletion, have been identified and are thought to disrupt a cis-acting imprinting control element necessary for methylation at GNAS exon A/B (Linglart2005A).

A novel long-range deletion spanning 87.5 kb, including STX16 and NPEPL1, has also been reported. This deletion does not affect the GNAS locus directly but is associated with imprinting defects that lead to AD-PHP1B (Yang2020A). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of STX16 in maintaining normal calcium and phosphate balance through its impact on GNAS locus methylation.

## Interactions
Syntaxin 16 (STX16) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in membrane trafficking and cellular processes. STX16 interacts with the Sec1/Munc18 family member Vps45, which is essential for its stability and function. This interaction occurs through a conserved N-terminal peptide motif, which is crucial for binding to Vps45 and is similar to the interaction between yeast Tlg2p and Vps45p (Dulubova2002How; Struthers2009Functional). The binding of STX16 to Vps45 facilitates the transition of syntaxins from a closed to an open conformation, necessary for SNARE-complex assembly (Struthers2009Functional).

STX16 also interacts with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in epithelial cells. This interaction is important for the trafficking and recycling of CFTR to the plasma membrane, affecting CFTR channel activity and membrane expression (Gee2010Syntaxin).

In cytokinesis, STX16 is involved in the recruitment of the Exocyst complex and interacts with Rab11, playing a role in the delivery of proteins necessary for cell division (Neto2013Syntaxin). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of STX16 in cellular physiology.
