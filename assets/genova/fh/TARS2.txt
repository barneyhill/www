# TARS2

## Overview
The TARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (mt-ThrRS), a crucial enzyme in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family responsible for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme facilitates the attachment of threonine to its corresponding tRNA, a vital step in the translation process within mitochondria, thereby supporting the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system essential for cellular energy production (Diodato2014VARS2andTARS2Mutations; Gao2022TARS2). The TARS2 gene is located on chromosome 1q21.3 and is known for its involvement in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, influencing cell growth and proliferation (Kim2021Mitochondrial). Mutations in TARS2 have been associated with mitochondrial disorders, including combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-21 (COXPD21), characterized by severe clinical manifestations such as encephalomyopathy and developmental delays (Gao2022TARS2; Zhang2024TARS2).

## Structure
The TARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase (mt-ThrRS), a protein crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. The mt-ThrRS protein is composed of 718 amino acids and includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal N1 domain (Leu20-Ser124), an N2 domain for editing (Pro125-Asp301), an aminoacylation domain for amino acid activation and tRNA charging (His302-Gly605), and an anticodon binding domain for tRNA binding (Lys606-Phe718) (Gao2022TARS2; Zhang2024TARS2). The N1 domain is responsible for editing and ensuring the correct activation of threonine, preventing the incorrect activation of non-homologous serine sequences (Gao2022TARS2).

The protein's structure is characterized by a Rossmann fold, which is typically involved in ATP binding, although specific details about this fold in TARS2 are not provided in the context. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, although specific sites or effects are not detailed in the provided context. The TARS2 gene is located on chromosome 1q21.3 and contains 18 exons, with potential for alternative splicing, which could lead to different isoforms of the protein, though specific isoforms are not described (Gao2022TARS2).

## Function
The TARS2 gene encodes mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme crucial for the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNA with threonine, a key step in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Diodato2014VARS2andTARS2Mutations; Gao2022TARS2). This process is essential for the proper functioning of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system, which is vital for cellular energy production (Gao2022TARS2). TARS2 is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it ensures the accurate synthesis of mitochondrial proteins by catalyzing the attachment of threonine to its corresponding tRNA (Del2022The; Kim2021Mitochondrial).

In addition to its role in protein synthesis, TARS2 is involved in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. It interacts with the lysosomal amino acid-sensing machinery, playing a significant role in threonine-sensitive activation of mTORC1, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation (Kim2021Mitochondrial). TARS2's interaction with Rag GTPases, particularly RagC, is dependent on threonine and is necessary for mTORC1 activation, highlighting its role in cellular responses to threonine availability (Kim2021Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TARS2 gene are linked to a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-21 (COXPD21). This condition is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction due to impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, leading to a range of clinical manifestations including severe encephalomyopathy, cardiomyopathy, developmental delay, and neurological symptoms, often resulting in poor prognosis and early death (Gao2022TARS2; Zhang2024TARS2). 

Patients with TARS2 mutations may present with symptoms such as axial hypotonia, limb hypertonia, psychomotor developmental delay, epilepsy, and brain anomalies (Zhang2024TARS2). Specific mutations identified include compound heterozygous variants and a Chinese-specific founder mutation, c.470 C > G, p.Thr157Arg, which has been reported in multiple cases (Zhang2024TARS2; Li2020Novel). 

Biochemical studies have shown that these mutations lead to multiple deficiencies in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activities, contributing to the clinical presentation of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (Diodato2014VARS2andTARS2Mutations). The pathogenic role of TARS2 mutations has been confirmed through complementation studies, which demonstrated that expression of wild-type TARS2 can rescue the biochemical impairment of mitochondrial respiration (Diodato2014VARS2andTARS2Mutations).

## Interactions
TARS2, a mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. Notably, TARS2 physically interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 M protein, suggesting a potential role in the virus-host interaction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that TARS2 may be hijacked by the virus, potentially affecting mitochondrial function and host cellular responses (Feng2022The).

In the context of mitochondrial disorders, mutations in the TARS2 gene have been linked to mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. These mutations result in decreased levels of TARS2 protein and threonyl-tRNA, impacting mitochondrial translation and function. The study of these mutations highlights the critical role of TARS2 in maintaining mitochondrial respiratory chain activities (Diodato2014VARS2andTARS2Mutations).

TARS2 is also part of a broader network of mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are essential for protein synthesis within mitochondria. These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of mitochondrial translation machinery and cellular energy production (Feng2022The).
