# KHDRBS2

## Overview
KHDRBS2 is a gene that encodes the protein KH RNA binding domain containing, signal transduction associated 2, which is a member of the STAR (signal transduction and activation of RNA) domain-containing family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in RNA metabolism and signal transduction, functioning as a multifunctional adapter protein due to its ability to bind SH2 and SH3 domains. The KHDRBS2 protein contains a STAR domain, which includes a KH domain crucial for RNA binding, and is flanked by QuA1 and QuA2 domains. It is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as RNA splicing, stability, and transport. The protein's activity in both the nucleus and cytoplasm underscores its importance in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Liu2021Pseudogene; Wang2002CloningandcharacterizationofanovelhumanSTARdomaincontainingcDNAKHDRBS2*).

## Structure
The KHDRBS2 protein is characterized by the presence of a STAR domain, which is a conserved domain involved in RNA binding and signal transduction. This domain is approximately 200 amino acids long and includes a maxi-KH module flanked by QuA1 and QuA2 domains (Wang2002CloningandcharacterizationofanovelhumanSTARdomaincontainingcDNAKHDRBS2*). The protein also contains proline-rich motifs and a C-terminal tyrosine-rich region, contributing to its structural complexity and potential interaction capabilities (Wang2002CloningandcharacterizationofanovelhumanSTARdomaincontainingcDNAKHDRBS2*).

The KHDRBS2 protein shows high sequence identity with rat and mouse SLM-1 proteins, indicating a close evolutionary relationship and suggesting a conserved structural framework across species (Wang2002CloningandcharacterizationofanovelhumanSTARdomaincontainingcDNAKHDRBS2*). The molecular mass of the predicted KHDRBS2 protein is 38.9 kDa, and its isoelectric point is 5.94, which may influence its solubility and interaction with other biomolecules (Wang2002CloningandcharacterizationofanovelhumanSTARdomaincontainingcDNAKHDRBS2*).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of KH domains suggests a role in RNA binding, which is critical for the protein's function in signal transduction and RNA metabolism (Wang2002CloningandcharacterizationofanovelhumanSTARdomaincontainingcDNAKHDRBS2*). The protein's expression is ubiquitous across various human tissues, indicating its fundamental cellular role (Wang2002CloningandcharacterizationofanovelhumanSTARdomaincontainingcDNAKHDRBS2*).

## Function
KHDRBS2, also known as SLIM1, is a member of the STAR (signal transduction and activation of RNA) domain-containing family, which plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism by linking tyrosine kinase signaling cascades to RNA processing. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind SH2 and SH3 domains, suggesting its function as a multifunctional adapter protein (Wang2002CloningandcharacterizationofanovelhumanSTARdomaincontainingcDNAKHDRBS2*). The STAR domain includes a KH domain involved in RNA binding, flanked by QuA1 and QuA2 domains, which are essential for its function in RNA metabolism (Wang2002CloningandcharacterizationofanovelhumanSTARdomaincontainingcDNAKHDRBS2*).

KHDRBS2 is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, including the brain, lung, kidney, and small intestine, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Wang2002CloningandcharacterizationofanovelhumanSTARdomaincontainingcDNAKHDRBS2*). In the brain, KHDRBS2 is involved in post-transcriptional regulation, influencing RNA splicing, stability, and transport, which are critical for maintaining normal cellular functions and development (Liu2021Pseudogene). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, impacting cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Liu2021Pseudogene).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KHDRBS2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In Alzheimer's disease, KHDRBS2 is involved in increasing blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. The pseudogene ACTBP2 promotes KHDRBS2 transcription, which stabilizes HEY2 mRNA, leading to decreased expression of tight junction proteins and increased BBB permeability. This mechanism suggests that KHDRBS2 plays a role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease by affecting BBB integrity (Liu2021Pseudogene).

In glioblastoma, KHDRBS2 is significantly downregulated and hypermethylated, contributing to the disease's progression. The downregulation is linked to DNA methylation, which is a common epigenetic alteration in glioblastoma, suggesting that KHDRBS2 may act as a tumor suppressor in this context (Bhargava2016Elucidation).

In lung adenocarcinoma, lower expression levels of KHDRBS2 are associated with poorer clinical outcomes. The gene's expression is downregulated in tumor samples compared to normal tissue, and higher expression correlates with longer survival times, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Chen2022Identification).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of KHDRBS2 in various pathological conditions, where its altered expression or interactions can impact disease progression and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
KHDRBS2, a member of the STAR (signal transduction and activation of RNA) domain family, is known for its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src during mitosis and contains a KH domain, which is characteristic of the STAR family. This protein shares high sequence identity with rat and mouse SLM-1 proteins, which are known to bind SH2 and SH3 domains of proteins such as p59 fyn, Grb-2, and phospholipase Cγ-1, suggesting its role as a multifunctional adapter protein (Wang2002CloningandcharacterizationofanovelhumanSTARdomaincontainingcDNAKHDRBS2*).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, KHDRBS2 is upregulated in an Aβ 1-42 microenvironment, where it stabilizes HEY2 mRNA by binding to its 3′UTR, enhancing HEY2 expression. This interaction affects the expression of tight junction proteins, contributing to increased blood-brain barrier permeability (Liu2021Pseudogene). The pseudogene ACTBP2 influences KHDRBS2 transcription by recruiting the KMT2D/WDR5 methyltransferase complex to its promoter, facilitating histone modification and enhancing KHDRBS2 expression (Liu2021Pseudogene).

Additionally, KHDRBS2 has been studied for its RNA-binding properties using the easyCLIP method. Mutations in KHDRBS2, such as R168C, have been shown to increase RNA binding, suggesting potential alterations in its interaction patterns, which may have implications in cancer (Porter2021easyCLIP).
