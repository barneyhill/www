# SEC14L6

## Overview
SEC14L6 is a human gene that encodes the SEC14-like lipid-binding protein 6, a member of the SEC14-like lipid-binding protein family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in lipid metabolism and transport, primarily through its CRAL-TRIO and GOLD domains. The CRAL-TRIO domain is responsible for binding small lipophilic molecules, while the GOLD domain is implicated in Golgi dynamics and intracellular protein trafficking, suggesting a role in vesicle trafficking and membrane composition (Dong2015Structural). SEC14L6 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and is classified as an alpha and beta protein (a+b), indicating its potential involvement in intracellular processes (Dong2015Structural). The gene is notably expressed in lung and kidney tissues, hinting at its functional significance in these organs (Dong2015Structural). While the precise physiological roles of SEC14L6 remain to be fully elucidated, its expression patterns and domain structures suggest a critical role in lipid transport and metabolism (Acoba2024Kidney).

## Structure


## Function
The SEC14L6 gene encodes a protein that is part of the SEC14-like lipid-binding protein family, which is involved in lipid metabolism and transport. The protein product of SEC14L6 is 397 amino acids long and contains two key domains: the CRAL-TRIO domain and the GOLD domain. The CRAL-TRIO domain, spanning amino acids 76 to 249, is known for binding small lipophilic molecules, including Vitamin E, suggesting a role in lipid binding and transport. The GOLD domain, located between amino acids 252 and 383, is involved in Golgi dynamics and intracellular protein trafficking, indicating a potential role in vesicle trafficking and membrane composition (Dong2015Structural).

In terms of cellular localization, SEC14L6 is found in the cytoplasm and is classified as an alpha and beta protein (a+b), suggesting it may have a functional role in intracellular processes (Dong2015Structural). Although its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, the presence of significant expression at the RNA level in lung and kidney tissues implies a role in these organs (Dong2015Structural). The protein's involvement in lipid traffic is further supported by its CRAL-TRIO lipid-binding domain, which suggests a role in lipid transport and metabolism (Acoba2024Kidney).

## Clinical Significance
The SEC14L6 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although specific diseases directly resulting from its mutations or expression alterations are not extensively detailed. In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SEC14L6 is identified as one of the hub survival genes in a prognostic risk score model. This model correlates higher risk scores with lower overall survival, suggesting that SEC14L6 expression levels may influence cancer progression and patient prognosis (Dai2022A).

In schizophrenia research, SEC14L6 is mentioned in relation to a risk locus identified in a Han Chinese cohort. The locus involves the PES1 gene, with SEC14L6 located in the intergenic region, indicating a potential association with schizophrenia risk, although the specific role of SEC14L6 remains unclear (Liu2021Genomewide).

In Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoproliferative disorder (HVLPD), SEC14L6 is noted as one of the downregulated genes in skin lesions. While the study does not directly link SEC14L6 to specific conditions, its downregulation in HVLPD lesions suggests a possible role in the disease's pathophysiology (Cohen2019Hydroa).
