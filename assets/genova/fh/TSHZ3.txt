# TSHZ3

## Overview
TSHZ3, or teashirt zinc finger homeobox 3, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor protein involved in various developmental processes, including smooth muscle cell differentiation and neurodevelopment. The TSHZ3 protein is characterized by its zinc finger homeobox domains, which enable it to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. It plays a pivotal role in the differentiation of smooth muscle cells by interacting with other transcription factors such as SOX9 and MYOCD, influencing the myogenic program. In the realm of neurodevelopment, TSHZ3 is essential for the expression of genes related to synaptic function, with implications in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) due to its impact on synaptic transmission and plasticity. Mutations in TSHZ3 are linked to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and have been associated with various cancers, where it can function as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the context (Martin2013TSHZ3; Zhou2021TSHZ3; Chabbert2019Postnatal; Kesdiren2024Heterozygous).

## Function
TSHZ3 (teashirt zinc finger homeobox 3) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various developmental processes, particularly in the differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and neurodevelopment. In the context of SMC differentiation in the ureter, TSHZ3 interacts with SOX9 to form a molecular complex that regulates the timing of SMC differentiation by modulating myocardin (MYOCD) activity. This interaction inhibits the transcriptional activation of smooth muscle-specific genes by displacing MYOCD from its co-regulator, serum response factor (SRF), thereby controlling the myogenic program (Martin2013TSHZ3).

In neurodevelopment, TSHZ3 is crucial for the proper expression of genes involved in synaptic function and is linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The loss of TSHZ3 affects gene expression differently in prenatal and postnatal stages, impacting synapse adhesion and neurotransmitter release. This results in altered synaptic transmission and plasticity, particularly involving NMDA receptor pathways, contributing to ASD-like behaviors (Chabbert2019Postnatal).

TSHZ3 is active in the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression by binding to DNA, influencing cell differentiation and organogenesis. Its dysfunction can lead to significant developmental abnormalities, highlighting its critical role in healthy human cells (Chabbert2019Postnatal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TSHZ3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), rare heterozygous TSHZ3 missense variants have been identified in patients, leading to conditions such as multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), hydronephrosis, and hydroureter. These variants are predicted to be deleterious and are linked to developmental delays and genital anomalies (Kesdiren2024Heterozygous).

TSHZ3 is also implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Heterozygous deletions of TSHZ3 are associated with ASD-like behaviors, including social interaction deficits and stereotypies. In mouse models, TSHZ3 deficiency affects the corticostriatal circuitry, crucial for synaptic plasticity, and is linked to NMDA receptor pathway abnormalities (Chabbert2019Postnatal).

In cancer research, TSHZ3 functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Its down-regulation or loss of function contributes to the pathogenesis of several cancers, including breast, prostate, ovarian, and oral squamous cell carcinomas. In gliomas, TSHZ3 down-regulation is negatively associated with tumor grades, while its over-expression suppresses glioblastoma cell invasion. However, TSHZ3 has oncogenic roles in non-small cell lung cancer and tongue squamous carcinoma (Zhou2021TSHZ3).

## Interactions
The TSHZ3 protein is known to interact with several transcription factors, playing a crucial role in the differentiation of smooth muscle cells, particularly in the context of kidney and urinary tract development. TSHZ3 physically interacts with the transcription factors SOX9 and MYOCD. These interactions are essential for the proper differentiation of ureteral smooth muscle cells. Mutations in TSHZ3, specifically the missense variants p.(Ser58Gly), p.(Pro63Leu), and p.(Ala65Thr), have been shown to alter these interactions. The p.(Ser58Gly) variant significantly impairs binding to SOX9, while all three variants increase binding to MYOCD compared to the wild-type TSHZ3. These altered interactions can disrupt the transcription of MYOCD, leading to disorganized smooth muscle layers in affected tissues, as evidenced by α-SMA immunohistochemistry (Kesdiren2024Heterozygous).

In zebrafish, the tshz3b gene, a homolog of TSHZ3, interacts with Hox proteins and TALE-class homeodomain proteins, such as Exd (Pbx) and Hth (Meis). These interactions are important for repressing the transcription of certain genes during hindbrain development, suggesting a role in integrating Hox and Wnt pathways (Erickson2011Zebrafish).
