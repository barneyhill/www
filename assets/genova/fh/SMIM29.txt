# SMIM29

## Overview
SMIM29 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 29, which is involved in various cellular processes, including endocytosis and potentially influencing anthropometric traits. The protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where specific mutations can impair its function (Tobys2020Inhibition). SMIM29 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where its expression levels are used in prognostic modeling (Yue2023Unraveling). Additionally, genetic variants of SMIM29 have been associated with height differences across different populations, highlighting its potential role in growth-related traits (Cho2021A).

## Clinical Significance
SMIM29 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, primarily through alterations in its expression levels and potential involvement in disease mechanisms. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), SMIM29 is part of a 10-gene signature used for prognostic modeling. This gene was found to be upregulated in ccRCC tumors, suggesting a role in tumor progression. However, its expression pattern differed in an Asian cohort compared to the TCGA-KIRC dataset, indicating possible population-specific expression differences (Yue2023Unraveling).

In the context of endocytosis, SMIM29 has been studied for its role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Mutations in the cytoplasmic tail of SMIM29, specifically at sites L54A/L55A and Y60A, significantly impair its uptake, highlighting the importance of these sites for its endocytic function. These findings suggest that alterations in SMIM29 could affect cellular trafficking processes, although the clinical implications of these mutations are not fully explored (Tobys2020Inhibition).

Additionally, SMIM29 has been associated with anthropometric traits, such as height, in genome-wide association studies. Genetic variants in SMIM29 have been linked to height differences in both Korean and European populations, indicating its potential role in growth-related traits (Cho2021A).
