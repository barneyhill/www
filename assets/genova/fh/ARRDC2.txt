# ARRDC2

## Overview
ARRDC2 (arrestin domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the arrestin family, which is primarily involved in cellular signaling and receptor regulation. The protein encoded by ARRDC2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including endocytosis, ubiquitination, and protein trafficking, and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm (Gordon2019Arrdc2). As a member of the arrestin-related trafficking (ART) protein family, ARRDC2 plays a significant role in modulating receptor desensitization and internalization, which are crucial for cellular responses to external stimuli (Gordon2019Arrdc2). The protein is also involved in interactions with HECT ubiquitin ligases and components of the ESCRT-III machinery, highlighting its role in cellular trafficking and protein degradation (Rauch2011Multiple). In addition to its cellular functions, ARRDC2 has clinical significance, particularly in the context of ovarian cancer, where its expression levels are associated with patient prognosis and immune-related processes (Zhang2021A; Zhang2022A).

## Function
ARRDC2 (arrestin domain containing 2) is a protein involved in regulating cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the context of skeletal muscle response to various stimuli. It is part of the arrestin family, which is known for modulating receptor desensitization and internalization, processes crucial for cellular signaling and response to external stimuli (Gordon2019Arrdc2). ARRDC2 is implicated in endocytosis and ubiquitination, influencing protein trafficking and degradation, and is active in the cytoplasm (Gordon2019Arrdc2).

In skeletal muscle, ARRDC2 expression is responsive to anabolic and catabolic stimuli. It is upregulated in atrophied skeletal muscle following dexamethasone administration, suggesting a potential role in growth regulation or as a readout of glucocorticoid receptor activation (Gordon2019Arrdc2). ARRDC2 expression is also associated with autophagy, a process involving the degradation of muscle proteins, as indicated by changes in the LC3 II/I ratio, a marker of autophagy activation (Gordon2019Arrdc2). The expression of ARRDC2 is reduced following nutrient consumption and mechanical overload, independent of mTORC1 activation, suggesting its role in muscle plasticity and mass regulation (Gordon2019Arrdc2). However, the specific function of ARRDC2 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Gordon2019Arrdc2).

## Clinical Significance
ARRDC2 has been implicated in the progression and prognosis of ovarian cancer. High expression levels of ARRDC2 are associated with poor overall survival in ovarian cancer patients, making it a potential independent prognostic risk factor (Zhang2021A; Zhang2022A). The gene's expression is positively correlated with advanced FIGO stages and varies among different racial groups, being higher in Asians compared to African Americans (Zhang2021A; Zhang2022A).

ARRDC2 is involved in immune-related processes and pathways, such as B cell and T cell signaling, which may contribute to the malignant progression and poor survival outcomes in ovarian cancer patients (Zhang2021A; Zhang2022A). Its expression is positively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells like CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, B cells, and dendritic cells, and with immune checkpoints such as PD1, PDL1, PDL2, and CTLA4, suggesting a role in immune evasion mechanisms (Zhang2021A; Zhang2022A).

ARRDC2 expression is negatively regulated by DNA methylation, with specific CpG sites showing hypermethylation in ovarian cancer tissues, which may contribute to differences in expression between normal and tumor tissues (Zhang2021A; Zhang2022A). This methylation pattern may influence the gene's role in cancer progression.

## Interactions
ARRDC2, a member of the arrestin-related trafficking (ART) protein family, is involved in various protein interactions. It interacts with HECT ubiquitin ligases, specifically WWP1, WWP2, and Nedd4, but not with Itch. These interactions were confirmed using yeast two-hybrid and GST coprecipitation assays, which demonstrated that ARRDC2 can coprecipitate with the WW domains of these ligases (Rauch2011Multiple). ARRDC2 also interacts with ALIX, a component of the ESCRT-III machinery, but not with Tsg101, indicating its role in cellular trafficking processes (Rauch2011Multiple).

In humans, ARRDC2 is associated with RNA splicing and processing complexes and is linked to the Set1C/COMPASS complex, which is involved in histone modification and gene expression regulation. These interactions suggest a role for ARRDC2 in RNA processing and protein degradation (Lee2023Comparative). ARRDC2 is also involved in the trafficking of β2 adrenergic receptors (β2ARs) by being recruited to internalized β2AR-Nedd4 complexes on endosomes, indicating its role in receptor trafficking and endosomal sorting (Han2012Distinct). No interactions with nucleic acids were reported for ARRDC2 in these studies (Rauch2011Multiple).
