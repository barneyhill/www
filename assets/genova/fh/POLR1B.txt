# POLR1B

## Overview
POLR1B is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase I subunit B, a critical component of the RNA polymerase I (Pol I) complex, which is primarily responsible for the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in eukaryotic cells. This subunit plays a vital role in the assembly and stability of the Pol I complex, contributing to the transcription of rRNA, a key process in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis (Zhao2021Structure; Dash2023rRNA). The POLR1B protein is integral to the core structure of Pol I, facilitating interactions with other subunits and ensuring the proper function of the enzyme during transcription (Zhao2021Structure). Mutations in POLR1B have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Treacher Collins Syndrome and non-small cell lung cancer, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Yang2019POLR1B; Sanchez2020POLR1B).

## Structure
The POLR1B gene encodes a subunit of human RNA polymerase I (hPol I), which is involved in the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The structure of hPol I, including the POLR1B subunit, has been elucidated using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a complex architecture composed of 13 subunits (Zhao2021Structure). The POLR1B subunit is part of the core structure of hPol I, contributing to the formation of the central DNA-binding cleft along with other core subunits (Zhao2021Structure).

The quaternary structure of hPol I includes a single-subunit stalk, which is a notable feature distinguishing it from yeast Pol I, which has a two-subunit stalk (Zhao2021Structure). The POLR1B subunit is integrated into this core, interacting with other subunits to stabilize the enzyme's structure and function during transcription (Daiß2022The).

The tertiary structure of hPol I, including POLR1B, is characterized by a more closed DNA-binding clamp compared to its yeast counterpart, which enhances its interaction with DNA during transcription elongation (Zhao2021Structure). This structural adaptation is crucial for the transcription of complex rDNA substrates in humans. The study of hPol I's structure has also mapped disease-associated mutations to specific regions, providing insights into the molecular basis of related pathologies (Zhao2021Structure).

## Function
POLR1B encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase I (Pol I), which is essential for the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the nucleolus, a critical step in ribosome biogenesis. This process is vital for protein synthesis and cellular growth, as rRNA forms the structural and functional core of ribosomes (Sanchez2020POLR1B; Dash2023rRNA). In healthy human cells, POLR1B, as part of the Pol I complex, is responsible for transcribing ribosomal DNA (rDNA) into pre-ribosomal RNA, which is then processed into mature rRNAs (Zhao2021Structure). This activity occurs in the nucleolus, where POLR1B helps maintain nucleolar structure and function through phase separation, ensuring the proper assembly of ribosomal subunits (Dash2023rRNA).

The proper function of POLR1B is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting cell proliferation. Disruption of POLR1B activity can lead to nucleolar stress and developmental abnormalities, highlighting its importance in normal cellular and organismal function (Sanchez2020POLR1B; Dash2023rRNA). POLR1B's role in ribosome biogenesis is particularly significant during embryonic development, where it supports the survival and migration of neural crest cells, which are essential for craniofacial development (Sanchez2020POLR1B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the POLR1B gene have significant clinical implications. POLR1B is associated with Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS) type 4, a rare craniofacial disorder. Pathogenic variants in POLR1B, such as c.3007C>T and c.2046T>A (p.Ser682Arg), have been identified in patients with TCS, leading to craniofacial abnormalities due to impaired ribosome biogenesis and increased apoptosis in neural crest cell precursors (Venturi2020How; Sanchez2020POLR1B). These mutations are thought to destabilize the bridge ɑ-helix of the POLR1B protein, disrupting its function and contributing to the disorder's phenotypic manifestations (Sanchez2020POLR1B).

In addition to its role in TCS, POLR1B is implicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The gene is upregulated in NSCLC, promoting cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis. Knockdown of POLR1B in lung cancer cells leads to increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yang2019POLR1B). POLR1B's interactions with key cancer regulators, such as MYC and NR4A1, further highlight its role in cancer progression (Yang2019POLR1B). These findings suggest that POLR1B could serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target in NSCLC (Yang2019POLR1B).

## Interactions
POLR1B, a subunit of RNA polymerase I, is involved in various protein interactions essential for its function in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription. It forms part of the core enzyme complex with other subunits, such as POLR1A, to facilitate the transcription of rRNA. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), POLR1B interacts with several key proteins, influencing cancer cell proliferation. Protein-protein interaction network analysis has identified significant interactions with proteins such as MYC, BOP1, DKC1, RRP12, IPO4, MTHFD2, CTPS1, GARS, and NOC2L, which are considered crucial regulators of NSCLC through their interactions with POLR1B (Yang2019POLR1B).

In addition to its role in cancer, POLR1B is recruited to CpG-rich genomic regions by a protein complex known as CP, which enhances its binding to specific DNA sequences. This recruitment is significant for transcription and ribosome synthesis, as CP facilitates the assembly of protein complexes necessary for these processes (Iuchi2019Lysinespecific). POLR1B's interactions are not limited to stable complexes; it also participates in more transient interactions that are crucial for its regulatory functions in transcription and cell proliferation.
