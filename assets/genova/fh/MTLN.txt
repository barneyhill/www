# MTLN

## Overview
The MTLN gene encodes mitoregulin, a mitochondrial microprotein that plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity. Mitoregulin is primarily localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it forms hexameric complexes that may function as channels or transporters, contributing to mitochondrial membrane processes such as calcium handling and membrane potential regulation (Linzer2024Mitoregulin). This protein interacts with cardiolipin, a phospholipid crucial for mitochondrial membrane structure, and NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase, influencing lipid metabolism and respiratory chain efficiency (Stein2024Mitoregulin; Chugunova2019LINC00116). Mitoregulin's activity is essential for energy homeostasis and protection against stress-induced mitochondrial damage, with implications for various physiological and pathological conditions, including kidney function and metabolic disorders (Averina2023KidneyRelated; Chugunova2019LINC00116).

## Structure
Mitoregulin (MTLN) is a mitochondrial microprotein encoded by the MTLN gene. The primary structure of MTLN consists of a 56-amino acid sequence, which is highly conserved among chordates (Chugunova2019LINC00116). The protein is localized in the mitochondria, specifically associating with the inner membrane (Chugunova2019LINC00116).

MTLN is known to form higher-order oligomeric complexes, predominantly as hexamers, suggesting a quaternary structure that may resemble a pore-like formation. This hexameric structure is supported by various experimental techniques, including co-immunoprecipitation, BN-PAGE, and simulated modeling, which indicate that MTLN primarily exists in a ~66 kDa complex (Linzer2024Mitoregulin). The hexameric formation is hypothesized to function as a channel or transporter within mitochondrial membranes (Linzer2024Mitoregulin).

The protein's interaction with cardiolipin, a unique phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, suggests a role in stabilizing lipid microdomains and influencing mitochondrial membrane integrity (Stein2024Mitoregulin). The presence of a tryptophan residue (Trp25) in the transmembrane domain may be crucial for MTLN's self-association and oligomerization (Linzer2024Mitoregulin). However, specific details on secondary and tertiary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The MTLN gene encodes a small peptide known as mitoregulin, which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function. Mitoregulin is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is involved in maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and supporting the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (Stein2024Mitoregulin; Chugunova2019LINC00116). It interacts with cardiolipin, a lipid essential for membrane structure, to prevent damaging transitions that compromise membrane integrity, thereby enhancing membrane elasticity and resistance to stress-induced damage (Stein2024Mitoregulin).

Mitoregulin also influences lipid metabolism by interacting with NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase, which indirectly stimulates complex I functioning and affects the lipid composition of the mitochondrial membrane (Chugunova2019LINC00116). This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly of respiratory chain supercomplexes, which are essential for efficient electron transfer and energy production (Chugunova2019LINC00116).

In healthy human cells, mitoregulin's activity is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis, linking respiration and lipid metabolism, and protecting against stress-induced mitochondrial damage (Stein2024Mitoregulin; Chugunova2019LINC00116).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the MTLN gene, which encodes the mitochondrial protein mitoregulin, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of kidney function, MTLN knockout mice exhibit age- and gender-dependent pathologies, such as vacuolar degeneration of renal proximal tubules in aged males and decreased glomerular filtration rate in aged females. These changes suggest that MTLN is crucial for maintaining normal kidney function, and its absence can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and kidney pathologies (Averina2023KidneyRelated).

Increased expression of MTLN has been associated with chronic kidney disease, where it may contribute to extracellular matrix deposition and kidney fibrosis. This suggests a potential compensatory mechanism in response to renal damage (Averina2023KidneyRelated). Additionally, MTLN is involved in lipid metabolism through its interaction with cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (Cyb5r3). Disruption of this interaction can lead to changes in lipid composition, which may be linked to metabolic disorders (Chugunova2019LINC00116).

Furthermore, larger copy number variant deletions involving the MTLN gene have been associated with accelerated progression of nephronophthisis-induced nephropathy, highlighting its potential role in the severity of this condition (Liu2023Two).

## Interactions
Mitoregulin (MTLN) is a mitochondrial microprotein that engages in various interactions influencing mitochondrial function. It is known to self-associate, forming homo-oligomeric complexes, potentially hexameric pore-like structures, which may play a role in mitochondrial membrane processes such as calcium handling and membrane potential regulation (Linzer2024Mitoregulin).

MTLN interacts with NADH cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (Cyb5r3), a protein involved in lipid metabolism and respiratory complex I function. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial lipid composition and respiratory efficiency (Chugunova2019LINC00116). MTLN's interaction with Cyb5r3 is suggested to stabilize the enzyme, preventing its degradation and supporting its role in fatty acid desaturation (Averina2023KidneyRelated).

MTLN also binds to cardiolipin, a unique phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, which may help protect against mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation and oxidative stress, particularly in cardiac tissues (Stein2024Mitoregulin). These interactions highlight MTLN's role in modulating mitochondrial membrane integrity and function, with implications for energy metabolism and cellular stress responses.
