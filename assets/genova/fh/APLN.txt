# APLN

## Overview
The APLN gene encodes the apelin protein, a bioactive peptide that serves as an endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Apelin is involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including cardiovascular regulation, fluid homeostasis, and metabolic balance. The protein is initially synthesized as a preproprotein and undergoes enzymatic processing to produce various active isoforms, with apelin-13 being the most potent. The apelinergic system, comprising apelin and its receptor, plays a crucial role in modulating blood pressure, glucose uptake, and neurogenesis, among other functions. Dysregulation of the APLN gene and its protein product is associated with several cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Arababadi2019APLNAPJ; Shin2017Apelinergic; Marsault2019The).

## Structure
The APLN gene encodes the apelin protein, which is initially expressed as a 77-amino acid preproprotein. This preproprotein includes a 22-residue N-terminal secretory signal peptide and a 55-residue C-terminal domain that contains the receptor-binding site (Shin2017Apelinergic). The apelin protein undergoes processing to produce various isoforms, including apelin-36, -17, and -13, with apelin-13 being the most potent (Shin2017Apelinergic). The processing is mediated by proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin (PCSK) enzymes, particularly PCSK3 (furin), which preferentially produces apelin-13 from apelin-55 (Shin2017Apelinergic).

The apelin protein's structure is characterized by specific motifs crucial for its function. The 'RPRL' motif at the N-terminus is essential for binding to the apelin receptor (AR), while the 'GPMPF' motif at the C-terminus is critical for Gα I activation and β-arrestin-mediated signaling (Shin2017Apelinergic). The C-terminal phenylalanine is particularly important for receptor interaction and influences signaling pathways (Shin2017Apelinergic). The apelin protein exhibits a β-turn structure in the RPRL motif, which is important for GPCR recognition (Shin2017Apelinergic). The flexible linker region between these motifs allows the C-terminal tail to sample various conformations, facilitating receptor binding (Shin2017Apelinergic). The apelin protein's interaction with membranes may enhance receptor interaction by increasing local peptide concentration and inducing structural changes (Shin2017Apelinergic).

## Function
The APLN gene encodes the apelin peptide, which functions as an endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor. In healthy human cells, the interaction between apelin and the APJ receptor activates several intracellular signaling pathways, including phospholipase C-β (PLCβ), which increases intracellular calcium levels. This activation can further stimulate the Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK pathways, as well as the JNK/IRS1/GSK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR/eNOS pathways, leading to the production of nitric oxide (NO) (Arababadi2019APLNAPJ).

The apelinergic system, which includes apelin and its receptor, is involved in various physiological processes such as cardiovascular regulation, fluid homeostasis, and metabolic balance. Apelin plays a role in reducing arterial blood pressure through a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism and is involved in glucose uptake by increasing the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3. It also facilitates neovascularization, reduces systemic venous tone, and promotes diuresis and inotropic effects (Arababadi2019APLNAPJ).

In the central nervous system, apelin is expressed in regions such as the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, cortex, and cerebellum, suggesting its involvement in neurogenesis, hormone release, and fluid homeostasis (Ivanov2022Distribution).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the APLN gene, which encodes the peptide apelin, are associated with several cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. In heart failure, both with reduced and preserved ejection fraction, the apelinergic system is implicated in myocardial hypertrophy, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Loss of apelin function can lead to impaired myocardial contractility and aggravated left ventricular injury post-myocardial infarction (Marsault2019The). In pulmonary hypertension, reduced apelin levels are linked to worsened vascular remodeling and increased right ventricular systolic pressures, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Alastalo2011Disruption; Chandra2011Disruption).

In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), decreased apelin expression is observed in patients, and its administration has been shown to improve right ventricular function and reduce symptoms in animal models (Alastalo2011Disruption; Andersen2011Apelin). Apelin also plays a role in regulating blood pressure and vascular homeostasis, with its administration shown to lower blood pressure in rodent models (Marsault2019The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of APLN in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.
