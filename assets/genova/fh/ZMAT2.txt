# ZMAT2

## Overview
ZMAT2 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger matrin-type 2 protein, which is primarily involved in RNA processing, particularly the splicing of pre-mRNA. This protein is a crucial component of the spliceosome complex, facilitating the removal of introns from primary gene transcripts. The zinc finger matrin-type 2 protein is categorized as a nuclear protein due to its predominant activity within the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in gene expression regulation and cellular function. It is particularly important in the context of epidermal biology, where it interacts with various components of the spliceosome and epigenetic regulators to influence cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation processes (Rotwein2020Zmat2; Tanis2018Splicing).

## Function
The ZMAT2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in RNA processing, particularly in the splicing of pre-mRNA. It is a component of the spliceosome complex, which is essential for the removal of introns from primary gene transcripts. ZMAT2 is involved in the activation of the U6 snRNP at the 5â€² splice site of introns, facilitating the splicing process (Rotwein2020Zmat2). In human epidermal keratinocytes, ZMAT2 associates with the pre-spliceosome, indicating its involvement in RNA processing and the selective splicing of specific transcripts related to cell adhesion and proliferation (Tanis2018Splicing).

ZMAT2 is also implicated in the regulation of epidermal differentiation. It interacts with a network of epigenetic regulators, maintaining epidermal cells in an undifferentiated, proliferative state. Silencing ZMAT2 in keratinocytes leads to increased expression of differentiation markers, suggesting its role in cell renewal and proliferation (Tanis2018Splicing). Additionally, ZMAT2 may act as a negative regulator of keratinocyte differentiation by potentially blocking the splicing of specific primary gene transcripts (Rotwein2020Zmat2). The protein's activity is primarily located in the nucleus, where it contributes to gene expression regulation and cellular function.

## Interactions
ZMAT2 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, primarily within the context of RNA splicing. It is associated with the pre-spliceosome in epidermal keratinocytes, where it interacts with components of the spliceosome, similar to its putative ortholog snu23 in yeast (Tanis2018Splicing). ZMAT2 is identified as an interactor of the B complex in the spliceosome, accompanying the core complex B component tri-snRNP U4/U6.U5. It may influence the activation of the Brr2 helicase, which is crucial for the unwinding of the U4/U6 duplex, a necessary step for spliceosome activation (Tanis2018Splicing).

ZMAT2 also selectively binds to specific transcripts involved in epidermal biology, such as ITGB1, DSP, DST, ROCK2, and AREG, indicating its role in regulating specific biological processes in epidermal cells (Tanis2018Splicing). The protein's interactions are not limited to the spliceosome; it also functionally interacts with several epigenetic regulators, including ING5, SMARCA5, BPTF, UHRF1, and BRD1, suggesting a joint role in mediating splicing and epigenetic control (Tanis2018Splicing). These interactions highlight ZMAT2's significance in the regulation of adhesion-related genes, which are essential for epidermal biology (Tanis2018Splicing).
