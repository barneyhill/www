# PEAK1

## Overview
PEAK1, or pseudopodium enriched atypical kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, migration, and proliferation. The PEAK1 protein is characterized by its atypical kinase domain, which deviates from traditional kinase structures, and functions primarily as a scaffold in signaling pathways. It plays a significant role in transmitting integrin-mediated extracellular matrix signals and is implicated in oncogenic processes, particularly in cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer. PEAK1's involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics and angiogenesis further underscores its importance in cellular physiology and development. Due to its role in cancer progression, PEAK1 is considered a potential therapeutic target (Wang2018Pseudopodiumenriched; Ha2018The; Huang2018PEAK1).

## Structure
The PEAK1 protein, also known as pseudopodium enriched atypical kinase 1, exhibits a unique molecular structure that distinguishes it from canonical kinases. Its pseudokinase domain maintains the typical kinase catalytic fold with a β-sheet-rich N-lobe and an α-helical-rich C-lobe, but includes additional insertions and modifications. Notably, the glycine-rich loop (G-loop) in PEAK1 deviates from the conserved GXGXXG motif, suggesting reduced flexibility and potential issues with nucleotide binding (Ha2018The).

PEAK1 features a closed nucleotide-binding site, occluded by a tyrosine residue, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, indicating it may not bind nucleotides (Ha2018The). The protein also contains a split helical dimerization (SHED) region, which facilitates dimerization through a large hydrophobic interface, a feature conserved with another NKF3 member, pragmin (Ha2018The).

PEAK1 acts as a scaffold in signaling pathways, with its structure allowing for interactions with SH2, SH3, and PTB domain-containing effectors. It is involved in oncogenic processes, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, where it interacts with CAMK2, enhancing its activation through a feed-forward mechanism (Yang2024Feedforward).

## Function
PEAK1 (pseudopodium enriched atypical kinase 1) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in transmitting integrin-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) signals, which are essential for cell movement and growth (Wang2018Pseudopodiumenriched). PEAK1 acts as a scaffold protein in growth factor signaling pathways, facilitating the phosphorylation process and creating binding sites for various kinases (Ha2018The). It is part of the new kinase family three (NKF3) and is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues, indicating its importance in normal physiology (Kelber2010PEAK1).

PEAK1 is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, particularly through its interaction with the transcription factor GATA2, which is crucial for the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) (Wang2018Pseudopodiumenriched). This interaction is essential for integrating cell adhesion and growth factor signals necessary for angiogenesis during vertebrate development (Wang2018Pseudopodiumenriched). PEAK1 also plays a role in cytoskeletal dynamics, influencing cell migration and proliferation by modulating signaling pathways such as Src-p130Cas-Crk-Paxillin and Ras-Raf-Erk (Kelber2010PEAK1). These functions highlight PEAK1's critical role in maintaining cellular processes and tissue development.

## Clinical Significance
PEAK1 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In colorectal cancer (CRC), PEAK1 is overexpressed and associated with poor survival outcomes. Its expression is regulated by the EGFR/KRas signaling axis and miR-181d, with high PEAK1 levels correlating with poor prognosis. Silencing PEAK1 inhibits CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Huang2018PEAK1).

In breast cancer, PEAK1 overexpression is linked to larger tumor size, higher grade, advanced stage, and chemotherapy resistance. Targeting PEAK1 can reduce tumor growth and metastasis, indicating its role in disease progression and drug resistance (Wang2021PEAK1).

PEAK1 also plays a significant role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. Its overexpression leads to a mesenchymal phenotype and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases, facilitating cancer cell invasion (Ding2018Overexpression).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), PEAK1 is essential for tumor growth and metastasis, with its knockdown reducing migration and invasion (AbuThuraia2020AXL). These findings underscore PEAK1's clinical significance in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PEAK1, also known as pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell signaling pathways. It acts as a scaffold in growth factor signaling pathways and is involved in cancer cell metastasis and proliferation. PEAK1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to growth factor activation, creating SH2 domain binding sites for proteins such as Shc1, Grb2, Csk, and Src-family kinases (Ha2018The).

PEAK1 interacts with Src family kinases (SFKs), which are necessary for the phosphorylation of tyrosine 665 (Tyr-665), a critical site for PEAK1's function in regulating focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration (Bristow2013Dynamic). The interaction with SFKs is essential for PEAK1's localization and function in focal adhesions, affecting cell migration and invasion (Bristow2013Dynamic).

In triple-negative breast cancer cells, PEAK1 is involved in the phosphorylation of paxillin (PXN) through its interaction with the CSK tyrosine kinase. This interaction is crucial for focal adhesion turnover and is modulated by AXL activity, which recruits PEAK1 to focal adhesions (AbuThuraia2020AXL). PEAK1 also interacts with the βPIX/GIT1/PAK1 complex, facilitating the disassembly of focal adhesion structures (AbuThuraia2020AXL).

PEAK1's role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer involves its interaction with ZEB1, where it acts as a common partner in pathways such as MAPK and CRK signaling (Agajanian2015Identification). These interactions highlight PEAK1's significance in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
