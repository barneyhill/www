# DGKI

## Overview
Diacylglycerol kinase iota (DGKI) is a gene that encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase iota (DGKι), a member of the diacylglycerol kinase family, which plays a crucial role in lipid signaling pathways. DGKι is primarily expressed in the brain and retina, where it is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal reorganization and focal adhesion dynamics through its interactions with small GTPases such as RhoC and Rac1. As a type IV diacylglycerol kinase, DGKι contains several functional domains, including a MARCKS domain, ankyrin repeats, and a PDZ-binding motif, which facilitate its catalytic activity and protein-protein interactions. The gene's expression and methylation status have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and pre-eclampsia, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (foley2015diacylglycerol; Ariff2019Analysis; Huang2020Overexpression; Etcheverry2014DGKI).

## Structure
Diacylglycerol kinase iota (DGKι) is a type IV diacylglycerol kinase primarily expressed in the brain and retina. The protein structure of DGKι includes several key domains: a MARCKS domain, four ankyrin repeats, and a PDZ-binding motif. The MARCKS domain is involved in phosphorylation, which affects the subcellular localization of DGKι, particularly in the presence of PKCα (foley2015diacylglycerol). The ankyrin repeats are essential for the maximal catalytic activity of DGKι, influencing the phosphorylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) (foley2015diacylglycerol). The PDZ-binding motif allows DGKι to interact with PDZ-domain containing proteins, such as syntrophins, which localize DGKι presynaptically to regulate neurotransmitter release (foley2015diacylglycerol).

DGKι is involved in actin cytoskeletal reorganization by regulating the activities of RhoC and Rac1 (foley2015diacylglycerol). The catalytic domain of DGKι is highly conserved and includes a catalytic and an accessory subunit (foley2015diacylglycerol). The C1-domains in DGKι serve as protein-protein interaction domains, facilitating membrane localization and activation of the kinase (foley2015diacylglycerol). DGKι is alternatively spliced, which increases the diversity of its protein forms (foley2015diacylglycerol).

## Function
Diacylglycerol kinase iota (DGKI) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in actin cytoskeletal reorganization by regulating the activities of RhoC and Rac1, which are part of the Rho family of small GTPases. These GTPases are crucial for actin reorganization, essential for cell migration and other physiological processes dependent on cell motility (foley2015diacylglycerol). DGKI specifically stimulates RhoC activity through a direct interaction, which is stronger with RhoC than RhoA, possibly due to differences in their hypervariable C-terminal regions (foley2015diacylglycerol). 

DGKI is involved in the localization of focal adhesions, which are crucial for cell attachment and signaling. In DGKI-null cells, there is a decrease in Rac1 and RhoC activity, leading to changes in cell morphology, such as elongation and a spindle-like appearance (foley2015diacylglycerol). DGKI also influences the localization of focal adhesions, as DGKI-null cells show paxillin accumulation at the tips of processes rather than an even distribution along the cell perimeter (foley2015diacylglycerol). 

DGKI is primarily expressed in the brain and retina, where it regulates lipid signaling within the nucleus and at the plasma membrane (foley2015diacylglycerol).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DGKI gene have been implicated in several cancers. In gastric cancer, DGKI is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and high levels of DGKI expression are associated with poor prognosis. This overexpression correlates with advanced tumor grade, stage, and T classification, and is considered an independent risk factor for patient survival. The MAPK signaling pathway, which is enriched in cases of DGKI overexpression, is suggested to play a role in cancer development (Huang2020Overexpression).

In glioblastoma, the methylation status of the DGKI promoter has prognostic value, particularly in patients with MGMT-methylated tumors. DGKI methylation status can stratify patients into groups with significant differences in overall survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Etcheverry2014DGKI).

In thyroid cancer, low expression levels of DGKI are associated with more advanced stages and poorer prognosis. Conversely, higher DGKI expression is linked to better survival outcomes, suggesting a protective role in this context (Bai2022Key).

DGKI has also been identified as a candidate risk gene for pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy-related disorder. Its involvement in vascular smooth muscle contraction and hypertension suggests a potential role in the pathophysiology of this condition (Ariff2019Analysis).

## Interactions
Diacylglycerol kinase iota (DGKI) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in actin cytoskeletal reorganization. DGKI interacts robustly with RhoC, a small GTPase, through a specific binding site in its C-terminal region, which is crucial for its function in cytoskeletal dynamics (foley2015diacylglycerol). This interaction is direct, as DGKI binds strongly to RhoC wild type compared to its mutants (foley2015diacylglycerol). DGKI also interacts with PAK1, a serine/threonine kinase, which is suggested to be a direct association, as evidenced by binding assays (foley2015diacylglycerol). 

While DGKI does not directly bind to Rac1, it indirectly regulates Rac1 activity, potentially through guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) or by influencing PAK1 activity, which in turn affects Rac1 signaling (foley2015diacylglycerol). DGKI's interaction with PAK1 may help localize active PAK1 to the membrane, impacting Rac1-GAPs and Rac1-GEFs, thereby modulating Rac1 activity (foley2015diacylglycerol). These interactions highlight DGKI's role in modulating the activities of RhoC and Rac1, which are essential for actin cytoskeletal reorganization and focal adhesion dynamics.
