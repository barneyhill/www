# GAN

## Overview
The GAN gene encodes gigaxonin, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular organization and function, particularly within the nervous system. Gigaxonin is a member of the BTB/Kelch protein family, characterized by its involvement in protein-protein interactions and cytoskeletal organization. It functions as a substrate adaptor for an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the degradation of specific proteins to maintain the stability and organization of intermediate filaments and microtubules. This process is crucial for neuronal maintenance and function. Additionally, gigaxonin is involved in regulating autophagy and the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, further underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and neurodevelopment. Mutations in the GAN gene are linked to Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN), a severe neurodegenerative disorder, highlighting the clinical significance of gigaxonin in maintaining neuronal integrity (Cleveland2009Gigaxonin; Mussche2013Restoration; Bomont2000The).

## Structure
Gigaxonin, encoded by the GAN gene, is a protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains an N-terminal BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, a centrally located conserved BACK domain, and six kelch motifs in the C-terminal region (Bomont2000The; Mussche2013Restoration). The BTB domain is involved in dimerization and interacts with the E3 ligase cullin3 (Cul3), facilitating the ubiquitination process (Boizot2014The; Renganathan2022Gigaxonin). The kelch domains form a β-propeller structure, which is crucial for substrate binding, including interactions with microtubule-associated proteins and intermediate filaments (Mussche2013Restoration; Bomont2000The).

Gigaxonin is part of the BTB/Kelch protein family, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and cytoskeletal organization (Bomont2000The). Post-translational modifications, such as O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification, are essential for its function, linking metabolism to intermediate filament proteostasis (CHEN2019Glycosylation). Mutations in the GAN gene can lead to structural instability, affecting the protein's half-life and function, which is implicated in giant axonal neuropathy (Boizot2014The; Xu2020Identification).

## Function
The GAN gene encodes the protein gigaxonin, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the organization of intermediate filaments (IFs) in various cell types, including neurons. Gigaxonin functions as a substrate adaptor for an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the proteasome-dependent degradation of specific proteins, such as microtubule-associated proteins MAP1B, MAP8, and the tubulin folding chaperone TBCB. This process is essential for maintaining the stability and proper organization of IFs, which is vital for neuronal maintenance and function (Cleveland2009Gigaxonin; Mussche2013Restoration).

In addition to its role in IF organization, gigaxonin is involved in the regulation of autophagy. It controls the turnover of ATG16L1, a protein crucial for autophagosome formation, by promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This regulation ensures proper phagophore expansion during autophagy, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and survival (Scrivo2019Gigaxonin).

Gigaxonin is also implicated in the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, where it regulates the degradation of the Ptch receptor, influencing neuronal and muscle fate specification (Arribat2019Sonic). These functions highlight gigaxonin's critical role in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing neurodegenerative disorders.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GAN gene, which encodes the protein gigaxonin, are responsible for Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN), a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of intermediate filaments within cells, leading to enlarged axons with disordered microtubules and intermediate filaments. The disease typically manifests in early childhood with symptoms such as muscle weakness, gait disturbances, and sensory loss, progressing to severe motor impairment and often resulting in early death (Mahammad2013Giant; Mussche2013Restoration).

GAN is associated with a variety of mutations in the GAN gene, including deletions, insertions, and both missense and nonsense mutations. These mutations disrupt the normal function of gigaxonin, leading to impaired degradation of microtubule-associated proteins and intermediate filaments, which contributes to the pathological features of the disease (Bomont2000The; Mussche2013Restoration). Specific mutations, such as R293X and 1502+1G.T, have been identified in certain populations and are linked to severe clinical phenotypes, including white matter abnormalities and neurological symptoms (Demir2005Giant). Currently, there is no cure for GAN, and treatment is primarily symptomatic, though gene therapy is being explored as a potential therapeutic option (Shirakaki2022Genetic).

## Interactions
Gigaxonin, encoded by the GAN gene, is known to interact with various proteins and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), playing a significant role in cellular processes. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase adapter, promoting the degradation of cytoskeletal intermediate filament proteins, such as peripherin and neurofilament proteins, which are crucial for maintaining neuronal structure and function (Shi2019Kelchlike).

In the context of Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN), gigaxonin has been shown to interact with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein involved in RNA splicing, transport, and stabilization. This interaction suggests a novel role for gigaxonin in RNA biology, potentially influencing stress granule formation and RNA processing (Phillips2024Gigaxonin). The gigaxonin interactome is enriched with RBPs, comprising 40% of all identified interactors, indicating its involvement in processes such as cytoplasmic translation, splicing, ribosome biogenesis, translation initiation, and mRNA stabilization (Phillips2024Gigaxonin).

In GAN patient-derived neural progenitor cells, gigaxonin mRNA (KLHL16) was found to associate with 18 RBPs, with five of these proteins, including TDP-43 and PCBP2, also interacting with the gigaxonin protein itself. This suggests that mutations in gigaxonin may alter these interactions, potentially affecting neuronal homeostasis (Phillips2024Gigaxonin).
