# HEATR5A

## Overview
HEATR5A is a gene that encodes the HEAT repeat containing 5A protein, which is characterized by the presence of HEAT repeats, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and intracellular transport, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting a role in coordinating cellular activities across these compartments. HEATR5A has been implicated in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related condition, due to its significant overexpression in affected individuals (JacoboBaca2020Proteomic). The protein's ability to form multiprotein complexes and its involvement in membrane trafficking further underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Marmorale2023Two). Despite its recognized roles, the specific functions of HEATR5A in normal cellular physiology remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
HEATR5A (HEAT repeat containing 5A) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in facilitating protein-protein interactions. The HEAT repeats, which are characteristic motifs of this protein, enable it to participate in complex cellular functions. HEATR5A is implicated in processes such as cell cycle regulation and intracellular transport, indicating its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, suggesting a role in coordinating activities between these cellular compartments.

In the context of disease, HEATR5A has been identified as overexpressed in preeclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure during pregnancy. In a study examining the proteomic profile of preeclampsia, HEATR5A showed a significant fold change of 179.46 in women who developed the condition compared to those with normotensive pregnancies. This overexpression suggests a potential involvement in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, possibly through its roles in vascular remodeling, oxidative stress, immunity, inflammation, cellular development, and cell cycle regulation (JacoboBaca2020Proteomic). However, the specific function of HEATR5A in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
HEATR5A, a human protein characterized by HEAT repeats, is involved in forming multiprotein complexes through its interactions with other proteins. In humans, HEATR5A is predicted to interact with proteins such as Aftiphilin and Clba1. These interactions are facilitated by a common molecular binding interface that is similar to the one found in yeast, suggesting a conserved binding mechanism across species (Marmorale2023Two). The interactions involve the C-termini of HEATR5A and HEATR5B with Aftiphilin and Clba1, utilizing three short alpha-helical regions analogous to those in yeast proteins (Marmorale2023Two).

HEATR5A is also implicated in membrane trafficking, particularly in the adaptor protein complex-1 (AP1) mediated membrane traffic. While specific interactions of HEATR5A with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is suggested that HEATR5A, like its homolog HEATR5B, may use a similar mechanism to bind fast-evolving co-factors, indicating multiple roles in eukaryotic cells (Marmorale2023Two). These interactions highlight the potential of HEATR5A to participate in various cellular processes by forming distinct biochemical complexes with mutually exclusive binding partners.
