# GNRH2

## Overview
GNRH2 is a gene that encodes the gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2 (GnRH2), a decapeptide hormone involved in various physiological processes. Unlike its counterpart GnRH1, which primarily regulates gonadotropin secretion, GnRH2 is not a major regulator of this process but is implicated in modulating reproductive behavior and energy balance. The GnRH2 protein is characterized by its unique sequence and structural properties, which confer a higher stability and distinct receptor binding affinity compared to GnRH1. It interacts with its specific receptor, GNRHR2, to initiate signaling pathways, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). GnRH2 is expressed in both central and peripheral tissues, such as the brain, kidney, bone marrow, and prostate, and is involved in diverse signaling pathways that suggest roles in coordinating reproductive behavior and potentially other physiological processes (Desaulniers2017Expression).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the GnRH2 protein is characterized by its decapeptide sequence: pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-His-Gly-Trp-Tyr-Pro-Gly-NH2. This sequence differs from GnRH1 by three amino acids at positions 5, 7, and 8, which are His, Trp, and Tyr, respectively (Desaulniers2017Expression; Kim2012Molecular). These differences contribute to a 70% sequence identity with GnRH1 and result in a more negatively charged and slightly bulkier structure. The N-terminal and C-terminal residues are crucial for receptor binding and activation (Desaulniers2017Expression).

Structurally, GnRH2 adopts a β-turn conformation similar to GnRH1 but exists in a preconfigured conformation, reducing the need for extensive conformational changes for receptor activation. This preconfigured state may enhance its stability, making it less sensitive to peptidases and increasing its stability by six-fold compared to GnRH1 (Desaulniers2017Expression). The GnRH2 protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 20p13, and its expression is noted in various tissues, including the midbrain, kidney, bone marrow, and prostate (Desaulniers2017Expression; White1998Second). The presence of splice variant isoforms has been suggested, with tissue-specific processing observed in different regions (White1998Second).

## Function
GNRH2, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2, is a gene that encodes a decapeptide hormone involved in various physiological processes in humans. Unlike its counterpart GnRH1, which primarily regulates gonadotropin secretion, GnRH2 is not a major regulator of this process. Instead, it is implicated in modulating reproductive behavior and energy balance. In humans, GnRH2 is expressed in the brain, particularly in the caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and amygdala, as well as in peripheral tissues such as the kidney, bone marrow, and prostate (Desaulniers2017Expression).

GnRH2 is involved in signaling pathways that include the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), specifically ERK 1/2 and p38 MAPK, in a prolonged manner. This signaling is distinct from GnRH1, which transiently activates ERK 1/2 and c-Src (Desaulniers2017Expression). The hormone is also suggested to play a role in testicular function, where it may regulate spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis by influencing testosterone secretion from Leydig cells (Desaulniers2017Expression).

The presence of GnRH2 in various tissues and its involvement in diverse signaling pathways suggest it has a role in coordinating reproductive behavior and possibly other physiological processes, although its exact functions in healthy human cells are not fully understood (Desaulniers2017Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GNRH2 gene have been implicated in various reproductive cancers, including prostate, breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. In prostate cancer, GNRH2 expression is regulated by androgens, and its levels are significantly reduced following androgen ablation therapy. However, GNRH2 expression can be restored with synthetic androgen treatment, suggesting its role in androgen-dependent tumor growth (SISSUNG2023GNRH2Polymorphism; Darby2007Expression). Despite its expression in prostate tissues, the A16V polymorphism in GNRH2 does not significantly impact progression-free survival or overall survival in patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (SISSUNG2023GNRH2Polymorphism).

In breast cancer, GNRH2 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues and is associated with poorer prognosis. It has anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects, potentially reversing tamoxifen insensitivity (Desaulniers2024Role). In ovarian cancer, GNRH2 is overexpressed in malignant tumors and has shown anti-proliferative effects, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent (Desaulniers2024Role). The presence of GNRH2 and its receptor in these cancers indicates that they could be novel targets for cancer treatment (Desaulniers2024Role).

## Interactions
GNRH2, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2, interacts with its specific receptor, GNRHR2, to initiate various signaling pathways. This interaction is highly selective, with GNRH2 showing a 24-fold greater binding affinity for GNRHR2 compared to GNRHR1. In COS-1 cells overexpressing porcine GNRHR2 cDNA, GNRH2 stimulates inositol phosphate (IP) production with an EC50 of 0.5 nM, indicating a strong interaction and signaling capability (Desaulniers2017Expression).

GNRH2 also activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), specifically ERK 1/2 and p38 MAPK, in a prolonged manner, which differs from the transient activation by GNRH1. This suggests distinct signaling pathways are engaged upon GNRH2 binding to its receptor (Desaulniers2017Expression).

In the context of cancer, GNRH2 and its receptor are expressed in various reproductive cancer cells, where GNRH2 analogs inhibit cell proliferation. This interaction is independent of GNRHR1, suggesting a unique role for GNRHR2 in mediating these effects. GNRH2's anti-proliferative effects involve the inhibition of ribosomal phosphoproteins and increased metalloproteinase production, indicating complex interactions with cellular signaling pathways (Desaulniers2017Expression).
