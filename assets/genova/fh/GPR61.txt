# GPR61

## Overview
GPR61 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 61, a member of the class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is primarily expressed in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in neuronal signaling. GPR61 is involved in the constitutive activation of the cAMP signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell survival and memory maintenance. The receptor's structure, particularly its extracellular loop 2, is integral to its function, influencing its constitutive activity and interactions with other proteins. GPR61 has been implicated in several metabolic and neurological conditions, such as obesity and mood disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Watkins2020Orphan; Nambu2011Characterization; Lees2023Ana).

## Structure
The GPR61 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a structure typical of class A GPCRs, which includes seven transmembrane helices. The active state of GPR61 has been elucidated using cryo-electron microscopy at a resolution of 3.5 Å, revealing a conformation similar to other active-state class A GPCRs (Lees2023Ana). The extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) forms a lid-like structure over the orthosteric pocket, stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys115 and Cys195 (Lees2023Ana). The orthosteric pocket is small and discontinuous, framed by transmembrane helices TM1, TM2, TM3, and TM7, and bisected by ECL2 (Lees2023Ana).

GPR61 lacks key ligand-interacting residues found in other biogenic amine receptors but retains a conserved Phe304 (Lees2023Ana). The receptor's constitutive activity is linked to residues near its N terminus, with Val19 playing a key role, although the initial 44 residues are unresolved in the structure (Lees2023An). A unique disulfide bond between Cys299 and Cys333 may constrain the movements of TM6 and TM7, influencing receptor modulation (Lees2023An).

Post-translational modification of GPR61 includes N-glycosylation at N12, which affects the protein's subcellular expression but is not essential for cell surface expression (Kozielewicz2017N‐glycosylation). GPR61 shares sequence similarity with histamine, adrenergic, serotonin, and dopamine receptors and is phylogenetically closer to melatonin receptors (Kozielewicz2017N‐glycosylation).

## Function
GPR61 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in neuronal signaling. It is primarily expressed in the brain, including regions such as the caudate, putamen, thalamus, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and midbrain (Watkins2020Orphan). GPR61 is involved in the constitutive activation of the cAMP signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes (Muroi2017GPR62; Nie2023Specific). This receptor displays constitutive Gs signaling activity, leading to elevated levels of cAMP, a secondary messenger that influences numerous cellular functions (Watkins2020Orphan).

In neuronal cells, GPR61 is implicated in mediating plasmalogens-induced activation of ERK and Akt signaling pathways, which are essential for cell survival and memory maintenance (Hossain2016Neuronal). The receptor may form heterodimers with other GPCRs to transduce signaling, potentially affecting neuronal cell responses (Hossain2016Neuronal). GPR61 also interacts with melatonin receptor MT2, forming heteromers that modulate signaling pathways, which may influence mood and affective disorders (Watkins2020Orphan).

The structural configuration of GPR61, particularly its extracellular loop 2, is crucial for its constitutive activity, suggesting that its molecular structure is integral to its function in healthy human cells (Nie2023Specific).

## Clinical Significance
GPR61, a G protein-coupled receptor, has been implicated in several metabolic and neurological conditions. Research on GPR61-deficient mice has shown that the absence of this receptor leads to hyperphagia and obesity, suggesting its role in regulating food intake and body weight. These mice also exhibit increased body weight, visceral fat, and elevated plasma leptin and insulin levels, indicating a potential link between GPR61 and metabolic disorders such as obesity and hyperinsulinemia (Nambu2011Characterization). 

Alterations in GPR61 expression have also been associated with mood disorders. GPR61-deficient mice show lower mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hypothalamus, a factor known to contribute to mood disorders, suggesting a possible connection between GPR61 and affective disorders (Watkins2020Orphan). 

Additionally, GPR61's promoter hypermethylation has been linked to type 2 diabetes in humans, indicating that changes in its expression may contribute to this condition (Oishi2017Orphan). The receptor's constitutive activity and its interactions with other signaling pathways further highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for various metabolic and psychiatric conditions (Davenport2013International).

## Interactions
GPR61, a G protein-coupled receptor, engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing its signaling functions. It forms heteromeric complexes with the melatonin MT2 receptor in living cells, as demonstrated by Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions modulate the MT2 receptor's ability to recruit ß-arrestin2, although they do not affect the MT2 receptor's inhibition of cAMP production (Oishi2017Orphan). GPR61 also constitutively recruits ß-arrestin2, as observed through confocal microscopy, which shows a change in ß-arrestin2 staining from diffuse to punctuate intracellular staining, indicating co-localization in endosomes (Oishi2017Orphan).

In structural studies, GPR61 has been shown to interact with G proteins, specifically Gαs, to stimulate cyclic AMP-mediated signaling. An inverse agonist compound can bind to an intracellular allosteric pocket of GPR61, preventing Gαs binding by remodeling the protein structure (Lees2023An). The receptor's constitutive activity is linked to its N-terminal residues, and it lacks an ionic lock and sodium-interacting residues, which are features that stabilize the inactive state in other GPCRs (Lees2023Ana). These interactions highlight GPR61's role in complex signaling pathways and its potential as a target for pharmacological modulation.
