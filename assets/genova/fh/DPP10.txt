# DPP10

## Overview
DPP10 is a gene that encodes the protein dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 10, which is a member of the S9B family of serine proteases. Despite its classification, the DPP10 protein is enzymatically inactive due to a substitution in its catalytic triad. It is primarily known for its role as an auxiliary subunit in modulating the function of voltage-gated potassium channels, particularly the Kv4 subfamily, which are crucial for neuronal signaling. The protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes a beta-propeller domain and an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold, and it undergoes significant post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. DPP10 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, adrenal gland, and pancreas, and is implicated in several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as conditions like asthma. Its interactions with potassium channels and potential involvement in disease pathways make it a subject of interest for therapeutic research (Bezerra2015Structure; QI2003Cloning).

## Structure
The DPP10 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains and features. It consists of 796 amino acids and is encoded by a 2583-bp cDNA sequence (QI2003Cloning). The protein structure includes a beta-propeller domain (residues 82-517) with eight blades and an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold (residues 517-679 and 707-796), along with a small extended arm formed by three helices (residues 679-707) (Bezerra2015Structure). 

DPP10 lacks enzymatic activity due to the replacement of the catalytic serine with glycine, although it retains other active-site residues such as aspartate and histidine (QI2003Cloning). The protein forms a symmetric dimer with a total buried surface area of 7300 Å², primarily involving residues from the beta-propeller and hydrolase domains (Bezerra2015Structure). 

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, with six N-glycosylation sites, five of which are located in the beta-propeller domain (Bezerra2015Structure). Glycosylation is crucial for proper cell surface sorting and the formation of the ternary channel complex (Bezerra2015Structure). DPP10 is expressed in multiple splice variant isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (QI2003Cloning).

## Function
Dipeptidyl peptidase 10 (DPP10) is a protein that plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of voltage-gated potassium channels, specifically the Kv4 subfamily, in neurons. Although DPP10 is enzymatically inactive due to the substitution of a catalytic serine with glycine, it significantly influences the electrophysiological properties of these channels. It accelerates the activation and inactivation of Kv4.3 channel gating, which is essential for the propagation of action potentials, firing frequency, and synaptic integration in neurons (Bezerra2015Structure).

DPP10 is expressed in the brain, adrenal gland, and pancreas, suggesting its involvement in both neuronal signaling and potential regulation of hormone secretion (Bezerra2015Structure). The protein is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it forms a ternary complex with Kv4 channels and KChIPs, modulating the channels' electrophysiological properties (Bezerra2015Structure). Glycosylation of DPP10 is necessary for its proper cell surface expression and the formation of this complex, highlighting its role in cellular localization and function (Bezerra2015Structure). DPP10's malfunction is associated with neurodegenerative conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Bezerra2015Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DPP10 gene have been associated with several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. DPP10 is linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, and fronto-temporal dementia. These associations highlight its importance in cognitive function and neuronal health (Bezerra2015Structure).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, DPP10 has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Copy number variations (CNVs) involving duplications of the DPP10 gene have been identified in patients with ASD, although the pathogenicity of these duplications remains uncertain. Some studies suggest that these duplications might be benign polymorphisms, particularly in certain populations, such as the Southern Chinese (Liu2022Chromosomal; Mak2017Use). Despite this, the potential role of DPP10 in ASD susceptibility cannot be entirely ruled out, as it may still confer some risk for ASD and related disorders (Mak2017Use).

DPP10 is also associated with asthma, with polymorphisms in the gene linked to the condition. Its expression in the brain, adrenal gland, and pancreas suggests it may serve as a marker in certain malignant states, such as colorectal cancer (Bezerra2015Structure).

## Interactions
Dipeptidyl peptidase 10 (DPP10) is known for its interactions with voltage-gated potassium channels, particularly the Kv4 subfamily. DPP10 forms a ternary complex with Kv4 channels and KChIPs, which is essential for regulating A-type potassium currents in neurons (Bezerra2015Structure). This interaction accelerates the activation and inactivation of channel gating, influencing the electrophysiological properties of the channels (Bezerra2015Structure).

DPP10 can also form heterodimers with DPP6, supported by the compatibility of the b-propeller loop region, although these interactions are weaker compared to those of DPP4, as DPP10 forms fewer hydrogen bonds and no salt bridges (Bezerra2015Structure). Glycosylation of DPP10 is crucial for its cell surface expression and dimer formation, with specific glycosylation sites stabilizing the dimer interface (Bezerra2015Structure).

In flies, the DPP10 ortholog acts as an ancillary subunit of Kv4 channels and possesses peptidase activity, forming complexes with these channels to modulate their function. This interaction alters the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation, as well as the kinetics of inactivation and recovery (Shiina2016Fly). Despite these interactions, the fly DPP10's enzymatic and channel-regulatory functions are independent at the molecular level (Shiina2016Fly). There is no evidence of DPP10 interacting with nucleic acids in the provided context.
