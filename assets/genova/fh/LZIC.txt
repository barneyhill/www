# LZIC

## Overview
The LZIC gene encodes the leucine zipper and CTNNBIP1 domain-containing protein, which is primarily involved in regulating cell cycle transitions and maintaining genomic stability. This protein is characterized by its N-terminal coiled-coil domain and C-terminal ICAT-like domain, although it does not interact with β-catenin, distinguishing it from other ICAT proteins (skalka2020molecular; Skalka2019Leucine). LZIC plays a critical role in the G2/M checkpoint, particularly in response to DNA damage, and is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, DNA repair, and mRNA splicing (skalka2020molecular; Skalka2019Leucine). The protein's interactions with components of the spliceosome and other regulatory proteins suggest its involvement in RNA processing and signal transduction (skalka2020molecular). Clinically, alterations in LZIC expression are associated with cancer prognosis, with reduced levels linked to poor outcomes in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker (skalka2020molecular; Skalka2019Leucine).

## Structure
The LZIC protein is composed of 190 amino acids and features two primary domains: an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal ICAT-like domain (skalka2020molecular; Skalka2019Leucine). The coiled-coil domain is suggested to facilitate DNA binding, while the ICAT-like domain, despite its name, does not interact with β-catenin, distinguishing it from the canonical ICAT protein (skalka2020molecular; Skalka2019Leucine). 

The protein sequence of LZIC is highly conserved across species, with a 94% sequence homology between humans and mice, indicating the importance of its structure for functionality (skalka2020molecular). The long-alpha hairpin domain, located between residues 10 and 34, is particularly conserved, suggesting a crucial role in the protein's function (skalka2020molecular). 

Alternative splicing of LZIC results in different isoforms, which can significantly alter the protein's structure and function. For example, isoform C shows a shift in the long-alpha hairpin domain, potentially leading to its loss, while isoform D loses a substantial portion of its C-terminus, affecting the ICAT domain (skalka2020molecular). These structural variations may indicate functional divergence among the isoforms.

## Function
The LZIC gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle transitions, particularly at the G2/M checkpoint, in response to DNA damage such as ionizing radiation (IR). In healthy human cells, LZIC is involved in maintaining genome stability by ensuring proper checkpoint control, preventing premature progression through the G2/M transition into mitosis, which could otherwise lead to chromosome loss and aneuploidy (Skalka2019Leucine). 

LZIC is associated with the regulation of the mitosis-promoting factor (MPF) complex, which includes cyclin B1 and CDC2, and is crucial for the proper execution of IR-induced signaling (Skalka2019Leucine). The protein is also implicated in transcription control, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression, with potential involvement in mRNA splicing via the spliceosome and ribonucleoprotein biogenesis (skalka2020molecular). 

LZIC's role extends to the regulation of signaling pathways, including MYC and WNT, which are important for cell proliferation and differentiation (skalka2020molecular). The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with various proteins involved in transcription regulation and cellular stress responses (skalka2020molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the LZIC gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. Reduced expression of LZIC is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including clear renal cell carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors, where decreased LZIC levels correlate with lower patient survival times (skalka2020molecular; Skalka2019Leucine). In neuroblastoma, deletions in chromosome section 1p, which often include LZIC, are linked to poor outcomes (skalka2020molecular). 

LZIC loss leads to genome instability, characterized by premature release from the G2/M checkpoint, increasing the risk of chromosome loss and aneuploidy, which are indicators of tumorigenesis (skalka2020molecular; Skalka2019Leucine). This instability is particularly relevant in the context of ionizing radiation (IR), as LZIC-deficient cells show increased sensitivity to IR, suggesting a role in IR-induced tumorigenesis (skalka2020molecular).

In osteosarcoma, LZIC expression is reduced, while in pancreatic cancer, increased LZIC expression correlates with lymph node involvement (skalka2020molecular). These findings highlight the potential of LZIC as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
The LZIC protein is involved in various interactions with other proteins, suggesting its role in multiple cellular processes. It has been identified as interacting with components of the spliceosome, indicating a potential function in RNA processing (skalka2020molecular). LZIC interacts with several proteins involved in ribonucleoprotein biogenesis and anatomical structure development, such as neuronal growth (skalka2020molecular). 

A yeast-2-hybrid analysis identified several LZIC interactors, including zinc finger proteins ZNF558 and ZNF3, histone-arginine methyltransferase CARM1, and heat shock protein HSPA5 (skalka2020molecular). These interactions suggest LZIC's involvement in transcription regulation and the unfolded protein response. 

LZIC's interactome is enriched for domains involved in RNA processing and signal transduction, such as helicase domains and RNA recognition motifs (skalka2020molecular). It also interacts with proteins like CDK8, CDK19, and cyclin C, which are part of the mediator complex involved in RNA polymerase II regulation (skalka2020molecular). 

Despite these findings, LZIC does not interact with β-catenin, a key player in WNT signaling, suggesting a non-canonical role in this pathway (skalka2020molecular).
