# PIGA

## Overview
The PIGA gene is a critical component in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are essential for attaching proteins to the cell membrane. It encodes the PIG-A protein, a catalytic subunit of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex, which facilitates the initial step of GPI anchor biosynthesis by transferring N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol. This process is vital for the proper localization and function of various proteins involved in cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and protein sorting (TarailoGraovac2015The; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). Mutations in the PIGA gene can lead to significant clinical conditions, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizure syndrome 2, due to deficiencies in GPI-anchored proteins (Neuhofer2020A; Ware1994Mutations).

## Structure


## Function
The PIGA gene encodes a protein that is a catalytic subunit of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex, which is involved in the first step of GPI anchor biosynthesis. This process occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, where PIGA facilitates the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI), forming GlcNAc-PI, the first intermediate in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway (TarailoGraovac2015The; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). 

The GPI anchors are crucial for attaching proteins to the cell membrane, which is essential for various cellular functions, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and protein sorting (Wu2020The). In healthy human cells, the proper function of the PIGA gene ensures the correct anchoring of these proteins, which play significant roles in processes such as enzyme activity and cell signaling (TarailoGraovac2015The). Mutations in the PIGA gene can lead to deficiencies in GPI-anchored proteins, resulting in a range of clinical manifestations due to the improper localization of these proteins (TarailoGraovac2015The). The absence or malfunction of GPI-anchored proteins due to PIGA mutations can result in severe developmental and physiological abnormalities (Wu2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGA gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a well-known disorder linked to somatic mutations in PIGA, leading to a deficiency in GPI-anchored proteins on blood cells. This results in complement-mediated hemolysis, as seen in the absence of complement inhibitors like CD59 on red blood cells (Takeda1993Deficiency; Ware1994Mutations).

Germline mutations in PIGA can cause multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizure syndrome 2 (MCAHS2), characterized by early-onset epilepsy, hypotonia, and developmental delays. These mutations often result in severe neurological phenotypes due to impaired GPI anchor biosynthesis, affecting the expression of crucial proteins for neurodevelopment (TarailoGraovac2015The; Neuhofer2020A).

Other conditions associated with PIGA mutations include X-linked intellectual disability and various syndromes with neurological symptoms, such as infantile spasms and epileptic encephalopathy. These disorders often present with a spectrum of symptoms, including hypotonia, seizures, and intellectual disability, reflecting the diverse roles of GPI-anchored proteins in the central nervous system (Belet2014Early; Swoboda2013A).

## Interactions
The PIGA gene encodes the PIG-A protein, a catalytic subunit of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-GlcNAc transferase (GPI-GnT) complex. This complex is crucial for the first step of GPI biosynthesis, specifically the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI) (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). PIG-A interacts with several other proteins within the GPI-GnT complex, including PIG-H, PIG-C, PIG-Q, PIG-P, and PIG-Y. PIG-H, PIG-C, and PIG-P are essential subunits, while PIG-Q and PIG-Y, although not essential, play roles in stabilizing the complex and potentially regulating PIG-A's catalytic action (Wu2020The; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis).

PIG-Y is noted to be directly associated with PIG-A, suggesting a physical interaction that may regulate PIG-A's catalytic activity (Wu2020The). The presence of DPM2, a subunit of dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase, in the complex suggests a co-regulation of GPI biosynthesis with Dol-P-Man synthesis, indicating a broader network of interactions necessary for the proper function of the GPI-GnT complex (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). These interactions are essential for the biosynthesis of GPI anchors, which are critical for anchoring proteins to the cell membrane.
