# HIC1

## Overview
The HIC1 gene (Hypermethylated in Cancer 1) encodes the HIC ZBTB transcriptional repressor 1, a protein that plays a pivotal role in transcriptional repression and is categorized as a transcriptional repressor. This gene is located on chromosome 17p13.3 and is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, and DNA repair. The HIC1 protein contains several structural domains, such as the BTB/POZ domain and Kruppel-like C2H2 zinc fingers, which facilitate its function in DNA binding and protein interactions. It is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology, as it is frequently inactivated in various cancers through epigenetic mechanisms like promoter hypermethylation, contributing to tumorigenesis. Additionally, HIC1 is implicated in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and interacts with several chromatin remodeling complexes, highlighting its role in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential as a tumor suppressor (Valenta2006HIC1; Chen2004Epigenetic; Deltour2002The).

## Structure
The HIC1 protein is characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function as a transcriptional repressor. It contains an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and dimerization, forming a tightly intertwined obligate dimer essential for its function (StankovicValentin2007An; Deltour2002The). This domain is involved in scaffolding and dimerization, which are critical for the biological properties of this family of transcription factors (Bertrand2004Identification).

The C-terminal region of HIC1 includes five Kruppel-like C2H2 zinc fingers, which are involved in sequence-specific DNA binding through a consensus sequence centered on a GGCA core motif (StankovicValentin2007An; Deltour2002The). The central region of the protein contains a conserved GLDLSKK motif, which interacts with the CtBP corepressor and is crucial for transcriptional repression (Deltour2002The).

HIC1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including SUMOylation at a conserved lysine (K314) and acetylation by P300/CBP, which are regulated by deacetylases SIRT1 and HDAC4 (StankovicValentin2007An). These modifications influence the protein's transcriptional repression activity. The protein's structure is complex, with the central region being natively disordered except for the CtBP interaction motif (StankovicValentin2007An).

## Function
The HIC1 (Hypermethylated in Cancer 1) gene encodes a transcriptional repressor that plays a crucial role in maintaining normal cellular functions in healthy human cells. It is involved in regulating various biological processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, and DNA repair. HIC1 functions by repressing the transcription of target genes through binding to specific DNA sequences known as HIC1-responsive elements (HiRE) (Rood2013Deciphering; Fleuriel2009HIC1).

In the nucleus, HIC1 forms nuclear structures called HIC1 bodies, where it sequesters TCF-4 and β-catenin, key components of the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby attenuating TCF/β-catenin-mediated transcription (Valenta2006HIC1). This repression is significant for modulating the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell determination and organogenesis (Valenta2006HIC1).

HIC1 also interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes, such as NuRD and CtBP, to regulate gene expression. It is involved in a feedback loop with p53 and SIRT1, which is essential for the DNA damage response and apoptosis (Rood2013Deciphering). By repressing genes like SIRT1 and FGF-BP1, HIC1 helps control cell proliferation and angiogenesis, contributing to its role as a tumor suppressor (Zheng2012Signification).

## Clinical Significance
The HIC1 gene, located on chromosome 17p13.3, is frequently inactivated in various cancers through epigenetic mechanisms, such as promoter hypermethylation, rather than mutations. This inactivation is associated with several types of cancer, including medulloblastoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer (Chen2004Epigenetic; Waha2003Epigenetic). In medulloblastomas, HIC1 is often hypermethylated, leading to its silencing and contributing to tumorigenesis (Briggs2008Cooperation; Waha2003Epigenetic). The gene's loss of function is linked to the overexpression of target genes like ATOH1, which plays a role in tumor development (Fleuriel2009HIC1).

HIC1 is also associated with Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a severe genetic disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities. The gene's haploinsufficiency is linked to the syndrome's development, as it is located in a region frequently deleted in MDS patients (Valenta2006HIC1; Grimm1999Isolation). In breast cancer, the misexpression of ephrin-A1 due to HIC1 silencing may contribute to tumor growth (Zhang2010A). The gene's inactivation, particularly in combination with p53 mutations, plays a significant role in the development of osteosarcomas and potentially other cancers (Chen2004Epigenetic).

## Interactions
HIC1 (HIC ZBTB transcriptional repressor 1) is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in its function as a transcriptional repressor. HIC1 interacts with the mCtBP1 protein through a conserved GLDLSKK motif, which is essential for its transcriptional repression activity (Deltour2002The). It also forms complexes with the NuRD complex components, such as MTA1 and MBD3, with these interactions being modulated by posttranslational modifications like SUMOylation and acetylation at lysine 314 (Van2010Differential).

HIC1 interacts with the HIV-1 Tat protein, repressing Tat-dependent transcription, a process dependent on the acetylation state of HIC1 at lysine 314 (Le2016HIC1). It also cooperates with HMGA1 to regulate HIV-1 and cellular gene expression, with a significant overlap in their target genes (Le2016HIC1). HIC1's interaction with STAT3 involves the zinc finger domain of HIC1, which modulates STAT3 activity and affects the expression of genes like VEGF and c-Myc (Lin2013HIC1). These interactions highlight HIC1's role in transcriptional regulation and its potential impact on cancer and viral gene expression.
