# PFN2

## Overview
Profilin 2 (PFN2) is a gene that encodes the protein profilin 2, a member of the profilin family of actin-binding proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, which is crucial for various cellular processes, particularly in neurons. Profilin 2 is characterized by its ability to bind actin, poly-L-proline, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, facilitating its role in synaptic function and neuronal behavior (Xiaohui2023Profilin; Nodelman1999Xray). The gene exists in two splice variant isoforms, PFN2a and PFN2b, with PFN2a being predominant in the central nervous system (Murk2021Profilin). Beyond its role in neuronal health, PFN2 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Zhou2019Profilin; Zhang2018Loss). The multifaceted functions of profilin 2 underscore its importance in both normal cellular physiology and disease states.

## Structure
Profilin 2 (PFN2) is a member of the profilin family of actin-binding proteins, characterized by a structure that includes seven beta chains and four alpha helices (Xiaohui2023Profilin). The protein has three primary binding domains: the actin-binding domain, the poly-L-proline binding domain, and the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate-binding domain (Xiaohui2023Profilin). The poly-L-proline binding site in PFN2 is notable for its aromatic extension, which includes tyrosine at position 29, allowing for additional interactions and a higher affinity for proline-rich peptides compared to profilin I (Nodelman1999Xray).

PFN2 exists in two splice variant isoforms, PFN2a and PFN2b. PFN2a is the predominant form in the central nervous system and has a high affinity for synthetic polyproline peptides due to conserved aromatic residues (Murk2021Profilin). PFN2b, in contrast, does not significantly bind G-actin or poly-proline motifs, suggesting distinct cellular functions (Murk2021Profilin).

Post-translational modifications of PFN2 include covalent modifications of cysteine residues, such as disulfide bonds and DTT adducts, which may influence its function and stability (Haikarainen2009Structure). These modifications are located on the protein's surface and could impact its role in actin binding (Haikarainen2009Structure).

## Function
Profilin 2 (PFN2) is a critical regulator of actin dynamics in neurons, playing a significant role in synaptic function and neuronal behavior. It is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization, which is essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neuronal excitability. PFN2 specifically interacts with the WAVE-complex, directing actin nucleation to the synaptic scaffold, particularly in the presynaptic matrix and postsynaptic density (Pilo2007Profilin2). This interaction is crucial for rapid actin polymerization during sustained synaptic activity, affecting neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity (Pilo2007Profilin2).

PFN2 also plays a role in endocytosis by binding to dynamin 1, inhibiting endocytosis and regulating membrane trafficking in neurons. This interaction is modulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which can release dynamin 1 to form an endocytic complex, coordinating endocytosis and actin polymerization (Gareus2006Mouse). Additionally, PFN2 is involved in maintaining iron homeostasis by interacting with iron regulatory proteins, reducing the labile iron pool and protecting cells from oxidative stress (Luscieti2017The). These functions highlight PFN2's role in neuronal health and its impact on behavior and cognitive functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in PFN2 expression have been implicated in various cancers. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), PFN2 is upregulated and promotes proliferation and metastasis by regulating the PI3K/AKT/β-catenin signaling pathway. High PFN2 expression is associated with poor outcomes and shorter overall survival in HNSC patients (Zhou2019Profilin; Asai2022Impact). In colorectal cancer (CRC), low PFN2 expression is linked to enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased migratory capabilities, suggesting that PFN2 acts as a suppressor of metastasis (Zhang2018Loss). 

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), PFN2 is overexpressed and associated with worse overall survival, deeper invasion, and lymph node metastasis, indicating its role in promoting tumor invasion and metastasis (Cui2016PFN2). In lung cancer, PFN2 is upregulated and linked to poor survival rates, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Tang2015Epigenetic). 

PFN2 is also involved in breast cancer, where its expression is modulated by the FOXD2-AS1/miR-150-5p axis, contributing to cancer malignancy and poor prognosis (Jiang2019Long). These findings suggest that PFN2 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Profilin 2 (PFN2) is known for its interactions with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as endocytosis and actin polymerization. PFN2 binds directly to dynamin 1, a neuron-specific GTPase, through its poly-L-proline binding site. This interaction is significant in regulating endocytosis by competing with SH3 domain-containing ligands like endophilin, amphiphysin, and Grb2, which are essential for the assembly of the endocytic machinery (Gareus2006Mouse). The binding of PFN2 to dynamin 1 is independent of salt concentration and divalent ions and is not significantly affected by ATP, GMP, or GTP (Gareus2006Mouse).

PFN2 also interacts with the WAVE-complex, which is crucial for actin polymerization at synaptic sites. This interaction is specific to PFN2 and is not shared by profilin 1, highlighting its unique role in synaptic actin dynamics (Pilo2007Profilin2). In the context of cancer, PFN2 interacts with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), influencing its nuclear translocation and affecting tumor angiogenesis in non-small cell lung cancer (Xiaohui2023Profilin). These interactions underscore PFN2's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
