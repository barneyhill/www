# MINDY1

## Overview
MINDY1 is a gene that encodes the protein MINDY lysine 48 deubiquitinase 1, a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family. This protein is characterized by its ability to specifically cleave K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are signals for protein degradation via the proteasome pathway. As a cysteine protease, MINDY1 features a unique structural configuration with a catalytic core that includes a C-H architecture, typical of papain-like peptidases (Abdul2016MINDY1). The protein's function is critical in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by rescuing proteins from degradation, thus influencing protein stability and turnover (Kristariyanto2017A; Abdul2016MINDY1). MINDY1 is also involved in various cellular processes, including embryonic stem cell self-renewal and cancer progression, through its interactions with key proteins such as YAP and ERα (James2018MINDY1; Luo2021MINDY1; Tang2021MINDY1). Its role in these processes makes it a significant target for therapeutic strategies in cancer and metabolic diseases.

## Structure
The MINDY1 protein, encoded by the human gene MINDY1, is a member of a newly identified family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) with a unique molecular structure. The minimal catalytic domain of MINDY1 spans residues 110-384 and has been crystallized, revealing a structure that resembles a light bulb. This structure consists of two subdomains: a central 'bulb' subdomain with a seven-stranded beta sheet and a 'stalk' subdomain composed of three alpha helices (Abdul2016MINDY1). MINDY1 is classified as a new folding variant of cysteine proteases, featuring a catalytic core with a C-H architecture typical of papain-like peptidases. The catalytic residues C137 and H319 are crucial for its enzymatic activity, as mutations in these residues abolish function (Abdul2016MINDY1).

MINDY1 also contains tandem MIU (Motif Interacting with Ubiquitin) motifs, MIU1 and MIU2, which are involved in binding K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. MIU2 is the dominant motif for this interaction, while MIU1 enhances binding affinity through avidity (Kristariyanto2017A). The MIU2 motif binds to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains in an open conformation, interacting with all three ubiquitin moieties (Kristariyanto2017A).

## Function
MINDY1 (MINDY lysine 48 deubiquitinase 1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating protein degradation by specifically cleaving K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. These chains are the canonical signal for targeting proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome, and MINDY1's activity can rescue proteins from degradation, thereby influencing protein stability and turnover (Kristariyanto2017A; Abdul2016MINDY1). MINDY1 functions as an exo-deubiquitinase, trimming ubiquitin chains from the distal end, which is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Abdul2016MINDY1).

The enzyme contains two MIU (motif interacting with ubiquitin) motifs, MIU1 and MIU2, which are critical for its binding to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. MIU2 is primarily responsible for recognizing these chains, while MIU1 enhances binding affinity through avidity (Kristariyanto2017A). MINDY1's activity is not significantly influenced by its MIU motifs, although they are important for targeting the enzyme to its substrates (Abdul2016MINDY1).

In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), MINDY1 is involved in promoting self-renewal by stabilizing key self-renewal factors, preventing their degradation. This function is regulated by polyamines and is essential for maintaining ESC identity (James2018MINDY1). MINDY1 is prenylated, which is necessary for its function and localization within the cell, particularly to the endoplasmic reticulum (James2018MINDY1).

## Clinical Significance
MINDY1 has been implicated in several cancers due to its role in deubiquitination processes that affect protein stability and signaling pathways. In liver cancer, MINDY1 is highly expressed and is associated with immune escape mechanisms by regulating PD-L1 ubiquitination. High levels of MINDY1 correlate with poor prognosis and lower 5-year tumor-free survival rates in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, suggesting its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Song2024Study).

In breast cancer, MINDY1 stabilizes estrogen receptor α (ERα), promoting cancer cell proliferation. Its high expression is linked to poor prognosis in ERα-positive breast cancer patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Tang2021MINDY1).

MINDY1 also plays a role in bladder cancer by stabilizing the YAP protein, enhancing cell proliferation and tumor growth. Its upregulation is associated with increased cancer progression, making it a potential therapeutic target (Luo2021MINDY1).

In the context of type 2 diabetes, MINDY1 is involved in insulin action. Variants in MINDY1 are associated with protective effects against type 2 diabetes, and its phosphorylation at S441 is linked to insulin sensitivity, suggesting its role in metabolic regulation (Needham2024Personalized).

## Interactions
MINDY1, also known as MINDY lysine 48 deubiquitinase 1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. MINDY1 interacts with K48-linked polyubiquitin chains through its MIU (motif interacting with ubiquitin) motifs, particularly MIU2, which is crucial for its binding specificity and deubiquitinating activity (Kristariyanto2017A). This interaction is essential for the protein's function in removing ubiquitin from these chains, thereby preventing protein degradation.

In the context of cancer, MINDY1 interacts with the Yes-associated protein (YAP) in bladder cancer cells. It stabilizes YAP by deubiquitinating it, which prevents its degradation and promotes cell proliferation (Luo2021MINDY1). MINDY1 also interacts with estrogen receptor α (ERα) in breast cancer cells, stabilizing ERα by removing K48-linked ubiquitin chains, which enhances ERα's stability and signaling activity, promoting cancer cell proliferation (Tang2021MINDY1).

These interactions highlight MINDY1's role in regulating protein stability and its potential impact on cancer progression, making it a target of interest for therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.
