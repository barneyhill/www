# CCR9

## Overview
The CCR9 gene encodes the C-C motif chemokine receptor 9, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the migration of T lymphocytes to specific tissues, such as the small intestine and thymus. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane regions, which facilitate its function as a transmembrane protein involved in chemokine signaling. CCR9 primarily interacts with the chemokine CCL25, also known as thymus-expressed chemokine (TECK), to guide the chemotaxis of T cells, particularly influencing their localization and function in immune surveillance and homeostasis (Svensson2006Role; Kunkel2000Lymphocyte). Beyond its physiological roles, CCR9 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, where its expression and signaling pathways contribute to disease progression and severity (Xu2020CCR9; Wu2021The). As such, CCR9 represents a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating immune responses and treating related disorders.

## Structure
The CCR9 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane regions, an extracellular N-terminal domain, three extracellular loops, three intracellular loops, and a cytoplasmic C-terminus (Zhu2013Characterization). The primary structure of CCR9 consists of 373 amino acids (Zhu2013Characterization). The secondary structure includes transmembrane helices and loops typical of GPCRs (Zhu2013Characterization). 

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices and loops into a three-dimensional conformation, which is crucial for its function as a membrane protein (Zhu2013Characterization). The CCR9 receptor is involved in forming complexes with chemokines, such as CCL25, where the proximal N-terminus of CCR9 binds in the surface groove of CCL25, and the chemokine's N-terminus is submerged in the orthosteric binding pocket (Pinheiro2024Noncanonical). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, may affect CCR9's function and localization, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The receptor's interaction with chemokines involves significant rearrangements in the transmembrane helices, particularly TM5 and TM6, which are crucial for its activation (Pinheiro2024Noncanonical).

## Function
CCR9, a G protein-coupled receptor, plays a significant role in the immune system by mediating the migration of T lymphocytes to the small intestine and thymus. It primarily binds to the chemokine CCL25, also known as thymus-expressed chemokine (TECK), facilitating the chemotaxis of T cells, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, to these regions (Svensson2006Role; Kunkel2000Lymphocyte). In the thymus, CCR9 is involved in the development and positioning of thymocytes, guiding their migration through thymic niches and contributing to the transition from double-negative to double-positive thymocytes (Svensson2006Role).

In the small intestine, CCR9 is crucial for the localization of lymphocytes to the intestinal mucosa, where it supports immune surveillance and homeostasis. The receptor is expressed on most intraepithelial lymphocytes and lamina propria T cells, which migrate towards CCL25, highlighting its role in intestinal immunity (Svensson2006Role). The expression of CCR9 is tightly regulated, being upregulated during specific stages of T cell development and downregulated as cells mature, ensuring precise control over immune cell trafficking (Zabel1999Human; Svensson2006Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CCR9 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and inflammatory conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCR9 is overexpressed, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through the CCR9/CCL25 signaling pathway. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Xu2020CCR9). In lung adenocarcinoma, CCR9 is overexpressed in tumor tissues, correlating with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced disease stages. It serves as an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival (Zhong2015Expression).

CCR9 also plays a role in chemoresistance in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancers, by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, which enhances cell survival and inhibits apoptosis (Tu2016CCR9). In inflammatory diseases, CCR9 is involved in the pathogenesis of conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Its interaction with CCL25 contributes to inflammation and immune cell recruitment, exacerbating disease symptoms (Wu2021The). In asthma, CCR9 is linked to leukocyte recruitment and airway inflammation, highlighting its role in disease pathology (Wu2021The). These findings suggest that targeting CCR9 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for these conditions.

## Interactions
CCR9, a G protein-coupled receptor, primarily interacts with the chemokine CCL25. This interaction is characterized by the binding of the N-terminus of CCL25 within the orthosteric binding pocket of CCR9, with the 30s loop of CCL25 forming significant interactions with the chemokine recognition site 2 (CRS2) of CCR9 (Pinheiro2024Noncanonical). The CCR9-CCL25 complex involves critical hydrogen bonding networks, particularly around residues such as K211, S207, and T208, which are important for signaling and arrestin recruitment (Pinheiro2024Noncanonical). 

Mutational studies have shown that specific residues in CCR9, such as S207 and T208, play significant roles in chemokine binding and receptor signaling. These residues are involved in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the 30s loop of CCL25, which is crucial for CCR9 activation (Pinheiro2024Noncanonical). The interaction between CCR9 and CCL25 also influences the receptor's conformational equilibrium, affecting its signaling capacity (Pinheiro2024Noncanonical).

CCR9 is also involved in cancer-related signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, which are activated upon interaction with CCL25. This interaction contributes to cancer progression by modulating key signaling pathways (Tu2016CCR9).
