# SH2D3C

## Overview
The SH2D3C gene encodes the SH2 domain-containing protein 3C, a non-catalytic adaptor protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by the presence of an SH2 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions by binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues, and a Ras GEF-like domain, which, despite its structural similarity, lacks guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity. SH2D3C plays a crucial role in cell migration, adhesion, and immune response regulation, acting as a mediator in pathways involving integrin signaling and T-lymphocyte migration. It interacts with several proteins, including dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) and CARD11, linking it to oxidative stress response and antigen receptor signaling. The gene's expression and interaction profiles have significant implications in diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia and lung cancer, where it serves as a potential prognostic marker (Matovina2023Identification; Zhang2024Identification).

## Structure
The SH2D3C protein, also known as SH2 domain-containing protein 3C, contains both an SH2 domain and a Ras GEF-like domain. The SH2 domain is a protein-protein interaction module that typically recognizes and binds sequences containing phosphorylated tyrosine residues, playing a crucial role in cell signaling pathways (Diop2022SH2). The Ras GEF-like domain in SH2D3C is involved in forming complexes with other proteins such as BCAR3 and p130Cas, although it is catalytically inactive due to its closed structure (Matovina2023Identification).

SH2D3C is known to have multiple isoforms, with isoforms 2 and 3 being capable of binding to dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) (Matovina2023Identification). The protein is also characterized by a high content of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which may facilitate its role in connecting different cell signaling pathways (Matovina2023Identification). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation by MAPK upon EGF stimuli have been observed, which can lead to its translocation to membrane ruffles (Matovina2023Identification). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a role in processes like cell adhesion, migration, and growth, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Matovina2023Identification).

## Function
The SH2D3C gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, tissue organization, and immune response regulation. SH2D3C, also known as NSP3, is an adaptor protein that interacts with other proteins through its SH2 domain and Ras GEF-like domain, although it does not exhibit guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity towards RRAS (Matovina2023Identification). 

In healthy human cells, SH2D3C is involved in cell migration towards epidermal growth factor (EGF) and induces membrane ruffling, likely through its interaction with the p130Cas protein, which facilitates Crk protein binding to p130Cas (Matovina2023Identification). This protein is also a regulator of integrin-mediated adhesion and chemokine-induced tissue-specific migration of primary T-lymphocytes, acting upstream of the small GTPase Rap1 (Matovina2023Identification). The interaction between SH2D3C and dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) suggests a potential link between SH2D3C's role in cell adhesion and migration and the regulation of oxidative stress response via the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway (Matovina2023Identification). The plasma membrane association of SH2D3C is crucial for its function in T-lymphocyte migration (Matovina2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
SH2D3C has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SH2D3C is identified as a key gene associated with the disease, with its expression and methylation status significantly affecting patient survival. It is suggested as a potential prognostic marker for AML, influencing therapeutic decision-making and disease prognosis (Zhang2024Identification). 

In lung cancer, SH2D3C serves as a prognostic biomarker for tumor progression and immune evasion, highlighting its role in cancer pathophysiology (Zhang2024Identification). The gene is also involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where its expression is significantly reduced in tumor tissues. SH2D3C is part of a prognostic model that can predict survival rates and guide clinical treatment decisions in HNSCC (Liu2024Characterization).

SH2D3C's interaction with dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) suggests a link to oxidative stress response regulation, which may impact cell migration and growth processes. This interaction is relevant to conditions involving oxidative stress and cellular migration, although specific diseases are not directly mentioned (Matovina2023Identification).

## Interactions
SH2 domain-containing protein 3C (SH2D3C) is involved in several protein-protein interactions, playing a role in various cellular processes. It has been identified as a novel interactor of dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3), a zinc-dependent exopeptidase involved in the oxidative stress response via the NRF2-KEAP1 pathway. SH2D3C binds to DPP3 through its C-terminal Ras GEF-like domain, independent of DPP3's enzymatic activity. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation, GST pulldown assays, and molecular docking studies, suggesting a potential link between oxidative stress response and processes involving SH2D3C, such as cell adhesion and migration (Matovina2023Identification).

SH2D3C also interacts with CARD11, a positive regulator of antigen receptor signaling. This interaction enhances IL-2 production and co-localizes with CARD11 upon T-cell receptor stimulation, indicating a role in CARD11-mediated signaling pathways (Giallourakis2006A). Additionally, SH2D3C is known to interact with proteins such as EphB2, R-Ras, Rap1A, BCAR1, and HEF1, which are involved in cell migration and integrin-mediated adhesion (Matovina2023Identification). These interactions highlight SH2D3C's involvement in diverse signaling pathways and cellular functions.
