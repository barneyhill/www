# TWIST2

## Overview
TWIST2 is a gene that encodes the twist family bHLH transcription factor 2, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including immune regulation, myeloid lineage development, and energy homeostasis. The TWIST2 protein is characterized by its ability to form homodimers and heterodimers, which are crucial for its function in gene regulation. It plays a significant role in modulating cytokine expression, thereby influencing inflammatory responses and maintaining immune balance. Additionally, TWIST2 is implicated in adipose tissue regulation by interacting with transcription factors involved in fatty acid metabolism. Mutations in the TWIST2 gene are associated with congenital disorders such as Ablepharon Macrostomia Syndrome, Barber-Say Syndrome, and Setleis Syndrome, highlighting its importance in developmental processes (Sharabi2008Twist-2; Franco2010Redundant; Marchegiani2015Recurrent).

## Structure
The TWIST2 protein is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor composed of 160 amino acids. It contains several functional domains, including a basic domain (residues 66-77), a helix-loop-helix domain (residues 78-118), and a twist box at the C-terminus (residues 141-160) (Rosti2014Setleis). The basic domain is essential for DNA binding, with specific mutations in this region linked to Ablepharon Macrostomia Syndrome (AMS) and Barber-Say Syndrome (BSS) (Marchegiani2015Recurrent). The bHLH domain consists of two long α-helices separated by a loop, with helix H1 interacting with the major groove of DNA and helix H2 forming a coiled coil with a symmetry-related helix (Rosti2014Setleis).

Mutations in TWIST2, such as p.Glu75Lys and p.Glu75Gln, do not alter the global structure but may impact DNA-binding activity (Marchegiani2015Recurrent). The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, influencing its function in gene regulation (Rosti2014Setleis). The TWIST2 protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its critical role in developmental processes (Rosti2014Setleis).

## Function
TWIST2 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating various cellular and molecular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of immune system development and response by modulating the expression of cytokines. TWIST2 inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) while promoting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, thereby maintaining a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses (Sharabi2008Twist-2; Franco2010Redundant).

TWIST2 also plays a critical role in myeloid lineage development by inhibiting the proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitors into macrophages, neutrophils, and basophils. It achieves this by interacting with transcription factors such as Runx1 and C/EBPα, which are crucial for myeloid differentiation (Sharabi2008Twist-2).

In addition to its role in immune regulation, TWIST2 is involved in energy homeostasis, particularly in adipose tissue. It acts as an inhibitor of the transcription factor ADD1/SREBP1c, which is involved in adipocyte differentiation and the regulation of genes related to fatty acid and sterol biosynthesis (Franco2010Redundant; Lee2003Twist2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TWIST2 gene are associated with several congenital disorders, including Ablepharon Macrostomia Syndrome (AMS), Barber-Say Syndrome (BSS), and Setleis Syndrome. AMS and BSS are rare ectodermal dysplasias characterized by distinct facial and skin abnormalities. AMS is caused by a lysine substitution at residue 75 of TWIST2, while BSS results from a glutamine or alanine substitution at the same position. These mutations alter the DNA-binding pattern of TWIST2, leading to abnormal developmental phenotypes and transcriptome changes (Marchegiani2015Recurrent; Kim2017Localized).

Setleis Syndrome is linked to nonsense mutations in TWIST2, such as Q65X and Q119X, which result in truncated proteins. These mutations disrupt the regulation of periostin, a protein involved in connective tissue development, contributing to the syndrome's characteristic facial features (Franco2011Nonsense). The Q119X mutation retains some functional capabilities but lacks transactivational activity, affecting gene expression (Franco2011Nonsense).

TWIST2 mutations can also lead to dysregulation of periostin, impacting cell adhesion and migration, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of Setleis Syndrome (Franco2011Nonsense). These findings highlight the critical role of TWIST2 in craniofacial and dermal development.

## Interactions
TWIST2, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is known for its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and cellular processes. TWIST2 interacts with ADD1/SREBP1c, a transcription factor involved in fatty acid metabolism, by forming a stable complex with its N-terminal region. This interaction represses the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c, likely by inhibiting its DNA binding ability and recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to modify chromatin structure (Lee2003Twist2).

TWIST2 also competes with SREBP1c for binding to specific DNA sequences, such as E-boxes, which are critical for regulating gene expression. This competition affects the DNA binding and regulatory functions of SREBP1c, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism (Casasnovas-Nieves2023Mechanisms).

In the context of Setleis syndrome, TWIST2 mutations, such as Q119X, retain the ability to bind DNA and form dimers, potentially leading to altered gene regulation. This mutation can form homodimers and heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, such as E12 and TWIST1, affecting gene expression through retained dimerization and nuclear localization (Franco2011Nonsense).
