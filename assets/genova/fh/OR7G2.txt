# OR7G2

## Overview
OR7G2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 7 subfamily G member 2, which is part of the extensive family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals. The protein encoded by OR7G2 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odor molecules, initiating a cascade of neuronal responses that contribute to the perception of smell (Cardoso2020Wholegenome; Corda2022GProtein). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR7G2 and other olfactory receptors have been identified in non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential roles in diverse physiological processes (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Structure
OR7G2 is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. These receptors are involved in odor detection and signal transduction, interacting with odorant molecules to initiate neuronal responses (Cardoso2020Wholegenome; Corda2022GProtein). The primary structure of OR7G2, like other olfactory receptors, includes regions that are highly conserved across different GPCRs, such as the DRY motif, which is crucial for receptor activation and signaling (cvicek2015structure).

The secondary and tertiary structures of OR7G2 are likely to include the characteristic seven-transmembrane alpha-helices common to GPCRs, which form a helical bundle within the cell membrane (cvicek2015structure). These helices are connected by extracellular and intracellular loops, which play roles in ligand binding and signal transduction, respectively (cvicek2015structure).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in olfactory receptors, potentially affecting OR7G2's function and localization within the cell membrane (cvicek2015structure). These modifications can influence receptor stability, trafficking, and interaction with other cellular components. The quaternary structure of OR7G2, like many GPCRs, may involve dimerization or interaction with other proteins, although specific details for OR7G2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
OR7G2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR7G2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Yin2020Functional).

The olfactory receptors, including OR7G2, play a crucial role in the olfactory signaling pathway, which is essential for various survival aspects such as odor perception, food recognition, and the identification of sexual partners (Cardoso2020Wholegenome). These receptors are involved in recognizing a wide range of chemical compounds, which allows for the discrimination among structurally related odorants (Alonso2008Overdominance).

In addition to their primary role in olfaction, olfactory receptors like OR7G2 have been found to be ectopically expressed in other tissues, including the skin, where they may be involved in processes such as epidermal proliferation, migration, and regeneration (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). However, the specific function of OR7G2 in these non-olfactory tissues remains less well understood.
