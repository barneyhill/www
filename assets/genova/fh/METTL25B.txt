# METTL25B

## Overview
METTL25B is a gene that encodes the protein methyltransferase like 25B, which is part of the methyltransferase enzyme family. These enzymes are responsible for transferring methyl groups to various substrates, a process that is crucial for regulating gene expression and protein function. Methyltransferase like 25B is involved in various cellular processes, including the modification of nucleic acids and proteins, which can impact cellular signaling pathways and gene regulation. The specific biological roles and mechanisms of METTL25B and its encoded protein are still under investigation, but they are believed to play a significant role in cellular homeostasis and development (Qiu2020aarFDC).
