# CCNQ

## Overview
CCNQ is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin Q, which is a member of the cyclin family. Cyclins are a group of proteins known for their role in regulating the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclin Q is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and transcriptional regulation. It is particularly noted for its role in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). The expression and regulation of CCNQ, as well as its interactions with other proteins, are areas of active research due to their implications in cancer and other diseases.
