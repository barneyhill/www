# CCNT1

## Overview
The CCNT1 gene encodes cyclin T1, a regulatory protein that is a critical component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex. Cyclin T1 is categorized as a cyclin protein, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, muscle cell differentiation, and immune cell activation. Cyclin T1 is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues, with elevated levels in mesenchymal tissues. It interacts with several proteins, including the retinoblastoma protein and the HIV-1 Tat protein, highlighting its diverse functional roles in both cellular and viral contexts. The involvement of cyclin T1 in HIV-1 transcription and latency reactivation underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in HIV treatment strategies (Urano2012Regulation; Hafer2023A; Żuryń2021The).

## Function
Cyclin T1, encoded by the CCNT1 gene, is a crucial component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which also includes CDK9. This complex plays a vital role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, specifically during the elongation phase. Cyclin T1 facilitates the phosphorylation of serine 2 in the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, enabling the transition from transcription initiation to productive elongation (Zhou2017Regulation; Urano2012Regulation; Żuryń2021The).

Cyclin T1 is expressed in all human tissues, with particularly high levels in mesenchymal tissues such as connective tissue, skeletal muscle, and blood and lymphoid tissues. It is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle cell differentiation, antigen presentation, and cell proliferation. The cycT1-Cdk9 complex is essential for B-cell differentiation and activation, with increased expression observed in B-lymphocytes and T-cells upon antigen encounter (Żuryń2021The).

Cyclin T1 also interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which is crucial for regulating the transition between the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, suggesting a role in cell cycle progression (Żuryń2021The). Additionally, Cyclin T1 is involved in alternative splicing, mRNA transport, and chromatin modification, further highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular function (Urano2012Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
CCNT1 (cyclin T1) plays a significant role in the reactivation of HIV-1 from latency. It is essential for the transcriptional initiation component of latency reactivation, interacting with the viral protein Tat and TAR RNA to facilitate this process. Studies have shown that CCNT1 is required for HIV-1 reactivation from latency in both J-Lat cells and primary CD4+ T cells, although it is non-essential for normal T cell function (Hafer2023A). The knockout of CCNT1 significantly impairs HIV-1 reactivation without affecting T cell activation or proliferation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for strategies aimed at reducing the latent HIV reservoir, such as 'shock and kill' or 'block and lock' (Hafer2023A).

While CCNT1 is crucial for HIV-1 transcription, it has minimal effects on host gene transcription in Jurkat T cells, suggesting redundancy with other genes like CCNT2 or CCNK (Hafer2023A). The specific role of CCNT1 in HIV-1 latency and reactivation underscores its importance in the context of HIV infection and potential therapeutic interventions (Hafer2023A). There is no direct mention of other diseases or conditions associated with mutations in the CCNT1 gene beyond its role in HIV-1 latency (Hafer2023A).

## Interactions
Cyclin T1 (CCNT1) is a key component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, interacting with cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) to regulate transcription elongation. This complex phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, facilitating transcriptional elongation (Michels2008RNA‐driven; Michels2003MAQ1).

CCNT1 interacts with the HIV-1 Tat protein, which recruits P-TEFb to the TAR RNA element, enhancing viral transcription. This interaction involves the N-terminal 'cyclin homology' domain of CCNT1 and a specific Tat:TAR recognition motif (TRM) (Michels2008RNA‐driven; Battisti2003Additive).

CCNT1 is also part of several multiprotein complexes, including the 7SK snRNP complex, where it interacts with HEXIM1, HEXIM2, and 7SK RNA. This complex acts as a CDK inhibitor, modulating P-TEFb activity and competing with Tat for binding to CCNT1 (Michels2008RNA‐driven; Michels2003MAQ1).

Additionally, CCNT1 forms part of the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) and other novel complexes termed CCAPs, which include various proteins involved in transcription regulation and other cellular processes (Ramakrishnan2012Identification). These interactions highlight the diverse regulatory roles of CCNT1 in both cellular and viral transcription.
