# C8orf34

## Overview
C8orf34 is a gene located on chromosome 8 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 8 open reading frame 34. This protein is categorized as a non-kinase, non-receptor protein, and its specific biological functions remain largely uncharacterized. However, it is implicated in various cellular processes due to its interactions with other proteins and potential involvement in signaling pathways. The gene's expression and the protein's activity may have clinical significance, particularly in the context of certain diseases, although detailed mechanisms and pathways are still under investigation. Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise roles of C8orf34 and its encoded protein in human health and disease.
