# THNSL1

## Overview
The THNSL1 gene encodes the protein threonine synthase-like 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as an enzyme, specifically functioning in amino acid biosynthesis pathways. Although its precise biological role is not fully elucidated, threonine synthase-like 1 is thought to play a part in metabolic pathways that are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential implications in metabolic disorders and other clinical conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
