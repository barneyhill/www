# MAP7D2

## Overview
MAP7D2, or Microtubule-Associated Protein 7 Domain Containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in microtubule stabilization and intracellular transport, particularly within neuronal cells. The MAP7D2 protein is a member of the MAP7 family, characterized by its ability to bind microtubules and interact with kinesin-1, a motor protein essential for axonal transport. This interaction facilitates the transport of organelles and other cargoes into axons, playing a critical role in axon development and neuronal function (Pan2019MAP7D2; Kikuchi2021Map7D2). The protein is predominantly expressed in brain tissues, suggesting a specialized role in neuronal processes (Pan2019MAP7D2). Additionally, MAP7D2 is an X-linked imprinted gene with higher expression in females, indicating potential involvement in sex-specific brain functions and disorders (Niida2011MAP7D2). The gene's expression has been linked to various diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Hu2021Screening; Luo2021Expression).

## Structure
The MAP7D2 protein is a member of the MAP7 family, characterized by a conserved N-terminal coiled-coil motif that facilitates microtubule binding and a C-terminal MAP7 coiled-coil domain presumed to interact with kinesin-1 (Pan2019MAP7D2). The N-terminal region of MAP7D2, specifically amino acids 151-387, is crucial for its localization to the proximal axon and microtubule binding (Pan2019MAP7D2). This region is positively charged, a common feature of microtubule-binding domains, and is essential for microtubule stabilization (Kikuchi2021Map7D2).

MAP7D2 also contains a C-terminal domain that includes a binding site for Kif5b, a kinesin-1 heavy chain, which is important for kinesin-1-mediated cargo transport into the axon (Pan2019MAP7D2; Kikuchi2021Map7D2). The protein's interaction with kinesin-1 is crucial for its role in axonal transport and branching (Pan2019MAP7D2).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence MAP7D2's function, similar to other MAP7 family proteins (Pan2019MAP7D2). The protein is predominantly expressed in brain tissues, indicating its specialized role in neuronal function (Pan2019MAP7D2).

## Function
The MAP7D2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in microtubule stabilization and intracellular transport in neuronal cells. MAP7D2 binds directly to microtubules through its N-terminal domain, enhancing microtubule polymerization and bundling, which is essential for maintaining microtubule stability and organization (Kikuchi2021Map7D2). This protein is prominently localized at the centrosome and along microtubules, particularly during cell division and in neurites, regions known for microtubule bundling (Kikuchi2021Map7D2).

MAP7D2 is also involved in promoting kinesin-1-mediated cargo transport into axons, which is vital for axon development and neuronal function. It interacts with all three kinesin-1 family members, facilitating the transport of organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes into the axon (Pan2019MAP7D2). The protein's localization to the proximal axon is mediated by its N-terminal microtubule-binding domain, and it acts as a local regulator of kinesin-1, crucial for axonal development and neuronal migration (Pan2019MAP7D2).

In addition to its role in microtubule dynamics, MAP7D2 is identified as an X-linked imprinted gene with higher expression in females, suggesting a potential role in sex-specific brain functions (Niida2011MAP7D2).

## Clinical Significance
MAP7D2 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in neuronal development and cancer. Alterations in MAP7D2 expression have been observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its mRNA levels are significantly higher in large cell lung carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared to normal tissues. This suggests that MAP7D2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in NSCLC (Luo2021Expression). In the context of neurological disorders, MAP7D2 is an X-linked imprinted gene with higher expression in females, potentially influencing sex-specific neurobiological traits and psychiatric disorders such as autism (Niida2011MAP7D2). 

In gastric cancer, MAP7D2 has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker, although its specific role in this context requires further investigation (Liu2018Identification). Additionally, a rare single nucleotide variant in MAP7D2 has been associated with Graves' disease, indicating its potential involvement in autoimmune conditions (Hu2021Screening). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MAP7D2 in various diseases, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its role in disease pathogenesis and progression.

## Interactions
MAP7D2 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its role in microtubule stabilization and axonal transport. It binds directly to microtubules via its N-terminal domain, a feature it shares with other MAP7 family members, such as MAP7D1 (Kikuchi2021Map7D2). This interaction is crucial for its function in stabilizing microtubules and facilitating kinesin-1-mediated transport within neurons (Pan2019MAP7D2).

MAP7D2 interacts with all three kinesin-1 family members (KIF5A, KIF5B, and KIF5C), promoting their recruitment to microtubules in the proximal axon and enhancing cargo transport into the axon (Pan2019MAP7D2). This interaction is essential for axonal branching and the transport of organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes (Pan2019MAP7D2).

Although MAP7D2 does not directly interact with TRIM46, a microtubule-binding protein, TRIM46 is necessary for MAP7D2's localization to the proximal axon, suggesting an indirect interaction or dependency (Pan2019MAP7D2). These interactions highlight MAP7D2's role in neuronal development and function.
