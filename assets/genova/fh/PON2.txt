# PON2

## Overview
Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme paraoxonase 2, a type II transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in reducing oxidative stress. The PON2 protein is characterized by its antioxidative properties, which play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by hydrolyzing lipid peroxides and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. It is ubiquitously expressed across multiple tissues, including the heart, brain, lungs, and intestine, and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (Levy2007Biological; Manco2021Human). PON2's activity is significant in protecting against oxidative damage, contributing to cardiovascular health, neuroprotection, and cellular stress responses. The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as DJ-1 and quorum sensing molecules, further underscore its role in modulating oxidative stress and influencing disease processes, including atherosclerosis and cancer (Karlov2023Interactome; Manco2021Human).

## Structure
Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) is a protein encoded by the PON2 gene, characterized by a sequence of 354 to 355 amino acids, depending on the isoform (TalerVerčič2020The; Manco2021Human). The primary structure includes several potential N-glycosylation sites, specifically at Asn252, Asn269, and Asn323 (TalerVerčič2020The; Manco2021Human). PON2 is a type II transmembrane protein with a single transmembrane domain located between amino acids 6 and 24, characterized by a hydrophobic stretch (Hagmann2014Breaking). The C-terminal end, which contains the enzymatically active domain, is oriented towards the extracellular compartment (Hagmann2014Breaking).

The tertiary structure of PON2 is modeled based on the β-propeller structure of PON1, consisting of six blades, each made up of four β-sheets (Manco2021Human). PON2 does not form a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer, although it has been suggested to form a trimeric complex in some studies (Draganov2005Human). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, influence its stability and activity (Draganov2005Human).

PON2 exhibits several splice variant isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing or different transcription start sites, which lead to significant protein alterations (Manco2021Human). These isoforms include a canonical full-length protein and others with variations in the N-terminal sequence or missing regions, affecting their functional properties (Manco2021Human).

## Function
The PON2 gene encodes the paraoxonase-2 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in reducing oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis. PON2 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, lungs, and intestine, and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (Levy2007Biological; Manco2021Human). It functions as an intracellular antioxidant, hydrolyzing lipid peroxides and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage (Horke2007Paraoxonase2; Hagmann2014Breaking).

In vascular cells, PON2 reduces ROS levels and prevents oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by decreasing caspase activation, which is crucial for preventing atherosclerosis (Horke2007Paraoxonase2). PON2 also plays a role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) by reducing UPR-derived caspase activity and the induction of pro-apoptotic proteins, contributing to cell survival under endoplasmic reticulum stress (Manco2021Human).

PON2's antioxidative properties extend to the plasma membrane, where it counteracts lipid peroxidation, maintaining membrane integrity under oxidative conditions (Hagmann2014Breaking). This enzyme's activity is crucial in various physiological processes, including neuroprotection and cardiovascular health, by mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation (Manco2021Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PON2 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. The Ser311Cys polymorphism in PON2 is linked to an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and coronary artery disease (CAD), particularly in Caucasian populations. This polymorphism is also associated with higher mortality risk following acute myocardial infarction (Sanghera1998DNA; Manco2021Human). The impaired lactonase activity resulting from the S311C mutation affects the degradation of bacterial signaling molecules, potentially impacting innate immunity and contributing to diseases like atherosclerosis (Stoltz2009A).

PON2 expression is upregulated in certain cancers, providing antioxidative and antiapoptotic benefits that may aid malignant transformation and contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance. This overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in cancers such as brain and liver cancers (Witte2012Protectors; Manco2021Human). In metabolic diseases, PON2 deficiency is associated with impaired insulin signaling and increased atherosclerosis risk, highlighting its role in modulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial function (Manco2021Human). PON2 polymorphisms are also linked to diabetic nephropathy and microvascular complications in diabetes mellitus (Manco2021Human).

## Interactions
Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its biological functions. PON2 interacts with several proteins, including DJ-1 (PARK7), which is associated with Parkinson's disease. This interaction is crucial for modulating PON2 activity and enhancing cell survival under oxidative stress conditions (Manco2021Human). PON2 also interacts with proteins involved in cancer, such as LRIG1 and potentially EGFR, which are significant due to EGFR's role in oncogenesis (Karlov2023Interactome). 

In the context of bacterial infections, PON2 interacts with the quorum sensing molecule N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL), hydrolyzing it to reduce biofilm formation and virulence (Manco2021Human). PON2's interaction with stomatin (STOM) and GLUT1 is noted in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it influences the Warburg effect and metastasis (Manco2021Human). 

Additionally, PON2 is involved in interactions with proteins like Peroxyredoxyn 1 and is regulated by Sestrin 2, which helps reduce renal oxidative stress (Lampitella2024The). These interactions highlight PON2's role in cellular stress responses and its potential impact on various diseases.
