# CDO1

## Overview
CDO1, or cysteine dioxygenase type 1, is a gene that encodes a monomeric enzyme involved in the metabolism of cysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid. The protein product of CDO1, cysteine dioxygenase type 1, is categorized as a non-heme iron enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the catabolic pathway of cysteine, converting it to cysteine sulfinic acid. This conversion is crucial for maintaining cellular cysteine homeostasis and preventing cytotoxicity. CDO1 is predominantly expressed in the liver and adipose tissues, where it responds to dietary intake of protein and sulfur amino acids. The enzyme's activity is modulated by a unique post-translational modification, the formation of a Cys-Tyr thioether bond, which enhances its catalytic efficiency. CDO1 has significant clinical implications, particularly as a tumor suppressor gene frequently silenced by promoter methylation in various cancers, and its dysfunction is associated with neurodegenerative disorders (Brait2012Abstract; Sarkar2017Understanding; Stipanuk2008Cysteine).

## Structure
The human cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1) protein is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 23 kDa and consists of 200 amino acids (McCann1994Human; Sarkar2017Understanding). The primary structure of CDO1 shows over 90% homology with the equivalent rat enzyme (McCann1994Human). The secondary structure of CDO1 includes a cupin β-barrel motif, characterized by three β-sheets surrounding the active center (Sarkar2017Understanding). 

The tertiary structure of CDO1 features a catalytically important ferrous ion coordinated by the N-atoms of His86, His88, and His140, forming a 3-His facial metal-binding motif (Gardner2010Spectroscopic). A notable post-translational modification in CDO1 is the formation of a thioether bond, known as the Cys-Tyr cofactor, between Cys93 and Tyr157, which is crucial for proper substrate positioning and modulating ligand binding (Blaesi2015Spectroscopic; Sarkar2017Understanding). 

There is no evidence of multiple genes or mRNA transcripts for CDO1, suggesting a single gene product without alternative splice variant isoforms (Stipanuk2003Evidence). The quaternary structure of CDO1 is not applicable as it functions as a monomeric enzyme (Stipanuk2003Evidence).

## Function
Cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the catabolism of cysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid. In healthy human cells, CDO1 catalyzes the conversion of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid, which is a pivotal step in regulating cellular cysteine levels and preventing cytotoxicity from excess cysteine (Stipanuk2008Cysteine). This conversion is essential for the synthesis of taurine and sulfate, both of which are important for various metabolic processes, including maintaining cardiac function, protecting neural cells, and stabilizing skeletal muscles (Sarkar2017Understanding).

CDO1 is primarily active in the liver and adipose tissues, where it responds to dietary protein and sulfur amino acid intake, adjusting its activity to maintain cysteine homeostasis (Stipanuk2008Cysteine). The enzyme's activity is regulated by the formation of a Cys-Tyr thioether bond, which enhances its catalytic efficiency and stability (Stipanuk2008Cysteine). This regulation is crucial for preventing the accumulation of toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ensuring adequate production of taurine, which acts as a neurotransmitter and organic osmolyte in the central nervous system (Sarkar2017Understanding; Roman2013The).

## Clinical Significance
CDO1 (cysteine dioxygenase type 1) is implicated in various diseases, primarily due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene that is often silenced by promoter methylation in multiple human cancers. This silencing is a common event in cancers such as colon, breast, esophagus, lung, bladder, and stomach cancers, where CDO1 downregulation is associated with tumor progression (Brait2012Abstract). In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, CDO1 promoter hypermethylation is linked to poor prognosis and may serve as an independent prognostic factor (Minatani2016Prognostic). 

In colorectal cancer, CDO1 methylation increases along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cancer progression (Kojima2018Cysteine). The gene's methylation status is also a strong predictor for distant metastasis in certain breast cancer patients (Brait2012Abstract). 

Beyond cancer, CDO1 dysfunction is linked to neurodegenerative disorders, where elevated cysteine levels due to reduced CDO1 activity can lead to oxidative damage, as seen in diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's (Sarkar2017Understanding). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CDO1 in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
CDO1 (cysteine dioxygenase type 1) is known to interact with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg), a key transcription factor in adipogenesis. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of adipogenic gene expression. Studies have shown that CDO1 expression is upregulated during adipogenic differentiation, and its knockdown results in reduced expression of adipogenic-specific genes such as Pparg, Cebpa, and Fabp4, as well as decreased lipid droplet formation. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated a physical interaction between CDO1 and Pparg, indicating that CDO1 may act as a co-activator of Pparg, facilitating its binding to the promoters of key adipogenic genes (Deng2015Cysteine).

Additionally, CDO1 interacts with various proteins involved in metabolic pathways, as identified through the STRING database. These interactions include cystathionase (CTH), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), cysteine sulphinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD), and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). CDO1 also interacts with cell adhesion associated, oncogene-regulated (CDON), which is involved in myogenesis. These interactions suggest CDO1's involvement in diverse biological functions, although further studies are needed to fully understand these associations (Sarkar2017Understanding).
