# CLDN5

## Overview
The CLDN5 gene encodes the protein claudin 5, a crucial component of the claudin family, which is integral to the formation and function of tight junctions in endothelial cells. Claudin 5 is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining the selective permeability of barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). It is characterized by its ability to form tight junction strands that restrict the passage of molecules, thereby preserving the integrity of the BBB and other endothelial barriers. The protein's structure, featuring four transmembrane domains and specific extracellular loops, facilitates its interactions and stability within the cell membrane. These structural features enable claudin 5 to engage in both homophilic and heterophilic interactions, essential for the assembly and function of tight junctions (Morita1999Claudin; Hashimoto2021Claudin5:; Cording2013In).

## Structure
Claudin 5 (CLDN5) is a member of the claudin family, characterized by its role in forming tight junctions in endothelial cells. The protein is composed of 218 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 23.1 kDa (Morita1999Claudin). It features four transmembrane domains, with both the NH2- and COOH-termini located in the cytoplasm. The first extracellular loop is longer and more hydrophobic than the second, and the amino acid sequence is conserved in the first and fourth transmembrane domains and the first and second extracellular loops (Morita1999Claudin).

The secondary structure of claudin 5 includes a helix-turn-helix conformation in the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), which is crucial for its function in tight junctions (Krause2015Assembly). The protein forms cis-homodimers, stabilized by specific residues in the transmembrane 3 (TM3) segment, which are resistant to certain detergents, indicating a stable quaternary structure (Rossa2014Claudin3). Claudin 5 is predominantly involved in sealing functions within tight junctions, contributing to its role in maintaining the integrity of barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (Heinemann2019Structural).

## Function
The CLDN5 gene encodes the claudin-5 protein, a critical component of tight junctions in endothelial cells, particularly within the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Claudin-5 plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and selective permeability of the BBB by forming tight junction strands that restrict the passage of molecules. It allows only small, hydrophobic molecules with a molecular weight of less than 400 Da to pass through, while preventing larger molecules from crossing the barrier (Hashimoto2021Claudin5:).

In healthy human cells, claudin-5 is predominantly expressed in brain endothelial cells and is essential for the assembly of tight junctions through both cis- and trans-interactions. These interactions are crucial for the structural and functional integrity of the BBB, preventing the passage of potentially harmful substances into the brain while allowing essential nutrients to pass through (Hashimoto2021Claudin5:).

Claudin-5 also plays a role in limiting endothelial cell motility and maintaining cell-cell adhesion, which are important for the integrity and function of endothelial barriers (Yang2021The). The protein's intracellular C-terminal domain is important for its junctional localization and cellular half-life, with modifications such as palmitoylation and phosphorylation affecting its function and stability (Hashimoto2021Claudin5:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLDN5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those affecting the kidneys and the brain. In the context of kidney disease, the loss of CLDN5 in podocytes leads to the deregulation of WIF1, which activates WNT signaling pathways. This activation contributes to kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, as evidenced by increased expression of fibrosis markers such as α-SMA, COL1A1, and FN (Sun2022Loss). The interaction of CLDN5 with proteins like ZO1 and ZONAB is crucial for maintaining normal WNT signaling activity, and disruptions in these interactions can exacerbate kidney disease (Sun2022Loss).

In cancer, CLDN5 expression levels vary significantly across different types. In gliomas, particularly high-grade glioblastomas, CLDN5 expression is significantly reduced, which is associated with tumor progression and blood-brain barrier leakage (Karnati2014Down). In gastric cancer, CLDN5 is identified as a biomarker for metastasis and immune infiltration, with its expression levels correlating with patient prognosis and immune cell infiltration (Han2023CLDN5). These findings suggest that CLDN5 plays a significant role in both kidney and cancer pathologies through its involvement in cellular signaling and structural integrity.

## Interactions
Claudin-5 (CLDN5) is a critical component of tight junctions, engaging in various interactions that are essential for its function. CLDN5 forms homophilic cis-interactions, as demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, indicating that CLDN5 can interact with itself along the cell membrane (Cording2013In). These interactions are crucial for the structural integrity of tight junctions.

CLDN5 also participates in trans-interactions, which are important for paracellular tightening against ions and molecules. Specific residues in the second extracellular loop (ECL2), such as Y148, Y158, and E159, are necessary for these interactions. Substitutions at these positions can inhibit trans-interaction and increase permeability, highlighting their role in forming homopolymeric CLDN5 strands (Piehl2010Participation).

In addition to homophilic interactions, CLDN5 can form heterophilic interactions with other claudins, such as claudin-3, claudin-1, and claudin-2, contributing to the formation of tight junctions that regulate paracellular permeability (Piehl2010Participation). These interactions are not only crucial for maintaining tight junction structure but also play a role in the process of cross-over endocytosis, where claudins are internalized into neighboring cells (Gehne2017Crossover).
