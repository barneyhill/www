# MED17

## Overview
MED17 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 17, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair in eukaryotic cells. The MED17 protein is categorized as part of the Head module of the Mediator complex, where it plays a pivotal role in facilitating interactions between gene-specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to gene promoters and the formation of the preinitiation complex, thereby influencing the transcription of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes (Kikuchi2014Human; Carlsten2013The). MED17 also participates in lipid metabolism regulation and inflammatory response modulation through its interaction with the Liver X receptor (Ranjan2018Therapeutic). Additionally, MED17 is involved in DNA repair processes, particularly through its interactions with nucleotide excision repair factors, highlighting its dual role in transcription regulation and DNA repair (Kikuchi2014Human). Mutations in the MED17 gene are linked to severe autosomal recessive disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (FattalValevski2021Delineation).

## Structure
The human MED17 protein is a subunit of the Mediator complex, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. Structurally, MED17 is part of the Head module of the Mediator complex, specifically located in the fixed jaw and extending to the neck submodule, forming a hinge that connects the fixed jaw with the movable jaw (Kikuchi2014Human). The amino acid sequence of MED17 is conserved with that of budding yeast, showing 20.9% identity and 45.0% similarity (Kikuchi2014Human). The N-terminal region of MED17 is located in the neck of the Head module, while the C-terminal region forms the main structure of the fixed jaw (Kikuchi2014Human).

MED17 interacts with multiple subunits of RNA polymerase II, including Rpb3, Rpb4, Rpb7, Rpb8, and Rpb12, as well as general transcription factors such as TFIIB, TBP, and subunits of TFIIE and TFIIH (Kikuchi2014Human). These interactions suggest that MED17 plays a role in activator-independent transcription. MED17 also binds to nucleotide excision repair factors XPB and XPG, indicating its involvement in DNA repair processes (Kikuchi2014Human). The protein's structure facilitates its function as a switch between transcription and DNA repair phases (Kikuchi2014Human).

## Function
MED17 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells. In healthy human cells, MED17 is involved in lipid metabolism regulation through its interaction with the Liver X receptor (LXR), a transcription factor that regulates genes related to cholesterol transport, bile acid synthesis, and inflammatory responses. The activation of LXR by MED17 can lead to increased cholesterol efflux and a reduced risk of atherosclerosis, although it also stimulates triglyceride synthesis through the activation of SREBP-1c (Ranjan2018Therapeutic).

The Mediator complex, including MED17, acts as a bridge between gene-specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery, facilitating the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoters and stimulating the formation of the preinitiation complex. This interaction is essential for the regulated transcription of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes, influencing nearly all stages of transcription and coordinating these events with changes in chromatin organization (Carlsten2013The).

MED17's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and modulating inflammatory responses, contributing to overall cellular and organismal health (Ranjan2018Therapeutic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MED17 gene are associated with several severe autosomal recessive disorders. These include microcephaly, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and ataxia, which are linked to increased unfolded protein responses (UPRs) in fibroblasts from affected individuals. The upregulation of UPR-related genes such as CHOP and ATF4, along with increased basal phosphorylation of eIF2a, suggests that these cellular stress responses contribute to the clinical phenotypes observed in patients (Terabayashi2021Increased).

A specific missense mutation, c.1112T>C (p.L371P), in the MED17 gene has been identified as a founder mutation in the Caucasus Jewish population. This mutation results in a severe phenotype characterized by early progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, profound developmental delays, microcephaly, and various types of epileptic seizures. Affected individuals experience significant deceleration in head growth, leading to microcephaly, and develop severe neurological symptoms, including spasticity and swallowing difficulties, often resulting in fatal respiratory failure before puberty (Kaufmann2010Infantile; FattalValevski2021Delineation).

MRI findings in patients with this mutation consistently show severe cortical and cerebellar atrophy, hypomyelination, and thinning of the corpus callosum. While this mutation is prevalent in Caucasus Jewish families, other MED17 mutations with milder phenotypes have been identified, indicating potential compound heterozygous mutations in other ethnic groups (FattalValevski2021Delineation).

## Interactions
The human MED17 subunit is a crucial component of the Mediator complex, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with various proteins and transcription factors. MED17 is part of the head module of the Mediator complex and interacts with several subunits of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), including Rpb3, Rpb4, Rpb7, Rpb8, and Rpb12. These interactions are essential for transcriptional activation and the formation of a platform between Mediator and Pol II (Kikuchi2014Human).

MED17 also binds to general transcription factors such as TFIIB, TBP, and subunits of TFIIE and TFIIH, facilitating the recruitment of these factors into the pre-initiation complex. This suggests MED17's involvement in both activator-dependent and activator-independent transcription (Kikuchi2014Human). Additionally, MED17 interacts with nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors XPB and XPG, indicating a role in DNA repair processes, particularly in recognizing damaged DNA and assisting in transcription restart post-repair (Kikuchi2014Human).

The interactions of MED17 with these proteins highlight its dual role in transcription regulation and DNA repair, acting as a molecular switch between these processes, especially following DNA damage such as UV-C irradiation (Kikuchi2014Human).
