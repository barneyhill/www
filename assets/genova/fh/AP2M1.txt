# AP2M1

## Overview
The AP2M1 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 2 subunit mu 1, a medium subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), which is integral to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein, playing a pivotal role in the internalization of molecules and synaptic vesicle recycling by facilitating the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. The AP2M1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of endocytic trafficking and interactions with viral proteins, which are crucial for viral replication. Dysregulation of AP2M1 has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as in cancer, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Liu2021Dysregulation; Cho2018The).

## Structure
The AP2M1 protein is a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), which plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The primary structure of AP2M1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The secondary structure of AP2M1 consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and interaction capabilities (Yuan2020Viruses).

The tertiary structure of AP2M1 features a mu homology domain (MHD), which is significant for binding interactions, including those with antiviral compounds like ACA. This domain contains critical residues such as M216, N217, K400, and K410, which are essential for ACA binding (Yuan2020Viruses). The quaternary structure involves AP2M1 as part of the heterotetrameric AP-2 complex, which includes two large subunits, a medium subunit (AP2M1), and a small subunit (Neveu2012Identification).

AP2M1 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation at threonine residue 156, which is crucial for its role in endocytosis and is regulated by kinases such as AAK1 and GAK (Liu2021Dysregulation; Neveu2012Identification). This phosphorylation enhances AP2M1's binding to cargo proteins and its membrane association, impacting endocytic trafficking (Liu2021Dysregulation).

## Function
The AP2M1 gene encodes the µ1 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2), which is a critical component of the clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery. In healthy human cells, AP2M1 plays a vital role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a process essential for the internalization of molecules and the recycling of synaptic vesicle proteins on the plasma membrane (Liu2021Dysregulation). The AP2 complex, including AP2M1, is responsible for binding the clathrin coat to the membrane and recruiting cargo molecules, such as the transferrin receptor, into the forming clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) (Liu2021Dysregulation).

AP2M1 undergoes a phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle that regulates its recruitment to the plasma membrane and its subsequent uncoating from CCVs. Phosphorylation enhances its recruitment during the initial assembly of coated pits, which are then internalized into the cytosol. Dephosphorylation is necessary for uncoating and recycling AP2M1 back to the plasma membrane for a new cycle of endocytosis (Liu2021Dysregulation). This cycle is crucial for efficient endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling, which are important for normal neuronal activity (Liu2021Dysregulation). The proper functioning of AP2M1 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal neuronal function (Liu2021Dysregulation).

## Clinical Significance
The AP2M1 gene is clinically significant in several neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), AP2M1 is part of a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network that influences disease progression. It is significantly down-regulated in AD, correlating with cognitive decline as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Zhang2022Bioinformaticsbased). AP2M1 is also implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), where its phosphorylation by LRRK2 is crucial for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Dysregulation of this phosphorylation cycle leads to endocytic defects and dopaminergic neurodegeneration, contributing to PD pathogenesis (Liu2020LRRK2; Liu2021Dysregulation). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AP2M1 expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal liver tissues. It serves as a promising prognostic marker, particularly in patients with hepatitis C virus infection and/or alcohol intake, providing better survival predictions than existing markers (Cho2018The). These findings highlight the role of AP2M1 in various diseases, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
AP2M1, a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), is involved in various protein interactions crucial for viral replication and cellular processes. It interacts with viral proteins through a YxxØ motif, facilitating the trafficking of viral proteins beyond endocytosis. This interaction is essential for the nuclear import of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) in the case of Influenza A Virus (IAV), where the absence of AP2M1 results in the retention of viral nucleoprotein (NP) in the cytoplasm (Yuan2020Viruses). AP2M1 also interacts with the NP of Orthomyxoviridae, Gag of Retroviridae, NP of Bunyaviridae, NS3 of Flaviviridae, NP of Coronaviridae, 2C of Picornaviridae, and Core Protein V of Adenoviridae, highlighting its role in the viral replication cycle (Yuan2020Viruses).

In the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV), AP2M1 interacts with a tyrosine motif within the HCV core protein, which is essential for viral assembly. This interaction is mediated by the phosphorylation of AP2M1 by kinases such as AAK1 and GAK, enhancing its binding to tyrosine signals within cargo proteins and facilitating HCV entry (Neveu2012Identification; Neveu2015AP2Associated). These interactions underscore AP2M1's critical role in mediating viral entry and assembly through its interactions with other proteins in the endocytic pathway (Neveu2015AP2Associated).
