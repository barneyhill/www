# ST3GAL2

## Overview
ST3GAL2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 2, which belongs to the sialyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, a process that adds sialic acid to galactose residues, thereby influencing cell-cell interactions, signaling, and glycoprotein stability (HarduinLepers2012Sialyltransferases; Li2021The). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus and plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of sialylated structures such as gangliosides GD1a and GT1b (Li2021The). ST3GAL2 is implicated in various biological processes, including immune response modulation, neural development, and cell adhesion, and its dysregulation is associated with several neurological disorders (Blažetić2023Sialyltransferase). The gene's interactions with viral proteins and regulatory nucleic acids further highlight its significance in both health and disease contexts.

## Function
ST3GAL2 encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, specifically catalyzing the transfer of sialic acid to galactose residues. This enzymatic activity is essential for the terminal modification of glycoconjugates, which impacts cell-cell interactions, signaling, and the stability of glycoproteins (HarduinLepers2012Sialyltransferases; Li2021The). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the biosynthesis of sialylated structures such as gangliosides GD1a and GT1b (Li2021The).

In healthy human cells, ST3GAL2 is involved in various biological processes, including immune response modulation, neural development, and cell adhesion. The sialylation process mediated by ST3GAL2 affects cellular recognition and signaling pathways, which are critical for maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal homeostasis (Li2021The). The enzyme's activity is also linked to the regulation of inflammatory responses, as it can influence the expression of cytokines, thereby modulating immune responses (Li2021The). These functions highlight the importance of ST3GAL2 in maintaining cellular and systemic balance in the human body.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ST3GAL2 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders. Research indicates that deficiencies in ST3GAL2 can lead to changes in the expression of calcium-binding interneurons in the brain, which are crucial for neural development and function. These changes are associated with cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases (Blažetić2023Sialyltransferase). The study also suggests that mutations in ST3GAL2 could contribute to conditions like schizophrenia, autism, and intellectual disabilities, which involve defects in inhibitory neural circuits (Blažetić2023Sialyltransferase).

In St3gal2-null mice, there is a reduction in the expression of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b, which are important for interneuron migration and maturation. This reduction is linked to altered interneuron populations in specific brain regions, potentially impacting neurological conditions (Blažetić2023Sialyltransferase). The study highlights the role of gangliosides in the distribution of GABAergic interneurons, which are associated with cognitive and sensory processing (Blažetić2023Sialyltransferase). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ST3GAL2 in maintaining normal neurological function and its potential involvement in various neurological disorders.

## Interactions
ST3GAL2, a member of the sialyltransferase family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In the context of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection, ST3GAL2 interacts specifically with the GP2a structural protein of the virus. This interaction was confirmed through confocal immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated that ST3GAL2 co-localizes and interacts with GP2a in the cytoplasm, but not with other PRRSV structural proteins such as GP3, GP4, and GP5 (Li2021The).

In the context of Campylobacter jejuni infection, ST3GAL2 is regulated by the microRNA miR-615-3p. This interaction involves miR-615-3p targeting the 3′ UTR of ST3GAL2, leading to a decrease in its post-transcriptional expression. This regulatory mechanism was confirmed through dual luciferase reporter assays and RNA interference, indicating a significant role of miR-615-3p in modulating ST3GAL2 expression during infection (Xi2021The).

These interactions highlight the role of ST3GAL2 in viral and bacterial infections, influencing both viral proliferation and host immune responses through its interactions with viral proteins and regulatory nucleic acids.
