# ODAD3

## Overview
The ODAD3 gene encodes the protein outer dynein arm docking complex subunit 3, which is a crucial component of the outer dynein arm docking complex (ODA-DC) in ciliary axonemes. This protein plays a significant role in the assembly and docking of dynein arms, which are essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. As a structural protein, ODAD3 is involved in maintaining the integrity and function of motile cilia, facilitating effective ciliary beating and movement. The protein's interaction with other components of the ODA-DC, such as ODAD1, underscores its importance in the proper attachment of dynein arms to axonemal microtubules, which is vital for normal ciliary function (Zhou2023ODAD1; Lu2024Localisation). Mutations in the ODAD3 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by ciliary dysfunction, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2021Case).

## Structure
The ODAD3 protein, encoded by the ODAD3 gene, consists of 595 amino acids and features three highly conserved coiled-coil domains essential for its function in ciliary axonemes (Wang2021Case). These coiled-coil domains are crucial for the assembly and docking of the dynein arm, a key component in the motility of cilia and flagella. The interaction between ODAD3 and other proteins, such as ODAD1, is mediated through these domains, which are necessary for the proper attachment of the outer dynein arms to axonemal microtubules (Zhou2023ODAD1).

ODAD3 is part of a pentameric complex known as the Outer Dynein Arm Docking Complex (ODA-DC), which includes ODAD1, ODAD2, ODAD4, and ODAD5. This complex is vital for the docking of dynein motors onto microtubules, facilitating ciliary movement (Yamaguchi2023Calaxin). The protein's structure and function are conserved across species, as evidenced by its presence in both human and murine flagella (Pasquini2024The). While specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of ODAD3 are not provided, its role within the ODA-DC suggests a complex interaction network necessary for ciliary function.

## Function
The ODAD3 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the outer dynein arm docking complex (ODA-DC) in cilia axonemes. This protein is essential for the assembly and docking of dynein arms, which are crucial for the motility of cilia and flagella. In healthy human cells, ODAD3 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cilia, particularly in the assembly of the outer dynein arm docking complex, which is necessary for effective ciliary beating and movement (Zhou2023ODAD1; Wang2021Case).

ODAD3 localizes to the base of certain cilia types, suggesting roles beyond anchoring dynein arms to axonemal microtubules, potentially involving the transport of dynein arms or other undefined roles (Lu2024Localisation). The protein's interaction with other components of the ODA-DC, such as ODAD1, is crucial for the proper attachment of dynein arms to axonemal microtubules, which is essential for normal ciliary function (Zhou2023ODAD1). The presence of ODAD3 in human testes suggests a similar function in humans, potentially affecting sperm development and fertility (Pasquini2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ODAD3 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by motile cilia dysfunction. This condition leads to recurrent respiratory infections, subfertility, and laterality defects, such as situs inversus, where the positions of internal organs are mirrored (Wang2021Case). The prevalence of PCD is estimated to be between 1:10,000 to 1:20,000 live-born children (Wang2021Case). A specific homozygous variant, c.1166_1169dupAGAC, p.(Leu391Aspfs*105), has been identified in a patient with PCD, presenting symptoms like chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, dextrocardia, and infertility (Wang2021Case).

In mice, the ODAD3 gene is crucial for sperm development and male fertility. Homozygous knockout mice for the Odad3 gene exhibit azoospermia, a condition characterized by the absence of sperm, due to its role in spermatogenesis (Pasquini2024The). Conditional knockout studies have shown that even partial ablation of the Odad3 gene results in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OATS), characterized by low motile sperm counts and abnormal sperm morphology (Pasquini2024The). These findings suggest that ODAD3 is essential for proper spermiogenesis and spermiation, and its gene dosage is critical for maintaining male fertility (Pasquini2024The).

## Interactions
ODAD3, a component of the outer dynein arm docking complex (ODA-DC), plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of the outer dynein arm, which is essential for ciliary and flagellar movement. ODAD3 interacts with ODAD1, another subunit of the ODA-DC, facilitating the attachment of dynein arms to axonemal microtubules. This interaction is significant for maintaining the structural integrity and function of motile cilia (Zhou2023ODAD1).

Studies have shown that ODAD3 interacts with both wild-type and mutant forms of ODAD1. Mutants of ODAD1 that retain the first three or more coiled-coil domains can still bind to ODAD3, although they exhibit a competitive inhibitory effect on the interaction between wild-type ODAD1 and ODAD3. This suggests that ODAD3's interaction with ODAD1 is crucial for the proper function of the dynein arms and that mutations in ODAD1 can disrupt this interaction, potentially leading to primary ciliary dyskinesia (Zhou2023ODAD1).

ODAD3 is also localized to the axonemes of (9+2) cilia, indicating its role in ciliary motility. Its localization patterns in vertebrate motile cilia suggest potential additional functions beyond anchoring dynein arms, such as transport or other undefined roles (Lu2024Localisation).
