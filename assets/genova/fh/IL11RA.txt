# IL11RA

## Overview
The IL11RA gene encodes the interleukin 11 receptor subunit alpha (IL-11Rα), a type-I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in cytokine signaling. This receptor is a key component of the IL-11 receptor complex, which is involved in various physiological processes, including bone metabolism and hematopoiesis. IL-11Rα interacts with interleukin 11 (IL-11) and the signal transducer gp130 to activate intracellular signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K, which are crucial for cellular functions and homeostasis (Negahdaripour2016A; Schwertschlag1999Hematopoietic). Structurally, IL-11Rα is characterized by an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin-type-III-like domains, essential for ligand binding and receptor stability (Ahmad2023The; Metcalfe2020The). Mutations in IL11RA can lead to craniofacial abnormalities, underscoring its importance in normal development and its potential as a therapeutic target (Nieminen2011Inactivation).

## Structure
The IL11RA gene encodes the interleukin 11 receptor alpha (IL-11Rα), a type-I transmembrane protein involved in cytokine signaling. The extracellular portion of IL-11Rα consists of an immunoglobulin-like domain (D1) and two fibronectin-type-III-like domains (D2 and D3), which form the cytokine-binding homology region (CHR) (Ahmad2023The; Metcalfe2020The). The D3 domain contains a WSXWS motif, common in many cytokine receptors, and is crucial for ligand binding (Ahmad2023The). The structure of IL-11Rα is characterized by an 'L-shaped' configuration, with the D1 domain exhibiting an unusual s-type topology and the D2 and D3 domains containing expected disulfide bonds (Metcalfe2020The).

The IL-11Rα forms a complex with IL-11 and the signal transducer gp130, which is essential for activating intracellular signaling pathways (Metcalfe2020The). The receptor's quaternary structure involves forming a 1:1 complex with IL-11, with a significant hydrophobic interaction at the interface (Metcalfe2020The). Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation at specific sites, such as N105 and N172 (Metcalfe2023Structures). The receptor's proper folding and function are dependent on structural motifs like the arginine-tryptophan-zipper in the D3 domain, which is crucial for receptor stability (Ahmad2023The).

## Function
The IL11RA gene encodes the interleukin 11 receptor alpha, a crucial component of the IL-11 receptor complex involved in cytokine signaling. This receptor is primarily located on the cell membrane, where it binds interleukin 11 (IL-11) and facilitates the activation of the signal transducing subunit gp130. This interaction triggers downstream signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K pathways, which are essential for various cellular processes (Negahdaripour2016A; Schwertschlag1999Hematopoietic).

IL11RA plays a significant role in bone metabolism, particularly in the differentiation and function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone formation and resorption, respectively. The receptor's activity is crucial for maintaining bone homeostasis, especially in craniofacial bones, by regulating the balance between bone formation and resorption (Nieminen2011Inactivation; Kespohl2021The). IL11RA is also involved in hematopoietic processes, promoting the differentiation and maturation of megakaryocytes and stimulating erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis (Schwertschlag1999Hematopoietic).

Mutations in IL11RA can lead to craniofacial abnormalities, such as craniosynostosis, due to impaired IL-11 signaling, highlighting its importance in normal craniofacial development (Nieminen2011Inactivation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL11RA gene are associated with a recessively inherited craniofacial syndrome characterized by craniosynostosis, maxillary hypoplasia, delayed and ectopic tooth eruption, formation of supernumerary teeth, and minor digit abnormalities. These mutations include p.Arg296Trp, p.Pro221Ser, p.Ser245Cys, p.Gln159X, and a 3 amino acid duplication, p.Thr306_Ser308dup. These mutations affect conserved amino acids in the receptor's extracellular domain, crucial for ligand and coreceptor interactions, leading to a loss of function (Nieminen2011Inactivation).

The p.Arg296Trp mutation specifically impairs the IL11RA's ability to mediate IL11 signal transduction, affecting the phosphorylation of STAT3, a key component of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Nieminen2011Inactivation). Another variant, p.W307R, results in craniosynostosis by disrupting the arginine-tryptophan-zipper crucial for proper folding of the D3 domain, impairing IL-11R maturation and transport to the cell surface, leading to a complete loss of IL-11 signaling (Ahmad2023The).

These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of IL11RA in craniofacial development and its potential implications in related disorders, suggesting that modulating IL11 signaling could be a therapeutic approach for treating craniosynostosis (Nieminen2011Inactivation).

## Interactions
IL11RA, the interleukin 11 receptor subunit alpha, is a key component in cytokine signaling, primarily interacting with interleukin 11 (IL-11) to form a complex that includes the transmembrane glycoprotein gp130. This interaction is crucial for activating intracellular signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT and MAPK cascades, which are involved in various physiological processes, including bone metabolism and inflammation (Dong2023The).

The IL-11/IL11RA complex forms with nanomolar affinity, indicating a strong interaction that is essential for subsequent engagement by gp130, which facilitates signal transduction (Metcalfe2020The). The binding of IL-11 to IL11RA involves specific residues that form hydrophobic interactions, crucial for the stability and function of the complex (Metcalfe2020The).

IL11RA can also undergo proteolytic cleavage, resulting in a soluble form (sIL-11R) that can bind IL-11 and participate in trans-signaling. This process is mediated by proteases such as ADAM10 and neutrophil serine proteases, which regulate the availability of sIL-11R and thus modulate IL-11 signaling pathways (Lokau2016Proteolytic). The soluble IL-11R can form a complex with IL-11, which is capable of inducing signaling in cells expressing gp130, highlighting its role in trans-signaling (Lokau2016Proteolytic).
