# MAP3K14

## Overview
MAP3K14 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14, commonly referred to as NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). This protein is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating immune responses, inflammation, and the development of lymphoid organs. NIK is involved in the phosphorylation and activation of IKKα, leading to the processing of NF-κB2/p100 into its active form, p52, which then translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription (Sun2012The; Razani2011Non‐canonical). The kinase is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including mitochondrial dynamics and B cell function (Sun2012The; Jung2016NIKMAP3K14). Dysregulation of MAP3K14 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including immunodeficiencies, cancer, and autoimmune diseases (Tang2024Potential; Schlechter2017Exome; Nguyen2022MAP3K).

## Function
MAP3K14, also known as NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for the regulation of immune responses, lymphoid organ development, and inflammation. NIK is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of IKKα, which subsequently leads to the processing of NF-κB2/p100 into p52. The p52 then translocates to the nucleus, where it forms dimers with RelB to regulate the transcription of target genes involved in immune function and cell survival (Sun2012The; Razani2011Non‐canonical).

In healthy human cells, NIK is involved in maintaining the architecture of secondary lymphoid organs and is essential for the survival and function of B cells. It interacts with receptors such as LTβR, BAFF-R, and CD40, which are important for immune organ development and B cell function (Razani2011Non‐canonical). NIK also plays a role in mitochondrial dynamics, influencing mitochondrial distribution and motility, which are critical for cellular functions such as migration and invasion (Jung2016NIKMAP3K14). The kinase is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it orchestrates these molecular processes (Sun2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAP3K14 gene, also known as NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), have significant clinical implications. A novel mutation, Val345Met, in the MAP3K14 gene has been associated with recessive atypical combined immunodeficiency. This mutation affects the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to altered levels of p100 and p52 proteins, which are crucial for immune function. Despite these changes, the mutation does not appear to impact autophagy (Schlechter2017Exome).

In cancer, MAP3K14 is implicated in various malignancies. It is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with poor prognosis, including lower overall survival and progression-free survival. The gene's expression correlates with advanced cancer stages and immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in tumor progression and immune evasion (Tang2024Potential). In thyroid cancers, particularly BRAF-mutated papillary thyroid carcinomas, MAP3K14 is involved in the activation of NF-κB pathways, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis (Cormier2023NFκB).

MAP3K14's role extends to autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases, where its dysregulation can lead to excessive immune responses and disease progression (Nguyen2022MAP3K).

## Interactions
MAP3K14, also known as NIK, is a key player in the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. It interacts with several proteins to facilitate its role in this pathway. NIK forms a complex with IKKα and NF-κB2, which is crucial for the processing of the NF-κB2 precursor protein p100 into its active form, p52. This complex formation is essential for the activation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression during processes such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (Choudhary2005Respiratory).

NIK also interacts with the fission protein Drp1, regulating its phosphorylation and localization to mitochondria, which is important for mitochondrial dynamics and cell invasion in cancer cells. This interaction is independent of the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway, highlighting a distinct role for NIK in mitochondrial function (Jung2016NIKMAP3K14).

In the context of NF-κB signaling, NIK specifically induces the processing of p100 by promoting its phosphorylation and ubiquitination, a process not shared by other MAP3Ks like MEKK1, MEKK2, MLK3, and Cot (Xiao2001NF-κB-Inducing). This specificity underscores NIK's unique role in NF-κB regulation.
