# F3

## Overview
The F3 gene encodes tissue factor (TF), a critical transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the initiation of the blood coagulation cascade. As a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, TF plays a pivotal role in hemostasis by forming a complex with coagulation factor VIIa, which subsequently activates factors IX and X, leading to thrombin generation and fibrin formation. This process is essential for maintaining vascular integrity and preventing excessive bleeding following injury (Ahmadi2023Tissue; Schulman2020A). Beyond its role in coagulation, TF is implicated in various cellular signaling pathways, influencing processes such as angiogenesis, inflammation, and cancer progression through interactions with protease-activated receptors and integrins (Ahmadi2023Tissue; Breitenstein2009Tissue). The regulation of TF activity is tightly controlled by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which provides a feedback mechanism to modulate coagulation (Broze1995TISSUE). Dysregulation of F3 expression is associated with pathological conditions, including thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Chuang2012miR93106b).

## Structure
The F3 gene encodes tissue factor (TF), a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the initiation of the blood coagulation cascade. The primary structure of TF includes a signal peptide, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Schulman2020A; Unruh2020Beyond). The extracellular domain contains two fibronectin type III domains, which are crucial for binding coagulation factors VII/VIIa and enhancing their catalytic activity (Schulman2020A; Unruh2020Beyond). 

TF exists in multiple isoforms, including full-length TF (flTF) and alternatively spliced TF (asTF). The flTF isoform is a 263 amino acid transmembrane protein, while asTF lacks the transmembrane domain and is secreted (Han2014Tissue; Unruh2020Beyond). The flTF isoform includes an extracellular domain (residues 1-219), a transmembrane domain (residues 220-242), and an intracellular C-terminal domain (residues 243-263) (Unruh2020Beyond). 

Post-translational modifications of TF include glycosylation at asparagine residues N11, N124, and N137, which may affect its charge and affinity for factor VII (Unruh2020Beyond). Phosphorylation and palmitoylation also occur, influencing TF's orientation and function in the plasma membrane (Unruh2020Beyond). TF does not typically form quaternary structures but interacts with factor VIIa to form a functional complex essential for coagulation (Schulman2020A).

## Function
The F3 gene encodes tissue factor (TF), a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the initiation of the blood coagulation cascade. TF is an integral membrane protein that binds to factor VII/VIIa, catalyzing the activation of factors IX and X, which are essential for triggering coagulation (Schulman2020A). In healthy human cells, TF is constitutively expressed in a hemostatic envelope surrounding the vessel wall, ensuring rapid hemostasis in case of injury and preventing its interaction with plasma to maintain normal coagulation processes (Schulman2020A). 

TF is part of the cytokine receptor superfamily and includes an N-terminal signal sequence, two extracellular fibronectin type III domains, a transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domains facilitate the binding of factor VII/VIIa, enhancing the catalytic activity of the factor VIIa serine protease domain (Schulman2020A). The anchoring of TF to the lipid bilayer is critical for its procoagulant activity, as factors VIIa, IX, and X require calcium ions for membrane binding (Schulman2020A). TF is essential for embryonic development and hemostasis, with its deficiency leading to significant physiological effects (Schulman2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the F3 gene, which encodes tissue factor, have significant clinical implications. Overexpression of F3 is associated with a pro-coagulant state, contributing to thrombosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. In the context of leiomyomas, F3 expression is notably lower compared to normal myometrium, but it is elevated during the luteal phase, which may be linked to symptoms such as heavy menses and abnormal uterine bleeding (Chuang2012miR93106b). The regulation of F3 by microRNAs miR-93 and miR-106b is crucial, as these microRNAs can repress F3 expression, impacting downstream targets like IL8, CTGF, and PAI-1, which are involved in inflammation and tissue turnover (Chuang2012miR93106b).

The interaction between F3 and these microRNAs suggests potential therapeutic targets for conditions where F3 is dysregulated. For instance, the gain of function of miR-93 and miR-106b has been shown to decrease the expression of F3 and its downstream targets, which could be beneficial in managing leiomyoma growth and associated symptoms (Chuang2012miR93106b). Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is essential for developing interventions for diseases linked to F3 dysregulation.

## Interactions
The F3 gene encodes tissue factor (TF), which interacts with several proteins to perform its functions. TF primarily forms a complex with coagulation factor VIIa (FVIIa), initiating the coagulation cascade by activating factors IX and X, leading to thrombin generation and fibrin formation (Ahmadi2023Tissue; Breitenstein2009Tissue). This TF-FVIIa complex also interacts with protease-activated receptors (PARs), particularly PAR2, to influence cellular signaling pathways involved in cancer progression, angiogenesis, and inflammation (Ahmadi2023Tissue; Breitenstein2009Tissue).

TF interacts with integrins, which are crucial for TF-FVIIa-PAR2 signaling in tumor cells. This interaction is important for processes such as angiogenesis and tumor metastasis (Ahmadi2023Tissue). The TF-FVIIa complex also activates members of the MAP kinase family, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT5 pathways, which are involved in cell migration, apoptosis, and cancer progression (Ahmadi2023Tissue).

The activity of TF is regulated by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which inhibits the TF-FVIIa complex and factor Xa, providing a feedback mechanism to control coagulation (Broze1995TISSUE). These interactions highlight TF's role in both coagulation and cellular signaling.
