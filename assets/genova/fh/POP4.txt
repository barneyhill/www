# POP4

## Overview
POP4 is a gene that encodes the POP4 homolog, a protein subunit integral to the ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) complexes. These complexes are ribonucleoproteins involved in the essential processing of precursor tRNA and rRNA, which are critical for RNA metabolism and protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The POP4 protein, also known as Rpp29, plays a pivotal role in the structural stability and function of these complexes by interacting with both RNA and other protein subunits, thereby facilitating the catalytic activity necessary for RNA processing (Rosenblad2006Inventory; Perederina2018In). Its activity is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it contributes to RNA maturation, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular function and viability across various eukaryotic organisms (Rosenblad2006Inventory).

## Function
The POP4 gene encodes a protein subunit that is a critical component of the ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) complexes. These complexes are essential for the processing of precursor tRNA and rRNA, respectively, which are crucial steps in RNA metabolism and protein synthesis. In eukaryotic cells, including humans, RNase P and MRP are ribonucleoprotein complexes composed of an RNA molecule and multiple protein subunits, with POP4 being one of the shared components (Rosenblad2006Inventory).

POP4 is involved in the structural stability and function of these complexes, contributing to the precise cleavage and modification of RNA. It interacts directly with the RNA component of RNase P, forming UV-induced crosslinks with specific nucleotides, which indicates its role in RNA binding and processing (Perederina2018In). The presence of POP4 enhances the binding of other protein subunits to the RNA, which is necessary for the catalytic activity of the RNase P complex (Perederina2018In).

In humans, POP4 is active in the nucleolus, where it participates in the maturation of RNA molecules, impacting cellular function and viability. Its ubiquitous presence across various eukaryotic organisms underscores its essential role in cellular processes (Rosenblad2006Inventory).

## Interactions
The human gene POP4 encodes a protein subunit of the RNase P and RNase MRP complexes, which are involved in the processing of precursor tRNA and rRNA, respectively. POP4, also known as Rpp29, participates in several protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions within these complexes. It interacts with multiple other RNase MRP proteins, including hPop1, hPop5, Rpp38, and Rpp25, indicating its central role in the complex's architecture (Welting2004Mutual). POP4 can also homodimerize, suggesting potential multimerization within the complex (Welting2004Mutual).

In terms of protein-RNA interactions, POP4's binding to RNase MRP RNA is highly dependent on the RNA's conformation and the presence of magnesium ions. The P3 domain of the RNA is crucial for this interaction, and deletion of specific regions can completely abolish POP4 binding (Welting2004Mutual). POP4 interacts with multiple regions of the RNase MRP RNA, with the P3 and P4/P19 regions being particularly important for its binding (Welting2004Mutual). These interactions highlight POP4's role in the assembly and function of the RNase P and MRP complexes.
