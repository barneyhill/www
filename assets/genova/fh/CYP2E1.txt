# CYP2E1

## Overview
CYP2E1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of small, hydrophobic substrates, including various xenobiotics, drugs, and endogenous compounds. CYP2E1 is characterized by its role in the oxidation of low molecular weight compounds, such as ethanol and acetaminophen, and is known for producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a byproduct of its metabolic activities (Gonzalez2005Role). The enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it plays a significant role in drug metabolism and the bioactivation of procarcinogens (Guengerich1991Role). CYP2E1's activity is influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which can affect individual susceptibility to diseases such as alcoholic liver disease and certain cancers (Chen2019A). The enzyme's interactions with other proteins and its involvement in oxidative stress pathways underscore its importance in both physiological and pathological processes (Davydov2022Exploring).

## Structure
The human CYP2E1 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, characterized by its role in metabolizing small, hydrophobic substrates. The primary structure of CYP2E1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that includes a conserved tryptophan residue at position 122, which is common among vertebrate P450s (Freeman1992cDNA). The secondary structure of CYP2E1 features twelve major α-helices and four β-sheets, forming the typical cytochrome P450 fold (Levy2015Structural). 

The tertiary structure of CYP2E1 includes a heme-binding domain, with a signature bond between the sulfur atom of Cys437 and the iron of the heme group, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Levy2015Structural). The active site of CYP2E1 is relatively small, accommodating substrates like chlorzoxazone and 4-nitrophenol, and involves key residues such as phenylalanine-205 and threonine-298 for substrate binding (Lewis2003Homology).

CYP2E1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may affect its stability and function (Freeman1992cDNA). The protein can interact with other proteins, such as HSP90, which influences its cellular levels and degradation (Kitam2012The).

## Function
CYP2E1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of a wide range of xenobiotics, including drugs, toxicants, and chemical carcinogens. In healthy human cells, CYP2E1 plays a crucial role in the oxidation of small organic molecules, such as ethanol, which can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (Gonzalez2005Role). This enzyme is particularly important in the metabolism of acetaminophen, where it converts the drug into a reactive quinone metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which can cause hepatotoxicity by binding to cellular macromolecules (Gonzalez2005Role).

CYP2E1 is primarily active in the liver, where it acts as a major catalyst in the oxidation of various low molecular weight compounds, including potential carcinogens like benzene and styrene (Guengerich1991Role). The enzyme is also involved in the metabolism of ketone bodies during starvation, suggesting a role in gluconeogenesis (Gonzalez2005Role). Despite its involvement in these processes, CYP2E1-null mice develop normally, indicating that CYP2E1 may not be critical for physiological homeostasis (Gonzalez2005Role).

## Clinical Significance
The CYP2E1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in the metabolism of various xenobiotics, which can lead to several diseases and conditions. Polymorphisms in CYP2E1, such as the CYP2E1*5B variant, are associated with increased enzyme activity and altered susceptibility to diseases like alcoholic liver disease (Chen2019A). The CYP2E1*6 polymorphism is linked to an increased risk of asthma in children exposed to high levels of benzopyrene (Chen2019A). Additionally, combinations of CYP2E1 polymorphisms, including *5B, *6, and *7B, may increase susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Chen2019A).

Alterations in CYP2E1 expression are associated with various pathological states. Overexpression of CYP2E1 can lead to oxidative stress, contributing to liver injury and conditions such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Chen2019A). The enzyme's role in producing reactive oxygen species and its interaction with antioxidants are part of an adaptive mechanism to mitigate oxidative damage (Chen2019A). CYP2E1 is also implicated in the metabolism of procarcinogens, with polymorphisms like RsaI associated with variations in cancer risk, including lung cancer (He2018CYP2E1). The enzyme's activity can lead to the formation of reactive metabolites, contributing to conditions such as liver injury and potentially cancer (Chen2019A).

## Interactions
CYP2E1 interacts with a variety of proteins, forming complex networks that influence its function in drug metabolism. It forms high-affinity interactions with other cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2A6, CYP3A4, CYP4F2, and CYP4A11, as well as UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) like UGT1A1, UGT1A4, and UGT2B7 (Davydov2022Exploring). These interactions suggest a tightly integrated role within the human drug-metabolizing ensemble (Davydov2022Exploring).

CYP2E1 also interacts with cytochrome b5, which can support certain reactions in the absence of cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), indicating a complex network of interactions essential for electron transfer processes (Jamakhandi2007Global). Despite its expected role, CPR was not identified as a crosslinked partner in some studies, possibly due to its low abundance and competition among P450 species (Davydov2022Exploring).

Unexpected interactions have been observed with proteins such as fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1), disulfide oxidase 1α (ERO1L), and ribophorin II (RPN2), which are involved in xenobiotic metabolism (Davydov2022Exploring). These findings highlight the diverse and complex interaction network of CYP2E1, which plays a significant role in its metabolic functions.
