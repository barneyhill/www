# GOLGA6L9

## Overview
GOLGA6L9 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family like 9, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are typically involved in the structural organization of the Golgi apparatus, a critical cellular organelle responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or use within the cell. While the specific functions of golgin A6 family like 9 remain to be fully elucidated, it is believed to play a role in maintaining Golgi structure and function. Recent studies have highlighted the gene's potential involvement in various pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and cancer, suggesting that GOLGA6L9 may have broader implications in cellular processes and disease mechanisms (Choochuen2024Discovery; Wang2023Integration; Lv2023Transcriptional).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
GOLGA6L9 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer. In the study by Wang et al., GOLGA6L9 was identified as a credible causal gene associated with both AD and cognitive performance, as well as AD and intelligence. This suggests a potential role in the genetic overlap between AD and cognition-related phenotypes (Wang2023Integration).

In cancer research, GOLGA6L9 has been linked to chemotherapy resistance in advanced-stage Wilms tumor (WT) patients. Mutations in GOLGA6L9, along with other genes, were significantly associated with resistance to chemotherapy, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker for treatment outcomes in WT (Choochuen2024Discovery).

Additionally, GOLGA6L9 is involved in transcriptional dysregulation in metastatic colon cancer. Although its original expression level was not significantly associated with the metastatic colon cancer phenotype, its transcriptional dysregulation was noted, indicating a possible role in cancer progression (Lv2023Transcriptional).

These findings suggest that GOLGA6L9 may serve as a significant marker in both neurodegenerative and oncological conditions, warranting further investigation into its clinical implications.
