# VEZF1

## Overview
VEZF1 (vascular endothelial zinc finger 1) is a gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in vascular endothelial cells. The protein encoded by VEZF1 is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. VEZF1 plays a crucial role in vascular development and endothelial cell function by modulating the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and vascular integrity (AlAbdi2018The; Xiong1999Vezf1:A). It is also implicated in cardiac biology, influencing genes related to cardiac muscle contraction and structure (Paavola2020Vezf1). VEZF1 interacts with various proteins, including ETV2 and TEAD-1, to regulate gene expression in different biological contexts (Paavola2020Vezf1; Das2023ETV2). Alterations in VEZF1 expression are associated with several diseases, including heart failure and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Wu2021MicroRNA‑382‑5p; Paavola2020Vezf1).

## Structure
VEZF1 (vascular endothelial zinc finger 1) is a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding. The primary structure of VEZF1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form these zinc finger motifs, essential for its function as a transcription factor. These motifs are typically involved in recognizing specific DNA sequences, allowing VEZF1 to regulate gene expression effectively.

The secondary structure of VEZF1 often involves the formation of alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the stability and functionality of the zinc finger domains. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is critical for its interaction with DNA and other molecular partners. While specific details about the quaternary structure of VEZF1 are not provided, it is common for transcription factors to interact with other proteins, potentially forming complexes that influence their regulatory roles.

VEZF1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its activity and interactions. Additionally, splice variants of VEZF1 can result in different isoforms, each with distinct functional properties, allowing for a diverse range of regulatory capabilities in various cellular contexts. These structural and functional characteristics underscore the importance of VEZF1 in vascular endothelial biology.

## Function
VEZF1 (vascular endothelial zinc finger 1) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in vascular development and endothelial cell function. It is primarily expressed in endothelial cells and their precursors, where it regulates gene expression through DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Xiong1999Vezf1:A). VEZF1 is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis by modulating the expression of both pro- and antiangiogenic factors. It represses the expression of the antiangiogenic factor Cited2, allowing for the activation of proangiogenic genes by Hif-1α, which is crucial for proper vascular development (AlAbdi2018The).

VEZF1 also plays a role in transcription regulation by mediating RNA polymerase II pausing, which is important for transcription elongation and alternative splicing (Gowher2012Vezf1). It is involved in the regulation of DNA methylation through its effects on the expression of the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3b, maintaining normal DNA methylation levels essential for cellular function and development (Gowher2008Vezf1).

In addition to its role in vascular biology, VEZF1 is implicated in cardiac structure and function, where it regulates genes related to cardiac muscle contraction and dilated cardiomyopathy (Paavola2020Vezf1). VEZF1's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, influencing its transcriptional activation capabilities (Bruderer2013Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VEZF1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In cardiac health, decreased VEZF1 expression is associated with heart failure, particularly in idiopathic and ischemic cardiomyopathy. This reduction in expression is also observed in sudden cardiac death victims with ischemic heart disease, suggesting a critical role for VEZF1 in maintaining cardiac function under stress (Paavola2020Vezf1). In zebrafish models, VEZF1 knockdown leads to impaired cardiac growth and contractile response, indicating its importance in cardiac structure and function (Paavola2020Vezf1).

In vascular development, VEZF1 is essential for proper endothelial cell function. Mutations or reduced expression can lead to vascular remodeling defects, loss of vascular integrity, and hemorrhaging, as seen in mouse models (Kuhnert2005Dosagedependent). VEZF1-null mutations result in impaired vascular structure formation, characterized by disorganized vascular networks and abnormal collagen IV deposition, which are crucial for maintaining vascular integrity (Zou2010Targeted).

In cancer, particularly osteosarcoma, VEZF1 acts as an oncogene. Overexpression of VEZF1 in osteosarcoma cells enhances proliferation and invasion, counteracting the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-382-5p, which targets VEZF1 (Wu2021MicroRNA‑382‑5p). This suggests that VEZF1 may be a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
VEZF1, a zinc finger transcription factor, participates in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its regulatory functions. VEZF1 interacts with members of the RhoGTPase family, specifically binding to RhoB through a site in its N-terminal region. This interaction can sequester VEZF1 in the nucleus, inhibiting its transcriptional activation of certain promoters (Bruderer2013Role).

VEZF1 also physically interacts with ETV2, another transcription factor, in the regulation of the hematoendothelial lineage during embryogenesis. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, showing that VEZF1 can bind to both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of ETV2. Together, VEZF1 and ETV2 coactivate the Flt1 promoter, enhancing its activity more significantly than either factor alone (Das2023ETV2).

In cardiac biology, VEZF1 interacts with TEAD-1, a transcriptional enhancer factor, suggesting a role in regulating cardiac structure and function. This interaction is significant for the expression of the Myh7 gene, which is crucial for cardiac muscle contraction (Paavola2020Vezf1).

VEZF1 also binds to DNA, particularly at the 5' ends of genes, where it is associated with RNA polymerase II pausing, influencing transcription elongation and alternative splicing (Gowher2012Vezf1).
