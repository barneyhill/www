# CFAP206

## Overview
CFAP206 is a gene that encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 206, a critical component involved in the structural and functional integrity of cilia and flagella. This protein plays a pivotal role as a microtubule-docking adapter, particularly in the assembly and stability of radial spokes within the axoneme, which is essential for ciliary motility and function. CFAP206 is integral to processes such as respiratory function and sperm motility, and its dysfunction is linked to conditions like primary ciliary dyskinesia and Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the Flagella (Beckers2020The; Vasudevan2015FAP206). The gene's significance is underscored by its involvement in maintaining effective mucociliary clearance and its association with clinical manifestations when mutated (Beckers2020The; Graziani2024Genetic).

## Function
CFAP206 is a crucial protein involved in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CFAP206 localizes to the ciliary axoneme and basal body, playing a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of motile cilia. It is particularly important for the proper arrangement of radial spokes, which are critical for ciliary motility (Beckers2020The; Vasudevan2015FAP206).

CFAP206 acts as a microtubule-docking adapter for radial spoke 2 (RS2) and is involved in the assembly and stability of the axoneme, the core structural component of cilia and flagella. This function is essential for the modulation of ciliary beat frequency and the generation of the ciliary waveform, impacting processes such as respiratory function and sperm motility (Beckers2020The; Vasudevan2015FAP206).

In multiciliated cells, CFAP206 is necessary for effective mucociliary clearance, a process vital for maintaining respiratory health. Its absence can lead to defects similar to those observed in primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by impaired mucociliary clearance and male infertility due to largely immotile sperm (Beckers2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP206 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in ciliary function. CFAP206 is implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary motility, leading to symptoms such as recurrent respiratory infections, male infertility, and sometimes hydrocephalus (Beckers2020The). In mice, CFAP206 knockout results in hydrocephalus, defective mucociliary clearance, and male infertility, indicating its critical role in these physiological processes (Beckers2020The).

The gene is also associated with Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the Flagella (MMAF), a condition that causes reduced sperm motility due to flagellar defects. CFAP206 mutations contribute to MMAF, which shares phenotypic similarities with PCD, suggesting a continuum between these conditions (Graziani2024Genetic). Despite normal flagellar structure, sperm from CFAP206 mutants exhibit impaired motility, affecting fertilization capability (Beckers2020The).

CFAP206's role as a microtubule-docking adapter for radial spokes in cilia is crucial for maintaining ciliary structure and function. Mutations can lead to the absence of radial spokes, further contributing to ciliary dysfunction and associated clinical manifestations (Beckers2020The; Vasudevan2015FAP206).

## Interactions
CFAP206, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 206, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for ciliary function. In Tetrahymena, FAP206 acts as a microtubule-docking adapter for radial spoke 2 (RS2) and is essential for the assembly of RS2 and its associated inner dynein arm, dynein c. FAP206 interacts with radial spoke protein 3 (RSP3), a major component of the spoke stem, suggesting that FAP206 may require RSP3 for its assembly onto the axoneme (Vasudevan2015FAP206). The absence of FAP206 leads to the loss of dynein c and affects the stability of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) and the calmodulin and spoke complex (CSC), indicating its role in stabilizing RS2 and RS3 (Vasudevan2015FAP206).

In Chlamydomonas, FAP206 is part of a complex with RSP3 and interacts with the CSC component FAP91/CaM-IP2, which is necessary for the stable assembly of FAP91/CaM-IP2 into the axoneme (Vasudevan2015FAP206). CFAP206 also coimmunoprecipitates with FAP251, providing biochemical evidence for an RS2-RS3 bridge, although this structure is not visible by cryo-electron microscopy (Urbanska2015The). These interactions highlight CFAP206's role in the structural integrity and function of ciliary components.
