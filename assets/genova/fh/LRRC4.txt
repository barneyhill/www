# LRRC4

## Overview
The LRRC4 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat containing 4 protein, which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in protein-protein interactions and cell adhesion, playing a significant role in the development and function of the nervous system. It is predominantly expressed in brain tissue and is crucial for neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. The LRRC4 protein is characterized by an N-terminal LRR domain and a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, including those involved in synaptic signaling and cellular signaling pathways (Li2014Function; Feng2021LRRC4). Additionally, LRRC4 has been implicated in various neurological disorders and cancers, functioning as a tumor suppressor in gliomas and influencing immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (Wang2016The; Zhao2020LRRC4). Its role in modulating signaling pathways and cellular interactions underscores its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in cancer research.

## Structure
The LRRC4 protein is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) superfamily, characterized by its involvement in protein-protein interactions and cell adhesion. The structure of LRRC4 includes an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, which facilitates interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins (Feng2021LRRC4). The LRR domain is composed of multiple repeats that contribute to the protein's secondary structure, typically forming alpha-helices and beta-sheets (Li2014Function).

LRRC4 also contains a docking domain (D domain) at its C-terminus, crucial for binding and anchoring ERK1/2 in the cytoplasm. This domain is characterized by a specific sequence pattern, (R/K)1-2-X1-6-ØA-X-ØB, where ØA and ØB are hydrophobic residues (Wang2016The). The D domain plays a significant role in inhibiting ERK1/2 activation and nuclear translocation, thereby affecting cell proliferation and invasion in glioma cells (Wang2016The).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. LRRC4 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing for functional diversity (Zhao2020LRRC4). The specific arrangement of these domains and motifs contributes to the protein's role in cellular signaling and tumor suppression.

## Function
The LRRC4 gene, also known as NGL-2, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the development and function of the nervous system. It is predominantly expressed in brain tissue and is involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. LRRC4 is localized to the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses, where it recruits pre-and postsynaptic proteins, facilitating the formation of excitatory synapses and promoting neurite extension in dendritic segments of hippocampal neurons (Li2014Function; Zhang2021LRRC4).

LRRC4 interacts with netrin-G2, contributing to the development of axons, dendrites, and synapses, and is involved in lamina-specific dendritic segmentation (Li2014Function). It also forms a complex with NMDA receptor subunits, regulating NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission (Li2014Function). The protein's structure includes a signal peptide, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region with a PDZ domain-binding motif, suggesting its involvement in complex signaling pathways (Li2014Function).

In healthy human cells, LRRC4 is involved in axon differentiation by partnering with the PAR6, PAR3, and PKCζ complex, stabilizing axonal microtubules through the aPKCζ/MARK2 pathway (Li2017Novel; Zhang2021LRRC4).

## Clinical Significance
The LRRC4 gene, also known as NGL-2, is implicated in various neurological disorders and cancers due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), LRRC4 functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is often reduced or absent in these tumors, primarily due to promoter hypermethylation and miRNA dysregulation, which contribute to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Zhang2008Promoter; Wang2016The). The loss of LRRC4 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation, invasion, and resistance to chemotherapy, such as temozolomide (TMZ) (Wu2007LRRC4a; Feng2020Leucine-rich).

LRRC4 also plays a role in modulating the immune microenvironment in GBM by inhibiting tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells and promoting effector T cell expansion, which may enhance anti-tumor immunity (Li2017Novel). In epithelial ovarian cancer, LRRC4 suppresses metastasis by inhibiting the PIK3R1-mediated AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2020LRRC4). These findings underscore the clinical significance of LRRC4 in cancer pathogenesis and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The LRRC4 protein, also known as NGL-2, is involved in several critical interactions within cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with ERK1/2, a key component of the MAP kinase signaling pathway, through its D domain, anchoring ERK1/2 in the cytoplasm and inhibiting its activation and nuclear translocation. This interaction prevents the phosphorylation of downstream substrates, thereby suppressing cell proliferation and invasion in glioma cells (Wang2016The). LRRC4 also interacts with the RNA-binding protein SAM68, leading to the degradation of SAM68 and influencing the formation of circular RNA, specifically circCD44, by affecting the competitive binding of SAM68 and eIF4A3 to CD44 pre-mRNA (Feng2021LRRC4).

In addition to these interactions, LRRC4 forms complexes with PDPK1 and HSP90, promoting NF-κB nuclear translocation and cytokine production, which modulates Treg cell infiltration in the glioblastoma microenvironment (Feng2021LRRC4). It also binds to DEPTOR, inhibiting autophagy and increasing the sensitivity of glioblastomas to TMZ treatment, and interacts with PIK3R1, suppressing epithelial ovarian cancer metastasis by targeting the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway (Feng2021LRRC4).
