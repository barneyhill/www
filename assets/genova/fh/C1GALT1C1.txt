# C1GALT1C1

## Overview
C1GALT1C1, also known as Cosmc, is a gene that encodes the protein C1GALT1-specific chaperone 1, a molecular chaperone essential for the proper folding and function of the enzyme C1GALT1, also known as T-synthase. This chaperone is crucial in the O-glycosylation pathway, ensuring the stability and activity of C1GALT1 by preventing its misfolding and degradation. C1GALT1C1 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and lungs, and plays a vital role in the synthesis of core 1 O-glycans, which are important for protein stability, cell signaling, and immune response (Kiryluk2017GWAS; AcoTlachi2018Glycogene). The absence or malfunction of C1GALT1C1 can lead to significant pathologies, including cancer and IgA nephropathy, due to the exposure of Tn antigens and impaired glycosylation processes (Xia2022Update; Xiang2022Emerging).

## Function
C1GALT1C1, also known as Cosmc, is a molecular chaperone essential for the proper folding, stability, and activity of the enzyme C1GALT1, which is involved in the O-glycosylation pathway. This chaperone ensures that C1GALT1, also known as T-synthase, is correctly folded and stable, preventing its misfolding and degradation. C1GALT1C1 is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues, including IgA1-secreting cells, blood cells, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and lungs (Kiryluk2017GWAS; AcoTlachi2018Glycogene).

In healthy human cells, C1GALT1C1 is crucial for the synthesis of core 1 O-glycans, which are important for various biological processes, including protein stability, cell signaling, and immune response. The absence of functional C1GALT1C1 leads to the inactivation and degradation of C1GALT1, resulting in the loss of T-synthase activity and the absence of Tn antigen expression (Baenziger2012Moving; AcoTlachi2018Glycogene). This chaperone's activity is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing the exposure of Tn antigens, which are associated with various pathologies (Xia2022Update).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the C1GALT1C1 gene, also known as Cosmc, have significant clinical implications. In cancer, aberrant expression of Cosmc can lead to the production of Tn and STn antigens, which are associated with impaired expression of C1GALT1 and/or Cosmc, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. This is linked to processes such as cancer angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), making Cosmc a potential therapeutic target for tumors (Xiang2022Emerging).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lower expression of Cosmc is correlated with poorer overall survival and increased metastasis, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker. A predictive model incorporating Cosmc expression has shown improved prognostic capacity over traditional methods (Shen2020C1GALT1C1COSMC).

In IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of C1GALT1C1 has been associated with the disease in females, although no significant association was found in the overall population (Li2009Do). Downregulation of Cosmc in IgAN is linked to abnormal glycosylation of IgA1, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Xiang2022Emerging).

## Interactions
C1GALT1C1, also known as Cosmc, is a molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in the proper folding and function of the enzyme C1GALT1, which is involved in O-glycosylation. Cosmc interacts specifically with C1GALT1 in the endoplasmic reticulum to ensure its stability and proper folding. This interaction is essential for converting C1GALT1 into its active and dimeric forms before it enters the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the addition of galactose to GalNAc residues, forming the core 1 structure of mucin-type O-glycans (Wan2021Expression; Tian2024Unraveling).

In the absence of Cosmc, inactive T-synthase, the enzyme encoded by C1GALT1, accumulates and is degraded in a ubiquitin-/proteasome-dependent manner. Cosmc can also reactivate denatured T-synthase by forming stable complexes with it, thus restoring its enzyme activity in vitro (Xia2022Update). Mutations in Cosmc can lead to defects in C1GALT1, resulting in the exposure of the Tn antigen and associated syndromes (Xia2022Update). The interaction between Cosmc and C1GALT1 is critical for maintaining normal glycosylation processes, and disruptions in this interaction can contribute to various diseases, including cancer (Sun2021C1GALT1).
