# SPRED2

## Overview
SPRED2 is a gene that encodes the protein sprouty-related EVH1 domain containing 2, which is a crucial regulator of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by its tripartite domain structure, comprising an N-terminal EVH1 domain, a central c-Kit-binding domain (KBD), and a C-terminal SPR domain. These domains facilitate its interactions with various proteins, including neurofibromin and the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase, thereby modulating cellular responses to growth factors and maintaining normal cellular functions (Butler2023Sacylation; Lorenzo2020SPRED). SPRED2 is involved in critical physiological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and plays a significant role in hematopoiesis and tumor suppression (Lorenzo2020SPRED; Gong2020Progress). Alterations in SPRED2 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Vafeiadou2022Hyperactivation; Kachroo2012Evidence).

## Structure
SPRED2 is a protein characterized by a tripartite domain structure, which includes an N-terminal EVH1 domain, a central c-Kit-binding domain (KBD), and a C-terminal SPR domain. The EVH1 domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, specifically binding to neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor that regulates the MAPK pathway (Butler2023Sacylation; Lorenzo2020SPRED). The KBD domain allows SPRED2 to bind to the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase, which is crucial for its role in inhibiting MAPK signaling (Butler2023Sacylation; Lorenzo2020SPRED). The SPR domain is essential for membrane localization and Ras signaling inhibition by recruiting neurofibromin to the plasma membrane. This domain also facilitates the dimerization of SPRED proteins, which is important for their functional activity (KING2005Distinct; Lorenzo2020SPRED).

SPRED2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues, which influences its activity and interactions. Tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for its inhibitory function (KING2005Distinct). SPRED2 can form heterodimers with other SPRED proteins via the SPR domain, which is crucial for their interaction and regulatory functions (KING2005Distinct).

## Function
SPRED2 is a protein that plays a critical role in the negative regulation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In healthy human cells, SPRED2 functions by inhibiting the activation of RAF1, a key component of this pathway, thereby modulating cellular responses to growth factors (Lorenzo2020SPRED; Gong2020Progress). Structurally, SPRED2 contains an N-terminal EVH1 domain, a central c-Kit-binding domain (KBD), and a C-terminal Sprouty-related domain (SPR). The EVH1 domain is crucial for inhibiting ERK activation, while the SPR domain is involved in the localization of SPRED proteins to the membrane (Lorenzo2020SPRED; Gong2020Progress).

SPRED2 is widely expressed in adult tissues and is involved in regulating vital activities such as cell development, movement, and proliferation. It participates in physiological processes like tumor metastasis, hematopoietic regulation, and inflammatory reactions (Gong2020Progress). In the context of hematopoiesis, SPRED2 regulates the proliferation of megakaryocytes, granulocytes, and hematopoietic cells through c-Kit-mediated Ras-MAPK signaling (Lorenzo2020SPRED). Additionally, SPRED2 is involved in maintaining normal cellular functions by regulating signaling pathways that control cell growth, inflammation, and tissue integrity (Gong2020Progress).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SPRED2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor α-positive (ERα+) types, SPRED2 is often downregulated, leading to increased cell proliferation, migration, and resistance to tamoxifen, a common therapeutic agent. This resistance is associated with hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway, specifically through increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which enhances estrogen signaling and reduces tamoxifen efficacy (Vafeiadou2022Hyperactivation).

In prostate cancer, SPRED2 mRNA levels are significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to benign glands, especially in higher-grade tumors. This downregulation is linked to increased ERK phosphorylation, promoting cell proliferation and migration. Overexpression of SPRED2 in prostate cancer cells has been shown to inhibit these processes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Kachroo2012Evidence).

SPRED2 also plays a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its expression is reduced in tumor tissues. Overexpression of SPRED2 in HCC cell lines inhibits cell proliferation and migration, induces apoptosis, and negatively regulates the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, which are involved in tumor invasion and metastasis (Kawazoe2019The).

## Interactions
SPRED2, a member of the SPRED protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. It contains an N-terminal EVH1 domain, a central c-Kit-binding domain (KBD), and a C-terminal SPR domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins (Lorenzo2020SPRED). SPRED2 interacts with neurofibromin (NF1), a tumor suppressor that regulates the MAPK pathway by promoting Ras GTP hydrolysis. This interaction is mediated through the EVH1 domain (Butler2023Sacylation). SPRED2 also binds to the c-Kit receptor, a type of receptor tyrosine kinase, through its KBD domain, influencing hematopoiesis and inhibiting MAPK signaling (Lorenzo2020SPRED).

SPRED2 can form protein-protein dimers, which further regulate the Ras/MAPK pathway (Gong2020Progress). It also interacts with the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) through the LC3-interacting region in the SPR domain, enhancing autophagy in cancer cells (Gong2020Progress). Additionally, SPRED2 is S-acylated by the s-acyltransferase zDHHC17, despite lacking a consensus zDABM sequence for zDHHC17 binding, suggesting a novel mode of enzyme-substrate interaction (Butler2023Sacylation). These interactions highlight SPRED2's role in modulating cellular signaling and its potential impact on cancer progression.
