# SQOR

## Overview
The SQOR gene encodes the enzyme sulfide quinone oxidoreductase, a mitochondrial protein that plays a pivotal role in the detoxification and metabolism of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in human cells. This enzyme is categorized as a flavoprotein due to its reliance on the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor for its catalytic activity. Sulfide quinone oxidoreductase is anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane and is integral to the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway, where it catalyzes the conversion of H2S into less toxic forms, thereby preventing the accumulation of this potentially harmful gas. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular respiration and energy production by linking sulfide oxidation to the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Mutations in the SQOR gene have been implicated in Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder, highlighting the clinical significance of this enzyme in human health (Friederich2020Pathogenic; Landry2020Hydrogen).

## Structure
The human sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) protein is anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane through two amphipathic C-terminal helices, with the remainder of the protein facing the mitochondrial matrix (Landry2021Structural). The structure of SQOR includes tandem Rossmann fold repeats, which are crucial for binding the FAD cofactor. The first Rossmann fold binds the ADP moiety of FAD, while the second contains electropositive patches that interact with membrane phospholipids (Landry2021Structural). 

SQOR features a unique cysteine trisulfide configuration involving Cys-201 and Cys-379, which is essential for its catalytic activity. This configuration is distinct from other members of the flavin disulfide reductase superfamily, where cysteines typically form a disulfide bond (Landry2020Hydrogen). The trisulfide structure is sensitive to cyanolysis, which can lead to an inactive form of the enzyme, but it can be reformed by incubation with sulfide (Landry2020Hydrogen).

The protein's active site includes a large electropositive cavity that allows access to substrates such as glutathione and coenzyme A, supporting substrate promiscuity (Landry2020Hydrogen). The structure also features a hydrophobic tunnel that facilitates the movement of coenzyme Q (CoQ) between the active site and the lipid bilayer (Landry2020Hydrogen).

## Function
Sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in human cells. It catalyzes the first step in the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway, converting H2S into sulfane sulfur, which is then transferred to glutathione to form glutathione persulfide (GSSH) (Landry2020Hydrogen). This reaction is coupled with the reduction of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), integrating the process into the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Landry2020Hydrogen). 

SQOR's activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of H2S, a toxic gas that can inhibit complex IV in the electron transport chain, leading to respiratory poisoning (Landry2020Hydrogen). By facilitating the clearance of H2S, SQOR helps maintain cellular respiration and energy production. The enzyme's unique cysteine trisulfide cofactor enhances its reactivity, facilitating efficient sulfur transfer and electron movement (Landry2020Dismantling).

In addition to its detoxification role, SQOR contributes to cellular energy metabolism by linking sulfide oxidation to ATP production. It drives sulfide-derived electrons into the respiratory chain, specifically entering at complex III, resulting in more protons being pumped and more ATP being generated compared to other pathways (Landry2020Hydrogen).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SQOR gene, which encodes the enzyme sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, have been identified as a cause of Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and metabolic dysfunction. Pathogenic variants in SQOR lead to reduced enzyme activity, resulting in impaired hydrogen sulfide (H2S) metabolism and decreased activity of complex IV in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, despite normal protein levels and complex formation (Friederich2020Pathogenic). This disruption in mitochondrial function contributes to the clinical manifestations of Leigh syndrome, including neurological decline and increased lactic acid levels (Kanemaru2024Exclusion).

In mouse models, the exclusion of SQOR from mitochondria results in a Leigh-like disease, characterized by brain lesions, motor dysfunction, and shortened lifespan. This condition is due to the systemic accumulation of H2S and decreased complex IV activity, similar to human cases of Leigh syndrome caused by SQOR mutations (Kanemaru2024Exclusion). Potential therapeutic strategies for managing SQOR-related Leigh syndrome include treatments with metronidazole or a sulfur-restricted diet, which have been shown to alleviate symptoms by reducing H2S levels and normalizing complex IV activity in affected mice (Kanemaru2024Exclusion).

## Interactions
Sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins and molecules, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. SQOR interacts with the glycine-alanine dipeptide repeat protein (GA-DPR) from C9orf72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9-ALS). This interaction occurs specifically at the C-terminal fragment of SQOR, which includes part of the enzyme's active region. The interaction between GA-DPR and SQOR has been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in HMC3 microglia cells, contributing to neuroinflammation and ALS pathology (Fu2023GlycineAlanine).

The interaction between GA-DPR and SQOR was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation analysis, and immunofluorescence staining, which demonstrated partial colocalization of GA50, a variant of GA-DPR, with SQOR in the cytoplasm of HMC3 cells (Fu2023GlycineAlanine). This interaction is significant because it leads to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the cytoplasmic escape of mitochondrial DNA, which are associated with the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Fu2023GlycineAlanine).

SQOR also interacts with various nucleophiles, including glutathione (GSH) and coenzyme A (CoA), forming complexes that are crucial for its role in sulfide oxidation and energy production (Landry2020Hydrogen).
