# CA3

## Overview
The CA3 gene encodes the enzyme carbonic anhydrase 3, a member of the carbonic anhydrase family, which is characterized by its zinc metalloenzyme activity. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide, contributing to acid-base balance and ion transport within tissues. Carbonic anhydrase 3 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it aids in pH regulation and protects against oxidative damage, particularly under conditions such as iron deficiency and beta-thalassemia anemia. Structurally, CA3 is distinct from other carbonic anhydrase isoforms due to specific amino acid substitutions, resulting in reduced catalytic activity and insensitivity to many sulfonamide inhibitors. These unique structural and functional properties underscore its importance in muscle physiology and its potential role in mitigating oxidative stress (Supuran2007Carbonic; Supuran2002Carbonic; Imtaiyaz2013Structure).

## Structure
Carbonic anhydrase 3 (CA3) is a member of the carbonic anhydrase family, characterized by its zinc metalloenzyme activity, which catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. The primary structure of CA3 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that differ from other carbonic anhydrase isoforms, contributing to its unique functional properties (Supuran2002Carbonic).

The secondary structure of CA3 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a compact, globular tertiary structure typical of carbonic anhydrases. This structure features a zinc ion at the active site, coordinated by three histidine residues and a water molecule, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Supuran2016Structure).

CA3's quaternary structure may involve the formation of homodimers, although specific details on this aspect are less documented. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation can occur, potentially influencing the enzyme's activity and stability (Supuran2002Carbonic).

The enzyme's active site is distinct due to the presence of a lysine residue at position 64 and a phenylalanine residue at position 198, which contribute to its lower catalytic activity compared to other isoforms like CA II. These structural features also result in CA3's insensitivity to many sulfonamide inhibitors (Supuran2007Carbonic; Supuran2002Carbonic).

## Function
Carbonic anhydrase 3 (CA3) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in maintaining acid-base balance within tissues by catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it contributes to pH regulation and ion transport, facilitating rapid removal of CO2 and formation of bicarbonate, which are crucial for muscle function and metabolic processes (Imtaiyaz2013Structure).

CA3 is involved in protecting muscle tissues against oxidative damage, which is particularly important in conditions such as iron deficiency and beta-thalassemia anemia. Its protective function is linked to its ability to mitigate oxidative stress, suggesting a role in maintaining muscle health (Imtaiyaz2013Structure). Structurally, CA3 is unique among carbonic anhydrases due to specific amino acid substitutions that result in significantly reduced catalytic activity compared to other isozymes like CAII. These structural differences, including a lysine residue at position 64 instead of the conserved histidine, affect its proton transfer capabilities during catalysis (Imtaiyaz2013Structure).

Despite its lower catalytic efficiency, CA3's structural features and expression in muscle tissues underscore its importance in physiological processes related to muscle function and protection against oxidative stress (Imtaiyaz2013Structure).
