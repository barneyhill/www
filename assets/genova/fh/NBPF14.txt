# NBPF14

## Overview
NBPF14 is a gene that belongs to the neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF), which is predominantly located on chromosome 1. This gene encodes the protein NBPF member 14, which contains Olduvai domains, previously referred to as DUF1220. These domains are associated with cognitive functions and variations in brain size. The NBPF14 gene is highly expressed in skin and ovary tissues and has been identified as a potential biomarker for predicting the response to lithium treatment in women with bipolar disorders. The protein encoded by NBPF14 is predicted to have structural similarities to transcription factor complexes, indicating a possible role in DNA binding. NBPF14 is also implicated in brain development, particularly during fetal human neocortex development, and is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. The gene's location in the 1q21.1 region of chromosome 1, a hotspot for copy number variations, further underscores its potential involvement in these conditions (Leitão2022Clinical; Heide2021HumanSpecific; Wu2020The).

## Function
NBPF14 is a member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) genes, which are primarily located on chromosome 1. These genes encode proteins containing Olduvai domains, previously known as DUF1220, which are associated with cognitive functions and brain size variations (Wu2020The). NBPF14 is highly expressed in skin and ovary tissues and has been identified as a biomarker for predicting the response of women with bipolar disorders to lithium treatment (Wu2020The). The protein encoded by NBPF14 is predicted to have similar N-terminal regions to transcription factor complexes, suggesting a potential role in DNA binding (Wu2020The).

NBPF14 is also implicated in brain development, as it is one of the human-specific genes expressed during fetal human neocortex development. This expression pattern suggests a possible role in conditions like microcephaly (Heide2021HumanSpecific). The gene is part of a genomic sequence associated with autism, and its Olduvai domain copy number variations have been linked to autism severity (Davis2019A). Despite these associations, the specific cellular functions and regulation of NBPF14 in healthy human cells remain largely unknown (Wu2020The).

## Clinical Significance
The NBPF14 gene, part of the NBPF gene family, is located in the 1q21.1 region of chromosome 1, a genomic area known for its susceptibility to copy number variations (CNVs) that are associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders. Alterations in the NBPF14 gene, such as deletions or duplications, have been implicated in conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), and epilepsy (Leitão2022Clinical). The 1q21.1 region, where NBPF14 is located, is prone to non-allelic homologous recombination events, which can lead to genomic instability and contribute to these clinical conditions (Fiddes2019Paired).

The NBPF14 gene is also associated with the expansion of Olduvai sequences, which have been linked to brain size and cognitive function. Variations in the copy number of these sequences are connected to cognitive diseases such as autism, schizophrenia, microcephaly, and macrocephaly (Fiddes2019Paired). While the specific clinical significance of NBPF14 gene expression alterations alone has not been fully elucidated, its involvement in broader CNV findings suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of these disorders (Leitão2022Clinical).
