# GLT8D1

## Overview
GLT8D1 is a gene that encodes the protein glycosyltransferase 8 domain containing 1, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase 8 (GT8) family. This protein is characterized by its role as a UDP-dependent galactosyltransferase, involved in the glycosylation of proteins and lipids, a process essential for cellular function and integrity (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase). The protein is a type II membrane glycoprotein, featuring a GT-A fold catalytic domain, and is predominantly localized in the trans-Golgi network and endoplasmic reticulum (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase). GLT8D1 is implicated in various biological processes, including cellular communication and immune response, and has been associated with diseases such as familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance (CooperKnock2019Mutations; Yang2018Comprehensive).

## Structure
GLT8D1 is a type II membrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 41.9 kDa, consisting of 371 amino acids. It features a short cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 1-7), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 8-28), and a luminal catalytic domain (amino acids 29-371) (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase). The protein belongs to the GT8 family of glycosyltransferases and exhibits a GT-A fold catalytic domain, characterized by a Rossman-like fold that binds nucleotides and often requires a metal ion for activity (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase). 

The AlphaFold model of GLT8D1 identifies key structural motifs such as the DxD motif, G-loop, and a C-terminal His residue, which are typical of GT-A fold enzymes. It also includes a non-canonical 'xED' motif, suggesting a retaining catalytic mechanism (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase). The protein is predicted to have a single disulfide bond and three Asn-linked glycan sequons at positions N103, N249, and N257 (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase). 

GLT8D1 is predominantly N-glycosylated with complex N-glycans, which may influence its function and stability (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase). The protein's structure and glycosylation are crucial for its role in glycosyltransferase activity and potential involvement in disease mechanisms.

## Function
GLT8D1 encodes a UDP-dependent galactosyltransferase involved in glycosylation processes, specifically transferring glycosyl residues from activated sugar donors onto nucleophilic acceptors to form glycosidic bonds (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase). This enzyme is part of the glycosyltransferase 8 (GT8) family and is characterized by a GT-A fold structure, which includes features such as a DxD motif, G-loop, and C-terminal His residue essential for sugar nucleotide donor binding (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase). GLT8D1 primarily utilizes UDP-Gal as a sugar donor and is involved in the glycosylation of proteins or lipids, a critical process for maintaining cellular functions and integrity (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase).

The protein is localized in the trans-Golgi network and endoplasmic reticulum, where it participates in the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase). Despite its low galactosyltransferase activity, GLT8D1 is implicated in the synthesis of complex glycans, which may serve as better substrates for the enzyme (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase). The enzyme's activity is crucial for cellular communication and immune response, impacting processes such as protein folding and stability (Vicente2023Glycosyltransferase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GLT8D1 gene are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons. These mutations, particularly those located in exon 4, are significantly enriched in familial ALS cases and are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The mutations often affect highly conserved amino acids near the substrate binding site, leading to reduced enzyme activity and increased substrate affinity, which may result in a dominant-negative effect (CooperKnock2019Mutations). Functional studies have demonstrated that these mutations increase cytotoxicity and impair motor function in cell and zebrafish models, supporting their role in ALS pathogenesis (YousefianJazi2020Pathogenic; CooperKnock2019Mutations).

GLT8D1 has also been identified as a risk gene for schizophrenia (SCZ) through integrative genomic analyses. Variants in GLT8D1 are associated with altered synaptic transmission and neurodevelopmental processes, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The gene's expression is significantly downregulated in schizophrenia cases, suggesting its involvement in the disorder's neurodevelopmental aspects (Yang2018Comprehensive). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance in both neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
GLT8D1, a glycosyltransferase, is known to physically interact with the CD133 protein, particularly in the context of glioma stem cells. This interaction is crucial for the glycosylation and stabilization of CD133, which in turn activates Wnt signaling, promoting glioma progression (Liu2022Hypoxiainduced). The interaction between GLT8D1 and CD133 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, which demonstrate that both endogenous and exogenous GLT8D1 can bind to CD133 (Liu2022Hypoxiainduced). Immunofluorescent staining has been used to visualize this interaction and their localization within cells (Liu2022Hypoxiainduced).

GLT8D1's role in maintaining CD133 stability is mediated through N-linked glycosylation, which prevents CD133 degradation via the endosomal-lysosomal pathway (Liu2022Hypoxiainduced). The interaction is significant for glioma stem cell maintenance and resistance to therapies, as it helps maintain the 'stemness' of these cells under hypoxic conditions (Liu2022Hypoxiainduced). The study also highlights the potential of a peptide, FECD133, which can inhibit the interaction between GLT8D1 and CD133, leading to the degradation of CD133 and reduced glioma progression (Liu2022Hypoxiainduced).
