# OR9G4

## Overview
The OR9G4 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 9 subfamily G member 4, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. As a GPCR, it features a characteristic seven-transmembrane domain structure that facilitates signal transduction across the cell membrane, allowing the receptor to interact with specific odorants and initiate a cellular response. The OR9G4 protein is part of a large family of olfactory receptors, each with unique amino acid sequences that confer specificity for different odorant molecules. This specificity is essential for the discrimination of a wide array of odors, contributing to the complexity and sensitivity of the olfactory system (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
The OR9G4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which belongs to the class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitates their role in signal transduction across the cell membrane. The primary structure of the OR9G4 protein consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its unique properties and function. 

In terms of secondary structure, the OR9G4 protein likely contains alpha helices, which are common in GPCRs and contribute to the formation of the transmembrane domains. The tertiary structure of OR9G4 involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, allowing the receptor to interact with specific odorant molecules. While the quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, olfactory receptors typically function as monomers.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in olfactory receptors, including OR9G4. These modifications can influence the receptor's stability, localization, and activity. The presence of these modifications suggests a level of regulation and functional diversity in the receptor's role in olfaction. The specific domains and prominent folds of OR9G4 contribute to its ability to detect and respond to odorant molecules.
