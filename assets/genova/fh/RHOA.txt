# RHOA

## Overview
RHOA is a gene that encodes the protein ras homolog family member A, a small GTPase belonging to the Rho family. This protein functions as a molecular switch in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cell shape, motility, and division. RHOA cycles between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state, a process modulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (Burridge2019Mechanotransduction:; Marjoram2014Regulation). The protein is involved in mechanotransduction, influencing cellular responses to mechanical forces, and plays a role in the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, which are crucial for cell adhesion and migration (Arthur2001RhoA; Ridley1992Thea). RHOA's activity and interactions with various proteins, such as Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK1/2), underscore its importance in cellular signaling pathways and functions (Xiang2013Lysophospholipid).

## Structure
The RHOA protein is a small GTPase involved in signal transduction pathways, characterized by its ability to cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain, which includes key regions such as the switch I and II regions that undergo conformational changes upon nucleotide binding (Dvorsky2004Always). The secondary structure of RHOA includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with specific domains like the α2-helix playing crucial roles in interactions with binding partners (Dvorsky2004Always).

The tertiary structure of RHOA is a compact, globular form featuring a GTP-binding domain. This structure is essential for its function as a molecular switch, allowing it to interact with various regulatory proteins, including guanine nucleotide-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs), and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (Dvorsky2004Always). RHOA can form quaternary structures by interacting with other proteins, such as the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain, which involves a significant interface and specific residues critical for binding affinity and GTPase activity (Bao2016Structural).

Common post-translational modifications of RHOA include prenylation and phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and localization (Dvorsky2004Always). These modifications are crucial for its function in cellular processes such as cell shape, polarity, and motility.

## Function
RHOA, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, functions as a molecular switch in various cellular processes by cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. It plays a critical role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division (Burridge2019Mechanotransduction:; Marjoram2014Regulation). RHOA is involved in the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, structures that are crucial for cell adhesion and migration (Arthur2001RhoA; Ridley1992Thea).

RHOA activity is modulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which regulate its cycling between active and inactive states (Marjoram2014Regulation). In its active form, RHOA interacts with effectors such as Rho kinase (ROCK) to promote myosin II activity, enhancing contractile force and actin filament stability (Burridge2019Mechanotransduction:; Lessey2012From).

RHOA is also involved in mechanotransduction, the process by which cells sense and respond to mechanical forces, impacting cellular responses such as proliferation and differentiation (Burridge2019Mechanotransduction:; Lessey2012From). It is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, influencing processes like cell spreading and migration by promoting membrane protrusion and polarity (Arthur2001RhoA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RHOA gene, particularly the Gly17Val (G17V) mutation, are significantly associated with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma with T follicular helper phenotype (PTCL-TFH). This mutation is found in 50-70% of AITL cases and is linked to the neoplastic T-cell population, aiding in early detection and diagnosis of these lymphomas (Dobson2021Early; Lee2019RHOA). The RHOA G17V mutation is considered a potential biomarker for cytological assessment in AITL, providing clinical value in subclassifying T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (Lee2019RHOA). 

The mutation disrupts normal RHOA signaling, potentially by sequestering activated Guanine Exchange Factor (GEF) proteins, and is associated with changes in cell morphology and stress fiber formation (Palomero2014Recurrent). In addition to AITL, RHOA mutations have been identified in other lymphoid malignancies, such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, as well as in some solid tumors like diffuse-type gastric carcinoma (Lee2019RHOA). These mutations are linked to the oncogenesis of nodal mature T-cell lymphomas, contributing to their pathogenesis and progression (de2022Tumor).

## Interactions
RHOA, a small GTPase, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It interacts with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as p63RhoGEF, which is activated by Gα_q subfamily members of heterotrimeric G proteins. This interaction is crucial for the activation of RhoA, as it facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP, transitioning RhoA to its active state (Lutz2007Structure). RHOA also forms complexes with ARHGEF1, where specific interactions like D59-K567 and Q63-T566 contribute to the stability and function of the complex (Gheyouche2021Structural).

RHOA interacts with Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK1/2), which are downstream effectors involved in actin-myosin cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion (Xiang2013Lysophospholipid). It also engages with protein kinase D1 (PKD1) in a signaling pathway that activates NF-κB, a transcription factor involved in cell proliferation and survival (Cowell2009Loss). Additionally, RHOA is regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) like p190RhoGAP, which inactivate RHOA by stimulating its intrinsic GTPase activity, leading to the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP (Arthur2001RhoA). These interactions highlight RHOA's role in modulating various signaling pathways and cellular functions.
