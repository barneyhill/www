# UBE2S

## Overview
UBE2S is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 S, a pivotal component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This enzyme is primarily involved in the elongation of K11-linked ubiquitin chains, a process crucial for the targeted degradation of cell cycle regulators by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (Wu2010UBE2S). As a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UBE2S plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein turnover, particularly during mitosis. The protein's activity is tightly regulated through mechanisms such as autoinhibition and dimerization, ensuring precise control over ubiquitin chain elongation (Liess2020Dimerization; Liess2019Autoinhibition). UBE2S's interactions with various proteins, including β-Catenin and the APC/C complex, underscore its importance in cell cycle regulation and its potential implications in cancer progression (Li2018Ube2s; MartinezChacin2020Ubiquitin).

## Structure
UBE2S is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, particularly in elongating ubiquitin chains on substrates associated with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (MartinezChacin2020Ubiquitin). The primary structure of UBE2S includes a UBC domain, which spans residues 1-156 and contains the catalytic cysteine essential for its enzymatic activity (MartinezChacin2020Ubiquitin). This domain is critical for the enzyme's function in ubiquitin transfer.

The secondary structure of UBE2S is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a globular tertiary structure. The protein can dimerize, with the dimerization interface involving specific residues such as Leu 107, His 111, and Leu 114 in the UBC domain (Liess2020Dimerization). This dimerization is facilitated by the hydrophobic face of helix αB and is energetically favored (Liess2020Dimerization).

UBE2S also contains a C-terminal peptide (CTP, residues 204-222), which is crucial for its recruitment to the APC/C and enhances substrate priming and multiubiquitination (MartinezChacin2020Ubiquitin). The C-terminal extension, particularly the C-helix, plays a role in dimerization and is involved in the regulation of UBE2S activity (Liess2020Dimerization). Autoubiquitination of UBE2S at Lys +5, located five residues from the active site, serves as a regulatory mechanism to prevent the enzyme from being reloaded with ubiquitin, thus inhibiting its activity (Liess2019Autoinhibition).

## Function
UBE2S (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 S) is a critical component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, primarily involved in the elongation of K11-linked ubiquitin chains on substrates targeted by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). This process is essential for the proteasomal degradation of cell cycle regulators, ensuring proper cell cycle progression, particularly during mitosis (Wu2010UBE2S). UBE2S operates by extending ubiquitin chains that have been initiated by other E2 enzymes, such as UbcH10 or UbcH5, and its activity is dependent on the APC/C complex (Wu2010UBE2S).

In healthy human cells, UBE2S is involved in regulating protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, forming transient macromolecular assemblies crucial for its function in ubiquitin linkage formation (Liess2020Dimerization). UBE2S exists in an autoinhibited, dimeric state that prevents premature ubiquitin transfer, thus regulating its activity and maintaining a reservoir of the enzyme (Liess2020Dimerization). This regulation is crucial for balancing the need for rapid enzyme responses with the prevention of unnecessary auto-ubiquitination and degradation (Liess2020Dimerization). UBE2S's activity is modulated by autoubiquitination, particularly at a conserved lysine residue, Lys +5, which provides autoinhibition by interfering with the E1-mediated transfer of ubiquitin to the E2 (Liess2019Autoinhibition).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2S (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 S) is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In prostate cancer, UBE2S is overexpressed in metastatic tissues compared to primary sites, correlating with poor prognosis and shorter progression-free and overall survival. It promotes tumor cell proliferation and metastasis by degrading p16 and stabilizing β-catenin, which is crucial for WNT signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Peng2022UBE2S).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), UBE2S is highly expressed, particularly in the nucleus, and is associated with poor prognosis. It interacts with TRIM28 to enhance the ubiquitination of p27, promoting cell cycle progression. UBE2S also contributes to chemoresistance by decreasing PTEN levels and activating the AKT pathway (Zhang2021UBE2S; Gui2021UBE2S).

In glioma, UBE2S expression is linked to higher tumor grades and resistance to chemo-radiotherapy. It correlates with PTEN mutations and EGFR amplification, contributing to tumor progression and treatment resistance. UBE2S's role in DNA repair mechanisms, particularly non-homologous end joining, further enhances its contribution to treatment resistance (Hu2021Molecular).

UBE2S is also overexpressed in ovarian cancer, where it promotes cell proliferation and migration, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Zhang2022UBE2S).

## Interactions
UBE2S interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in the ubiquitination process. It forms a complex with β-Catenin, stabilizing it through K11-linked polyubiquitination, which is crucial for mesendoderm specification and colorectal cancer development (Li2018Ube2s). UBE2S also interacts with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), where it acts as a secondary E2 enzyme to elongate ubiquitin chains on substrates. This interaction is facilitated by its binding to a groove formed by the APC2 and APC4 subunits, enhancing the rate of UBE2C-dependent ubiquitination (MartinezChacin2020Ubiquitin).

UBE2S's interaction with APC/C is regulated by Emi2, which inhibits UBE2S binding during CSF arrest. Upon CSF release, Emi2 degradation allows UBE2S to bind to APC/C, facilitating cyclin degradation (Sako2014Emi2). In urinary bladder cancer, UBE2S interacts with TSC1, a tumor suppressor, targeting it for ubiquitination and potentially affecting the mTOR signaling pathway (Tang2021UBE2S). These interactions highlight UBE2S's role in cell cycle regulation and cancer progression.
