# GPRASP2

## Overview
GPRASP2, or G protein-coupled receptor associated sorting protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The protein, categorized as a sorting protein, plays a crucial role in receptor internalization, recycling, and degradation, thereby influencing signal transduction pathways. GPRASP2 is particularly significant in the context of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, where it facilitates the transport of the Smoothened (Smo) protein to the primary cilium, a key signaling hub. Additionally, GPRASP2 interacts with the huntingtin protein, suggesting its involvement in receptor sorting and degradation within the central nervous system. The gene's mutations have been linked to clinical conditions such as X-linked recessive syndromic hearing loss and may play a role in the progression of Wilms tumor and Huntington's disease (Vastrad2020Hub; Liu2017Dynamic; Xing2017GPRASP2; Jung2016Pitchfork; Horn2006Huntingtin).

## Function
GPRASP2 (G protein-coupled receptor associated sorting protein 2) is involved in the regulation and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) within cells. It plays a critical role in receptor internalization, recycling, and degradation, impacting signal transduction pathways. GPRASP2 is active in endosomal compartments, influencing cellular responses and maintaining receptor homeostasis (Liu2017Dynamic).

In the context of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, GPRASP2 is essential for the transport of the Smoothened (Smo) protein to the primary cilium, a key signaling hub. It forms a complex with Smo and Pifo, facilitating the anterograde transport of Smo into the primary cilium, which is crucial for Hh pathway activation (Jung2016Pitchfork). This process is regulated by motor proteins like Kif3a and is enhanced by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling (Jung2016Pitchfork).

GPRASP2 also interacts with the huntingtin protein (htt) in neurons, suggesting a role in receptor sorting and degradation, particularly in the central nervous system (Horn2006Huntingtin). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular signaling and receptor regulation, contributing to various cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPRASP2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. GPRASP2 has been identified as a novel causative gene for X-linked recessive syndromic hearing loss. A specific 2-bp missense mutation in exon 5 of GPRASP2, resulting in an amino acid change (p.A573N), has been associated with hearing loss characterized by abnormal auricular shapes and inner ear malformations. This mutation was found in a family with X-linked syndromic hearing loss and was not present in 300 ethnicity-matched controls, suggesting its pathogenic role (Xing2017GPRASP2).

In Wilms tumor, a childhood kidney cancer, GPRASP2 expression levels are significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to normal kidney tissues. This downregulation is associated with tumor purity and may play a role in the progression of the disease (Vastrad2020Hub).

GPRASP2 also interacts with the huntingtin protein, and this interaction is enhanced by the presence of expanded polyglutamine repeats, which are characteristic of Huntington's disease. This suggests a potential role for GPRASP2 in the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disorder (Horn2006Huntingtin).

## Interactions
GPRASP2 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and components of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. It forms a heterotrimeric complex with Smoothened (Smo) and Pifo, which is essential for the activation of the Hh pathway. This interaction facilitates the translocation of Smo into the primary cilium, a critical step for Hh pathway activation (Jung2016Pitchfork). GPRASP2 interacts with the cytoplasmic tails of various GPCRs, including the D2 dopamine receptor, δ opioid receptor 1, β-2 adrenergic receptor, and D4 dopamine receptor, influencing receptor internalization and signaling (Liu2017Dynamic).

The interaction between GPRASP2 and Smo is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which enhances the affinity of Smo for GPRASP2 and Pifo (Jung2016Pitchfork). GPRASP2 also interacts with huntingtin, which is involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking (Jung2016Pitchfork). The GASP motifs within GPRASP2 are crucial for its interaction with GPCRs, as demonstrated by experiments showing that mutations in these motifs significantly reduce interaction with GPCRs (ZederLutz2023Characterization; Bornert2013Identification).
