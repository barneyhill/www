# PITRM1

## Overview
PITRM1 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial matrix enzyme pitrilysin metallopeptidase 1, a member of the M16C subfamily of metalloproteases. This enzyme is integral to mitochondrial proteostasis, primarily through its role in degrading mitochondrial targeting sequences and amyloid-beta peptides, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and preventing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (Brunetti2021Role; Brunetti2015Defective). The protein is characterized by a zinc-binding motif essential for its catalytic activity, and it operates within a large catalytic chamber formed by two homologous domains (Liang2022Structural). PITRM1's activity is vital for cellular homeostasis, impacting mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species levels, thereby influencing overall organismal health (Ivanyuk2020Loss). Mutations in the PITRM1 gene have been linked to various neurodegenerative conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Brunetti2021Role).

## Structure
PITRM1, also known as presequence protease (PreP), is a mitochondrial matrix metalloprotease involved in the degradation of mitochondrial targeting sequences and amyloid-beta peptides. The protein is a member of the M16C subfamily of metalloproteases and is characterized by its zinc-binding motif, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Brunetti2021Role; Liang2022Structural).

Structurally, PITRM1 is a 117 kDa enzyme composed of two homologous domains, each approximately 50 kDa, forming a large catalytic chamber. These domains are connected by a hinge region that facilitates the enzyme's open and closed conformational states, essential for its function (Brunetti2021Role; Liang2022Structural). The enzyme's active site residues are located in both halves, interacting to form a peptidasome chamber that selectively binds and degrades unfolded β-strands of substrate peptides (Liang2022Structural).

PITRM1 has three isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, which may influence its function and localization (Brunetti2021Role). The enzyme's structure is similar to that of the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), another zinc metallopeptidase, but differs in its monomeric state and conformational dynamics (Liang2022Structural). The structural integrity and function of PITRM1 are influenced by specific motifs, such as the conserved strand-loop-strand motif containing the R183 residue, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Smith‐Carpenter2018Functional).

## Function
PITRM1, also known as pitrilysin metallopeptidase 1, is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and proteostasis in healthy human cells. It is responsible for degrading oligopeptides, including mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS) that are cleaved from proteins imported into mitochondria. This degradation is essential to prevent the accumulation of MTS within the mitochondrial matrix, which can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction (Ivanyuk2020Loss; Brunetti2015Defective).

PITRM1 also degrades amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. By preventing the accumulation of Aβ within mitochondria, PITRM1 helps maintain mitochondrial integrity and function, thereby playing a protective role against neurodegeneration (Brunetti2021Role; Brunetti2015Defective).

In healthy cells, PITRM1 ensures the proper maturation of mitochondrial proteins by degrading precursor proteins and processing intermediates, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Brunetti2021Role). The enzyme's activity is crucial for cellular homeostasis and energy production, impacting overall organismal health (Ivanyuk2020Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PITRM1 gene are associated with a range of neurodegenerative conditions due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Biallelic mutations in PITRM1 can lead to complex phenotypes, including intellectual disability, ataxic syndrome, and psychosis, often accompanied by cerebellar atrophy and mitochondrial abnormalities in muscle biopsies (Brunetti2021Role). Specific mutations, such as c.548G>A and c.2795C>T, result in reduced gene expression and are linked to amyloidotic neurodegeneration (Brunetti2021Role). The PITRM1 R183Q mutation, identified in a Norwegian family, causes reduced protein levels and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to neurodegenerative processes (Brunetti2021Role).

PITRM1 deficiency is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease-like pathology. Loss of PITRM1 function leads to the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides and other proteins, such as TDP-43 and Tau, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Brunetti2021Role). In human cerebral organoids, PITRM1 knockout results in Alzheimer's disease-like features, including protein aggregates and tau pathology (Pérez2020Loss). The accumulation of amyloid-beta and mitochondrial targeting sequences due to reduced PITRM1 activity is noted in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for PITRM1 in mitigating these effects (Brunetti2021Role).

## Interactions
PITRM1, or pitrilysin metallopeptidase 1, is a mitochondrial protease that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis by degrading mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS) and amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides. It interacts with several mitochondrial proteins, including the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) and mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP). These interactions are essential for the proper processing and maturation of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Dysfunctional PITRM1 activity can lead to the accumulation of Aβ, MTS, and octapeptides, which can inhibit MPP and MIP, resulting in the aggregation of unprocessed precursor proteins and contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction (Brunetti2021Role).

PITRM1 also shares structural similarities with the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which is involved in the degradation of beta-amyloid and other peptides. This similarity suggests potential overlapping functions in peptide degradation pathways (Brunetti2021Role). The interaction between PITRM1 and these mitochondrial peptidases highlights its role in the mitochondrial quality control system, which is crucial for preventing the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Pérez2020Loss).
