# C2CD3

## Overview
C2CD3 is a gene that encodes the C2 domain-containing 3 centriole elongation regulator, a protein integral to the process of ciliogenesis. This protein is characterized by multiple C2 domains, which are calcium-dependent lipid-binding motifs, and plays a pivotal role in the assembly of centriolar distal appendages necessary for ciliary vesicle docking and recruitment of ciliogenic proteins (Ye2014C2cd3; Chang2021Centriolar). The C2CD3 protein is involved in the recruitment of several key proteins to the ciliary basal body, facilitating the initiation of ciliogenesis and ensuring proper cilium formation and function (Ye2014C2cd3). Mutations in the C2CD3 gene are associated with various ciliopathies, including Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome type 14 and Joubert syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance in developmental abnormalities (ThauvinRobinet2014The; Boczek2018Characterization).

## Structure
The C2CD3 protein is characterized by multiple C2 domains, which are calcium-dependent lipid-binding motifs. It contains a tandem array of five classical Protein Kinase C C2 domains (PKC-C2) at the carboxyl terminus and a novel, divergent N-terminal C2 domain (C2CD3N-C2) at the amino terminus (Chang2021Centriolar; Cortés2016Mutations). The PKC-C2 domains are predicted to be involved in targeting proteins to the cell membrane, suggesting a membrane-anchoring function (Chang2021Centriolar). The C2CD3N-C2 domain is highly conserved among orthologs and is involved in microtubule binding/stabilization, membrane targeting, and vesicle docking (Chang2021Centriolar).

C2CD3 is encoded by a gene with 33 exons and has 8 splice variants, resulting in four distinct protein isoforms. The 255 kDa isoform is expressed across all tissues, the 232 kDa isoform at lower levels, and the 205 kDa isoform is robustly expressed in heart tissue (Chang2021Centriolar). The protein's structure and function are influenced by these isoforms, although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The C2CD3 gene encodes a centriolar protein that plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, in healthy human cells. C2CD3 is essential for the assembly of centriolar distal appendages, which are necessary for docking ciliary vesicles to the mother centriole and recruiting other ciliogenic proteins. It facilitates the recruitment of several distal appendage proteins, including Sclt1, Ccdc41, Cep89, Fbf1, and Cep164, as well as Tau tubulin kinase 2 (Ttbk2) to the ciliary basal body. This recruitment is critical for the removal of Cp110, a step required to initiate ciliogenesis (Ye2014C2cd3).

C2CD3 is also involved in the recruitment of intraflagellar transport proteins Ift88 and Ift52 to the mother centriole, which are essential for cilium formation and function (Ye2014C2cd3). The protein localizes to centriolar satellites and the distal ends of centrioles, indicating its active role in these cellular structures (Ye2014C2cd3). In the absence of C2CD3, ciliogenesis is impaired, leading to defects in ciliary vesicle docking and subsequent cilium formation, which can result in a range of ciliopathies (Ye2014C2cd3; Cortés2016Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C2CD3 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in the structure or function of cilia. Notably, C2CD3 mutations are linked to Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome type 14 (OFD14), characterized by facial, oral, and digital anomalies, as well as microcephaly and cerebral malformations (ThauvinRobinet2014The; Chang2021Centriolar). These mutations can lead to severe craniofacial malformations due to impaired cilia-dependent signaling pathways, such as the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is crucial for cranial neural crest cell migration and differentiation (Chang2021Centriolar).

C2CD3 variants have also been implicated in Joubert syndrome, which presents with neurological, renal, and retinal phenotypes, and skeletal dysplasia (Boczek2018Characterization). The phenotypic spectrum of C2CD3-mediated diseases is broad, ranging from lethal to viable conditions, and includes brain malformations like the Dandy-Walker malformation and the 'molar tooth' sign observed in MRI scans (Boczek2018Characterization).

The gene's role in centriole elongation and cilia formation is critical, and its dysfunction can result in a variety of developmental abnormalities, highlighting its clinical significance in ciliopathies (ThauvinRobinet2014The).

## Interactions
C2CD3 is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for centriole elongation and ciliogenesis. It physically interacts with OFD1, a protein also implicated in oral-facial-digital syndromes, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction occurs at the distal end of centrioles, where C2CD3 and OFD1 form a complex that is important for centriole elongation (ThauvinRobinet2014The).

C2CD3 also interacts with CEP120, a protein necessary for centriole appendage assembly and ciliogenesis. The interaction between C2CD3 and CEP120 is crucial for the recruitment of C2CD3 to the distal ends of centrioles, which is necessary for proper centriole elongation. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown assays (Tsai2019CEP120).

Additionally, C2CD3 is associated with centriolar satellites through interactions with Pcm1 and Bbs4, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation analysis. These interactions are important for the localization of C2CD3 to centriolar satellites, although C2CD3 is not required for the integrity of these structures (Ye2014C2cd3).
