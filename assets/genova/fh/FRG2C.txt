# FRG2C

## Overview
The FRG2C gene encodes the protein FSHD region gene 2 family member C, which is part of a family of proteins associated with the genetic disorder facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological role remains to be fully elucidated. The FRG2C gene is located on chromosome 10 and is one of several genes implicated in the pathogenesis of FSHD, a condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. The protein encoded by FRG2C is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it is thought to play a role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure, contributing to the complex molecular mechanisms underlying FSHD (Qiu2020aarFDC).
