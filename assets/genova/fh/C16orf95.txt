# C16orf95

## Overview
C16orf95 is a gene located on chromosome 16 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 16 open reading frame 95. While the specific biological function of this protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular processes and clinical conditions. The protein is not currently categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, but its involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and certain tumors suggests it may play a role in cellular signaling or structural integrity (Handrigan2013Deletions; Jansen2022Genomewide; Gao2020Differential). Research continues to explore the exact pathways and interactions in which C16orf95 is involved, highlighting its potential significance in both normal physiology and disease states.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The C16orf95 gene, located on chromosome 16, has been implicated in several clinical conditions, although its specific role remains under investigation. Deletions in the 16q24.2 region, which include C16orf95, have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), as well as congenital renal malformations like bilateral hydronephrosis (Handrigan2013Deletions). These findings suggest that C16orf95, along with other genes in the region, may play a role in cognitive and renal development.

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, C16orf95 has been identified as a novel locus associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, particularly pTau levels, suggesting a potential link to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's pathology (Jansen2022Genomewide). The gene has also been associated with brain structural changes, such as lateral ventricular volume, which are relevant to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis (Jansen2022Genomewide).

Additionally, mutations in C16orf95 have been observed in mesoderm-derived tumors, particularly in uterus tumors, indicating a possible role in tumorigenesis (Gao2020Differential). Despite these associations, the precise mechanisms by which C16orf95 contributes to these conditions are not fully understood, necessitating further research.
