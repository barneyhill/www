# EXOSC5

## Overview
EXOSC5 is a gene that encodes the protein exosome component 5, a crucial structural subunit of the RNA exosome complex. This complex is essential for RNA processing and degradation, functioning in both the nucleus and cytoplasm to maintain cellular RNA homeostasis. The protein exosome component 5 is part of the core ring structure of the exosome, interacting with other subunits such as EXOSC3, EXOSC8, and EXOSC9, which are vital for the stability and integrity of the complex (Slavotinek2020Biallelic). Although exosome component 5 contains an RNase PH-like domain, it lacks catalytic activity and instead plays a structural role within the exosome (Slavotinek2020Biallelic). The RNA exosome is involved in the 3'-5' trimming of RNA molecules, including mRNA, rRNA, and snRNA, contributing to RNA quality control and regulation of gene expression (Slavotinek2020Biallelic). Mutations in EXOSC5 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and cardiac conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Slavotinek2020Biallelic; Calame2021Risk). Additionally, EXOSC5 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is upregulated and promotes cell proliferation through the STAT3 signaling pathway (Zhang2022Integrated).

## Function
EXOSC5 is a structural subunit of the RNA exosome complex, which is essential for RNA processing and degradation in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The RNA exosome is involved in the 3'-5' trimming of RNA molecules, including the processing of 7S pre-rRNA to produce mature 5.8S rRNA, and is crucial for maintaining normal cellular RNA levels and function (Slavotinek2020Biallelic). EXOSC5 is part of the core ring of the RNA exosome complex, interacting directly with other subunits such as EXOSC3, EXOSC8, and EXOSC9, which are important for the stability and integrity of the complex (Slavotinek2020Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, EXOSC5 plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the RNA exosome complex, which is necessary for proper RNA processing and cellular function (Slavotinek2020Biallelic). The protein contains an RNase PH-like domain, which, although lacking catalytic activity, is important for its structural role within the exosome (Slavotinek2020Biallelic). The RNA exosome's function is vital for the degradation and processing of various RNA species, including mRNA, rRNA, and snRNA, contributing to RNA quality control and regulation of gene expression (Slavotinek2020Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXOSC5 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Biallelic variants in EXOSC5 have been linked to developmental delays, short stature, cerebellar hypoplasia, and motor weakness. These clinical features overlap with those seen in mutations of other RNA exosome subunit genes, such as EXOSC3, EXOSC8, and EXOSC9, which are also involved in neurodevelopmental conditions (Slavotinek2020Biallelic). Specific pathogenic variants, like p.Leu206His and p.Thr114Ile, have been shown to impair RNA processing and alter interactions with other exosome subunits, potentially affecting the stability and function of the RNA exosome complex (Slavotinek2020Biallelic).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, EXOSC5 mutations have been implicated in cardiac conditions. A study identified compound heterozygous variants in EXOSC5 associated with cardiac conduction abnormalities, including sinus node dysfunction and ventricular tachycardia, which can lead to sudden cardiac death (Calame2021Risk).

Alterations in EXOSC5 expression have also been linked to cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EXOSC5 is upregulated, promoting cell proliferation through the STAT3 signaling pathway. This overexpression correlates with clinical cancer stage and poorer survival outcomes, suggesting a role for EXOSC5 in cancer progression (Zhang2022Integrated).

## Interactions
EXOSC5, a component of the RNA exosome complex, participates in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is a structural subunit of the exosome complex, which is involved in RNA processing and degradation. EXOSC5 interacts with other exosome components such as EXOSC3, EXOSC8, and EXOSC9, forming part of the core structure of the exosome complex. These interactions are crucial for the integrity and function of the RNA exosome, as they facilitate RNA metabolism and processing (Slavotinek2020Biallelic).

Pathogenic variants in EXOSC5, such as p.L206H and p.T114I, have been shown to impair interactions with other RNA exosome subunits, suggesting that these interactions are essential for the proper assembly and stability of the complex (Slavotinek2020Biallelic). In the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, EXOSC5 interacts with Peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) and the HBV X protein (HBx), forming a complex that accelerates the degradation of HBV RNA. This interaction highlights the role of EXOSC5 in host defense mechanisms against viral infections (Deng2019Peroxiredoxin).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EXOSC5 is upregulated and promotes cell proliferation through the STAT3 signaling pathway, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Zhang2022Integrated).
