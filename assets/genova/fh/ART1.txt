# ART1

## Overview
ART1 is a gene that encodes the protein ADP-ribosyltransferase 1, a member of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase family. This protein is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ectoenzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to arginine residues on target proteins, a process known as mono-ADP-ribosylation. ART1 is predominantly expressed in tissues such as cardiac and skeletal muscle, leukocytes, brain, and testis, where it influences various cellular processes, including muscle differentiation and immune response modulation (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION; Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation). The protein's enzymatic activity is essential for modifying cell surface proteins, impacting their function, localization, and interactions. ART1's involvement in muscle development, immune system regulation, and its overexpression in certain cancers, such as colorectal cancer, underscores its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Zhang2021Identification; Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation).

## Structure
ART1 (ADP-ribosyltransferase 1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that belongs to the family of mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases. The primary structure of ART1 includes specific amino acid sequences that are crucial for its enzymatic activities. Notably, amino acids 24-38 are necessary to inhibit both transferase and glycohydrolase activities, while amino acids 39-45 are required for proper ADP-ribose transfer (Bourgeois2003Identification).

The secondary structure of ART1 features an alpha-helical amino terminus and a beta-sheet-rich carboxyl terminus. The carboxyl terminus contains a basic region encoded by a separate exon, which is important for its catalytic function (Bourgeois2003Identification). The beta-sheet-rich region in the carboxyl-terminal half is identified as the catalytic site, similar to prokaryotic ARTs, and is involved in stabilizing NAD binding (Bourgeois2003Identification).

ART1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including ADP-ribosylation, which is crucial for its function in modifying cell surface proteins during muscle cell differentiation (Friedrich2008Identification). The protein is expressed predominantly in skeletal and cardiac muscle, with its expression regulated by specific promoter elements during myotube differentiation (Friedrich2008Identification).

## Function
ART1 (ADP-ribosyltransferase 1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to arginine residues on target proteins, a process known as mono-ADP-ribosylation. This post-translational modification can regulate protein function, localization, and interactions, impacting various cellular processes (Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation). ART1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ectoenzyme primarily expressed in tissues such as cardiac and skeletal muscle, leukocytes, brain, and testis (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION).

In muscle cells, ART1 is involved in the differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes and modifies integrin α7, a major laminin-binding receptor, which is significant for muscle development and function (Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation). In the immune system, ART1 is expressed on the surface of neutrophils and lymphocytes, where it modulates immune responses by ADP-ribosylating cell surface proteins. This activity can affect the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of T cells and the antimicrobial properties of human neutrophil peptides (Scarpa2013A; Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation).

ART1 also plays a role in the regulation of immune responses by modifying proteins involved in cell adhesion and chemotaxis, such as the lymphocyte function-associated molecule-1 and human neutrophil peptide-1 (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION; Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ART1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). ART1 is significantly overexpressed in CRC, where it acts as a cancer-promoting factor by regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, tumor angiogenesis, and DNA repair (Zhang2021Identification). The enzyme modifies GRP78, a key protein in the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is crucial for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis in tumor cells. This modification inactivates GRP78, leading to increased endoplasmic reticulum stress stimuli, which is associated with tumor cell survival (Zhang2021Identification). Silencing ART1 in CRC cells has been shown to downregulate key signaling molecules in the UPR, resulting in decreased cell survival and increased apoptosis (Zhang2021Identification).

ART1 also interacts with the IL-6 signaling pathway, where its knockdown reduces the expression of gp130, a component of this pathway, thereby inhibiting CRC cell proliferation and tumor growth (Lin2024ART1). The expression of ART1 is positively correlated with gp130 levels in CRC tissues, and both are associated with lymph node metastasis and pathological grade, suggesting ART1's role in cancer progression (Lin2024ART1). These findings highlight ART1 as a potential therapeutic target in CRC.

## Interactions
ART1 (ADP-ribosyltransferase 1) is involved in various protein interactions through its enzymatic activity of ADP-ribosylation, which modifies arginine residues on target proteins. ART1 is known to ADP-ribosylate human neutrophil peptide-1 (HNP-1), specifically on arginine residues 14 and 24, which affects its antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities (Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation). This modification can lead to the release of interleukin-8 (IL-8) from A549 cells and enhance T-cell chemotaxis (Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation).

ART1 also interacts with growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), altering their receptor-binding capabilities and biological activities. The ADP-ribosylation of PDGF-BB by ART1 results in reduced mitogenic and chemotactic responses (Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation). In muscle cells, ART1 modifies integrin α7, a major laminin-binding receptor, which is associated with myopathies (Stevens2018MonoADPRibosylation).

Additionally, ART1 can ADP-ribosylate the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 at multiple arginine sites, potentially affecting its interaction with cell membranes and negatively charged biomolecules (Picchianti2014NADdependent). These interactions highlight ART1's role in modulating immune responses and cellular functions through protein modification.
