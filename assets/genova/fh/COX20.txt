# COX20

## Overview
COX20 is a gene that encodes the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor COX20, a transmembrane protein integral to the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The COX20 protein plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis and stabilization of the COX2 subunit, acting as a chaperone to facilitate its insertion into the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process is crucial for the proper assembly and maturation of cytochrome c oxidase, which is essential for efficient ATP production and cellular respiration (Bourens2014Human; Abriata2017Structural). COX20 interacts with metallochaperones such as SCO1 and SCO2, which are necessary for the biosynthesis of the CuA site in COX2, further underscoring its importance in mitochondrial function (Bourens2014Human; Lorenzi2018The). Mutations in the COX20 gene are linked to various mitochondrial and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Otero2018Novel; Dong2021Biallelic).

## Structure
The COX20 protein is involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase and is characterized by its transmembrane domains, which facilitate its integration into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Structural modeling suggests that COX20 contains a long helix spanning residues approximately 55-102, which interacts with a shorter helix spanning residues 30-50. These helices are consistent with the predicted transmembrane topology, with hydrophobic residues appropriately positioned for transmembrane helices (Abriata2017Structural). The N- and C-termini of COX20 are localized to the intermembrane space, indicating its role as an integral membrane protein (Bourens2014Human).

The protein is predicted to have a possible dimerization interface in the transmembrane region, involving pairs of residues such as Tyr36-Gly72 and His48-Asp60, which may be crucial for its function in stabilizing COX2 during its maturation (Abriata2017Structural). The C-terminal helix of COX20 is longer than a typical membrane-spanning helix, which may aid in stabilizing COX2's transmembrane helices when only one is membrane-inserted (Abriata2017Structural). The structural information provides insights into COX20's function in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase, although specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
COX20 is a crucial assembly factor for cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) in human mitochondria, primarily involved in the biogenesis and stabilization of the COX2 subunit. It acts as a chaperone, stabilizing newly synthesized COX2 and facilitating its insertion into the inner mitochondrial membrane (Bourens2014Human; Abriata2017Structural). COX20 interacts with copper metallochaperones SCO1 and SCO2, which are essential for the biosynthesis of the CuA site in COX2, a critical step for the proper assembly and maturation of cytochrome c oxidase (Bourens2014Human; Lorenzi2018The).

COX20 forms complexes that co-migrate with the COX1 assembly intermediate MITRAC complex, indicating its involvement in early steps of complex IV assembly (Lorenzi2018The). The protein is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it stabilizes COX2 during its translocation and insertion, ensuring the proper function of the respiratory chain and efficient ATP production (Bourens2014Human; Abriata2017Structural).

The absence or dysfunction of COX20 leads to instability of COX2, resulting in cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, which can impair cellular respiration and energy production (Bourens2014Human; Szklarczyk2012A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COX20 gene are associated with several neurological and mitochondrial disorders. These mutations can lead to autosomal recessive sensory neuronopathy, characterized by degeneration of dorsal root ganglia neurons, sensory ataxia, and mitochondrial dysfunction due to impaired assembly of mitochondrial complex IV (Dong2021Biallelic). The COX20 gene encodes a transmembrane protein essential for the assembly of complex IV, and its deficiency results in reduced respiratory capacity and cell proliferation under metabolic stress (Dong2021Biallelic).

COX20 mutations have also been linked to a rare neurological disorder with symptoms such as childhood hypotonia, areflexia, ataxia, dysarthria, dystonia, and sensory neuropathy. Specific variants, like the homozygous missense mutation c.154A>C (p.T52P), have been identified in consanguineous Turkish families, presenting with additional findings like microcephaly and cerebellar atrophy (Otero2018Novel).

Compound heterozygous variants in COX20 can cause a syndrome involving ophthalmoplegia and visual failure, as seen in siblings with progressive gait unsteadiness, dysarthria, muscle weakness, and visual impairment (Li2022Compound). These mutations impair mitochondrial complex IV function, leading to decreased enzyme activity and mitochondrial dysfunction (Chen2023Clinical).

## Interactions
COX20 is involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CIV) and interacts with several proteins crucial for this process. In humans, COX20 interacts with SCO1 and SCO2, which are metallochaperones essential for the biosynthesis of the Cu A site in COX2. These interactions are COX2-dependent, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that COX20 binds to newly synthesized COX2 to stabilize it and facilitate its maturation (Bourens2014Human). COX20 also forms a stable 90 kDa complex in mitochondria, suggesting interactions with other unidentified partners or possibly forming a homohexamer (Bourens2014Human).

In yeast, COX20 interacts with proteins involved in the early steps of COX2 biogenesis, such as Mba1, Cox18, Mss2, Pnt1, and Sco2, indicating its involvement in multiple steps of COX2 maturation, from translocation to copper insertion (Lorenzi2024Analysis). COX20's interaction with TMEM177 has been identified, suggesting a role for TMEM177 in the early steps of COX2 assembly (Lorenzi2018The). These interactions highlight COX20's critical role in the stabilization and maturation of COX2, essential for the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
