# ARL8A

## Overview
ARL8A is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor-like GTPase 8A, which is a member of the ARF-like (ARL) family of small GTPases. This protein is primarily involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the regulation of endolysosomal functions. As a small GTPase, ARL8A cycles between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states, with the latter being crucial for its association with endolysosomes and interaction with various effector proteins. These interactions facilitate processes such as lysosomal fusion, anterograde and retrograde transport of endolysosomes, and axonal transport. ARL8A's role in these cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer and autoimmune conditions (Niwa2017BORC; Xie2022ARL11; KerenKaplan2022RUFY3).

## Structure
ARL8A is a member of the ARF-like (ARL) family of small GTPases, characterized by its involvement in intracellular trafficking. The primary structure of ARL8A consists of a specific sequence of amino acids encoded by the ARL8A gene. Its secondary structure includes both alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of ARL8A is a compact, globular form typical of GTPases, featuring a GTP-binding domain that is crucial for its activity. While the quaternary structure details of ARL8A are less defined, it is known to potentially interact with other proteins, suggesting a role in complex cellular processes. Post-translational modifications of ARL8A can include phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions. These structural features enable ARL8A to perform its role in cellular trafficking effectively.

## Function
ARL8A is a small GTPase that plays a significant role in the regulation of endolysosomal functions in human cells. It cycles between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form, with the latter associating with endolysosomes. This association is facilitated by an N-terminal acetylated, amphipathic α-helix and the endolysosome-associated BORC complex, which may act as a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (KerenKaplan2022RUFY3). ARL8A interacts with several effectors, including the HOPS complex, adaptor proteins PLEKHM1 and SKIP, and kinesin motor proteins, to mediate various cellular processes such as lysosomal fusion with other organelles, anterograde transport of endolysosomes, and phagolysosome resolution (KerenKaplan2022RUFY3).

ARL8A is also involved in the transport of endolysosomes by recruiting motor proteins for both anterograde and retrograde transport. It recruits kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 for anterograde transport and dynein-dynactin for retrograde transport, with the balance between these processes regulated by interactions with adaptors like RUFY3 and RUFY4 (KerenKaplan2022RUFY3). This regulation is crucial for maintaining proper lysosome positioning and movement, which is essential for cellular functions such as autophagy, antigen presentation, and axonal transport (Boda2019Drosophila).

## Clinical Significance
ARL8A has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in lysosomal trafficking and cellular processes. In breast cancer, ARL8A is noted for having a high mutation ratio of 15%, and its expression is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This suggests that ARL8A may contribute to the pathogenesis of breast cancer and could impact prognosis and treatment outcomes (Xie2022ARL11). In prostate cancer, low expression levels of ARL8A are associated with a shorter time to biochemical and clinical recurrence, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Nturubika2024Altered).

In the context of autoimmune diabetes, ARL8A shows differential expression patterns in NOD mice, a model for Type 1 Diabetes. Although significant differences in expression were not consistently observed, there is a trend towards statistical significance, suggesting a possible involvement in the disease's development (CorralPujol2023NOD).

ARL8A is also upregulated in endometrial cancer tissues, although specific clinical implications in this context are not detailed (Zhang2020Clinical). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of ARL8A in various cancers and autoimmune conditions.

## Interactions
ARL8A, a small GTPase, is involved in several key interactions that facilitate its role in lysosomal trafficking and axonal transport. ARL8A interacts with SKIP (SifA and kinesin-interacting protein) on lysosomal membranes, coupling lysosomes to the kinesin-1 motor protein, which promotes their movement towards the cell periphery (Jackson2023An). It also interacts with RUFY3 and RUFY4, which associate with the dynein-dynactin complex to mediate lysosomal movement towards the minus end of microtubules at the cell center (Jackson2023An).

In the context of axonal transport, ARL8A is activated by the BORC complex, specifically through the SAM-4 subunit, which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARL8A. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of ARL8A to synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) and for activating the kinesin motor protein UNC-104/KIF1A, facilitating the transport of SVPs to synaptic terminals (Niwa2017BORC). ARL8A also interacts with UNC-104/KIF1A in a nucleotide state-dependent manner, which is essential for overcoming the autoinhibition of this motor protein and promoting axonal transport (Niwa2017BORC). These interactions highlight ARL8A's role in regulating intracellular transport processes.
