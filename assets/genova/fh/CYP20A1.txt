# CYP20A1

## Overview
CYP20A1 is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome P450 family 20 subfamily A member 1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes are known for their role in the metabolism of a wide range of substrates, including drugs and endogenous compounds. The CYP20A1 protein is characterized by its unique structural features, such as a conserved N-terminal motif and a transmembrane domain, which suggest its localization in cellular organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (Lemaire2016Cytochrome). Despite being classified as an 'orphan' cytochrome P450 due to the absence of identified substrates and specific functions, CYP20A1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and liver, indicating a potential role in neurophysiological processes (Nebert2013Human; Stark2008mRNA). The gene's involvement in disease susceptibility, such as lung cancer and Parkinson's disease, highlights its clinical significance, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Hartz2023A; Li2019Gene).

## Structure
The human CYP20A1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, characterized by its involvement in the metabolism of various substrates. The CYP20A1 protein consists of 462 amino acids and is encoded by 14 exons spanning 67,400 bases on chromosome 2q33.2 (Pan2016Computational). The primary structure of CYP20A1 includes a highly conserved N-terminal motif with a transmembrane domain typical of microsomal P450s, suggesting a potential bimodal distribution in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (Lemaire2016Cytochrome).

The secondary structure of CYP20A1 is predicted to include α-helices and β-strands, with specific motifs such as the I-helix and K-helix being present. However, the I-helix motif diverges from typical P450s, lacking the usually conserved threonine involved in the P450 catalytic cycle (Lemaire2016Cytochrome). The heme-binding region is also unusual, being one residue shorter and having a unique sequence around the conserved cysteine (Lemaire2016Cytochrome).

Despite these insights, the detailed tertiary and quaternary structures, specific domains, prominent folds, and common post-translational modifications of CYP20A1 remain unknown (Lemaire2016Cytochrome; Pan2016Computational). The protein is considered an 'orphan' cytochrome P450 due to the lack of known substrate specificity and functional information (Pan2016Computational).

## Function
CYP20A1 is an orphan member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, with its specific function in healthy human cells remaining largely undetermined. Despite this, CYP20A1 is expressed in several brain regions, including the substantia nigra, hippocampus, and amygdala, as well as in the liver, suggesting a potential role in neurophysiological processes (Nebert2013Human; Stark2008mRNA). The enzyme's expression in brain areas associated with neurological functions implies it may be involved in the metabolism of endogenous substances, although no catalytic activity has been confirmed with typical P450 substrates (Stark2008mRNA).

CYP20A1 is also expressed in the nasopharynx and central nervous system, indicating a possible involvement in broader physiological pathways (Nebert2013Human). The high degree of sequence conservation across species suggests an important, yet unidentified, physiological role (Nebert2013Human). In zebrafish, CYP20A1 expression is linked to neurobehavioral outcomes, hinting at a similar function in humans (Lemaire2016Cytochrome). Despite these insights, the exact molecular processes and organismal outcomes associated with CYP20A1 remain to be elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The CYP20A1 gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its genetic polymorphisms and expression alterations. In lung cancer, particularly among males and those with advanced-stage or small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the CYP20A1 rs2043449 polymorphism is associated with increased susceptibility. The CC genotype of this polymorphism significantly elevates the risk of developing SCLC, with an odds ratio of 5.36, suggesting a notable impact on lung cancer susceptibility (Li2019Gene).

In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), CYP20A1 is considered a potential player due to its high expression in the brain and the presence of significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in individuals with a genetic predisposition to PD. These SNPs, with odds ratios greater than 5, suggest that CYP20A1 may influence the manifestation of PD symptoms, possibly through alterations in the metabolism of endogenous compounds (Hartz2023A).

Additionally, a novel transcript isoform of CYP20A1, named CYP20A1_Alu-LT, has been identified as a potential miRNA sponge. This isoform is upregulated in response to stress conditions such as HIV1-Tat exposure, indicating a role in miRNA-mediated regulation under stress, which may impact neuronal function and stress response pathways (Bhattacharya2019Origin).

## Interactions
CYP20A1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is involved in the metabolism of various substances. While specific interactions of CYP20A1 are not well-documented, it is likely to interact with electron transfer partners typical of cytochrome P450 enzymes. These interactions include those with cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome b5, which are known to facilitate the enzymatic activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes by transferring electrons necessary for their catalytic processes. The interaction with cytochrome P450 reductase is particularly crucial, as it provides the electrons required for the monooxygenase activity of P450 enzymes. Similarly, cytochrome b5 can modulate the activity of P450 enzymes, either by donating electrons or by altering the enzyme's conformation to enhance or inhibit its activity. Although direct evidence of these interactions specific to CYP20A1 is not available, the general behavior of cytochrome P450 enzymes suggests that CYP20A1 likely participates in similar interactions to fulfill its metabolic roles.
