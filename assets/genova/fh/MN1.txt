# MN1

## Overview
The MN1 gene encodes the MN1 proto-oncogene, a transcriptional regulator that plays a crucial role in gene expression modulation. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional coactivator, interacting with various coactivators such as RAC3 and p300 to enhance transcriptional activity mediated by retinoic acid receptors (RAR-RXR) (van2003The). Although MN1 does not directly bind to DNA, it influences gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors and coactivators, thereby impacting cell differentiation and proliferation (Mak2019MN1). The MN1 protein is characterized by its nuclear localization and contains transcription-activating domains, including proline/glutamine-rich regions and polyglutamine stretches, which are typical of transcription factors (MeesterSmoor2007The; Buijs2000The). Clinically, alterations in the MN1 gene are associated with various conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal development and disease (Hussain2024Variants; Langer2009Prognostic).

## Structure
The MN1 protein is characterized by its nuclear localization and contains several transcription-activating domains. It includes proline/glutamine-rich regions and two polyglutamine stretches, which are common features in transcription factors (MeesterSmoor2007The; Buijs2000The). The protein does not have homology to other proteins, but homologs exist in mice and puffer fish, indicating evolutionary conservation (MeesterSmoor2007The). 

MN1 interacts with coactivators such as RAC3 and p300, enhancing transcription mediated by retinoic acid receptors (RAR-RXR) (van2003The). It does not directly bind to RAR-RXR but works synergistically with it, recognizing retinoic acid responsive elements (RAREs) (van2003The). The MN1 protein's transactivating domains, particularly between amino acids 48-256 and 365-520, are crucial for its interaction with these coactivators (van2003The).

The MN1-TEL fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation, retains much of the MN1 sequence and is involved in leukemogenesis. This fusion protein acts as a transcription factor with transforming activity, highlighting the importance of MN1's transactivating domains (Buijs2000The). Specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of MN1 are not detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The MN1 gene encodes a transcriptional co-activator protein that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression. It is involved in the activation of the IGFBP5 promoter, which is crucial for modulating the activity of insulin-like growth factors that regulate mammalian growth and development (MeesterSmoor2007The). MN1 functions as a transcription coactivator rather than a sequence-specific transcription factor, activating transcription from complex promoters like the MSV-LTR and working synergistically with retinoic acid receptors (RAR-RXR) in the presence of ligands such as ATRA (van2003The). The protein interacts with coactivators like p160 and p300, enhancing transcriptional activity (van2003The). MN1 does not directly bind to DNA but interacts with other proteins, supporting its role as a coactivator (van2003The). It is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other transcription factors to modulate the expression of target genes, impacting cell differentiation and proliferation (Mak2019MN1). MN1 is essential for normal development, as evidenced by severe developmental defects in Mn1 null mice, particularly in the formation of membranous bones in the skull (MeesterSmoor2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MN1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Gain-of-function truncation variants of MN1 lead to a recognizable syndrome characterized by craniofacial and brain abnormalities. These variants result in proteins lacking the C terminus, which enhances protein aggregation and stability, interfering with normal degradation processes and leading to dysregulation of MN1 target genes. This syndrome is marked by severe developmental delay, speech impairment, and specific facial features (Miyake2020GainofFunction).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high MN1 expression levels are linked to poor prognosis. Elevated MN1 expression is associated with lower complete remission rates, shorter disease-free survival, and overall survival in patients with cytogenetically normal AML. This suggests that MN1 expression levels can independently predict clinical outcomes in AML (Langer2009Prognostic).

MN1 is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations in MN1 can cause CEBALID syndrome, characterized by craniofacial anomalies, language delay, and intellectual disability. These mutations result in a dominantly active truncated protein, contributing to the distinct phenotype observed in affected individuals (Hussain2024Variants).

## Interactions
The MN1 oncoprotein interacts with several coactivators, including RAC3 and p300, which are part of the p160 coactivator family. These interactions enhance transcriptional activity mediated by the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) (van2003The). MN1 does not directly bind to RAR-RXR but works synergistically with it, recognizing retinoic acid responsive elements (RAREs) and binding to known coactivators of RAR-RXR (van2003The). The interaction between MN1 and these coactivators is demonstrated through luciferase assays and in vitro binding studies (van2003The).

MN1 also activates transcription of the IGFBP5 promoter through a CACCC-rich consensus sequence. This interaction is likely indirect, mediated by other proteins, as MN1 does not directly bind to the CA and GT-rich DNA elements (MeesterSmoor2007The). The CACCCAC motif recognized by MN1 is associated with various transcription factors, suggesting that MN1's interaction with nucleic acids is mediated through these factors (MeesterSmoor2007The).

The MN1-TEL fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation in myeloid leukemia, retains most of the MN1 sequence and activates genes normally repressed by TEL due to MN1's transactivating properties (van2003The).
