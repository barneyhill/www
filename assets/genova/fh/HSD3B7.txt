# HSD3B7

## Overview
The HSD3B7 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 7, which is a critical component in the biosynthesis of primary bile acids. This enzyme, categorized as a dehydrogenase/isomerase, is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver cells, where it facilitates the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids, such as cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. These bile acids are essential for cholesterol metabolism and the absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins (Zhao2021Genetic; Nittono2024Navigating). Proper functioning of the HSD3B7 gene is crucial for maintaining liver health and metabolic balance, with deficiencies leading to significant clinical conditions, including neonatal cholestasis and liver disease (Zhao2021Genetic). Additionally, alterations in the expression of HSD3B7 have been linked to certain cancers, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Hu2022HSD3B7).

## Function
The HSD3B7 gene encodes the enzyme 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase, which plays a crucial role in the synthesis of primary bile acids, such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (Gonzales2018Cholic; Nittono2024Navigating). This enzyme is responsible for converting 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-bile acids into their respective 3-oxo-Δ4 intermediates, a necessary step in the production of primary bile acids (Nittono2024Navigating). The enzyme is active in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver cells, where it facilitates the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids, essential for cholesterol metabolism and the absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins (Zhao2021Genetic).

In healthy human cells, the proper function of the HSD3B7 gene is vital for maintaining normal liver function and overall metabolic homeostasis. Deficiency in this gene can lead to impaired bile acid synthesis, resulting in the accumulation of atypical bile acids and potential liver damage (Zhao2021Genetic). The enzyme's activity is crucial for preventing conditions such as neonatal cholestasis and severe liver disease, underscoring its importance in bile acid metabolism (Zhao2021Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSD3B7 gene are associated with primary bile acid synthesis defects, specifically 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency. This rare genetic disorder leads to inadequate synthesis of primary bile acids, such as cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, resulting in the accumulation of atypical and hepatotoxic bile acid intermediates. Clinically, this condition manifests as neonatal cholestasis and can progress to early cirrhosis and liver failure if untreated (Zhao2021Genetic; Gonzales2018Cholic). 

HSD3B7 deficiency is characterized by low serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and serum total bile acids (sTBA), distinguishing it from other liver conditions like biliary atresia (Zhao2021Genetic; Nittono2024Navigating). Treatment with oral cholic acid or chenodeoxycholic acid has been shown to normalize clinical features, improve liver biochemistry, and reduce liver fibrosis, allowing affected individuals to reach adulthood in good health (Zhao2021Genetic; Gonzales2018Cholic).

Alterations in HSD3B7 expression have also been implicated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where high expression levels are associated with poor prognosis. The gene's expression is linked to immune-related pathways, suggesting its role in the tumor microenvironment (Hu2022HSD3B7).
