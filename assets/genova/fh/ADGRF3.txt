# ADGRF3

## Overview
ADGRF3, also known as GPR113, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F3, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain and a large extracellular region, which are typical features of aGPCRs. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including immune response and inflammation, and is implicated in several diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy and renal cell carcinoma. The ADGRF3 gene exhibits significant transcript variability, leading to the production of multiple protein isoforms, which may contribute to its diverse functional roles (Araç2020Structure; Kuhn2024The). Despite its structural similarities to hormone receptors, a specific ligand for ADGRF3 has not yet been identified (Araç2020Structure).

## Structure
The ADGRF3 gene, also known as GPR113, encodes a protein that is part of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This protein is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain (7TMD) and a large extracellular region. The gene exhibits significant transcript variability, with 24 identified transcript variants, which include different 5' start exons and 3' end exons, suggesting the presence of multiple promoters and the potential for generating diverse protein isoforms (Kuhn2024The). The GAIN domain, a hallmark of aGPCRs, is present in ADGRF3 and is involved in receptor activation through autoproteolysis, although specific details on its structure in ADGRF3 are not provided (Araç2020Structure).

The protein's structure includes a Hormone Receptor (HormR) domain, which is structurally similar to that of secretin-family GPCRs, indicating potential hormone receptor functions, though no specific hormone ligand has been identified for ADGRF3 (Araç2020Structure). The variability in transcript variants suggests that ADGRF3 may produce N-terminally truncated protein isoforms and C-terminal fragment-like receptor proteins, contributing to its functional diversity (Kuhn2024The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, common in GPCRs, although specific modifications for ADGRF3 are not detailed in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
ADGRF3, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F3, has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and potential mutations. In the context of kidney diseases, ADGRF3 is upregulated in diabetic nephropathy, with a significant 2.938-fold increase in expression observed in a mouse model. This suggests a role in kidney inflammation associated with metabolic disorders like diabetes (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion). Additionally, ADGRF3 is highly expressed in renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), particularly in chromophobe RCC, indicating a possible link between immune cell activity, inflammatory processes, and RCC development (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion).

In the immune system, ADGRF3 is expressed in granulocytes and plays a role in immune responses during systemic inflammation. It is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species and proteolytic enzyme activity, mediated through NF-κB and ERK signaling pathways. This activity is crucial for regulating antimicrobial functions in human granulocytes (Morgan2019The). The gene's expression and function in immune cells suggest its involvement in inflammatory conditions and potentially in disorders where immune regulation is disrupted. However, specific diseases directly caused by mutations in ADGRF3 have not been detailed in the available literature.
