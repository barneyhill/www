# CTRL

## Overview
The CTRL gene encodes the chymotrypsin-like protein, which is a member of the serine protease family. This protein is involved in the proteolytic processing of various substrates, playing a crucial role in numerous physiological processes, including digestion and immune response. As a serine protease, the chymotrypsin-like protein is characterized by its ability to cleave peptide bonds in proteins, a function that is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating biological pathways. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential implications in various diseases, highlighting the importance of understanding their structure, function, and interactions within the human body (Qiu2020aarFDC).
