# FAM210A

## Overview
FAM210A is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein known as family with sequence similarity 210 member A. This protein is integral to mitochondrial homeostasis and function, particularly in the regulation of mitochondrial mRNA translation, which is crucial for the synthesis of proteins involved in the electron transport chain and ATP production. FAM210A is highly expressed in cardiac cells, where it is essential for maintaining normal cardiomyocyte contractile function, and in brown adipose tissue, where it plays a significant role in mitochondrial remodeling and thermogenesis during cold exposure (Wu2023FAM210A; Qiu2023FAM210A). The protein is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by interacting with mitochondrial proteases, thereby influencing mitochondrial morphology and energy metabolism (Qiu2023FAM210A). Alterations in FAM210A expression have been associated with various cardiac and metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2023FAM210A).

## Function
The FAM210A gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and function. It is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial mRNA translation, which is essential for the production of mitochondrial-encoded proteins critical for the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis. This function is vital for energy production in cells, particularly in cardiac cells where FAM210A is highly expressed and necessary for normal cardiomyocyte contractile function (Wu2023FAM210A).

In brown adipose tissue (BAT), FAM210A is essential for cold-induced mitochondrial remodeling. It regulates mitochondrial dynamics by controlling the cleavage of OPA1, a protein involved in mitochondrial inner membrane fusion, through the YME1L/OMA1 axis. This regulation is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial cristae integrity, which supports thermogenic function during cold exposure (Qiu2023FAM210A). FAM210A also plays a role in the browning of white adipose tissue, contributing to systemic energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (Qiu2023FAM210A).

Overall, FAM210A is a key regulator of mitochondrial function, influencing both energy metabolism and cellular stress responses in various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FAM210A gene have been linked to several cardiac and metabolic conditions. In the context of cardiac health, FAM210A is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function in cardiomyocytes. Its deficiency leads to severe mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. This is characterized by disrupted mitochondrial translation, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and decreased respiratory activity, which activate the integrated stress response (ISR) and contribute to cardiac remodeling and heart failure (Wu2023FAM210A). 

In ischemic heart failure (IHF) and myocardial infarction (MI), reduced expression of FAM210A correlates with compromised mitochondrial function. Overexpression of FAM210A in mouse models has been shown to improve cardiac function and reduce damage post-MI, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for ischemic heart disease (Wu2023FAM210A).

FAM210A also plays a role in brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Its loss leads to impaired thermogenic response and altered metabolic activity, indicating its importance in metabolic regulation and disorders related to BAT dysfunction (Qiu2023FAM210A).

## Interactions
FAM210A is involved in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in brown adipose tissue (BAT) during cold exposure. It plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial cristae structure by interacting with specific mitochondrial proteases. FAM210A directly interacts with the protease YME1L, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, suggesting a physical interaction that enhances YME1L activity (Qiu2023FAM210A). This interaction is essential for modulating the cleavage of OPA1, a key regulator of mitochondrial morphology, by preventing excessive cleavage mediated by YME1L and OMA1 (Qiu2023FAM210A).

FAM210A does not affect the stability of YME1L, OMA1, and OPA1 when these proteins are incubated individually. However, it enhances YME1L's activity in the presence of OPA1, indicating a context-dependent interaction that is crucial for mitochondrial remodeling during cold exposure (Qiu2023FAM210A). The FAM210A-YME1L/OMA1 axis acts as a molecular brake to finely tune OPA1 cleavage, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function in response to cold stress (Qiu2023FAM210A). There is no evidence of FAM210A interacting directly with nucleic acids (Qiu2023FAM210A).
