# RAD23A

## Overview
RAD23A is a gene that encodes the RAD23 homolog A protein, a crucial component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway in humans. This protein is categorized as a nucleotide excision repair protein and plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the global genome NER (GG-NER) pathway. The RAD23A protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes ubiquitin-like and ubiquitin-associated domains, facilitating its interaction with the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These interactions are vital for the stabilization of the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein, thereby preventing its degradation and ensuring efficient DNA damage recognition and repair (Walters2003DNArepair; Ng2003A). Beyond its role in DNA repair, RAD23A is involved in regulating the tumor suppressor protein p53 and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), linking it to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Yokoi2017Two). The gene's function and interactions underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease processes such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Xueshui2024Reduction; Yokoi2017Two).

## Structure
The RAD23A protein, involved in nucleotide excision repair, is a modular protein composed of several distinct domains. It contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, a central ubiquitin-associated (UBA1) domain, a RAD4/XPC binding domain (RBD/XPCB), and a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA2) domain (Byeon2021Structure; Yokoi2017Two). The UBL domain is structurally homologous to ubiquitin, featuring five β-strands and an α-helix, and is crucial for the protein's function in DNA repair (Walters2003DNArepair). The UBA domains are entirely α-helical, each forming three α-helices (Walters2003DNArepair).

The RAD23A protein adopts a dynamic conformation, with its domains connected by flexible linker regions that allow for intramolecular interactions (Walters2003DNArepair). The UBL domain interacts with the UBA domains, causing chemical shift perturbations, indicating a dynamic equilibrium of exchange (Walters2003DNArepair). The interaction with the proteasomal subunit S5a can disrupt these interdomain interactions, leading to a conformational change that is significant for its function in linking DNA repair and protein degradation pathways (Walters2003DNArepair). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in maintaining genome integrity.

## Function
The RAD23A gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in nucleotide excision repair (NER), a vital DNA repair mechanism in human cells. RAD23A is involved in the global genome NER (GG-NER) pathway, where it stabilizes the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein, preventing its degradation by the proteasome. This stabilization is essential for the recognition and repair of DNA damage across the entire genome, particularly damage caused by UV light and chemical mutagens (Ng2003A).

RAD23A contains ubiquitin-like and ubiquitin-associated domains, linking it to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It interacts with proteasome subunits, facilitating the translocation of ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome, and is involved in proteolytic protein degradation (Yokoi2017Two). RAD23A also plays a role in regulating the tumor suppressor protein p53, protecting it from degradation and influencing the DNA damage response (Yokoi2017Two).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, RAD23A is implicated in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It interacts with apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), facilitating its nuclear translocation during cell death, which is crucial for apoptosis (Yokoi2017Two). These functions highlight RAD23A's importance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RAD23A gene have been implicated in several disease processes, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), RAD23A is involved in the pathology associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy. Studies have shown that reducing RAD23A expression can extend lifespan and improve pathological features in mouse models of TDP-43 pathology, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for these conditions (Xueshui2024Reduction). The reduction of RAD23A appears to enhance proteasome function and reduce the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, which are characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases (Xueshui2024Reduction).

In cancer, RAD23A plays a role in DNA repair processes, and its interactions with proteins involved in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Disruptions in these interactions can affect cellular responses to DNA damage, potentially contributing to cancer development (Ng2003A; Yokoi2017Two). The gene's involvement in stabilizing key proteins like p53 further underscores its significance in tumor suppression and cellular stress responses (Yokoi2017Two).

## Interactions
RAD23A, a human nucleotide excision repair protein, interacts with several proteins involved in DNA repair and protein degradation pathways. It forms a complex with the xeroderma pigmentosum group C-complementing protein (XPC), playing a crucial role in recognizing DNA damage and facilitating repair processes (Schauber1998Rad23). RAD23A also interacts with the HIV-1 Vpr protein, which binds to the UBA2 domain of RAD23A. This interaction is significant for Vpr's role in modulating DNA repair pathways and does not lead to ubiquitination or degradation of RAD23A, unlike other Vpr interactions (Byeon2021Structure).

RAD23A is involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway through its ubiquitin-like domain, which allows it to bind to proteasome components such as Cim3 and Cim5. This interaction links DNA repair to protein degradation, highlighting RAD23A's role in stabilizing repair complexes and promoting the assembly of repair factors (Schauber1998Rad23). RAD23A also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, protecting it from degradation and influencing p53-dependent apoptotic signaling (Yokoi2017Two). These interactions underscore RAD23A's multifunctional role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating protein turnover.
