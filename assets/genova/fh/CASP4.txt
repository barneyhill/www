# CASP4

## Overview
CASP4 is a gene that encodes the protein caspase-4, a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease family, which plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory response. Caspase-4 is primarily involved in the non-canonical inflammasome pathway, where it detects intracellular lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and initiates pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. This protein is characterized by its caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), which is essential for binding LPS and facilitating its activation through oligomerization (An2019Caspase4; Smith2022Caspase4). Caspase-4 is active in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum, responding to both bacterial infections and cellular stressors, thereby maintaining immune and inflammatory balance (Casson2015Human). Alterations in CASP4 expression have been linked to various cancers and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Di2024Caspase4; Papoff2018CASP4).

## Structure
Caspase-4 (CASP4) is a cysteine-aspartic acid protease involved in inflammatory processes. Its primary structure includes a pro-domain, large subunit, and small subunit, with a catalytic cysteine crucial for its enzymatic activity (Chan2023Caspase4). The protein contains a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), which is essential for binding lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and subsequent oligomerization, a key step in its activation (An2019Caspase4; Smith2022Caspase4).

The secondary structure of caspase-4 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the formation of its active site (An2019Caspase4). The tertiary structure involves the formation of an active site with a catalytic cysteine, which is necessary for its protease activity (Chan2023Caspase4). Quaternary structure is characterized by dimerization, which is required for its activation and function in the noncanonical inflammasome pathway (Chan2023Caspase4).

Caspase-4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including cleavage at specific sites in the interdomain linker, which are crucial for its full proteolytic activity (Chan2023Caspase4). The protein has several splice variant isoforms, with some variants lacking residues necessary for LPS binding and CARD oligomerization, potentially affecting their function (Smith2022Caspase4).

## Function
Caspase-4 (CASP4) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the inflammatory response in human cells. It is primarily involved in the non-canonical inflammasome pathway, where it detects intracellular lipopolysaccharides (LPS), leading to pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (Shi2014Inflammatory). CASP4 is crucial for the processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, which are essential for mounting an effective immune response (Galluzzi2016Caspases). 

In human macrophages, CASP4 is activated in response to bacterial infections, such as those caused by Francisella novicida and Legionella pneumophila, where it mediates non-canonical inflammasome activation and cytokine release (Casson2015Human; Lagrange2018Human). CASP4 directly binds to LPS, leading to its oligomerization and activation, which is a critical step in the immune response to bacterial pathogens (Shi2014Inflammatory). 

CASP4 is active in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it can also be triggered by stressors such as endoplasmic reticulum stress and UVB irradiation, indicating its role in responding to both exogenous and endogenous signals (Casson2015Human). This enzyme is essential for maintaining immune and inflammatory balance in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in CASP4 expression have been implicated in various cancers and inflammatory conditions. In epithelial cancers, CASP4 is involved in cell migration, cell-matrix adhesion, and tissue invasion. Its expression levels can influence tumor development and patient prognosis. Higher CASP4 expression is associated with worse overall survival in lung, head and neck, liver, pancreatic, renal, and thyroid cancers, while lower expression correlates with poor outcomes in breast, endometrial, prostate, and urothelial cancers (Papoff2018CASP4). In gliomas, CASP4 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis, affecting tumor cell proliferation and immune cell recruitment. It is associated with decreased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that inhibiting CASP4 could enhance drug efficacy (Di2024Caspase4).

CASP4 also plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where its regulation is influenced by factors like oxPAPC and glutathione peroxidases. In ulcerative colitis, lower levels of GPx8 and higher CASP4 expression are observed, indicating a protective role of GPx8 against colitis (Smith2022Caspase4). These findings highlight CASP4's potential as a therapeutic target in both cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
Caspase-4 (CASP4) is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate its role in the inflammatory response. It interacts with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacterial membranes, through its caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). This interaction is crucial for the activation of caspase-4 and subsequent inflammatory signaling (An2019Caspase4; An2022A). The CARD domain of caspase-4 binds to LPS micelles, forming high molecular weight complexes that are essential for its activation (An2019Caspase4).

Caspase-4 also interacts with guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), particularly GBP1, which binds LPS and recruits caspase-4 to LPS-containing membranes. This recruitment is a key step in the non-canonical inflammasome pathway, facilitating caspase-4 activation (Zamyatina2020Lipopolysaccharide; Santos2020Human). GBP2 and GBP4 assist in recruiting caspase-4, while GBP3 is involved in its activation (Zamyatina2020Lipopolysaccharide).

Once activated, caspase-4 cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD), leading to pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. It can also directly cleave pro-IL-1β into its mature form, independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome, highlighting its unique role in inflammatory responses (Chan2023Caspase4).
