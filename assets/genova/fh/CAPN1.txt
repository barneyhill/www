# CAPN1

## Overview
The CAPN1 gene encodes calpain 1, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal remodeling, signal transduction, and apoptosis. Calpain 1 is characterized by its ability to form a heterodimer with the small regulatory subunit CAPNS1, which is essential for its stability and activation. The protein's structure comprises a large catalytic subunit with distinct domains that undergo conformational changes upon calcium binding, facilitating its proteolytic activity. Calpain 1 is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in the selective cleavage of substrates, thereby modulating their function in response to calcium signaling. This protease is regulated by calpastatin, an endogenous inhibitor that prevents its activation. Mutations in the CAPN1 gene have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Campbell2012Structure–function; Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin; Méreaux2021Increasing).

## Structure
Calpain 1, encoded by the CAPN1 gene, is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease that forms a heterodimer with a small regulatory subunit, CAPNS1. The primary structure of calpain 1 includes a large catalytic subunit of approximately 80 kDa, which is composed of four domains: DI, DII, DIII, and DIV (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin). The secondary structure features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with the catalytic domain exhibiting a papain-like fold (Campbell2012Structure–function).

The tertiary structure of calpain 1 involves a cysteine protease core, divided into two subdomains, DIIa and DIIb, which form the active site. This core undergoes significant conformational changes upon calcium binding, aligning the catalytic triad composed of Cys115, His272, and Asn296 for proteolytic activity (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin; Campbell2012Structure–function). The quaternary structure is characterized by the formation of a heterodimer with CAPNS1, facilitated by interactions between the penta-EF-hand domains of both subunits (Spinozzi2021Calpains).

Calpain 1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and autolysis, which regulate its activity and stability (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin). The protein's structure and regulation are crucial for its role in cellular processes such as signal transduction and apoptosis (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin).

## Function
Calpain 1, encoded by the CAPN1 gene, is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, which is crucial for cell movement and migration. Calpain 1 facilitates the detachment of cells from the substrate by cleaving focal adhesion complexes at the trailing edge and reorganizing the cytoskeleton at the leading edge, where membrane ruffles and pseudopods form (Campbell2012Structure–function). 

In muscle cells, calpain 1 is essential for the repair of plasma membrane injuries. It is activated by calcium influx, which triggers pathways for membrane repair, including the severing of transmembrane-cytoskeletal tethers and the activation of sub-membranous cytoskeleton remodeling (Piper2020Loss). 

Calpain 1 also participates in signal transduction and cell cycle progression by selectively cleaving substrates in response to calcium signaling, thereby altering their function without degrading them (GOLL2003The). It is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is active in the cytoplasm, where it responds to physiological stimuli to maintain cellular homeostasis (Ono2012Calpains).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAPN1 gene are associated with a range of neurodegenerative disorders, primarily hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and spastic ataxias. These conditions are characterized by symptoms such as lower limb spasticity, cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and lower limb weakness (GanOr2016Mutations; Méreaux2021Increasing). CAPN1 mutations can lead to both pure and complicated forms of HSP, with the latter including additional neurological symptoms like ataxia and dysarthria (Lai2020Novel). The gene is part of the "ataxia-HSP spectrum disease genes," and its mutations have been linked to neurodegeneration and motor impairment in animal models (Cotti2019A).

The clinical presentation of CAPN1 mutations is variable, with some cases also carrying pathogenic variants in other genes, potentially leading to a synergistic effect (Méreaux2021Increasing). Depression and cognitive impairment are noted as underreported features in patients with CAPN1 mutations (Méreaux2021Increasing). The term "CAPN1-associated neurodegeneration" has been proposed to describe the disease due to its clinical variability (Rahimi2020CAPN1). CAPN1 mutations are associated with autosomal recessive inheritance patterns and a range of clinical symptoms, including both pure and complicated HSP (Xia2020Mutation).

## Interactions
CAPN1, or calpain 1, is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of its primary interactions is with calpastatin, an endogenous inhibitor that regulates calpain activity. Calpastatin binds to calpain at multiple sites, inhibiting its proteolytic activity by preventing calcium binding and activation (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin).

CAPN1 forms a heterodimer with a small regulatory subunit, CAPNS1, which is crucial for its stability and activation. This interaction is essential for the protease's function, as it facilitates the structural conformation necessary for its activity (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin).

The calpain system, including CAPN1, is involved in the proteolysis of target proteins, which is crucial for processes such as cell cycle progression, cell migration, and apoptosis. CAPN1 interacts with various substrates, including kinases, phosphatases, and cytoskeletal proteins, affecting pathways related to cellular signaling and homeostasis (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin).

These interactions highlight CAPN1's role in modulating cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases where calpain activity is dysregulated (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin).
