# RIMS4

## Overview
RIMS4 (regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, a process essential for neurotransmitter release in neurons. The RIMS4 protein, categorized as part of the RIM protein family, plays a pivotal role in synaptic transmission and plasticity by facilitating vesicle docking and fusion at the presynaptic terminal. This protein interacts with voltage-dependent calcium channels and other presynaptic proteins to modulate neurotransmitter release, particularly glutamate, thereby influencing neural signaling and brain function (Leblond2019Both). RIMS4 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease, where it is differentially expressed, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (CHEN2023Proteomics). Additionally, RIMS4 is associated with a CpG island methylator phenotype in clear cell renal cell carcinomas, indicating a role in cancer progression (Arai2012SingleCpGresolution).

## Function
RIMS4 (regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, a critical process for neurotransmitter release in neurons. The RIMS4 protein plays a significant role in synaptic transmission and plasticity, influencing communication between neurons. It is active at the presynaptic terminal, where it interacts with other proteins to facilitate vesicle docking and fusion with the synaptic membrane, impacting neural signaling and brain function.

In the context of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), RIMS4 has been identified as a protein associated with the pathogenesis of the disease. Proteomics analysis in an AD rat model has shown differential expression of RIMS4, suggesting its involvement in the disease's molecular mechanisms (CHEN2023Proteomics). The study highlights RIMS4 as a potential therapeutic target, indicating its role in neuroprotection and synaptic function (CHEN2023Proteomics).

RIMS4 is also associated with a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in clear cell renal cell carcinomas, where it shows significant hypermethylation. This hypermethylation is linked to a more aggressive clinicopathological phenotype, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Arai2012SingleCpGresolution).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
RIMS4, a protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, plays a crucial role in presynaptic protein interactions. It is part of the RIM protein family, which includes RIMS1, RIMS2, and RIMS3, and is essential for modulating neurotransmitter release at the synapse. RIMS4 interacts with voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) at the presynaptic active zone, where it suppresses their activity to regulate neurotransmitter release, particularly glutamate (Leblond2019Both). This interaction is vital for the fine-tuning of synaptic transmission and plasticity.

The interaction between alpha-RIMs (RIMS1 and RIMS2) and gamma-RIMs (RIMS3 and RIMS4) is significant for modulating glutamate release. The knockdown of gamma-RIMs, including RIMS4, has been shown to attenuate glutamate release, although to a lesser extent than alpha-RIMs, indicating a nuanced role in synaptic regulation (Leblond2019Both).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, RIMS4 has been identified as a differentially expressed protein in the hippocampus of rat models treated with the Huang-Pu-Tong-Qiao formula. This suggests its involvement in the protein-protein interaction network related to Alzheimer's pathogenesis (CHEN2023Proteomics).
