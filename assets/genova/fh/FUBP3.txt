# FUBP3

## Overview
FUBP3 is a gene that encodes the far upstream element binding protein 3, a member of the far upstream element-binding protein family, which is characterized by its ability to bind single-stranded RNA or DNA sequences through its four K-homology (KH) motifs (Xu2021FUSE; Li2022Identification). The protein plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, particularly by enhancing the translation of specific mRNAs such as FGF9, without affecting their stability or transcription levels (Gau2011FUBP3). FUBP3 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, viral replication, and immune response modulation, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Gau2011FUBP3; Yao2022LncEST12). Clinically, FUBP3 has been implicated in cancer progression and immune regulation, with its expression levels serving as potential prognostic biomarkers in diseases such as glioblastoma and colorectal cancer (Amniouel2024Highaccuracy; Li2022Identification).

## Structure
The FUBP3 protein is a member of the far upstream element-binding protein family, which includes FUBP1 and FUBP2. It is characterized by the presence of four K-homology (KH) motifs, which are crucial for its ability to bind single-stranded RNA or DNA sequences (Xu2021FUSE; Li2022Identification). These KH domains are essential for the protein's function in nucleic acid binding and are involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and viral replication (Xu2021FUSE; Yao2022LncEST12).

The KH3 and KH4 domains of FUBP3 are particularly important for its interaction with specific RNA molecules, such as the long noncoding RNA lnc-EST12, which influences the protein's role in immune response regulation (Yao2022LncEST12). FUBP3 also interacts with the 3' untranslated region of FGF9 mRNA, enhancing its translation through binding to UG-repeat motifs (Gau2011FUBP3).

While the context does not provide detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FUBP3, it highlights the significance of its KH domains in its functional roles. The protein's molecular weight is approximately 67 kDa (Gau2011FUBP3).

## Function
FUBP3, or far upstream element binding protein 3, plays a significant role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells. It specifically binds to the UG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of FGF9 mRNA, enhancing its translation without affecting mRNA stability or transcription levels. This interaction increases the translational efficiency of FGF9 mRNA, leading to elevated FGF9 protein levels, which are crucial for various physiological processes such as mitogenesis, angiogenesis, and morphogenesis (Gau2011FUBP3).

FUBP3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting its involvement in multiple cellular processes. It is part of a complex regulatory network that includes other RNA-binding proteins and cis-elements, contributing to the fine-tuning of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (Gau2011FUBP3). The protein's ability to bind single-stranded RNA or DNA sequences is facilitated by its four regular K homologous motifs, which are characteristic of the family of single-strand nucleic acid binding proteins to which FUBP3 belongs (Li2022Identification). This binding capability allows FUBP3 to participate in various cellular processes, including the regulation of immune-related pathways and the modulation of immune responses (Li2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
FUBP3 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers, due to its role in gene expression regulation. In glioblastoma (GBM), FUBP3 expression is decreased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. Higher levels of FUBP3 expression are associated with longer overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals in GBM patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Li2022Identification). FUBP3 is also involved in immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment, correlating with the infiltration of immune cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages (Li2022Identification).

In colorectal cancer, FUBP3 is part of the FUBP3-c-Myc signaling pathway, which is associated with metastasis and advanced disease stages. This pathway influences the response to FOLFOX chemotherapy, with reduced FUBP3 expression linked to better treatment outcomes due to decreased inflammation (Amniouel2024Highaccuracy).

FUBP3 also interacts with long non-coding RNAs, such as lnc-EST12, to modulate immune responses. In the context of mycobacterial infections, this interaction suppresses inflammatory cytokine expression and promotes the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages, highlighting its role in immune evasion (Yao2022LncEST12). These findings underscore the clinical significance of FUBP3 in cancer progression and immune regulation.

## Interactions
FUBP3 is known to interact with various nucleic acids and proteins, playing a significant role in gene expression regulation. It binds specifically to the (UG)n repeat motifs in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of FGF9 mRNA, forming RNA-protein complexes that enhance the translational efficiency of FGF9 without affecting mRNA stability. This interaction is specific to the cytoplasmic fraction and is not observed in the nuclear fraction, indicating a role in post-transcriptional regulation (Gau2011FUBP3).

FUBP3 also interacts with the 3' UTR of the Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) RNA, where it is involved in promoting viral replication and translation. Upon JEV infection, FUBP3 redistributes within the cell and co-localizes with the viral NS5 protein in the cytoplasm, suggesting its recruitment to viral replication complexes (Xu2021FUSE).

In addition to these interactions, FUBP3 binds to the long non-coding RNA NORAD, specifically the NORAD repeat unit 7 (NRU7). This interaction involves the formation of a complex with Pumilio1, indicating a potential role in maintaining genome stability (Kumar2023Discovery).
