# TBATA

## Overview
The TBATA gene, also known as Spatial, encodes a protein that is predominantly expressed in the thymus, brain, and testes, where it plays a crucial role in cell differentiation and tissue-specific functions. The protein encoded by TBATA is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the thymus, where it interacts with the transcription factor Aire to influence the expression of genes necessary for immune tolerance (Saade2010Spatial). In the brain and testes, TBATA is implicated in neuronal differentiation and spermiogenesis, respectively, indicating its diverse functional roles across different tissues (Saade2010Spatial). The protein's expression is regulated by various signals, including RANK and CD40, and is independent of thymocyte-derived signals, highlighting its autonomous regulatory mechanisms in medullary thymic epithelial cells (Saade2010Spatial).

## Function
The TBATA gene, also known as Spatial, plays a significant role in cell differentiation and is involved in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is expressed in highly polarized cell types, including testis germ cells, brain neurons, and thymic epithelial cells (TEC) (Saade2010Spatial). In the thymus, TBATA is expressed in both cortical and medullary TECs, with a nuclear distribution specific to mature medullary TECs, where it is associated with the transcription factor Aire (Saade2010Spatial). This association suggests a role in the regulation of promiscuous gene expression, which is crucial for central tolerance and the prevention of autoimmune diseases (Saade2010Spatial).

TBATA's expression is independent of thymocyte-derived signals and is regulated by Aire, as well as RANK and CD40 signals, indicating its involvement in the differentiation of medullary TECs (Saade2010Spatial). The gene is also expressed in the central nervous system and testis, where it is linked to neuronal differentiation and spermiogenesis, respectively, highlighting its broader role in cell differentiation across different tissues (Saade2010Spatial). These functions underscore TBATA's importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and proper immune function.
