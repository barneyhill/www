# CLDN3

## Overview
The CLDN3 gene encodes the protein claudin 3, a critical component of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Claudin 3 is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining the paracellular barrier function, which is essential for tissue integrity and homeostasis. The protein's structure includes four transmembrane helices and two extracellular segments, facilitating its interactions with other claudin proteins to form tight junction strands. These interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of tight junctions, impacting processes such as ion permeability and tissue protection. CLDN3 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, and is involved in physiological processes like embryo implantation and selective absorption in the nephron. Alterations in CLDN3 expression or mutations in the gene have been linked to several diseases, including neural tube defects and various cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Hempel2020Assembly; Ikeda2021Utility; Amasheh2010Claudins).

## Structure
Claudin-3 (CLDN3) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of tight junctions in epithelial cells. The molecular structure of CLDN3 includes four transmembrane helices (TM1-TM4) that form a helix bundle, with two extracellular segments (ECS1 and ECS2) that contain an anti-parallel β-sheet. This structure is often compared to a human left hand, where the transmembrane helices represent the forearm and the extracellular segments resemble the fingers (Nakamura2019Morphologic).

A unique feature of CLDN3 is the bending of the third transmembrane helix (TM3), which is influenced by the presence of proline at a specific position, Pro134. This bending is a distinguishing characteristic that affects claudin-claudin interactions and the morphology of tight junction strands (Nakamura2019Morphologic).

In terms of quaternary structure, CLDN3 can form homo-tetrameric building blocks that polymerize in a channel-independent manner. These tetramers are involved in the formation of tight junction strands through cis- and trans-interactions, contributing to the structural organization and function of tight junctions (Hempel2020Assembly).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can impact the function and localization of CLDN3 within tight junctions (Milatz2015Probing).

## Function
Claudin 3 (CLDN3) is a critical component of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells, playing a significant role in maintaining the paracellular barrier function. This protein is involved in reducing paracellular permeability, thereby contributing to the sealing of tight junctions against various ions, which is essential for maintaining tissue integrity and function (Amasheh2010Claudins). CLDN3 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, where it colocalizes with other tight junction proteins like occludin, indicating its role in the structure and function of these junctions (Morita1999Claudin).

In the gastrointestinal tract, CLDN3 is predominantly expressed in the distal parts, such as the colon, where it contributes to the epithelial barrier function, protecting against rapid luminal changes in osmolarity and pH (Lameris2012Expression; Amasheh2010Claudins). In the nephron, CLDN3 is involved in the selective absorption processes necessary for maintaining large gradients, crucial for the countercurrent system (Amasheh2010Claudins).

CLDN3's role extends to its involvement in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity during processes like embryo implantation, where it helps regulate trophoblast invasion and placenta formation (Schumann2015Claudin3). Its expression patterns and functions are consistent across species, allowing for extrapolation from animal models to human settings (Lameris2012Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CLDN3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of neural tube defects (NTDs), rare missense variants in CLDN3, such as the p.A128T and p.P134L mutations, have been identified in patients. These variants are associated with increased incidence of NTDs, potentially due to their impact on protein-protein interactions at tight junctions, which are crucial for neural tube closure (Baumholtz2020Functional).

In cancer, CLDN3 is frequently overexpressed in various types, including ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. This overexpression is linked to tumor progression and survival, making CLDN3 a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. In ovarian cancer, high CLDN3 expression is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor patient prognosis (Honda2007Regulation; Uthayanan2022Potential; Ikeda2021Utility). CLDN3's role as a biomarker is also explored in cholangiocarcinoma, where its expression in bile-derived extracellular vesicles shows high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis (Ikeda2021Utility).

Overall, CLDN3's involvement in these conditions highlights its clinical significance in both developmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
Claudin 3 (CLDN3) is a key component of tight junctions, where it interacts with other claudin proteins to form homo-tetrameric building blocks that polymerize in a channel-independent manner. These interactions involve both cis- and trans-interfaces, which are crucial for the assembly and function of tight junction strands (Hempel2020Assembly). CLDN3 forms cis-interactions within the same membrane, which are stabilized by hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions involving specific residues such as E158, F146, F147, L150, M69, and L72 (Hempel2020Assembly). 

The protein also engages in trans-interactions with adjacent cell membranes, contributing to the formation of tight junction strands. These interactions are influenced by the structural features of CLDN3, such as the bending of the transmembrane helix 3 (TM3), which affects the extracellular domain and the cis-interaction pocket size (Nakamura2019Morphologic). 

CLDN3 can form complexes with other claudins, such as claudin-1, as demonstrated by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analysis, which shows similar interaction strengths for claudin-3/claudin-3 and claudin-1/claudin-3 combinations (Milatz2015Probing). These interactions are essential for maintaining the integrity and function of tight junctions in epithelial tissues.
