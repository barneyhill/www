# CDIP1

## Overview
CDIP1, or cell death-inducing p53 target 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death. The protein encoded by CDIP1 is categorized as a pro-apoptotic factor and is a target of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is known to play a critical role in cellular responses to stress and DNA damage (Brown2007CDIP). CDIP1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including membrane remodeling and apoptosis, through its interactions with components of the ESCRT-I complex and other proteins (Inukai2021The). The gene's expression is tightly regulated and has been associated with both cancer progression and cardiac health, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in these contexts (Liao2021Cardiac; Inukai2024Cytoprotective).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDIP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and cardiac health. In cancer, CDIP1 is involved in apoptosis, and its expression is regulated by p53 in response to genotoxic stress. Dysregulation of CDIP1 can lead to impaired apoptotic responses, potentially contributing to tumor progression and resistance to therapy (Brown2007CDIP; Inukai2024Cytoprotective). In breast cancer cells, CDIP1 expression is linked to apoptosis and autophagy, with its degradation occurring via the lysosomal pathway. This suggests that manipulating CDIP1 expression could influence cancer cell survival (Inukai2024Cytoprotective).

In cardiac health, CDIP1 is associated with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. The gene's expression is targeted by microRNAs such as miR-21-5p and miR-24-3p, which can reduce apoptosis in cardiac cells by downregulating CDIP1. This interaction is crucial for promoting angiogenesis and improving cardiac function following myocardial infarction (Jin2024Naringenin; Liao2021Cardiac). Additionally, CDIP1's role in apoptosis is influenced by circular RNAs in heart diseases, where its expression affects myocardial injury outcomes (Wang2020Circular). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CDIP1 in both cancer and cardiovascular conditions.

## Interactions
CDIP1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in apoptosis. It associates with the ESCRT-I complex, particularly with TSG101, a core subunit, in a calcium-dependent manner facilitated by ALG-2. This interaction is enhanced by the presence of calcium ions, suggesting that ALG-2 acts as a bridge between CDIP1 and TSG101 (Inukai2021The). CDIP1 also interacts with VAPA and VAPB through a C-terminal FFAT-like motif, which is crucial for its cell death-inducing activity. The interaction with VAPs is Ca2+-independent, and specific mutations in the FFAT-like motif can disrupt this binding (Inukai2021The).

CDIP1's interaction with ALG-2 is mediated by an ABM-2-like motif in its N-terminal region, which is important for the Ca2+-dependent interaction. This interaction is crucial for CDIP1's role in promoting cell death (Inukai2021The). CDIP1 is also involved in forming complexes with various ESCRT-I isocomplexes, such as 37B/12B and 37C/12B, in a calcium-dependent manner, highlighting its role in cellular processes like membrane remodeling and apoptosis (Inukai2021The). These interactions suggest that CDIP1 is a key player in apoptosis, particularly in response to cellular stress and damage.
