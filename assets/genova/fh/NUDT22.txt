# NUDT22

## Overview
NUDT22 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 22, a member of the nudix hydrolase family, which is involved in the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. This protein plays a critical role in the pyrimidine salvage pathway by hydrolyzing UDP-glucose to UMP, thereby contributing to the maintenance of deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels necessary for DNA replication and repair (Walter2023NUDT22; CarrerasPuigvert2017A). NUDT22 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is regulated by cellular stress, particularly through a p53-mediated pathway, indicating its involvement in the cellular response to DNA damage (Walter2023NUDT22). While its function in healthy cells is less pronounced, NUDT22 is crucial for maintaining nucleotide balance and preventing replication stress, especially during DNA replication (Walter2023NUDT22). The gene's expression is notably elevated in various cancers, where it is associated with poor patient outcomes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Walter2023NUDT22; Walter2022NUDT22).

## Function
NUDT22 is a member of the nudix hydrolase family, which is involved in the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. In healthy human cells, NUDT22 plays a role in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, specifically in the hydrolysis of UDP-glucose to UMP, a precursor for pyrimidine synthesis. This function is crucial for maintaining adequate levels of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) necessary for DNA replication (Walter2023NUDT22). NUDT22 is active in the cytoplasm and contributes to nucleotide metabolism, impacting processes like DNA repair and cellular signaling (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

NUDT22 expression is regulated by cellular stress and is induced by DNA damage through a p53-mediated pathway. This regulation suggests a role in the cellular response to stress, where NUDT22 helps manage nucleotide salvage pathways during periods of increased metabolic demand (Walter2023NUDT22). Although its role in healthy cells is less pronounced compared to cancer cells, NUDT22 is involved in maintaining nucleotide balance and preventing replication stress, which is particularly critical during DNA replication (Walter2023NUDT22). The specific function of NUDT22 in healthy human cells remains less defined, but it is implicated in nucleotide metabolism and cell cycle regulation (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

## Clinical Significance
The NUDT22 gene is clinically significant due to its role in cancer growth through the pyrimidine salvage pathway. Elevated expression of NUDT22 is observed in various cancer tissues, correlating with poor patient outcomes, particularly in breast cancer (Walter2023NUDT22; Walter2022NUDT22). NUDT22 expression is regulated by p53 and cMYC, with a positive correlation between NUDT22 and MYC expression, especially in tumors with p53 mutations (Walter2023NUDT22). Knockout studies in cancer cell lines, such as U2OS and MCF7, demonstrate that loss of NUDT22 leads to increased DNA damage and replication stress, which can be alleviated by uridine supplementation (Walter2023NUDT22; Walter2022NUDT22).

NUDT22-deficient cancer cells show reduced nucleotide pools and increased sensitivity to pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors, suggesting that targeting NUDT22 could be a potential therapeutic strategy (Walter2023NUDT22; Walter2022NUDT22). The gene's involvement in maintaining pyrimidine pools and TCA cycle metabolites highlights its importance in cancer cell metabolism and growth, making it a promising target for cancer therapy (Walter2023NUDT22; Walter2022NUDT22).
