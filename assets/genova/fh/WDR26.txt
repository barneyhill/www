# WDR26

## Overview
WDR26 is a gene located on chromosome 1q42.12 that encodes the WD repeat domain 26 protein, a member of the WD40 repeat-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by its structural motifs, which form a β-propeller structure facilitating protein-protein interactions. WDR26 functions as a scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways such as MAPK, Wnt, and PI3K. It plays a critical role in regulating intracellular signaling, leukocyte migration, and protecting neural cells from oxidative stress-induced injury. Mutations in the WDR26 gene are linked to Skraban-Deardorff syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Sun2011The; Zhao2009A; Pavinato2021Expanding).

## Structure
WDR26 is a protein characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which are short structural motifs that typically form a β-propeller structure. This structure provides multiple binding surfaces for protein-protein interactions (Sun2011The; Zhao2009A). The protein is composed of 514 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 59 kDa (Zhao2009A). WDR26 contains six WD40 repeats, which are conserved across species and are crucial for its function (Zhao2009A).

The molecular structure of WDR26 includes Lis-homology (LisH) and C-terminal to LisH (CTLH) domains at the N terminus, which are involved in protein interactions and dimerization (Sun2013WDR26). These domains, along with the WD40 repeats at the C terminus, facilitate the formation of higher-order oligomers necessary for its scaffolding function (Sun2013WDR26). WDR26 binds to Gβγ subunits, with binding sites located at the C terminus, including the WD40 and LisH-CTLH domains (Sun2011The).

WDR26 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and splice variant isoforms can result in structural diversity, affecting its function and interactions (Zhao2009A).

## Function
WDR26 is a WD40 repeat-containing protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, WDR26 acts as a negative regulator by interacting with Axin1, a scaffold protein involved in the degradation of β-catenin. This interaction facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin, maintaining low cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin in the 'Wnt off' state and negatively regulating the expression of Wnt target genes (Goto2016WDR26).

WDR26 is also involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, where it suppresses the transcriptional activities of c-fos serum response element (SRE) and Elk-1, thereby modulating intracellular signaling pathways and affecting gene expression and cellular responses (Zhu2004WDR26:). In leukocyte migration, WDR26 promotes Gβγ-dependent signal transduction by activating downstream effectors such as PLCβ and PI3K, which are crucial for leukocyte migration (Sun2011The).

Additionally, WDR26 plays a protective role against oxidative stress-induced injury in neural cells by suppressing apoptosis and enhancing cell survival, potentially through the AP-1 signaling pathway (Zhao2009A). In erythropoiesis, WDR26 is part of the Gid ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the polyubiquitination and degradation of nuclear proteins, which is essential for proper erythroblast differentiation (Zhen2020Wdr26).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR26 gene are associated with Skraban-Deardorff syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, abnormal facial features, feeding difficulties, and minor skeletal anomalies. The syndrome is linked to de novo loss-of-function variants in the WDR26 gene, which is highly intolerant to such variations, suggesting haploinsufficiency as the underlying mechanism (Yang2024Novel; Pavinato2021Expanding). 

The WDR26 gene is located at chromosomal region 1q42.12 and encodes a WD-repeat protein involved in several cellular processes, including MAPK, Wnt, and PI3K signaling pathways. Alterations in these pathways have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as cardiovascular, kidney, and skeletal diseases (Yang2024Novel; Pavinato2021Expanding). 

Clinical manifestations of Skraban-Deardorff syndrome are heterogeneous, with symptoms ranging from neurological to non-neurological. These include intellectual disability, developmental delays, hypotonia, epilepsy, and distinct facial features. The phenotypic expression can vary significantly even among patients with the same type of WDR26 variant (Hu2022Two; Yang2024Novel).

## Interactions
WDR26 is a scaffolding protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in signal transduction pathways. It binds to Gβγ subunits, which are part of the G protein complex involved in signal transduction, enhancing Gβγ-mediated activation of phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2) in leukocytes. This interaction is essential for the translocation of PLCβ2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, facilitating its activation (Sun2013WDR26). WDR26 forms a complex with Gβγ and PLCβ2, promoting leukocyte migration by activating downstream effectors like PLCβ and PI3K (Sun2011The).

WDR26 also interacts with VDAC1, a mitochondrial protein, through its isoform MIP2. This interaction is significant in cardiomyocytes, where MIP2 regulates VDAC1 expression levels, potentially influencing apoptosis signaling by inhibiting VDAC1 expression and promoting its degradation (Jiang2018WDR26MIP2).

In Jurkat T cells, WDR26 interacts with endogenous Gβγ upon stimulation with SDF1α, a process dependent on Gi/o proteins. This interaction is transient and is inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating a specific regulatory mechanism in Gβγ signaling (Sun2011The).
