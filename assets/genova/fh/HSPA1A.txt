# HSPA1A

## Overview
The HSPA1A gene encodes the heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 1A, a molecular chaperone that is integral to cellular stress responses and protein homeostasis. As a member of the Hsp70 family, this protein is involved in the folding and stabilization of nascent polypeptides, the refolding of misfolded proteins, and the prevention of protein aggregation, particularly under stress conditions (Oliverio2018Functional; Boyko2017HSP70). The Hsp70 protein encoded by HSPA1A is characterized by its two-domain structure, comprising an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain, which facilitate its chaperone activity through ATP-dependent conformational changes (Zhang2014Crystal; Yang2020SGlutathionylation). Beyond its chaperone functions, Hsp70 is implicated in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and apoptosis inhibition, underscoring its role in maintaining cellular integrity under adverse conditions (Garrido2001Heat; Duan2014HspA1A). The gene's involvement in diverse pathologies, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and schizophrenia, highlights its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Yan2021Comprehensive; Kowalczyk2018Association; Kakkar2014Barcoding).

## Structure
The HSPA1A gene encodes a protein that is part of the Hsp70 family, which plays a crucial role in protein homeostasis. The protein structure consists of two main domains: an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD) (Zhang2014Crystal; Yang2020SGlutathionylation). The NBD is responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, which regulates the chaperone activity of the protein (Zhang2014Crystal). The SBD is further divided into two subdomains: SBDα, an alpha-helical lid, and SBDβ, a beta-sandwich that contains the peptide-binding pocket (Zhang2014Crystal).

The SBDα forms an α-helical bundle that acts as a lid over the substrate-binding site, and its structure is less conserved among Hsp70 family members (Yang2020SGlutathionylation). The SBDβ is more structurally conserved and contains the peptide-binding pocket (Zhang2014Crystal). The protein undergoes allosteric conformational changes that couple ATP hydrolysis in the NBD with substrate binding and release in the SBD (Yang2020SGlutathionylation).

Post-translational modifications such as S-glutathionylation can lead to structural changes, including the unfolding of the α-helical lid, affecting substrate binding and ATPase activity (Yang2020SGlutathionylation). These modifications play a regulatory role in the protein's function (Yang2020SGlutathionylation).

## Function
The HSPA1A gene encodes a major stress-inducible 70-kDa heat shock protein, known as Hsp70, which functions as a molecular chaperone in human cells. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by assisting in the proper folding of nascent and stress-accumulated misfolded proteins, preventing protein aggregation, and facilitating the refolding of denatured proteins (Oliverio2018Functional). Hsp70 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it is involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding, stabilization, and degradation of misfolded proteins (Boyko2017HSP70).

Hsp70 also plays a significant role in the cellular stress response by promoting the repair or elimination of damaged proteins and stabilizing molecular conformation. It is involved in DNA repair processes, including base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair pathways, by interacting with other proteins such as casein kinase 2 (Duan2014HspA1A). Additionally, Hsp70 exhibits anti-apoptotic properties, inhibiting apoptosis by reducing caspase activation and preventing mitochondrial damage (Garrido2001Heat). These functions are crucial for protecting cells from stress-induced damage and maintaining protein homeostasis under adverse conditions.

## Clinical Significance
HSPA1A, a member of the Hsp70 family, is implicated in various diseases due to mutations, expression alterations, or changes in its interactions. In cancer, HSPA1A copy number variations (CNVs) are associated with shorter survival times in stomach adenocarcinoma and esophageal carcinoma, with hazard ratios indicating a significant impact on prognosis (Yan2021Comprehensive). The gene is also down-regulated in colon adenocarcinoma, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Yan2021Comprehensive). In neurodegenerative diseases, HSPA1A overexpression has been shown to inhibit α-synuclein aggregation in Parkinson's disease models, indicating a protective role against protein aggregation (Kakkar2014Barcoding). In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), HSPA1A has been observed to reduce TDP-43-associated degeneration in Drosophila and provide protection in mouse models, although its long-term effects on SOD1 aggregates remain unclear (Kakkar2014Barcoding).

In schizophrenia, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HSPA1A, such as rs562047, have been linked to symptom severity, particularly in paranoid schizophrenia, with sex-dependent effects noted (Kowalczyk2018Association). These findings suggest that HSPA1A may play a role in the psychopathology of schizophrenia, potentially through neuroprotective mechanisms (Kowalczyk2018Association).

## Interactions
HSPA1A, a member of the Hsp70 family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a molecular chaperone. It forms complexes with the ZNF198 protein and its oncogenic derivative ZNF198-FGFR1, playing a critical role in their stability and function. This interaction is essential for the nuclear localization and stability of ZNF198, and the absence of HSPA1A disrupts these processes (Kasyapa2007HSPA1A). HSPA1A also interacts with casein kinase 2 (CK2) in human bronchial epithelial cells, enhancing DNA repair processes. This interaction is particularly significant following exposure to benzo[a]pyrene, where HSPA1A and CK2 co-localize in the nucleus and perinuclear region, facilitating DNA repair (Duan2014HspA1A).

In neuronal cells, HSPA1A associates with stress-sensitive cytoplasmic and nuclear structures, including centrioles and nuclear speckles, following heat shock. It colocalizes with markers such as γ-tubulin and SON, indicating its involvement in cellular stress responses (Shorbagi2016Dynamics). Additionally, HSPA1A's interaction with intracellular phosphatidylserine is crucial for its membrane localization, which is important for its function under stress conditions (Bilog2019Membrane).
