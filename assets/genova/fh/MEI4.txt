# MEI4

## Overview
MEI4 is a gene that encodes the meiotic double-stranded break formation protein 4, a crucial component in the process of meiotic recombination. This protein is integral to the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are essential for homologous chromosome pairing and genetic diversity during meiosis (Pan2024Biallelic). MEI4 functions as part of the pre-DSB recombinosomes, facilitating the molecular environment necessary for DNA breakage along the chromosomal axis (Pan2024Biallelic). The protein is active in the nucleus during the prophase I stage of meiosis, where it localizes to specific foci on meiotic chromosome axes, acting as a structural component of the DSB machinery (Kumar2010Functional). MEI4's interaction with other proteins, such as REC114, forms a complex essential for DSB formation, highlighting its role as a key player in the meiotic process (Daccache2022Evolutionary). The gene's function is conserved across mammalian species, emphasizing its importance in fertility and reproductive health (Pan2024Biallelic).

## Function
MEI4 (meiotic double-stranded break formation protein 4) is essential for the initiation of meiotic recombination in human cells. It plays a critical role in the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiosis, a process necessary for homologous chromosome pairing and genetic diversity (Pan2024Biallelic). MEI4 is part of the pre-DSB recombinosomes, which create the molecular environment required for DNA breakage along the chromosomal axis, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during meiosis (Pan2024Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, MEI4 is active in the nucleus, particularly during the prophase I stage of meiosis. It localizes to discrete foci on meiotic chromosome axes, acting as a structural component of the DSB machinery (Kumar2010Functional). The protein's interaction with DNA is crucial for its function, as it facilitates the necessary DNA interactions for DSB formation (Pan2024Biallelic).

The function of MEI4 is conserved across mammalian species, underscoring its essential role in meiosis and fertility. Disruption of MEI4's interaction with DNA can lead to infertility due to arrested embryonic development, highlighting its importance in reproductive health (Pan2024Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MEI4 gene are associated with female infertility, specifically preimplantation embryonic arrest (PREMBA). Bi-allelic missense variants in MEI4 have been identified in individuals from multiple families experiencing primary infertility and recurrent IVF/ICSI failures. These variants disrupt the interaction between MEI4 and DNA, impairing its function in meiotic double-strand break formation, which is crucial for oocyte maturation and embryonic development (Pan2024Biallelic). In vivo studies using knock-in mouse models have demonstrated that these variants lead to infertility and developmental defects during oogenesis, confirming the pathogenic role of MEI4 mutations in female infertility (Pan2024Biallelic).

In mice, the absence of MEI4 results in significant defects in both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. MEI4-deficient mice exhibit meiotic arrest and increased apoptosis in spermatocytes, as well as impaired development of oocytes and follicles. These findings suggest that MEI4 is essential for proper meiotic progression and gamete development, and its dysfunction can lead to infertility (Kumar2010Functional). The functional conservation of MEI4 across species underscores its critical role in reproductive health, and mutations in this gene can have profound effects on fertility (Kumar2010Functional).

## Interactions
MEI4 is a protein that plays a crucial role in meiotic double-strand break (DSB) formation by interacting with other proteins to form a complex essential for this process. MEI4 interacts directly with REC114, forming a heterotrimeric complex with a 2:1 stoichiometry, where the C-terminus of REC114 homodimerizes and interacts with the N-terminus of MEI4 (Daccache2022Evolutionary). This interaction is conserved across species, as demonstrated by structural modeling and experimental validation (Daccache2022Evolutionary). The MEI4-REC114 complex is part of a larger assembly that includes IHO1, which is necessary for the localization of MEI4 and REC114 on the chromosome axis (Kumar2018Mouse).

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, MEI4 forms a complex with Mer2 and Rec114, which is crucial for DSB formation. These proteins partially colocalize on meiotic chromosomes and co-immunoprecipitate, indicating strong interactions (Li2006Saccharomyces). The MEI4-Rec114 interaction is particularly strong, as shown in two-hybrid protein systems (Li2006Saccharomyces). The presence of MEI4 stabilizes Rec114, as indicated by thermal shift analyses (Daccache2022Evolutionary). These interactions are essential for the recruitment and stabilization of the DSB machinery during meiosis.
