# POLR3G

## Overview
POLR3G is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase III subunit G, a critical component of the RNA polymerase III enzyme complex. This protein is involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA, which are essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth (Renaud2013Gene). As a subunit of RNA polymerase III, POLR3G plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of cellular homeostasis, particularly in the nucleoplasm (Wong2011A). The protein is notably expressed in human pluripotent stem cells, where it is implicated in maintaining pluripotency and is rapidly downregulated during differentiation (Lund2017RNA; Wong2011A). POLR3G's expression and function are tightly regulated by transcription factors such as MYC, NANOG, and OCT4, which are crucial for stem cell maintenance and proliferation (Wong2011A; Renaud2013Gene). Additionally, alterations in POLR3G expression have been linked to various cancers, where it is often upregulated, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Cheng2023RNA).

## Function
POLR3G encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III, which is crucial for transcribing small non-coding RNAs, including tRNA and 5S rRNA, in eukaryotic cells. This transcriptional activity is essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth, as these RNAs play a vital role in the translation process (Renaud2013Gene). POLR3G is predominantly active in the nucleoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Wong2011A).

In human pluripotent stem cells, POLR3G is highly expressed and is rapidly downregulated during differentiation. This expression pattern suggests its involvement in maintaining pluripotency and its potential as a marker for undifferentiated stem cells (Lund2017RNA; Wong2011A). POLR3G regulates specific subsets of polyadenylated and small RNA transcriptomes, influencing the expression of protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs, which are crucial for stem cell maintenance and proliferation (Lund2017RNA).

The gene is also implicated in cellular transformation, as its expression is associated with increased cell proliferation and resistance to differentiation in stem cells (Wong2011A; Renaud2013Gene). POLR3G's regulatory role is further highlighted by its interaction with transcription factors such as MYC, NANOG, and OCT4, which are key players in maintaining the pluripotent state of stem cells (Wong2011A; Renaud2013Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the POLR3G gene have been implicated in various cancers. POLR3G is upregulated in several cancer types, including prostate cancer, basal-like breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, and multiple myeloma. This upregulation is often associated with poor prognosis and survival outcomes (Cheng2023RNA). In bladder cancer, POLR3G expression is positively correlated with tumor progression, and its knockdown in cell lines results in decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in malignancy (Liu2024The).

The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as MYC, OCT4, and NANOG, which are frequently dysregulated in cancer. MYC, in particular, directly targets POLR3G, enhancing RNA polymerase III activity, a characteristic of cancerous cells (Cheng2023RNA; Renaud2013Gene). The contrasting expression patterns of POLR3G and its paralog POLR3GL in cancer suggest different roles, with POLR3GL associated with favorable outcomes (Cheng2023RNA).

In addition to cancer, POLR3G is crucial for maintaining pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells, and its dysregulation can lead to loss of pluripotency and increased differentiation, potentially contributing to oncogenic transformation (Wong2011A).

## Interactions
POLR3G, a subunit of RNA polymerase III, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a trimeric subcomplex with POLR3C and POLR3F, which is essential for transcription initiation. This subcomplex interacts with transcription initiation factors such as TFIIIB, highlighting its role in the formation of the transcription initiation complex (Wong2011A; Renaud2013Gene). 

POLR3G also interacts directly with POLR3C but not with POLR3F, BRF1, or BRF2, suggesting specific binding within the trimeric complex. This complex interacts with BRF1 and BRF2 through other subunits, indicating a structured assembly within the RNA polymerase III complex (Renaud2013Gene). 

In human pluripotent stem cells, POLR3G binds to tRNA genes, non-coding RNAs, and miRNAs, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Its binding sites overlap significantly with those of POLR3A, and it is involved in maintaining stem cell status by regulating the expression of various tRNAs and small RNAs (Lund2017RNA). 

POLR3G is also a downstream target of transcription factors such as OCT4 and NANOG, and its expression is regulated by the Erk1/2 signaling pathway, indicating its integration into broader regulatory networks (Wong2011A).
