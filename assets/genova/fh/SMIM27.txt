# SMIM27

## Overview
SMIM27 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 27, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including macrophage differentiation and inflammatory signaling, as identified through CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens (Halasz2023CRISPRi). While the precise biological functions of SMIM27 are still being elucidated, its expression and methylation patterns have been linked to several clinical conditions, such as basal cell carcinoma and pregnancy-induced hypertension, suggesting a potential role in cancer development and neurodevelopmental outcomes (Nawrocka2021Profile; Zhu2024Pregnancy). The gene's involvement in these diverse biological contexts highlights its significance in both normal physiology and disease states.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The SMIM27 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although specific diseases directly linked to its mutations or expression alterations are still under investigation. In the context of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), SMIM27 is frequently mutated in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), suggesting a potential role in cancer development. However, the precise impact of these mutations on BCC progression or patient outcomes remains unclear (Nawrocka2021Profile).

In breast cancer, the overexpression of SMIM27 has been associated with favorable outcomes, indicating a possible protective role in this type of cancer (Nawrocka2021Profile). Additionally, research on pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) has identified SMIM27 as having a hypermethylated differentially methylated region (DMR) in newborns, which may influence nervous system development. This suggests that abnormal methylation of SMIM27 could mediate the effects of PIH on neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring (Zhu2024Pregnancy).

Furthermore, SMIM27 has been identified as a multifunctional locus in CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens, indicating its involvement in macrophage differentiation and inflammatory signaling, although specific diseases related to these functions have not been detailed (Halasz2023CRISPRi).
