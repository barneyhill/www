# CBLN4

## Overview
CBLN4 is a gene that encodes the cerebellin 4 precursor protein, a member of the cerebellin family, which is part of the C1q and tumor necrosis factor superfamily. The cerebellin 4 precursor protein is primarily involved in synaptic organization and function within the central nervous system, acting as a synaptic organizer. It plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of inhibitory GABAergic synapses, particularly those targeting dendrites of somatostatin-positive interneurons, and is implicated in the regulation of anxiety-related behaviors (Larsen2021The). The protein's structure includes a 10-stranded jelly-roll fold and a unique alpha helix, allowing it to form hexameric complexes that interact with various receptors, such as neurexins and the netrin receptor DCC, influencing synaptic plasticity and neuronal communication (Zhong2017Cbln1; Rong2018Glycosylation). CBLN4's expression is notably high in specific brain regions, such as the thalamus, suggesting its involvement in thalamo-cortical pathways and sensory and motor functions (wei2012cbln).

## Structure
The CBLN4 protein, part of the cerebellin family, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by several distinct features. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a protein capable of undergoing post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation at asparagine residues N26 and N85. This glycosylation affects receptor binding properties, with the N-terminal glycosylation site enhancing binding to neurexins when eliminated, and the C1q domain site increasing binding to Grid2 when removed (Rong2018Glycosylation).

The secondary structure of CBLN4 includes a 10-stranded jelly-roll fold and an additional alpha helix, which is unique to the Cbln family (Zhong2017Cbln1). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, forming a globular assembly that is typical of the C1q/TNF superfamily (Rong2018Glycosylation).

In terms of quaternary structure, CBLN4 can form hexameric complexes composed of a dimer of trimers. The C1q domain mediates trimer assembly, while a cysteine motif near the N-terminus supports dimerization via disulfide bonding (Rong2018Glycosylation). These structural features enable CBLN4 to interact with various receptors, influencing synaptic organization and function.

## Function
CBLN4, a member of the cerebellin family, plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and function within the central nervous system. It is part of the C1q and tumor necrosis factor superfamily and acts as a synaptic organizer, particularly in the formation and maintenance of inhibitory GABAergic synapses. CBLN4 is essential for the development of dendrite-targeting inhibitory synapses made by somatostatin-positive interneurons, contributing to the regulation of anxiety-related behaviors (Larsen2021The).

CBLN4 interacts with various signaling pathways and receptors, notably binding to the netrin receptor DCC, which is involved in developmental processes. This interaction suggests that CBLN4 may participate in DCC-dependent processes, influencing synaptic function in the adult brain (wei2012cbln). CBLN4 also forms heteromeric complexes with CBLN1, which can alter receptor-binding specificity and influence signaling pathways (wei2012cbln).

In the context of synaptic plasticity, CBLN4 interacts with neogenin-1 (Neo1) to mediate long-term potentiation (LTP) at entorhinal cortex-dentate gyrus synapses, highlighting its role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal communication (LiakathAli2022Transsynaptic). CBLN4's expression is highest in specific brain regions, such as the thalamus, indicating its involvement in thalamo-cortical pathways and sensory and motor functions (wei2012cbln).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CBLN4 gene have been associated with several neurological and physiological conditions. In the context of synaptic function, CBLN4 plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and plasticity. Its interaction with neurexin and neogenin-1 is essential for long-term potentiation (LTP) at entorhinal cortex-dentate gyrus synapses, which is critical for learning and memory processes (LiakathAli2022Transsynaptic). Disruptions in these interactions can lead to impaired synaptic modification, potentially contributing to cognitive deficits.

In animal studies, the deletion of CBLN4, along with other cerebellins, has been linked to severe neurological symptoms such as epilepsy and motor dysfunction, although these do not affect lifespan (Seigneur2018Genetic). The absence of CBLN4, in combination with CBLN1 and CBLN2, results in significant synaptic and behavioral changes, indicating its role in maintaining normal brain function (Seigneur2018Genetic).

Additionally, CBLN4 has been implicated in the regulation of energy balance and weight, as its expression is downregulated in response to food deprivation, suggesting a potential link to obesity (Chiang2019Genomewide). In the context of cystic fibrosis, CBLN4 is associated with lung disease severity, although specific mutations or alterations in this gene have not been detailed (Gallati2014Diseasemodifying).

## Interactions
CBLN4, a member of the cerebellin family, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for synaptic function. It forms a stable complex with the neurexin protein Nrxn1b, with a stoichiometry of 1:1, as demonstrated by size-exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering (Zhong2017Cbln1). This interaction is specific, with Nrxn1b binding to the N-terminal region of CBLN4, breaking the symmetry of the CBLN4 hexamer (Zhong2017Cbln1).

CBLN4 also binds robustly to the netrin receptor DCC, a prototype receptor involved in developmental processes. This interaction is stronger than CBLN1's binding to GluRδ2 and is similar to its binding with neurexins (wei2012cbln). CBLN4's interaction with DCC can be competed by netrin-1, suggesting a competitive binding relationship (wei2012cbln).

In the context of synaptic plasticity, CBLN4 interacts with neogenin-1 (Neo1) in the dentate gyrus, forming a complex essential for long-term potentiation (LTP) at entorhinal cortex-dentate gyrus synapses. This interaction involves presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic Neo1, highlighting CBLN4's role in transsynaptic signaling (LiakathAli2022Transsynaptic). These interactions underscore CBLN4's involvement in synaptic organization and signaling pathways.
