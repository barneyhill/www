# LYZL2

## Overview
LYZL2 is a gene that encodes the protein lysozyme-like 2, which is a member of the mammalian lysozyme gene family. This protein is primarily expressed in the testes, indicating a potential role in reproductive processes rather than traditional lysozyme activity, such as bacterial cell wall degradation (Li2021Fish; Irwin2011Evolution). The LYZL2 protein is characterized by amino acid substitutions that likely render it inactive in hydrolyzing bacterial peptidoglycan, differentiating it from conventional lysozymes (Irwin2011Evolution). The gene is located on chromosome 10 and is closely related to LYZL1, with both genes arising from a recent segmental duplication, suggesting a recent evolutionary origin (Irwin2011Evolution). The evolutionary and expression patterns of LYZL2 imply its involvement in sperm maturation and fertilization, potentially contributing to sperm surface modifications (Narmadha2016In).

## Structure


## Function
LYZL2, a member of the mammalian lysozyme gene family, is primarily expressed in the testes, suggesting a role in reproduction (Li2021Fish; Irwin2011Evolution). Unlike traditional lysozymes, LYZL2 has amino acid substitutions that likely render it unable to hydrolyze bacterial peptidoglycan, indicating it may not possess typical lysozyme activity (Irwin2011Evolution). Instead, LYZL2 might be involved in processes related to sperm maturation and fertilization, as its expression is abundant in the testis (Narmadha2016In; Li2021Fish).

The gene is located on chromosome 10, close to LYZL1, and is part of a recent segmental duplication, suggesting a recent evolutionary origin (Irwin2011Evolution). The high sequence identity between LYZL1 and LYZL2 may be due to concerted evolution, which could obscure their distinct evolutionary paths (Irwin2011Evolution). Although the specific function of LYZL2 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its expression pattern and evolutionary history imply essential roles in reproductive biology, potentially contributing to sperm surface modifications and fertilization processes (Narmadha2016In).
