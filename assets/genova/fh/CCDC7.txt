# CCDC7

## Overview
The CCDC7 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 7 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and signal transduction. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions, making it a crucial component in cellular signaling pathways. CCDC7 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, such as early-onset preeclampsia, cervical cancer, and diabetic retinopathy, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological and disease contexts. The gene's expression and mutations can influence critical pathways, such as the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby affecting cellular functions and contributing to disease pathogenesis (Cai2024Genomewide; CCDC7; Tan2024Rare).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCDC7 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In early-onset preeclampsia (EOPE), rare mutations in CCDC7, specifically the c.625C>T (p.R209C) and c.1015C>T (p.R339*) variants, have been identified. These mutations are associated with impaired trophoblast migration and invasion, which are critical processes in placental development. The p.R339* variant, in particular, results in decreased mRNA and protein expression, contributing to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia by affecting placental function (Tan2024Rare).

In cervical cancer, CCDC7 is overexpressed and linked to tumor growth and poor prognosis. It promotes cell proliferation through the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway by upregulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This overexpression is associated with advanced clinical stages and higher histological grades of cervical cancer, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (p&gt; Zhou2020&lt; CCDC7).

CCDC7 has also been associated with diabetic retinopathy (DR) through genome-wide association studies. The rs184619214 variant in CCDC7 is linked to vascular functions and may contribute to the genetic predisposition to DR, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Cai2024Genomewide).
