# ZNF100

## Overview
ZNF100 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 100, a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are typically involved in DNA binding and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation, gene expression, and cellular differentiation. The specific functions of zinc finger protein 100, as encoded by ZNF100, are not fully elucidated, but it is believed to participate in various cellular processes through its interactions with DNA and other proteins. The study of ZNF100 and its protein product is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential roles in health and disease.
