# CEP72

## Overview
CEP72 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 72, a crucial component of the centrosome involved in centriole duplication and microtubule organization. This protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein and plays a significant role in the recruitment and assembly of microcephaly (MCPH) proteins at the centrosome, which is essential for proper cell cycle progression and mitosis. CEP72 is integral to the hierarchical network of centriolar satellite proteins, facilitating the localization and function of key proteins necessary for centriole duplication and microtubule dynamics (Kodani2015Centriolar; Ying2022CCHCR1astrin). The protein's interactions with other centrosomal proteins, such as astrin and CCHCR1, underscore its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper mitotic processes (Ying2022CCHCR1astrin). Additionally, alterations in CEP72 expression have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer development and progression (Lin2021Comprehensive; Ni2020Functional).

## Function
CEP72 is a centrosomal protein that plays a critical role in centriole duplication and microtubule organization in healthy human cells. It is involved in the recruitment of microcephaly (MCPH) proteins, such as CEP152, CEP63, and CDK5RAP2, to the centrosome, which is essential for proper centriole duplication and centrosome maturation during mitosis (Kodani2015Centriolar; Ying2022CCHCR1astrin). CEP72 functions as part of a hierarchical system of centriolar satellite proteins that ensure the proper assembly and localization of these MCPH-associated proteins at the centrosome, facilitating the recruitment of CDK2, a cyclin-dependent kinase necessary for centriole duplication (Kodani2015Centriolar).

CEP72 is also crucial for microtubule dynamics, as its depletion affects microtubule nucleation activity and decreases microtubule regrowth, impacting the organization of the mitotic spindle (Ying2022CCHCR1astrin). The protein localizes to the pericentriolar material (PCM) and is involved in the transport of cargo proteins to the centrosome in a microtubule-dependent manner, highlighting its role in cell cycle progression and mitosis (Kodani2015Centriolar). The interaction between CEP72 and other centrosomal proteins, such as astrin and HCR, is necessary for its centrosome localization, which is vital for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Ying2022CCHCR1astrin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the CEP72 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer, genetic variants in CEP72, such as the rs924607-T allele, are associated with increased expression of the gene in stomach tissues. This heightened expression is linked to enhanced promoter activity, which correlates with increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Knockdown experiments of CEP72 in gastric cancer cell lines have shown a significant reduction in these malignant behaviors and an increase in apoptosis, suggesting that CEP72 plays a role in promoting gastric cancer progression through pathways like the Ras signaling pathway (Ni2020Functional).

In colorectal cancer, germline deletion structural variants (DSVs) involving CEP72 have been associated with immune response gene expression and cancer prognosis. Specifically, the deletion of CEP72 has been linked to improved recurrence-free survival, potentially through its interaction with the IFIT1 gene, which is involved in immune response modulation. This suggests that CEP72 deletions might influence cancer prognosis by affecting the tumor microenvironment and immune gene expression (Lin2021Comprehensive). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CEP72 in cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
CEP72 is a centrosomal protein that plays a critical role in centriole duplication and microtubule organization through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts directly with HCR (CCHCR1) via the third coiled-coil domain, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. This interaction is crucial for the centrosome localization of CEP72, as the depletion of HCR or astrin significantly reduces CEP72's centrosomal signal, although its overall expression remains unchanged (Ying2022CCHCR1astrin). 

CEP72 is also involved in a complex with astrin and HCR, which is essential for recruiting MCPH proteins like CEP152 and CEP63 to the centrosome, necessary for proper centriole duplication. The interaction between HCR and CEP72 is mediated by the C-terminal coiled-coil of HCR, and overexpression of this domain can disrupt microtubule organization by sequestering CEP72 into cytoplasmic puncta, preventing its localization to the centrosome (Ying2022CCHCR1astrin). 

Additionally, CEP72 interacts with CEP290 at centriolar satellites, which is important for recruiting BBS proteins to the primary cilium. This interaction highlights CEP72's role in cilium formation and trafficking (Conkar2017The). These interactions underscore CEP72's importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper mitotic processes.
