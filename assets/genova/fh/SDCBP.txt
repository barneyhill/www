# SDCBP

## Overview
The SDCBP gene encodes the protein syntenin-1, a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. Syntenin-1 is characterized by its two PDZ domains, which facilitate interactions with a range of partner proteins, thereby playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. It is particularly noted for its interactions with syndecans, transmembrane proteoglycans that are integral to cellular signaling and adhesion. Syntenin-1's ability to bind to the C-terminal motifs of syndecans influences processes such as exosome formation and focal adhesion dynamics. The protein is implicated in oncogenic pathways, with its expression and interactions being linked to the progression of several cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer. These interactions highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Qian2017Dasatinib; Du2020SDCBPMDA9syntenin; Mathiesen2019The).

## Structure
Syntenin-1, encoded by the SDCBP gene, is a multifunctional protein composed of 298 amino acids and is highly conserved across species (Lee2023The). The protein is organized into four distinct domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), two PDZ domains (PDZ1 and PDZ2), and the C-terminal domain (CTD) (Lee2023The). The PDZ domains are crucial for protein-protein interactions, typically binding to the C-terminal peptide of partner proteins. PDZ1 has a weak binding affinity due to its positive charge, while PDZ2 is the preferred binding site for most partner proteins (Lee2023The).

The tertiary structure of syntenin-1 is characterized by these PDZ domains, which facilitate its role in cellular signaling and interaction with other proteins. Syntenin-1 can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure (Lee2023The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating its function. For instance, phosphorylation by Aurora A kinase (AURKA) at specific sites prevents its degradation and promotes its stability, which is crucial for its oncogenic function in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Du2020SDCBPMDA9syntenin). Splice variants of SDCBP can lead to different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Lee2023The).

## Function
SDCBP, also known as syntenin-1, is a protein that plays a significant role in intracellular trafficking, cell adhesion, and signaling pathways. It interacts with syndecans, which are transmembrane proteoglycans involved in cellular signaling and adhesion. SDCBP is known to bind to the C-terminal FYA-motif in syndecan-4 through its PDZ2 domain, influencing the recycling of syndecan to the plasma membrane and exosome formation. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of focal adhesion formation by modulating the syndecan-4-PKCα interaction, which affects PKCα activation (Mathiesen2019The).

In the context of syndecan-2, SDCBP is involved in intracellular trafficking, coordinating with ARF6, a GTP binding protein that regulates the intracellular traffic of syndecans. It is robustly associated with syndecan-2, indicating its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and protein metabolism (Mathiesen2020The). SDCBP is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it influences processes like cell migration and proliferation. It is also implicated in the organization of the cytoskeleton, contributing to cell communication and signal transduction pathways (Mathiesen2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SDCBP gene, also known as syntenin-1, have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In uveal melanoma, high SDCBP expression is associated with an increased risk of metastasis, comparable to the risk conferred by monosomy 3, a known marker for poor prognosis. This suggests that SDCBP could serve as a prognostic marker for metastatic progression in uveal melanoma (Gangemi2012Mda9Syntenin).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), SDCBP is overexpressed and correlates with advanced clinical stages and poor survival outcomes. The protein interacts with the EGFR-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, promoting oncogenic activities such as cell survival and migration. Phosphorylation by AURKA enhances its stability and oncogenic function, making SDCBP a potential therapeutic target in ESCC (Du2020SDCBPMDA9syntenin).

In pancreatic cancer, high SDCBP expression is linked to poor prognosis and promotes cancer progression through the PI3K/AKT pathway. It is regulated by miR-216b, with low levels of this microRNA associated with increased cancer progression, suggesting both SDCBP and miR-216b as potential therapeutic targets (Zu2022Syntenin).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SDCBP overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis. It interacts with c-src, promoting its phosphorylation and cancer progression, and dasatinib, a c-src inhibitor, has shown potential in targeting SDCBP-overexpressing TNBC cells (Qian2017Dasatinib).

## Interactions
SDCBP, also known as syntenin-1, is a protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It contains two PDZ domains that facilitate its binding to multiple partners. SDCBP interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through its PDZ2 domain, influencing EGFR internalization and signaling, which is crucial for the activation of the EGFR-PI3K-Akt pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (Du2020SDCBPMDA9syntenin). 

SDCBP also interacts with Aurora kinase A (AURKA), which phosphorylates SDCBP at specific sites, enhancing its stability by preventing ubiquitination-mediated degradation. This interaction occurs primarily through the PDZ1 domain of SDCBP (Du2020SDCBPMDA9syntenin). The phosphorylation of SDCBP by AURKA is essential for maintaining its oncogenic function and stability, particularly in the context of ESCC (Du2020SDCBPMDA9syntenin).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SDCBP interacts with c-src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, promoting its phosphorylation at tyrosine-419. This interaction enhances tumor cell proliferation by facilitating the G1/S transition in the cell cycle. Dasatinib, a kinase inhibitor, disrupts this interaction, highlighting the potential of targeting SDCBP-c-src interactions in TNBC therapy (Qian2017Dasatinib).
