# SLC28A2

## Overview
The SLC28A2 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 28 member 2, also known as human concentrative nucleoside transporter 2 (hCNT2). This protein is a transmembrane transporter that plays a critical role in the cellular uptake of nucleosides, particularly purine nucleosides and uridine, through a sodium-dependent mechanism. hCNT2 is predominantly expressed in the intestinal epithelium, where it facilitates the absorption of nucleosides necessary for nucleic acid synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Pastor‐Anglada2018Intestinal; PastorAnglada2015Nucleoside). Beyond its physiological functions, hCNT2 is also involved in the pharmacokinetics of nucleoside-derived drugs, influencing their absorption and efficacy (Pastor‐Anglada2018Intestinal). Variations in the SLC28A2 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as hyperuricemia and gout, as well as differential drug responses, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Lemstrová2014Role; Zhou2019Common).

## Function
The SLC28A2 gene encodes the human concentrative nucleoside transporter 2 (hCNT2), which is integral to the uptake of nucleosides into cells. This transporter is primarily responsible for the absorption of purine nucleosides and uridine, playing a crucial role in nucleotide nutrition and nucleoside absorption across the intestinal epithelial barrier (Pastor‐Anglada2018Intestinal; PastorAnglada2015Nucleoside). hCNT2 is located at the apical side of enterocytes in the intestinal epithelium, where it facilitates the unidirectional flow of nucleosides into the cell through a sodium-dependent mechanism, with a 1:1 stoichiometry of sodium ions to nucleosides (Pastor‐Anglada2018Intestinal; PastorAnglada2015Nucleoside).

In healthy human cells, hCNT2 is involved in the uptake and transport of purine nucleosides, which are essential for nucleic acid synthesis and cellular homeostasis (PastorAnglada2015Nucleoside). The transporter is also significant for drug pharmacokinetics, as it mediates the absorption of nucleoside-derived drugs like ribavirin in the gastrointestinal tract (Pastor‐Anglada2018Intestinal). Additionally, hCNT2 plays a role in modulating extracellular adenosine levels, which is important for purinergic signaling and maintaining intestinal physiology (Pastor‐Anglada2018Intestinal).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC28A2 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily related to its role in nucleoside transport. Variants in SLC28A2 are associated with serum uric acid (SUA) levels, hyperuricemia (HUA), and gout in the Han Chinese population. Specifically, the polymorphism rs16941238 is significantly associated with SUA levels and HUA, while rs2271437 is linked to an increased risk of gout (Zhou2019Common). These associations suggest that genetic variations in SLC28A2 may influence the development of these conditions by affecting uric acid metabolism.

In the context of cancer treatment, SLC28A2 has been studied for its role in drug response. Variants such as rs1060896 and rs1637002 have been associated with a decreased risk of neutropenia in non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin, although similar studies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients have not shown consistent results (Lemstrová2014Role). However, no significant associations were found between SLC28A2 variants and methotrexate efficacy or toxicity in rheumatoid arthritis patients, indicating the complexity of predicting drug response based on genetic factors alone (Eektimmerman2018SLC04A1).
