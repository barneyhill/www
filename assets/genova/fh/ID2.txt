# ID2

## Overview
ID2, or inhibitor of DNA binding 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein family, which functions as a dominant negative regulator of basic HLH transcription factors. The ID2 protein is characterized by its HLH domain, which allows it to form heterodimers with other HLH proteins, thereby inhibiting their DNA-binding activity due to its lack of a basic DNA-binding region (Sun1991Id; Roschger2017The). This regulatory mechanism is crucial for controlling cell differentiation and maintaining cellular proliferative potential. ID2 plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation by interacting with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and related proteins, disrupting their growth-suppressing activities and promoting cell cycle progression (Lasorella1996Id2). Additionally, ID2 is involved in various cellular processes, including myeloid cell differentiation and apoptosis, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, where its expression levels can serve as a prognostic biomarker (Florio1998Id2; Zhou2017High).

## Structure
The ID2 protein is part of the ID protein family, characterized by a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain that is crucial for its function. This domain allows ID2 to form heterodimers with basic HLH (bHLH) transcription factors, inhibiting their DNA-binding activity due to the absence of a basic DNA-binding region in ID2 (Sun1991Id; Roschger2017The). The HLH domain of ID2 can undergo self-association or heteroassociation with other HLH domains, forming a four-helix bundle, as supported by the crystal structure of the ID2 HLH domain (PDB ID: 4AYA) (Roschger2017The).

The N-terminal and C-terminal regions of ID2 are primarily disordered, containing regulatory signals such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation sites, as well as molecular recognition elements like the nuclear export signal (NES) and destruction box (D-box) (Roschger2017The). These intrinsically disordered regions contribute to ID2's conformational flexibility and its ability to interact with various proteins (Roschger2017The). Phosphorylation, particularly at Ser-5 by Cdk2 during the G1-S transition, affects ID2's localization and function, influencing its stability and degradation (Roschger2017The). Attempts to crystallize the full-length ID2 protein have been unsuccessful, with only a truncated version being crystallized (Roschger2017The).

## Function
ID2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2) is a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein family that functions as a dominant negative regulator of basic HLH transcription factors. It lacks the basic DNA binding domain, allowing it to form heterodimers with bHLH proteins, thereby inhibiting their ability to bind DNA and activate transcription (Sun1991Id). This regulatory mechanism is crucial in controlling cell differentiation and maintaining the proliferative potential of cells.

In healthy human cells, ID2 plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation by interacting with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and related proteins such as p107 and p130. This interaction disrupts the growth-suppressing activities of these tumor suppressor proteins, allowing cells to progress through the cell cycle (Lasorella1996Id2). ID2 can also counteract the effects of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors like p16 and p21, further promoting cell cycle progression (Lasorella1996Id2).

ID2 is involved in the differentiation of myeloid cells, where its expression increases during the maturation of granulocytes and macrophages. This suggests a role in promoting differentiation in more mature myeloid cells (Ishiguro1996Id2). Additionally, ID2 is implicated in apoptosis, with its expression correlating with increased levels of the proapoptotic molecule Bax, indicating a role in programmed cell death (Florio1998Id2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ID2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high ID2 expression is associated with poor chemotherapy response and prognosis, as well as shorter overall survival. It serves as an independent prognostic biomarker, with expression levels decreasing during remission and increasing at relapse (Zhou2017High).

In neuroblastoma, ID2 is regulated by the oncogene N-MYC, and its expression is linked to tumor progression. However, some studies have questioned its prognostic value due to issues with antibody specificity (Perk2005Id). Despite high transcript levels, ID2 protein is often undetectable in primary neuroblastoma tumors, suggesting a complex role in this cancer type (Gebauer2004Expression).

ID2 also plays a role in prostate cancer, particularly in castration-resistant neuroendocrine prostate cancer, where its expression is elevated. It is involved in activating pathways that promote lineage plasticity, contributing to the progression of androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer (Zhang2023ID2).

In glioblastoma, ID2 is associated with maintaining cancer stem cell properties and is linked to poor patient outcomes (Lee2016An). Its interactions with the retinoblastoma protein (RB) are significant in tumorigenesis, particularly in the context of RB loss, which is common in various cancers (Perk2005Id).

## Interactions
The ID2 protein, a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family, is known for its interactions with various proteins, influencing cell cycle regulation and differentiation. ID2 specifically binds to the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and its related proteins, p107 and p130. This interaction is facilitated by the HLH domain of ID2, which binds to the pocket domain of pRb, a region that shows extensive homology with p107 and p130. This binding allows ID2 to inactivate these proteins, which are known to suppress cell cycle progression (Iavarone1994The; Lasorella1996Id2).

ID2 also interacts with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, such as E2-2, in the human placenta. This interaction modulates transcriptional activity, as demonstrated by luciferase reporter assays and yeast two-hybrid assays (Liu2004Id2). Additionally, ID2 can bind to TCF ETS-domain transcription factors, including Elk-1 and SAP-1, inhibiting their DNA-binding activity and affecting nucleoprotein complex formation (Yates1999Id). These interactions highlight ID2's role in modulating transcription factor activity and cell cycle regulation.
