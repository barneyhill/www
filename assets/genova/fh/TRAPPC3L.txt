# TRAPPC3L

## Overview
TRAPPC3L is a gene that encodes the protein trafficking protein particle complex subunit 3L, which is a component of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complex. This protein is integral to the vesicle-mediated transport system within cells, facilitating the movement of proteins and lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. As a part of the TRAPP complex, TRAPPC3L plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring the proper functioning of organelles. The protein is particularly significant in the regulation of the secretory pathway, which is essential for protein synthesis, modification, and secretion. This function is vital for cellular processes and is especially important in tissues with high demands for protein turnover or secretion, such as muscle and liver tissues (Popescu2023NMN; Popescu2024Nicotinamide).

## Structure


## Function
TRAPPC3L is a subunit of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complex, which plays a critical role in vesicle-mediated transport within cells. This protein is involved in the trafficking of proteins and lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organelle function (Popescu2023NMN; Popescu2024Nicotinamide). In healthy cells, TRAPPC3L is implicated in the regulation of protein transport, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, modification, and secretion.

The TRAPP complex, including TRAPPC3L, is vital for the proper functioning of the secretory pathway, ensuring that proteins are correctly processed and delivered to their intended destinations within the cell. This process is fundamental for the maintenance of cellular structure and function, as well as for the response to cellular stress and signaling events. The involvement of TRAPPC3L in these pathways highlights its importance in cellular biology and its potential impact on organismal health, particularly in tissues with high protein turnover or secretion demands, such as muscle and liver tissues (Popescu2023NMN; Popescu2024Nicotinamide).
