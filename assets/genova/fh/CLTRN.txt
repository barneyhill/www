# CLTRN

## Overview
The CLTRN gene encodes the protein collectrin, an amino acid transport regulator that plays a pivotal role in the trafficking and activation of amino acid transporters, particularly in the kidney and pancreas. Collectrin is a transmembrane protein that is essential for the proper functioning of neutral amino acid transporters such as B0AT1 and B0AT3, facilitating their surface expression and stability. Beyond its role in amino acid transport, collectrin is also implicated in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and sodium-induced hypertension, highlighting its involvement in broader physiological processes (Pillai2019Loss; Fairweather2015Molecular). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the intestine, further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular transport and regulatory mechanisms (Karunakaran2022Interactome). Deficiencies in collectrin can lead to clinical conditions characterized by aminoaciduria and neuropsychiatric phenotypes, emphasizing its critical function in human health (Pillai2019Loss).

## Function
The CLTRN gene encodes the protein collectrin, which plays a crucial role in the trafficking and activation of amino acid transporters in healthy human cells. Collectrin is primarily involved in the function of the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1, particularly in the kidney and pancreas. In the kidney, collectrin is essential for the surface expression and stability of B0AT1, as it requires heterodimerization with collectrin to function properly (Pillai2019Loss). In the intestine, similar functions are performed by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Pillai2019Loss).

Collectrin is also involved in the expression and function of another transporter, B0AT3, which is located in the kidney. Both B0AT1 and B0AT3 require collectrin or ACE2 for proper membrane trafficking and catalytic activation (Fairweather2015Molecular). Collectrin's role extends beyond amino acid transport, as it is also implicated in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and sodium-induced hypertension (Fairweather2015Molecular). The protein is highly conserved among species, and its deficiency can lead to severe aminoaciduria, affecting both neutral and charged amino acids, indicating its broader role in renal amino acid transport (Pillai2019Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the CLTRN gene, which encodes the protein collectrin, have been linked to several clinical conditions. Collectrin is crucial for the transportation and activation of amino acid transporters in the kidney and pancreas. Deficiencies in collectrin can lead to a condition that mimics Hartnup disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neutral aminoaciduria and behavioral problems. This condition arises from a loss of B0AT1 function, impairing the absorption of neutral amino acids. In humans, collectrin deficiency has been associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including autistic features, anxiety, depression, compulsions, and motor tics, as well as neutral aminoaciduria (Pillai2019Loss).

In a study, two patients with deletions in the CLTRN gene exhibited symptoms such as behavioral problems and aminoaciduria, leading to a clinical diagnosis of Hartnup disease. Genetic analysis revealed a hemizygous deletion in exon 3 of the CLTRN gene in one patient, suggesting a nonfunctional protein (Pillai2019Loss). Collectrin deficiency in mice also results in severe aminoaciduria, affecting both neutral and charged amino acids, due to its role in the function of other renal amino acid transporters (Malakauskas2007Aminoaciduria).

## Interactions
Collectrin (CLTRN) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in amino acid transport and cellular processes. In the kidney, collectrin interacts with the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1, facilitating its surface expression and stability. This interaction is essential for the proper functioning of amino acid transporters, as collectrin deficiency leads to aminoaciduria due to impaired transporter activity (Pillai2019Loss; Malakauskas2007Aminoaciduria).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, collectrin is part of a regulatory complex involving the proteins NRF1, RAN, and DLD. NRF1 acts as an upstream transcription factor, while RAN and DLD interact with NRF1 to regulate the expression of collectrin. This complex influences the ferroptosis pathway, enhancing the radiosensitivity of HCC cells (Yuan2020CLTRN).

Collectrin also associates with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the intestine, where it plays a role in amino acid absorption. This interaction highlights collectrin's involvement in broader physiological processes beyond the kidney (Karunakaran2022Interactome). These interactions underscore collectrin's multifaceted role in cellular transport and regulatory mechanisms.
