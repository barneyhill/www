# EPHX3

## Overview
The EPHX3 gene encodes the enzyme epoxide hydrolase 3, a member of the α/β hydrolase fold enzyme family, which is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of epoxygenated compounds to diols. This enzyme plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, particularly within the skin, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier (Edin2021Epoxide; Gautheron2020The). EPHX3 is a membrane-bound protein that exhibits high enzymatic activity towards fatty acid-derived epoxides, and its expression is noted in various tissues, including the skin, lung, and gastrointestinal tract, indicating its involvement in both detoxification processes and the metabolism of signaling molecules (Gautheron2020The; Decker2012EH3). The gene's expression levels have been linked to several clinical conditions, including cancer and skin disorders, underscoring its potential significance in disease prognosis and therapeutic targeting (Edin2021Epoxide; Decker2012EH3).

## Structure
The EPHX3 protein, encoded by the EPHX3 gene, is a member of the α/β hydrolase fold enzyme family, which is involved in the hydrolysis of epoxygenated compounds to diols (Edin2021Epoxide). The primary structure of EPHX3 consists of 360 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 40,909 Da and an isoelectric point of 7.7 (Decker2012EH3). The protein sequence includes a hydrophobic region between residues 22 to 44, likely serving as a membrane insertion signal, and arginine residues that may act as a stop transfer signal, suggesting a cytoplasmic orientation (Decker2012EH3).

The catalytic activity of EPHX3 involves specific residues, including D173, Y220, Y281, D307, and H337, with D173 acting as the catalytic nucleophile and H337-D307 forming a charge relay system (Decker2012EH3). The protein is membrane-bound and exhibits high enzymatic activity towards fatty acid-derived epoxides (Decker2012EH3). While the tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available context, the presence of the α/β hydrolase fold suggests a typical enzyme structure with a catalytic triad or dyad common to this family. There is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
EPHX3, or epoxide hydrolase 3, is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of epoxides, converting them into diols. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and detoxifying potentially harmful compounds. EPHX3 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the skin, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier (Edin2021Epoxide; Gautheron2020The).

In the skin, EPHX3 hydrolyzes linoleate epoxides, such as 9,10-epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acid (EpOME), and epoxyalcohols derived from the 12R-lipoxygenase pathway. This process is essential for converting these compounds into their corresponding diols and triols, which are integral to the structural integrity of the skin barrier (Edin2021Epoxide). EPHX3's activity is crucial for maintaining the water permeability barrier in the epidermis, as evidenced by increased trans-epidermal water loss in Ephx3-deficient mice (Edin2021Epoxide).

EPHX3 is also expressed in other tissues such as the lung and gastrointestinal tract, suggesting its involvement in the metabolism of signaling molecules rather than detoxification of xenobiotics (Gautheron2020The). Its role in these tissues may contribute to physiological processes involving fatty acid epoxides (Decker2012EH3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EPHX3 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. EPHX3 is downregulated in several tumors, including gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma, often due to hypermethylation in its promoter region. This downregulation may be significant because epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which EPHX3 metabolizes, have the potential to reactivate dormant tumors and promote metastasis due to their angiogenic properties (Decker2012EH3). High expression of EPHX3 is correlated with better survival rates in head and neck cancer patients, while reduced expression is linked to poor prognosis in prostate cancer (Edin2021Epoxide).

In the context of skin disorders, EPHX3 has been identified as a candidate disease gene for ichthyosis, a condition characterized by a defective skin barrier and hyper-proliferation of the epidermis (Edin2021Epoxide; Decker2012EH3). Disruption of the EPHX3 gene in mice leads to impaired skin barrier function, evidenced by increased trans-epidermal water loss and a reduction in covalently bound ceramides, suggesting a structural impairment in the skin's water barrier (Edin2021Epoxide). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of EPHX3 in skin health and cancer prognosis.
