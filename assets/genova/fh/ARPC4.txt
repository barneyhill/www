# ARPC4

## Overview
The ARPC4 gene encodes the actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4, a critical component of the Arp2/3 complex, which is integral to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is categorized as a structural protein within the complex, contributing to the nucleation and branching of actin filaments, essential for various cellular processes such as motility, endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking (Goley2006The; Goley2010An). ARPC4, in conjunction with ARPC2, forms a heterodimer that is pivotal for the interaction with filamentous actin (F-actin), facilitating the formation of branched actin networks (Rouiller2008The). The protein's structural and functional roles underscore its importance in maintaining cellular architecture and dynamics, with implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including skin disorders and intellectual developmental conditions (AbarcaBarriga2022Intellectual; van2017Knockout).

## Structure
The ARPC4 protein, also known as actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4, is a component of the Arp2/3 complex, which plays a crucial role in actin polymerization. Structurally, ARPC4 forms a dimer with ARPC2 (p34) at the core of the Arp2/3 complex. The NH2-terminal region of ARPC4 features an α/β domain, beginning with a four-turn helix followed by an antiparallel β sheet composed of five strands. An α helix is inserted between strands 3 and 4, and the structure is completed by a short helix (Robinson2001Crystal).

The COOH-terminal region of ARPC4 consists of long helices (38 residues) that associate with those of ARPC2 in an antiparallel manner, with a crossing angle of about -20°. These helices are loosely packed, with the interface formed by hydrophobic residues and two salt bridges, although they do not follow a regular heptad repeat or a knob-in-hole packing pattern (Robinson2001Crystal).

The Arp2/3 complex, including ARPC4, is described as a flat ellipsoid, with ARPC4 contributing to a C-shaped clamp that cradles the Arp subunits, indicating its significant role in the quaternary structure of the complex (Robinson2001Crystal). The context does not provide information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of ARPC4.

## Function
ARPC4 is a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, which is essential for actin filament nucleation and branching in cells. This complex plays a critical role in the formation of branched actin networks, which are vital for various cellular processes such as cell motility, endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking (Goley2006The; Goley2010An). ARPC4, along with ARPC2, forms a heterodimer that provides the main surface for interaction with the mother filament, anchoring Arp3, the first subunit of the daughter filament. This interaction is crucial for branch formation and the structural integrity of the Arp2/3 complex (Rouiller2008The).

The ARPC2-ARPC4 heterodimer is essential for high-affinity binding to filamentous actin (F-actin), which is necessary for actin nucleation and the stability of Y-branched networks (Goley2010An). The complex is inactive on its own and requires activation by nucleation-promoting factors and ATP, leading to the polymerization of actin filaments in a Y-branch orientation, which is particularly suited for generating motile force in structures like lamellipodia at the leading edge of motile cells (Goley2010An). ARPC4 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at sites of dynamic actin remodeling, contributing to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (Goley2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARPC4 gene, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, have been linked to several clinical conditions. In mice, the knockout of ARPC4 in the epidermis results in a psoriasis-like disease characterized by skin abnormalities such as uneven thickening, alopecia, and psoriasis-like plaques. This condition is marked by hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, acanthosis, and inflammatory infiltrations in the dermis. The knockout leads to a significant decrease in the expression of the Arp2/3 complex, which is essential for its stability, and perturbs the differentiation program of keratinocytes, resulting in increased cell proliferation (van2017Knockout). 

In humans, ARPC4 expression is downregulated in psoriatic skin, particularly in the basal proliferative layer, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. This downregulation is also observed in an imiquimod-induced psoriasiform mouse model, which mimics human psoriatic lesions. The Arp2/3 complex, including ARPC4, is thought to regulate the transcription factor Nrf2 through actin filament formation, potentially linking reduced F-actin levels to increased Nrf2 activity during keratinocyte differentiation (van2017Knockout).

Additionally, ARPC4 is part of a copy number variation (CNV) associated with intellectual developmental disorder, dysmorphic facies, and ptosis in a Peruvian patient. This CNV involves a 90 kb deletion affecting several genes, including ARPC4, and highlights its potential role in cellular processes like proliferation and migration (AbarcaBarriga2022Intellectual).

## Interactions
ARPC4, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, plays a crucial role in actin filament nucleation and branching. It interacts with other subunits of the Arp2/3 complex, including ARPC1B, ARPC2, ARPC3, ARPC5, ACTR3, and ACTR2, forming a seven-subunit complex essential for cellular processes such as motility and division (Häupl2016Protein). The interaction between ARPC4 and F-actin is critical for the nucleation and stability of Y-branched actin networks. Protein-protein docking simulations have identified specific residues on ARPC4 that are within 5 Å of F-actin, highlighting the importance of these interactions for the complex's activity (Goley2010An).

Mutations in ARPC4 can significantly affect its interaction with F-actin, leading to reduced actin nucleation and branch stability. These mutations demonstrate the critical role of ARPC4 in maintaining high-affinity binding to F-actin and efficient actin polymerization (Goley2010An). Additionally, ARPC4 interacts with the protein kinase D2 (PKD2), suggesting a role in transport processes at the trans-Golgi network (Häupl2016Protein). The phosphorylation of ARPC4, particularly at arginine residues R105 and R106, can mimic the effects of phosphorylation on the Arp2 subunit, leading to conformational changes that facilitate activation of the Arp2/3 complex (Narayanan2011Phosphorylation).
