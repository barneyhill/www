# APEH

## Overview
The APEH gene encodes the enzyme acylaminoacyl-peptide hydrolase, a serine hydrolase that plays a pivotal role in protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. This enzyme is involved in the removal of Nα-acetylated amino acids from peptides, a process crucial for regulating protein stability and function. Structurally, APEH is characterized by a catalytic domain with a Ser-His-Asp triad, and it functions as a homotetramer, enhancing its stability and substrate specificity (Tyler2021Acyl; KissSzemán2022CryoEM). APEH is implicated in various cellular processes, including the degradation of oxidized proteins, regulation of proteasome activity, and endocytic recycling of receptors (Palmieri2011Acylpeptide; Fujino2000Identification; Tan2019Acylpeptide). Clinically, alterations in the APEH gene have been linked to cancer and responses to oxidative stress, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing disease (Brzozowska2018Polymorphism; Zeng2017Acylpeptide).

## Structure
The acylaminoacyl-peptide hydrolase (APEH) enzyme is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary elements. The primary structure of APEH is encoded by the APEH gene, consisting of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the enzyme's stability and function (Tyler2021Acyl).

APEH's tertiary structure includes a catalytic domain typical of serine hydrolases, with a Ser-His-Asp triad crucial for its enzymatic activity (Tyler2021Acyl). This domain is part of a larger structure that includes a hydrolase domain and a propeller domain, the latter composed of multiple blades formed by antiparallel beta-strands (KissSzemán2022CryoEM). The enzyme functions as a homotetramer, indicating a quaternary structure that enhances its stability and substrate specificity (KissSzemán2022CryoEM).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate APEH's activity and interactions (KissSzemán2022CryoEM). The enzyme also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which can influence its functional properties and interactions within cellular environments. These structural features enable APEH to play a significant role in protein degradation and cellular processes.

## Function
Acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein quality control and cellular homeostasis. It catalyzes the removal of Nα-acetylated amino acids from peptides, a post-translational modification that influences protein stability, enzymatic activity, and protein-protein interactions (Tan2019Acylpeptide). APEH is involved in the degradation of oxidized and glycated proteins, functioning as a secondary antioxidant defense system by preventing the accumulation of damaged proteins (Fujino2000Identification). 

APEH also regulates proteasome activity, which is essential for protein turnover and the elimination of misfolded proteins. It acts as a negative effector of proteasome activity, and its inhibition can impair proteasome function, suggesting that APEH modulates proteasome activity by affecting the N-terminal acetylation of proteins (Palmieri2011Acylpeptide). 

In addition to its role in protein degradation, APEH is involved in the endocytic recycling of receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and transferrin receptor (TfR), which is important for maintaining KRAS localization on the plasma membrane (Tan2019Acylpeptide). APEH's activities are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oxidative stress and damage to cellular components (Tan2019Acylpeptide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the APEH gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the regulatory region of the APEH gene, particularly the CC genotype, has been linked to a reduced risk of severe radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis (OM) but also to lower overall survival rates. This suggests that the CC genotype may confer increased radiation resistance, potentially through enhanced DNA repair mechanisms (Brzozowska2018Polymorphism). 

APEH is also implicated in the cellular response to oxidative stress. Depletion of APEH in human cells increases sensitivity to oxidative damage, indicating its role in protecting against oxidative stress-induced DNA damage. This function is partly mediated through its interaction with the DNA repair protein XRCC1, which is involved in single-strand break repair (Zeng2017Acylpeptide). 

Additionally, APEH deletion has been associated with renal carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma, suggesting a potential role in cancer development (Zeng2017Acylpeptide). The enzyme's involvement in protein degradation and cellular homeostasis further underscores its significance in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing disease.

## Interactions
Acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH) interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in response to DNA damage and protein localization. APEH has been identified as a protein that interacts with the DNA strand break repair protein XRCC1. This interaction is specific and occurs via the amino-terminal domain of XRCC1, which also binds DNA polymerase β. The interaction is crucial for APEH's role in promoting cellular resistance to oxidative stress and accelerating single-strand break repair (Zeng2017Acylpeptide).

APEH is also involved in the regulation of KRAS plasma membrane localization and function. Knockdown or inhibition of APEH disrupts KRAS nanocluster formation, essential for downstream MAPK signaling. This mislocalization can be rescued by ectopic expression of APEH, indicating a regulatory role in KRAS PM localization (Tan2019Acylpeptide).

APEH's interaction with the proteasome is suggested to be indirect, as APEH inhibition leads to reduced proteasome activity without direct physical interaction. This regulatory role is thought to occur downstream of APEH inhibition, affecting protein turnover and potentially influencing apoptosis in cancer cells (Palmieri2011Acylpeptide).
