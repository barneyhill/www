# AMTN

## Overview
The AMTN gene encodes the protein amelotin, which is a secreted protein primarily involved in the mineralization of dental enamel. Amelotin is categorized as an intrinsically disordered protein, which allows it to form flexible linkers and interact with other proteins to facilitate enamel formation and mineralization. The protein is expressed in maturation-stage ameloblasts and the gingival junctional epithelium, playing a crucial role in hydroxyapatite crystal nucleation and growth, essential for enamel hardness and structure. Amelotin's interactions with other proteins, such as odontogenic ameloblast-associated protein (ODAM), are vital for the structural organization of the enamel matrix. Mutations in the AMTN gene have been linked to nonsyndromic amelogenesis imperfecta, highlighting its significance in dental health (Holcroft2011Identification; Smith2016Deletion; Ikeda2022Amelotin).

## Structure
The AMTN protein is characterized by a unique primary structure, consisting of 209 amino acids, with a significant enrichment in proline, leucine, glutamine, and threonine, which together make up 52% of its composition (Moffatt2006Cloning; Smith2016Deletion). The protein includes a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide, which is essential for its secretion (Smith2016Deletion). 

AMTN undergoes several post-translational modifications, notably O-glycosylation, with up to ten O-linked sugar moieties, primarily due to threonine residues clustered in the C-terminal half of the protein (Moffatt2006Cloning). It also contains a conserved CK2 phosphorylation site, SSEEL, which may have functional implications in inhibiting crystal growth (Moffatt2006Cloning; Yu2018A).

The protein has two splice variants, which encode truncated forms lacking the CK2 domain, potentially leading to functional differences among isoforms (Moffatt2006Cloning). The AMTN protein is secreted and forms aggregates or binds to enamel crystals, which may protect it from proteolytic cleavage (SomogyiGanss2011Comparative). The protein's migration pattern on SDS/PAGE suggests significant post-translational modifications, indicating a higher apparent molecular mass than predicted (Moffatt2006Cloning). Information on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures is not detailed in the available sources.

## Function
Amelotin (AMTN) is a protein primarily involved in the mineralization of dental enamel. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of hydroxyapatite crystal nucleation and growth, which is essential for enamel mineralization. In healthy human cells, AMTN is expressed in maturation-stage ameloblasts, where it contributes to the formation and localization on the enamel surface at the cell-mineral interface during the maturation stage (Moffatt2006Cloning; Ikeda2022Amelotin). AMTN binds to hydroxyapatite, promoting its mineralization, which is vital for proper enamel hardness and structure (Ikeda2022Amelotin).

AMTN is also expressed in the gingival junctional epithelium, where it is involved in wound healing processes at the JE-tooth interface (Ikeda2022Amelotin). The protein is localized to the basal lamina of maturation-stage ameloblasts and junctional epithelium, indicating a role in tooth development and possibly biomineralization (Moffatt2006Cloning). AMTN's ability to promote mineralization and adhesion in collagen-based systems suggests its potential application in biomaterials aimed at attaching to mineralized tissues (Ikeda2022Amelotin). Mutations in the AMTN gene have been linked to nonsyndromic amelogenesis imperfecta, underscoring its importance in enamel mineralization (Ikeda2022Amelotin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AMTN gene, which encodes the protein amelotin, are associated with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a genetic condition characterized by defective enamel formation. A study identified a heterozygous deletion of exons 3-6 in the AMTN gene in a Costa Rican family, leading to an in-frame deletion of 92 amino acids. This mutation results in hypomineralized enamel with reduced mineral density and structural defects, marking the first confirmation that AMTN mutations can cause autosomal dominant hypomineralized AI in humans (Smith2016Deletion).

The deletion disrupts a conserved tripeptide motif and an O-glycosylation site, potentially affecting protein trafficking and function. This may lead to a toxic gain of function in humans due to the presence of a mutant protein, contrasting with mouse models where no protein is produced and no enamel defects are observed in heterozygous mice (Smith2016Deletion).

The AMTN gene is considered enamel-specific, and its mutations may have been overlooked in previous genetic studies due to biases against detecting large indels. The findings emphasize the importance of including copy number variant analysis in genetic studies of AI (Smith2016Deletion).

## Interactions
Amelotin (AMTN) is known to participate in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for enamel formation and mineralization. AMTN interacts with itself, forming aggregates with molecular masses of approximately 100 and 400 kDa, which are significantly larger than a single AMTN molecule (Holcroft2011Identification). It also interacts with odontogenic ameloblast-associated protein (ODAM), and this interaction has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Holcroft2011Identification; Fouillen2017Interactions). These interactions are conserved across species, as shown by studies on human and rat homologs (Fouillen2017Interactions).

AMTN, ODAM, and secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein proline-glutamine rich 1 (SCPPPQ1) co-localize within a specialized basal lamina that connects epithelial cells to tooth mineral. This co-localization suggests a coordinated role in the structural organization of the enamel matrix (Fouillen2017Interactions). AMTN and ODAM are intrinsically disordered proteins, which allows them to form flexible linkers and recruit partners to form multidomain complexes. When mixed, these proteins form larger aggregates and supramolecular structures, indicating strong interaction potential (Fouillen2017Interactions). These interactions are essential for the adhesion of epithelial cells to mineralized surfaces and may have implications for periodontal disease and epithelial cancers (Fouillen2017Interactions).
