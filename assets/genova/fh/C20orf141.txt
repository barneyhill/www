# C20orf141

## Overview
C20orf141 is a gene located on chromosome 20 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 20 open reading frame 141. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The protein is categorized as a non-kinase, non-receptor protein, suggesting it may play a role in intracellular signaling or structural functions within the cell. Research has indicated potential involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant for cellular growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further studies are required to understand the full spectrum of its interactions and clinical implications.
