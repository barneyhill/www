# RANBP10

## Overview
RANBP10 is a gene that encodes the RAN binding protein 10, a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. As a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase RAN, RANBP10 plays a pivotal role in the transport of proteins and RNA across the nuclear envelope, as well as in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and mitotic spindle organization, which are essential for cell division (Hou2021RANBP10; Lai2021A). The protein is characterized by several conserved domains, including PRY, SPRY, LisH, CTLH, and CRA, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its involvement in complex cellular mechanisms (Salemi2017Cell; Palmieri2018Scorpins). RANBP10 is also known to act as a co-activator for the androgen receptor, influencing transcriptional regulation, and is implicated in the nuclear import of viral DNA during mitosis (Hou2021RANBP10; Lai2021A). Its diverse roles in cellular homeostasis and disease, particularly in cancer progression and potential involvement in neurodegenerative disorders, underscore its clinical significance (Hou2021RANBP10; Megat2021Loss).

## Structure
RANBP10 (RAN binding protein 10) is characterized by several conserved domains, including PRY, SPRY, LisH, CTLH, and CRA, which are shared with its paralog RANBP9. The PRY and SPRY domains are highly conserved, with 94% and 97% amino acid similarity to RANBP9, respectively, and are involved in protein-protein interactions (Palmieri2018Scorpins). The LisH domain, which shows 82% conservation, is implicated in protein dimerization and oligomerization, while the CTLH domain, with 90% conservation, is part of a complex that may function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Salemi2017Cell; Palmieri2018Scorpins). The CRA domain, 89% conserved, is predicted to have a high propensity for Î±-helices (Salemi2017Cell).

RANBP10 is distinct from other RAN-binding proteins due to the presence of the PRY/SPRY domain, suggesting it belongs to a subgroup called Scorpins (Palmieri2018Scorpins). The protein also contains several putative PIK-kinase phosphorylation sites, indicating potential regulation through phosphorylation (Palmieri2018Scorpins). While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of these domains suggests a complex structure capable of multiple interactions. The protein's role in cellular processes is further diversified by potential splice variant isoforms, although specific variants are not detailed in the context provided.

## Function
RANBP10 (RAN binding protein 10) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAN, a small GTPase, which is crucial for the transport of proteins and RNA across the nuclear envelope (Hou2021RANBP10). RANBP10 is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and mitotic spindle organization, essential for cell division. It interacts with microtubules during interphase and is dispersed throughout the cytosol during mitosis, indicating its role in facilitating nuclear import and export processes (Lai2021A).

RANBP10 also acts as a co-activator for the androgen receptor, influencing transcriptional regulation (Hou2021RANBP10). It is part of a multi-subunit complex that includes karyopherin alpha2 (KPNA2) and dynein light chain DYNLT3, which facilitates the nuclear import of viral DNA during mitosis, highlighting its role in intracellular transport mechanisms (Lai2021A). Although its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, RANBP10's involvement in these processes suggests it plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Lai2021A).

## Clinical Significance
RANBP10 is implicated in the progression of glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Overexpression of RANBP10 in GBM is associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival rates in patients. The gene promotes tumor progression by stabilizing the c-Myc protein, a known oncogene, through the suppression of FBXW7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for c-Myc degradation. This stabilization enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to the aggressive nature of GBM (Hou2021RANBP10).

RANBP10 is also linked to other cancer types, including gastric, kidney, and prostate cancers, where its overexpression correlates with poor survival outcomes. In prostate cancer, RANBP10 activates the androgen receptor, further promoting cancer progression (Hou2021RANBP10).

In addition to its role in cancer, RANBP10 has been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A study identified a novel association between RANBP10 and ALS, suggesting that alterations in its expression may contribute to the disease's pathogenesis (Megat2021Loss).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of RANBP10 in various diseases, particularly its role in cancer progression and potential involvement in neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
RANBP10 is known to participate in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the L2 protein of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16), facilitating the nuclear import of viral DNA during mitosis. This interaction is more pronounced in cells arrested in mitosis compared to interphase, suggesting a role in the transport of L2/vDNA to mitotic chromatin (Lai2021A). RANBP10 also forms a complex with karyopherin 2 (KPNA2), which aids in the nuclear import of L2/vDNA. The depletion of RANBP10 reduces the interaction between L2 and KPNA2, indicating its importance in the formation of this complex (Lai2021A).

In the context of glioblastoma, RANBP10 interacts with the c-Myc protein, stabilizing it by reducing its ubiquitination. This stabilization is achieved through the suppression of FBXW7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for c-Myc ubiquitination (Hou2021RANBP10). RANBP10 also binds to the promoter region of FBXW7, inhibiting its transcription and further reducing c-Myc ubiquitination, which promotes tumor growth and colony formation in glioblastoma cells (Hou2021RANBP10).
