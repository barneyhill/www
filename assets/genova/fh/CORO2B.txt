# CORO2B

## Overview
CORO2B is a gene that encodes the protein coronin 2B, which is a member of the coronin family of proteins. Coronin 2B is primarily involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component for maintaining cell structure and facilitating various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its seven WD40 domains, which form a beta-propeller structure essential for protein-protein interactions, and a coiled-coil domain that aids in oligomerization and subcellular localization (Rogg2017The; Chen2020Coronin). Predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, coronin 2B plays a vital role in neuronal development by modulating actin dynamics at growth cones and influencing dendrite outgrowth (Chen2020Coronin). Additionally, it is involved in cellular stress responses and nucleolar function, interacting with various proteins to maintain nucleolar integrity and facilitate rDNA transcription (Chen2024Coronin). The dysregulation of CORO2B has been linked to pathological conditions, including kidney diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis (Rogg2017The; Chen2024Coronin).

## Structure
Coronin 2B, encoded by the CORO2B gene, is a protein that plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton organization. The molecular structure of coronin 2B includes several distinct domains that contribute to its function. At the N-terminus, the protein contains seven repeated WD40 domains, which are known to form a beta-propeller structure. This structure is crucial for protein-protein interactions and is a characteristic feature of the coronin family (Rogg2017The; Chen2020Coronin).

The C-terminal region of coronin 2B includes a unique region and a coiled-coil domain. The coiled-coil domain is essential for the protein's oligomerization, which is necessary for its role in inhibiting actin polymerization. This oligomerization is not mediated by F-actin, indicating a specific structural requirement for its function (Chen2020Coronin). The coiled-coil domain also plays a role in the subcellular localization of the protein, particularly confining it to neurite tips (Chen2020Coronin).

Coronin 2B is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and is enriched at the tips of growing neurites, where it partially colocalizes with F-actin at growth cones (Chen2020Coronin). The protein's interaction with actin and its structural domains are critical for its function in regulating actin dynamics and dendrite development.

## Function
CORO2B, or coronin 2B, is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell structure and function. In glomerular podocytes, CORO2B is specifically enriched and localizes to the ventral actin cytoskeleton, where it is involved in cell-matrix adhesion and stress response modulation. It influences cytoskeletal plasticity by recruiting cofilin 1 (CFL1) to focal adhesions, thereby affecting the composition of the focal adhesome and enhancing the dynamic spreading capacities of podocytes (Rogg2017The).

In the nervous system, CORO2B is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it regulates dendrite outgrowth by modulating actin dynamics. It is enriched at the tips of developing neurites and colocalizes with F-actin, particularly at the actin arc structure of growth cones, acting as a gatekeeper for actin dynamics and neurite outgrowth (Chen2020Coronin). CORO2B is also crucial for neuronal migration during cortical development, influencing the transition from multipolar to bipolar morphology in neurons, which is essential for proper migration. This process involves the regulation of F-actin and Rac1 at the leading processes of neurons (Chen2022Coronin).

## Clinical Significance
CORO2B (coronin 2B) has been implicated in various pathological conditions due to its role in cellular stress responses and cytoskeletal dynamics. In the context of kidney diseases, alterations in CORO2B expression or function may influence podocyte stress responses. Studies using CORO2B knockout mouse models have shown that the absence of this protein provides partial protection against proteinuria and glomerular damage in a Doxorubicin nephropathy model, suggesting that CORO2B may augment susceptibility to cellular stress in podocytes (Rogg2017The).

In neurons, CORO2B deficiency leads to nucleolar stress, which is associated with the activation of the p53 signaling pathway and neuronal apoptosis. This stress response is linked to impaired ribosomal DNA transcription and disrupted nucleolar integrity, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative diseases. The deficiency of CORO2B results in the stabilization and activation of p53, a key regulator of apoptosis, which may exacerbate neuronal degeneration (Chen2024Coronin). These findings suggest that CORO2B plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation could have significant implications for kidney and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
Coronin 2B (CORO2B) is a nucleolar protein that plays a significant role in neuronal cells by interacting with various proteins to regulate rDNA transcription and maintain nucleolar integrity. One of its primary interactions is with the upstream binding factor (UBF), a crucial component of the RNA polymerase I transcriptional machinery. This interaction is essential for the formation of the rDNA transcription pre-initiation complex, facilitating the recruitment of RNA polymerase I to the rDNA promoter (Chen2024Coronin). 

Coronin 2B acts as a molecular scaffold, using its seven repeated WD40 domains to mediate interactions with UBF, which is necessary for the docking and assembly of the transcriptional machinery (Chen2024Coronin). The protein can form oligomers through its coiled-coil domain, providing a platform for protein-protein interactions (Chen2024Coronin). 

In addition to its role in transcription, coronin 2B interacts with vinculin, a major component of focal contacts, supporting its localization at focal adhesions (Xavier2024Evolutionary). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of coronin 2B in cellular processes, particularly in maintaining nucleolar function and actin cytoskeleton dynamics.
