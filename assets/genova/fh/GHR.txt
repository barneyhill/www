# GHR

## Overview
The GHR gene encodes the growth hormone receptor, a transmembrane protein that is integral to the regulation of growth and metabolism in humans. As a member of the class 1 cytokine receptor family, the growth hormone receptor facilitates the physiological effects of growth hormone (GH) by initiating a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways upon GH binding. This receptor is primarily expressed in tissues such as the liver, muscle, and bone, where it plays a pivotal role in processes like protein synthesis, lipolysis, and bone growth. The receptor's activation involves conformational changes that enable the recruitment and activation of Janus kinases (JAK2), leading to the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), particularly STAT5, which then modulate gene expression. The GHR gene's function is tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis, and mutations in this gene can result in conditions such as Growth Hormone Insensitivity and Laron syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance (Storr2018Nonclassical; GuevaraAguirre2018GH).

## Structure
The growth hormone receptor (GHR) is a 638 amino acid protein encoded by the GHR gene. Its structure includes several key domains: an 18 amino acid signal sequence, a 246 residue extracellular domain (ECD), a 24 residue transmembrane domain (TMD), and a 350 residue intracellular domain (ICD) (Lin2018Growth). The ECD is responsible for growth hormone (GH) binding and receptor dimerization, containing two subdomains and five conserved glycosylation sites (Lin2018Growth). The ECD also features a WSXWS motif crucial for maintaining the receptor's spatial structure (Lin2018Growth).

The GHR forms a constitutive dimer, with its activation involving a realignment of the receptor subunits rather than dimerization upon hormone binding (Waters2016The). The receptor's cytoplasmic domain contains a proline-rich Box 1 motif necessary for binding Janus kinases, which phosphorylate tyrosine residues, facilitating signal transduction (Waters2016The). The GHR's tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, and its activation involves a rotation or plunger movement of the receptor domains (Waters2006New). The receptor also undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are essential for its function (Lin2018Growth).

## Function
The growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of growth hormone (GH) in healthy human cells. GHR is a class 1 cytokine receptor that, upon binding with GH, undergoes conformational changes to activate Janus kinases (JAK2). This activation leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), primarily STAT5, which then translocate to the nucleus to influence gene expression (GuevaraAguirre2018GH).

The primary signaling pathway activated by GHR is the JAK2/STAT5/IGF-I pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGFBP3, and the acid labile subunit (ALS). These components circulate as a complex, with IGF-I being liberated to bind with its receptor (IGF-IR), promoting growth and metabolism (GuevaraAguirre2018GH). GHR signaling also involves other pathways, such as MAPK and PI3K-AKT, which influence growth, metabolism, and other cellular functions (GuevaraAguirre2018GH).

In healthy individuals, GHR ensures balanced growth and metabolic activities. It is primarily active in liver, muscle, and bone cells, contributing to processes like protein synthesis, lipolysis, and bone growth (GuevaraAguirre2018GH). The signaling is tightly regulated by mechanisms such as suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) to prevent dysregulation that could lead to diseases like cancer and diabetes (GuevaraAguirre2018GH).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GHR gene can lead to several clinical conditions, most notably Growth Hormone Insensitivity (GHI) and Laron syndrome. GHI is characterized by severe short stature and low levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) despite normal or elevated growth hormone levels. This condition can result from various mutations in the GHR gene, including the intronic GHR pseudoexon mutation known as 6C, which causes aberrant splicing and the insertion of 36 new amino acids, impairing receptor function (Storr2018Nonclassical). Another mutation, a single amino acid substitution (D152H), disrupts receptor dimerization, essential for growth hormone signaling, leading to Laron syndrome, a form of familial growth hormone resistance (Duquesnoy1994A).

Heterozygous mutations in the GHR gene can also result in a range of phenotypic outcomes, from normal stature to severe growth failure, depending on the specific mutation and genetic background (Storr2018Nonclassical). Some mutations act in a dominant-negative fashion, inhibiting the function of the wild-type receptor. For instance, a heterozygous splice site mutation can lead to a truncated receptor that lacks critical intracellular domains, contributing to GH insensitivity syndrome (Iida1998Growth). These mutations highlight the complexity of GHR-related disorders and their impact on growth and development.

## Interactions
The growth hormone receptor (GHR) interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation. Upon growth hormone (GH) stimulation, GHR translocates to the nucleus in certain cell lines, where it interacts with the transcriptional regulator HMGN1. This interaction is associated with changes in the expression of HMGN1 gene targets, indicating a role in transcriptional regulation (Jain2023The). GHR also potentially interacts with SUMO1, although this interaction might be indirect (Jain2023The).

GHR is known to recruit STAT5a and STAT5b to specific tyrosine motifs, Y534, Y566, and Y627, which are crucial for their activation. SOCS2 and CIS also interact with GHR, primarily at Y487 and Y595, and are involved in regulating STAT5 signaling (Uyttendaele2007Mammalian). The interaction with CoAA, a coactivator activator, is GH-dependent and promotes cell proliferation, suggesting a role in transcriptional activation (ConwayCampbell2008The).

GHR's interactions extend to proteins involved in ubiquitination, cytoskeletal regulation, and membrane trafficking, highlighting its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Jain2023The). These interactions underscore GHR's complex network and its multifaceted role in cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation.
