# PKN2

## Overview
Protein kinase N2 (PKN2) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which is a member of the PKN/PRK family. This family includes three isoforms: PKN1, PKN2, and PKN3, each playing distinct roles in cellular signaling pathways. The protein kinase N2 encoded by PKN2 is involved in various cellular processes, including glucose and lipid metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and actin cytoskeletal organization. It functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions with other proteins such as Cdo and APPL1, which are crucial for AKT activation and myoblast differentiation (Lee2016PKN2). PKN2 is also implicated in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and vascular tone regulation, highlighting its role in cardiovascular health (Jin2021Protein). Clinically, alterations in PKN2 expression or function are associated with developmental disorders, cardiovascular abnormalities, and cancer, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Cheng2018PKN2; Marshall2022PKN2).

## Structure
Protein kinase N2 (PKN2) is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the PKN/PRK family, which includes three isoforms: PKN1, PKN2, and PKN3. The molecular structure of PKN2 includes three tandem HR1 domains at the N-terminal region, a calcium-binding C2-like domain, and a C-terminal PKC-like serine/threonine kinase domain (Lee2016PKN2). The C-terminal region of PKN2, specifically amino acids 839-984, is crucial for its interaction with other proteins such as Cdo and APPL1, which are involved in AKT activation and myoblast differentiation (Lee2016PKN2). This region contains a domain responsible for AKT interaction, particularly between amino acids 862-900 (Lee2016PKN2).

PKN2 functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions with Cdo and APPL1, which are essential for AKT activation during myoblast differentiation (Lee2016PKN2). The N-terminal region interacts with Rho or Rac GTPases, regulating cell migration, although it is not involved in Cdo-mediated AKT activation (Lee2016PKN2). PKN2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which is common among protein kinases, and may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing (Cheng2018PKN2).

## Function
Protein Kinase N2 (PKN2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle cells. It is involved in insulin signaling, where its knockdown decreases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen incorporation, while increasing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. This results in enhanced fatty acid oxidation and altered lipid metabolism, with increased expression of genes involved in lipid handling and synthesis (Ruby2017Protein).

PKN2 also plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in mitosis and cytokinesis. It is essential for the activation of Cdc25B, which is necessary for entry into mitosis, and for the abscission process during cytokinesis. PKN2 localizes to the cleavage furrow and midbody, and its depletion leads to defects in cell abscission, resulting in binucleated cells. This indicates its critical role in ensuring proper cell division (Schmidt2007Rho).

In addition, PKN2 is involved in actin cytoskeletal organization, acting as a potential effector target of Rho and Rac GTPases. It regulates actin filament dynamics, influencing cell shape and motility (Vincent1997The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PKN2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiovascular and developmental disorders. PKN2 is essential for proper embryonic development, and its knockout in mice results in severe cardiovascular and morphogenetic abnormalities, including growth defects, lack of axial turning, and cardiovascular issues such as collapsed dorsal aorta and underdeveloped heart, leading to embryonic lethality (Quétier2016Knockout). In cardiac development, PKN2 deficiency is linked to congenital cardiomyopathy and defective responses to angiotensin II stress, resulting in various cardiac defects such as ventricular septal defects and thin myocardium, which are observed in embryonic stages and lead to high perinatal lethality (Marshall2022PKN2).

In adult hearts, PKN2 plays a role in adapting to pressure overload, such as that caused by hypertension. PKN2 haploinsufficiency in mice reduces cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in response to angiotensin II-induced hypertension, suggesting its involvement in managing cardiac stress responses (Marshall2022PKN2). Additionally, PKN2 is implicated in colon cancer, where low expression is associated with advanced disease and poor prognosis. It acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting M2-like polarization of tumor-associated macrophages, which are linked to tumor growth and invasion (Cheng2018PKN2).

## Interactions
Protein kinase N2 (PKN2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. PKN2 interacts with the cell surface protein Cdo through its C-terminal region, which is essential for myoblast differentiation. This interaction facilitates the formation of complexes with APPL1 and AKT proteins, enhancing AKT activation, a key signaling pathway in myogenesis (Lee2016PKN2). The C-terminal region of PKN2, specifically amino acids 839-984, is responsible for its interaction with Cdo, while the region between amino acids 839 to 900 mediates a strong interaction with APPL1 (Lee2016PKN2).

PKN2 also plays a role in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and vascular tone regulation. It mediates the phosphorylation of AKT at threonine 308, which is crucial for the AKT-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS at serine 1177, a process important for nitric oxide production in endothelial cells (Fulton2021Protein; Jin2021Protein). PKN2 interacts with Piezo1, Gq/G11, and PDK1, and can be phosphorylated by PDK1, promoting its activation (Jin2021Protein). These interactions highlight PKN2's role as a scaffold protein, integrating various signaling pathways to regulate cellular functions.
