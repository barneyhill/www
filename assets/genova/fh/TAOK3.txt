# TAOK3

## Overview
TAOK3, or TAO kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the immune system. The protein product, TAO kinase 3, plays a pivotal role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling by modulating key interactions that influence T cell activation and proliferation. It is also involved in the regulation of interleukin-2 production, which is crucial for T cell function, and plays a role in bone health by activating pathways that contribute to osteoblast differentiation and skeletal mineralization. TAOK3 is expressed in multiple tissues, including immune organs, highlighting its significance in immune function and cellular signaling pathways (Poirier2024The; Fang2020The; Li2020TAOK3). Additionally, TAOK3 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, and is a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Fang2020The; Hu2021Clinical).

## Function
TAOK3 (TAO kinase 3) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling by modulating the interaction between the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and the kinase LCK, which is crucial for T cell activation. TAOK3 phosphorylates SHP-1, promoting its ubiquitylation and degradation, thereby enhancing TCR signaling and influencing T cell proliferation and differentiation (Poirier2024The). This kinase is also involved in the regulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, which is essential for T cell function (Poirier2024The).

In the context of bone health, TAOK3 acts as an upstream activator of the JNK pathway in osteoblasts, contributing to osteoblast differentiation and skeletal mineralization. Its deficiency can lead to impaired mineralization and osteopenia (Li2020TAOK3). TAOK3 is also implicated in the development of marginal zone B cells in the spleen, where it influences the expression of ADAM10, a metalloproteinase necessary for B cell fate determination (Hammad2017Transitional).

TAOK3 is expressed in various tissues, including immune organs like the spleen and thymus, indicating its role in immune function and cellular signaling pathways (Fang2020The).

## Clinical Significance
TAOK3 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In cancer, high TAOK3 expression is associated with poor recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy, as it enhances resistance to microtubule-targeted drugs via the NF-κB signaling pathway (Fang2020The; Lai2020Kinase). In colorectal cancer, TAOK3 is downregulated in adenocarcinoma, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Fang2020The). 

TAOK3 is also linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations in TAOK3 have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia, with studies identifying de novo mutations in autistic children and a microdeletion in a schizophrenia patient (Hu2021Clinical). 

In the context of inflammation, TAOK3 plays a role in age-related inflammation, known as inflammaging. Its deficiency leads to severe inflammatory disorders, particularly in females, and is associated with autoimmune conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (Poirier2023TAOK3). 

TAOK3's involvement in drug resistance extends to melanoma, where it contributes to resistance against BRAF inhibitors (Fang2020The). The development of TAOK-specific inhibitors is being explored as a potential therapeutic strategy for these conditions (Fang2020The).

## Interactions
TAOK3, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It interacts directly with the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, phosphorylating it at Thr 394, which promotes SHP-1's ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. This interaction is essential for modulating SHP-1 abundance and ensuring effective TCR signaling (Poirier2024The). TAOK3 also interacts with the kinase LCK, limiting SHP-1's interaction with LCK and thus preventing premature inactivation of LCK during TCR signaling (Ormonde2019TAOK3).

TAOK3's role extends to forming complexes with ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as RAD18, which facilitate the degradation of SHP-1 through polyubiquitination (Poirier2024The). The interaction between TAOK3 and SHP-1 is enhanced by the presence of the constitutively active SRC Y527F kinase, which increases SHP-1 phosphorylation at Tyr 536, promoting protein-protein interactions (Poirier2024The).

In addition to protein interactions, TAOK3 is involved in the regulation of nucleic acids. It has been identified as an antiviral protein with specificity to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), indicating its role in innate immune responses (Pennemann2021Crossspecies). These interactions highlight TAOK3's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and immune regulation.
