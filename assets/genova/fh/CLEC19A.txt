# CLEC19A

## Overview
CLEC19A is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain containing 19A, which is characterized by its C-type lectin domain. This protein is involved in immune system functions and is categorized as an extracellular matrix-affiliated protein, suggesting roles in both structural integrity and immune response (Nauroy2018The). In various species, including humans, Atlantic salmon, and zebrafish, CLEC19A has been linked to immune-related processes and conditions. In humans, it is notably expressed in brain tissue and may be associated with neuropsychiatric conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Farhangdoost2024Transcriptomic). In Atlantic salmon, the gene is associated with resistance to viral infections, highlighting its potential in breeding strategies for disease resistance (Aslam2020Quantitative). The gene's involvement in immune regulation underscores its significance in health and disease across different organisms.

## Clinical Significance
CLEC19A, a gene encoding a protein with a C-type lectin domain, is implicated in various immune-related conditions. In Atlantic salmon, CLEC19A is associated with immune response and resistance to viral infections, particularly salmonid alphavirus, which affects pancreas disease resistance. Genetic variations in CLEC19A may influence the immune response, suggesting potential for breeding strategies to enhance disease resistance (Aslam2020Quantitative).

In humans, CLEC19A is highly expressed in brain tissue and is located near a locus associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), indicating a potential link to neuropsychiatric conditions (Farhangdoost2024Transcriptomic). The gene is also mentioned in the context of periodontal complex traits, which are associated with immune response and epithelial barrier function, although no direct link to specific diseases is established (Dalmády2019Periodontitis:).

In zebrafish, CLEC19A is identified as an extracellular matrix-affiliated protein gene, suggesting its involvement in structural and immune functions, although specific disease associations are not detailed (Nauroy2018The). These findings highlight the gene's role in immune regulation and its potential implications in various health conditions.
