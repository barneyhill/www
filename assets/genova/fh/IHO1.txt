# IHO1

## Overview
The IHO1 gene encodes the protein Interactor of HORMAD1 1, which is integral to the meiotic process, particularly in the formation and regulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and homologous recombination. This protein is categorized as a nuclear protein due to its active role within the nucleus of germ cells. IHO1 is essential for the proper assembly of DSB machinery on chromosome axes, facilitating the initiation of recombination and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. It interacts with HORMAD1, a key component of the meiotic chromosome axis, to promote the formation of recombination-promoting complexes. The protein's function is further modulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its interactions and recruitment to chromosome axes. The absence of IHO1 leads to defective synapsis and infertility, underscoring its critical role in maintaining genomic stability during meiosis (Stanzione2016Meiotic; Dereli2024Seeding).

## Function
The IHO1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in meiotic processes, particularly in the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and homologous recombination. IHO1 is essential for the proper assembly of DSB machinery on chromosome axes, which is crucial for initiating recombination and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis (Dereli2024Seeding). The protein interacts with HORMAD1, a key component of the meiotic chromosome axis, to facilitate the seeding of DSB-factor clusters. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal region of IHO1, which is necessary for its recruitment to chromosome axes and the formation of recombination-promoting complexes (Dereli2024Seeding).

IHO1 is active in the nucleus of germ cells, where it collaborates with other proteins such as REC114 and MEI4 to stabilize and form DSB-promoting recombinosomes (Stanzione2016Meiotic). The phosphorylation of specific serine residues in IHO1 enhances its interaction with HORMAD1, further promoting the formation of DSB machinery clusters (Dereli2024Seeding). The absence of IHO1 results in defective synapsis and infertility, highlighting its essential role in meiotic recombination and genomic stability (Stanzione2016Meiotic).

## Interactions
IHO1, also known as Interactor of HORMAD1 1, is a protein that plays a crucial role in meiotic processes through its interactions with several other proteins. A key interaction is with HORMAD1, a component of the meiotic chromosome axis. This interaction is facilitated by the C-terminal region of IHO1, particularly involving serine residues S569 and S570, which are critical for the formation of double-strand break (DSB) machinery on chromosome axes (Dereli2024Seeding). The phosphorylation of these serine residues, potentially by the DBF4-dependent kinase (DDK), enhances the interaction with HORMAD1 and promotes the recruitment of IHO1 to chromosome axes (Dereli2024Seeding).

IHO1 also interacts with other proteins involved in DSB formation, such as MEI4 and REC114, forming chromatin-bound complexes known as recombinosomes. These complexes are essential for the initiation of meiotic recombination and are stabilized by HORMAD1 (Stanzione2016Meiotic). Additionally, IHO1 can interact with ANKRD31, supporting the seeding and growth of DSB-factor clusters independently of HORMAD1 (Dereli2024Seeding). These interactions highlight IHO1's role in the assembly and function of the meiotic DSB machinery.
