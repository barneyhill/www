# MYL6

## Overview
MYL6 is a gene that encodes the myosin light chain 6, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the myosin II complex, which is essential for muscle contraction and various cellular processes. As an essential light chain (ELC), myosin light chain 6 is integral to the stability and function of myosin filaments, contributing to cellular integrity and motility. This protein is involved in the regulation of actin-myosin interactions, impacting critical cellular functions such as cytokinesis and cell motility, and is active in both muscle and non-muscle cells (Heissler2015Four; Park2011Myosin). MYL6 is also implicated in pathological conditions, such as sepsis-induced acute lung injury, where its expression levels and genetic variations can influence disease outcomes (Zhang2024Identification). Additionally, MYL6 interacts with other proteins, such as Myosin 5c, to facilitate cellular processes, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Kengyel2024Motor).

## Structure


## Function
MYL6 encodes an essential light chain (ELC) that is part of the myosin II complex, which plays a critical role in muscle contraction and cellular movement. In NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, MYL6 is associated with myosin heavy chains MYH9 (NMHC IIA) and MYH10 (NMHC IIB), as well as myosin regulatory light chains (RLCs) such as MYL12A, MYL12B, and MYL9 (Park2011Myosin). The presence of MYL6 within the myosin II complex is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and structure, as it contributes to the stability of the myosin filaments and prevents their abnormal aggregation (Park2011Myosin).

MYL6 is involved in the regulation of actin-myosin interactions, impacting processes like cytokinesis and cell motility. It is active in the cytoplasm of both muscle and non-muscle cells, where it contributes to cellular structure and function (Heissler2015Four). The depletion of MYL6, along with other components of the myosin II complex, leads to significant changes in cell morphology, such as disrupted actin stress fiber formation and increased cell size and protrusion length, although cell viability remains unaffected (Park2011Myosin).

## Clinical Significance
The MYL6 gene has been identified as a disulfidptosis-related gene involved in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Studies have shown that MYL6 expression levels are increased in sepsis-induced ALI models, both in vitro and in vivo. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs35436573, within the MYL6 gene, has been associated with the survival rate of sepsis patients. This suggests that genetic variations in MYL6 may influence individual responses to sepsis, potentially affecting the regulation of inflammatory responses or the tissue's ability to cope with infection. Alterations in MYL6 expression or function, possibly due to SNPs, could exacerbate inflammatory responses or lung injury, thereby reducing survival in sepsis (Zhang2024Identification).

While MYL6 is mentioned in the context of non-muscle myosin II-A (NMII-A) composition, its clinical significance in this regard is not detailed. The gene is noted for encoding essential light chains that bind to MHCII-A, but no specific diseases or conditions are directly linked to MYL6 mutations or interactions in the context of NMII-A (AsensioJuárez2020Linking).

## Interactions
MYL6 (myosin light chain 6) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in muscle contraction and cellular processes. It is a component of the myosin complex, interacting with myosin heavy chains to facilitate actin-myosin interactions in muscle fibers. MYL6 is also associated with the motor protein Myosin 5c (Myo5c), where it acts as an essential light chain (ELC). Myo5c, a member of the class V myosins, is involved in secretory processes and is expressed in epithelial and glandular tissues. MYL6 binds to Myo5c in a 1:1 ratio, and this interaction is crucial for the motor function of Myo5c, although phosphorylation by MLCK does not significantly affect this interaction (Kengyel2024Motor).

In the context of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), MYL6 is identified as an antigen of anti-NET antibodies (ANETA). The presence of anti-MYL6 antibodies disrupts the polymerization of G-actin into F-actin, which is necessary for neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. This disruption is thought to occur because the anti-MYL6 antibody interferes with the interaction between myosin and F-actin, thereby affecting actin dynamics essential for NET formation (Yoshinari2022Low).
