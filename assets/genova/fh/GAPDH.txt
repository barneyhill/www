# GAPDH

## Overview
GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is a gene that encodes the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a key player in glycolysis, the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, generating ATP in the process. This enzyme is classified as an oxidoreductase and is highly conserved across species, reflecting its fundamental role in cellular metabolism (Sirover1999New). Beyond its primary metabolic function, the GAPDH protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription regulation, and apoptosis, highlighting its multifunctional nature (Colell2009Novel; Cornett2022GAPDH). The protein's activity and localization are modulated by post-translational modifications, which enable its participation in diverse cellular pathways and stress responses (Kosova2017Role). Due to its involvement in critical cellular functions, alterations in GAPDH expression or activity are associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Hwang2015Impaired; Butera2019Regulation).

## Structure
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a 335 amino acid polypeptide that is highly conserved across species. The protein is composed of two major domains: the NAD+ binding domain, spanning amino acids 1-150, and the catalytic domain, covering amino acids 151-335. The NAD+ binding domain is characterized by a series of L sheets connected by K helices, forming a Rossmann fold, a common structural motif in nucleotide-binding enzymes (Sirover1999New; Kosova2017Role). The catalytic domain includes an active site cysteine and is involved in the enzyme's glycolytic function (Sirover2014Structural).

GAPDH typically exists as a tetramer, with each subunit weighing approximately 37 kDa, resulting in a total molecular weight of about 150 kDa (Kosova2017Role). The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, nitrosylation, and oxidation, which influence its activity and cellular localization (Kosova2017Role; Sirover2014Structural). These modifications are crucial for its diverse functions beyond glycolysis, including nuclear translocation and involvement in DNA repair (Kosova2017Role). Despite its multifunctionality, GAPDH is encoded by a single structural gene in somatic cells, with no alternate transcripts identified (Sirover2014Structural).

## Function
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a multifunctional enzyme primarily known for its role in glycolysis, where it catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, contributing to ATP production (Cornett2022GAPDH; Hildebrandt2015Cytosolic). Beyond its glycolytic function, GAPDH is involved in various cellular processes. It participates in endocytosis, nuclear membrane assembly, and membrane transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex (Colell2009Novel). GAPDH also interacts with microtubules, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cargo transport (Colell2009Novel).

In the nucleus, GAPDH is involved in DNA repair by binding to DNA and interacting with repair proteins such as APE1 and PARP1, which are essential for the base excision repair pathway (Cornett2022GAPDH). It also plays a role in transcription regulation as part of the OCA-S complex, which is crucial for S-phase-dependent histone-2B transcription (Colell2009Novel). GAPDH's activity and localization are influenced by posttranslational modifications, such as S-nitrosylation and phosphorylation, which can affect its participation in processes like cell death and stress responses (Colell2009Novel; Hildebrandt2015Cytosolic). These diverse functions underscore GAPDH's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulation.

## Clinical Significance
GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In cancer, GAPDH is often overexpressed, supporting the Warburg effect where cancer cells rely on glycolysis for energy production even in the presence of oxygen. This overexpression is linked to cancer cell proliferation and survival, making GAPDH a potential therapeutic target (Colell2009Novel; Butera2019Regulation). Inhibition of GAPDH with compounds like koningic acid has shown selective anti-tumor effects (Butera2019Regulation).

In neurodegenerative diseases, GAPDH is involved in apoptosis and cellular stress responses. In Huntington's disease, impaired GAPDH-induced mitophagy contributes to pathology, as mutant huntingtin protein inhibits GAPDH's role in mitochondrial degradation, leading to cell death (Hwang2015Impaired). GAPDH also interacts with proteins associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, contributing to the formation of protein aggregates and neuronal cell death (Colell2009Novel; Butera2019Regulation).

GAPDH's role in apoptosis is further highlighted by its interactions with apoptotic proteins and its involvement in oxidative stress-induced cell death, which is relevant in both cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Hara2006Nitric; Sirover2011On).

## Interactions
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing roles beyond its glycolytic function. GAPDH interacts with RNA polymerase II and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) at active transcription sites, forming part of the OCA-S complex that coactivates the transcription factor Oct 1 (Kosova2017Role). It also interacts with the oncogenic transcription factor hTAF II 68 TEC, stimulating its activity, and forms a complex with the androgen receptor that translocates to the nucleus (Kosova2017Role).

GAPDH binds to apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA, forming adducts that are influenced by oxidative stress, and interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), potentially leading to cell death through overactivation (Kosova2017Role). It also binds to telomeric DNA, protecting it from degradation, and inhibits telomerase activity, leading to telomere shortening (Kosova2017Role).

In viral interactions, GAPDH binds to the 3' ends of Japanese encephalitis virus RNA and colocalizes with the viral NS5 protein, affecting RNA stability and translation (Yang2009Glyceraldehyde3phosphate). It also interacts with the Dengue virus nonstructural 3 protein, reducing GAPDH's glycolytic activity and enhancing the ATPase activity of the viral protein (Silva2019Dengue).
