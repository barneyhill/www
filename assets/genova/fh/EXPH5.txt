# EXPH5

## Overview
The EXPH5 gene encodes the protein exophilin-5, also known as Slac2-b, which functions as a Rab27B GTPase effector involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking and cell adhesion processes. Exophilin-5 is categorized as a vesicle trafficking protein and plays a significant role in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, particularly in the movement of proteins such as Nox2, an NADPH oxidase, to the plasma membrane. This protein is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and modulating immune responses by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Mutations in the EXPH5 gene are linked to genetic disorders affecting skin integrity, such as epidermolysis bullosa simplex, and have been suggested to play a role in craniofacial development disorders like non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (Okunishi2020Exophilin5; Alade2024Rare; McGrath2012Germline).

## Function
The EXPH5 gene encodes the protein exophilin-5, also known as Slac2-b, which functions as a Rab27B GTPase effector involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking. In healthy human cells, exophilin-5 is implicated in protein-protein interactions, particularly through its Rab-binding N-terminal SHD domain, although it lacks other homology-predicted binding sites (McGrath2012Germline). Exophilin-5 localizes to intracellular vesicles and the periphery of spreading cells, where it colocalizes with Rab27B and b4 integrin, suggesting its involvement in early adhesion sites and cell adhesion processes (McGrath2012Germline).

Exophilin-5 is also involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking of PI4-kinase type 2a-containing late endosomes and exosome secretion in certain cell lines (Okunishi2020Exophilin5). It plays a role in the movement of Nox2, an NADPH oxidase, from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane upon stimulation, which is crucial for the release of extracellular superoxide and modulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Okunishi2020Exophilin5). This regulation helps prevent overactivation of Th2 cells in response to stimuli like IL-33, maintaining a balance in cytokine production and preventing excessive inflammation (Okunishi2020Exophilin5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXPH5 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, primarily affecting the skin. A notable condition linked to EXPH5 mutations is epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a group of heritable blistering diseases characterized by skin fragility. Specifically, mutations in EXPH5 have been implicated in autosomal recessive forms of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), where affected individuals exhibit symptoms such as generalized scale-crusts, trauma-induced blisters, and pigmentary mottling (McGrath2012Germline; Vahidnezhad2018Next). The EXPH5 gene encodes the Slac2-b protein, an effector of the Rab27B GTPase, which plays a crucial role in keratinocyte adhesion and cytoskeletal integrity. Mutations leading to a truncated Slac2-b protein result in disrupted keratinocyte adhesion and altered cell morphology, contributing to the skin fragility observed in these disorders (McGrath2012Germline).

In addition to its role in skin conditions, EXPH5 has been identified as a potential novel gene associated with non-syndromic orofacial clefts, specifically non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (NSCLP). Although direct associations with these phenotypes are not well-established, EXPH5 is implicated in processes crucial for craniofacial development, such as cell-cell adhesion (Alade2024Rare).

## Interactions
EXPH5, also known as exophilin-5, is involved in several protein interactions, primarily through its role as a Rab27 GTPase effector. It interacts with Rab27B, a GTPase, in keratinocytes, where it colocalizes at early adhesion sites, suggesting a role in keratinocyte adhesion and morphology (McGrath2012Germline). This interaction is crucial for maintaining keratinocyte integrity and adhesion, as evidenced by the disruption of the keratin filament network and altered cell adhesion when Slac2-b, the protein encoded by EXPH5, is knocked down (McGrath2012Germline).

In the context of allergic airway inflammation, EXPH5 interacts with Rab27a in T cells, forming a complex with NADPH oxidase (Nox2). This interaction is essential for the translocation of Nox2 to the plasma membrane, which regulates intracellular ROS production and extracellular superoxide release (Okunishi2020Exophilin5). The deficiency of exophilin-5 disrupts this process, leading to increased intracellular ROS and enhanced IL-33 sensitivity in Th2 cells (Okunishi2020Exophilin5). These interactions highlight the role of EXPH5 in vesicle trafficking and its potential impact on immune responses and skin integrity. Specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies.
