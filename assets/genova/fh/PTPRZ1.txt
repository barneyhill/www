# PTPRZ1

## Overview
PTPRZ1 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase. This protein is a type V transmembrane protein, primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays crucial roles in cell signaling, adhesion, and neural development. The protein's structure includes an extracellular region with a carbonic anhydrase-like domain and a fibronectin type III-like domain, and an intracellular region with two tyrosine phosphatase domains, of which only the membrane-proximal domain is catalytically active (Meng2000Pleiotrophin; Papadimitriou2023Protein). PTPRZ1 is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of signaling pathways that influence cell survival, differentiation, and migration (Papadimitriou2023Protein). It interacts with several proteins and pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT pathway, and is implicated in the regulation of ion channels and neural cell adhesion molecules (Papadimitriou2023Protein). Alterations in PTPRZ1 expression and function are associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xia2019The; Papadimitriou2023Protein).

## Structure
PTPRZ1, also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1, is a type V transmembrane protein characterized by a complex molecular structure. The extracellular region of PTPRZ1 includes a carbonic anhydrase-like domain and a fibronectin type III (FNIII)-like domain, followed by a Ser-Gly-rich region that facilitates glycosaminoglycan attachment, particularly in the PTPRZ-B isoform, which lacks exon 12 (Maeda1999A; Papadimitriou2023Protein). The intracellular region contains two tyrosine phosphatase (TP) domains, with the domain closer to the membrane (D1) being catalytically active, while the distal domain (D2) is inactive (Meng2000Pleiotrophin; Papadimitriou2023Protein).

PTPRZ1 exists in several splice variant isoforms, including PTPRZ-A, PTPRZ-B, and PTPRZ-S, which differ in their extracellular domain composition (Maeda1999A; Papadimitriou2023Protein). The protein undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation with chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, and human natural killer-1 carbohydrates, which are particularly prominent in the central nervous system and influence ligand binding (Nagai2022Protein; Papadimitriou2023Protein). These structural features enable PTPRZ1 to function as both a cell adhesion and signaling molecule, interacting with various ligands and proteins (Peles1995The; Nagai2022Protein).

## Function
Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 (PTPRZ1) is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it is involved in the survival and maturation of oligodendrocytes, which are essential for myelination and proper nervous system function (Papadimitriou2023Protein). PTPRZ1 modulates signaling pathways by dephosphorylating target proteins, influencing cell survival, differentiation, and migration (Papadimitriou2023Protein).

PTPRZ1 interacts with several proteins and pathways, including the PI3K-AKT pathway, enhancing cell survival by activating Akt and inhibiting apoptosis in human embryonic stem cells (Papadimitriou2023Protein). It also affects cell migration in endothelial cells through the activation of PI3K and other pathways. PTPRZ1 dephosphorylates voltage-gated sodium channels, impacting their function, and modulates the activity of receptors like anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and the neurotrophin receptor TrkA (Papadimitriou2023Protein).

PTPRZ1 interacts with neural cell adhesion molecules and integrins, playing roles in neural development and cell adhesion (Papadimitriou2023Protein). It is also involved in ion channel regulation and potentially in immune signaling, as suggested by its interaction with IL34 (Papadimitriou2023Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the PTPRZ1 gene are implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), PTPRZ1 is overexpressed and associated with tumor growth and invasion, particularly in glioblastoma stem cells, where it enhances cell migration and adhesion (Shi2017Tumour-associated; Papadimitriou2023Protein). The PTPRZ1-MET fusion is identified in certain gliomas and is linked to aggressive tumor phenotypes and resistance to temozolomide therapy (Xia2019The; Papadimitriou2023Protein).

In small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), PTPRZ1 is highly expressed and plays an oncogenic role by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation, which promotes tumor progression (Makinoshima2012PTPRZ1). In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative subtypes, PTPRZ1 overexpression is associated with recurrence and metastasis, negatively impacting patient survival (Xia2019The; Papadimitriou2023Protein).

PTPRZ1 also plays a role in prostate cancer, where decreased mRNA levels are linked to enhanced cell migration and metastasis (Papadimitriou2023Protein). In osteosarcoma, PTPRZ1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its deletion enhancing cancer development (Papadimitriou2023Protein). These findings highlight the gene's dual role as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
PTPRZ1, also known as receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta 1, engages in various interactions with proteins and ligands, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with neural cell adhesion molecules such as N-CAM and Ng-CAM, and with tenascin, mediated by asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in its carbonic anhydrase and FNIII-like domains (Papadimitriou2023Protein). Contactin, another neuronal cell adhesion protein, binds to PTPRZ1's carbonic anhydrase domain, potentially generating signals during neural development (Papadimitriou2023Protein). PTPRZ1 also associates with voltage-gated sodium channels in brain neurons, affecting sodium ion currents (Papadimitriou2023Protein).

PTPRZ1 interacts with pleiotrophin (PTN), which inhibits its phosphatase activity, leading to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, a key signaling molecule in development and oncogenic pathways (Meng2000Pleiotrophin). This interaction is significant as PTN is the first natural ligand identified for any receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, introducing a mechanism termed 'ligand-dependent receptor inactivation' (Meng2000Pleiotrophin). PTPRZ1 also interacts with integrins such as α4β1, α6β1, and ανβ3, with the interaction with ανβ3 being ligand-independent (Papadimitriou2023Protein). These interactions highlight PTPRZ1's role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling pathways, making it a potential target for cancer therapy and diagnosis.
