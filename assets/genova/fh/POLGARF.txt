# POLGARF

## Overview
POLGARF is a gene that encodes a protein through an alternative reading frame of the POLG mRNA, known as the POLG alternative reading frame protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular protein localization and extracellular signaling. POLGARF interacts with the mitochondrial protein C1QBP (P32), influencing its localization and function, which may impact mitochondrial translation and ribosome biogenesis (Loughran2020Unusually; Loughran2020Unprecedentedly). The protein localizes to nucleoli, particularly in regions of active ribosomal RNA production, and is associated with fibrillarin, a key nucleolar component (Loughran2020Unusually). Additionally, POLGARF is processed into a secreted fragment, POLGARFin, which is released in response to serum stimulation, indicating a role in extracellular signaling (Loughran2020Unusually; Loughran2020Unprecedentedly). These characteristics suggest that POLGARF plays a significant role in cellular dynamics, particularly in relation to nucleolar and mitochondrial functions.

## Function
The POLGARF protein, encoded by an overlapping reading frame in the POLG mRNA, plays a multifaceted role in cellular function. It is involved in intracellular protein localization and extracellular signaling. POLGARF interacts with the protein C1QBP (also known as P32), redirecting it from the mitochondria to the nucleoli, which may influence mitochondrial translation and ribosome biogenesis by preventing P32 maturation (Loughran2020Unusually; Loughran2020Unprecedentedly). POLGARF localizes to nucleoli, particularly in areas of active ribosomal RNA production, and colocalizes with fibrillarin, a major nucleolar component (Loughran2020Unusually).

POLGARF is also processed into a C-terminal fragment called POLGARFin, which is secreted from cells upon serum stimulation, suggesting a role in extracellular signaling. This secretion is rapid and does not require new protein synthesis, indicating that POLGARF is pre-processed for secretion (Loughran2020Unusually; Loughran2020Unprecedentedly). The secretion of POLGARFin is upregulated by serum addition, suggesting a regulatory mechanism in response to environmental changes (Loughran2020Unprecedentedly). These functions highlight POLGARF's potential impact on cellular processes related to nucleolar activity and mitochondrial functions.

## Interactions
The POLGARF protein interacts specifically with the protein C1QBP, also known as P32. This interaction was identified using GST-POLGARF fusion proteins in pull-down assays, which revealed P32 as a major interacting partner. P32 is primarily localized in the mitochondrial matrix and is involved in controlling the translation of mitochondrially encoded proteins. The interaction between POLGARF and P32 was confirmed using SNAP-tag pull-down assays, demonstrating that SNAP-POLGARF and SNAP-P32 fusion proteins efficiently pulled down P32 and POLGARF, respectively (Loughran2020Unusually; Loughran2020Unprecedentedly).

When overexpressed in HEK293T cells, POLGARF accumulates in the nucleoli, colocalizing with fibrillarin, a major nucleolar component, but not with SC35, a nuclear speckle marker. This nucleolar localization depends on amino acids within its N-terminal half. POLGARF's interaction with P32 prevents P32 maturation and redirects it from the mitochondria to the nucleoli, potentially affecting P32 functions (Loughran2020Unusually; Loughran2020Unprecedentedly). The interaction suggests a role for POLGARF in modulating P32 localization and processing, which may have implications for cellular functions (Loughran2020Unusually; Loughran2020Unprecedentedly).
