# GAGE13

## Overview
GAGE13 is a gene that encodes the G antigen 13 protein, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen (CTA) family. These proteins are typically expressed in the testis but are also found in various tumor types, making them of particular interest in cancer research and immunotherapy. The G antigen 13 protein is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but its expression is notably associated with tumorigenic processes. GAGE13 has been studied for its potential role in cancer prognosis and as a target for immunotherapeutic strategies due to its restricted expression in normal tissues and its immunogenic properties (Kalvapudi2024Cancertestis; Fratta2011The).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
GAGE13, a member of the GAGE gene family, is implicated in various cancers due to its aberrant expression patterns. In gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEAC), GAGE13 expression has been associated with improved survival outcomes in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, although this trend was not statistically significant, indicating a potential but unconfirmed clinical significance (Kalvapudi2024Cancertestis). In lung cancer, GAGE13 is part of a group of cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) that are predominantly expressed in testis tissue but also co-expressed in multiple tumor types. The Cancer Testis Antigen Burden (CTAB), which includes GAGE13, has been proposed as a novel biomarker for tumor-associated antigens, suggesting that it measures unique aspects of the tumor microenvironment not captured by other biomarkers like PD-L1 and tumor mutational burden (Seager2024Cancer).

In cutaneous angiosarcoma, GAGE13, along with other CTAs, is upregulated in recurrent lesions, although the specific role of GAGE13 in these lesions remains unclear (Magara2023Tumor). The expression of GAGE13 and other CTAs in various cancers highlights their potential as targets for cancer immunotherapy, given their restricted expression in normal tissues and strong immunogenicity (Fratta2011The).
