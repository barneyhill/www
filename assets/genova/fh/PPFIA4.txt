# PPFIA4

## Overview
PPFIA4 is a gene that encodes the protein liprin-alpha-4, a member of the liprin family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell-to-cell junctions and synapse maturation. Liprin-alpha-4 plays a crucial role in the disassembly of focal cell adhesion, facilitating cell-matrix interactions and maintaining cellular communication and structural integrity (Lee2017Korean). The protein is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, and is up-regulated under hypoxic conditions, indicating its involvement in cellular responses to low oxygen levels (Zhou2019Combined; Huang2021PPFIA4). PPFIA4 interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) and other liprin proteins, influencing cell adhesion, signaling pathways, and synaptic organization (Huang2021PPFIA4). The gene has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Sourbron2021PPFIA4; Zhao2022PPFIA4).

## Function
The PPFIA4 gene encodes the protein liprin-alpha-4, which is involved in cell-to-cell junctions and plays a significant role in synapse maturation and regulation. This protein is part of the liprin family, which is crucial for the disassembly of focal cell adhesion, facilitating cell-matrix interactions (Lee2017Korean). Liprin-alpha-4 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, although its specific functions in these tissues are not fully detailed (Zhou2019Combined; Huang2021PPFIA4).

In cellular processes, liprin-alpha-4 is known to be up-regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1a during hypoxic conditions, indicating its involvement in cellular responses to low oxygen levels (Lee2017Korean). The protein also interacts with several genes involved in excitatory neurotransmission, suggesting a role in neurological processes (Sourbron2021PPFIA4). Although primarily studied in the context of disease, such as its role in cancer progression, the protein's activity at cell junctions highlights its importance in maintaining cellular communication and structural integrity (Zhao2022PPFIA4).

## Clinical Significance
The PPFIA4 gene has been implicated in various diseases, primarily due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In colon cancer, PPFIA4 is identified as a glycolysis-related oncogene that promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration. Its overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes, advanced tumor stages, and increased lymph node metastasis. The gene enhances tumor glycolysis, contributing to cancer progression, and is linked to changes in epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) markers, which are involved in cancer metastasis (Huang2021PPFIA4).

In neurological disorders, a case study involving a 12-year-old boy with drug-resistant epilepsy identified a potential pathogenic variant in PPFIA4. Although the gene has not been previously associated with neurological conditions, its product interacts with genes involved in excitatory neurotransmission and epileptogenesis. The variant was classified as a variant of unknown significance (VUS) by InterVar but as pathogenic by MetaSVM, suggesting a possible oligogenic etiology for the patient's phenotype (Sourbron2021PPFIA4).

PPFIA4 has also been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the Japanese population. A specific SNP in PPFIA4, rs17461925, was significantly linked to AF susceptibility, indicating a potential role in cardiovascular diseases (Patel2023Genomic).

## Interactions
PPFIA4, also known as PTPRF interacting protein alpha 4, is part of the liprin family and is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF), playing a role in cell adhesion and communication. PPFIA4 is known to form complexes with LAR family phosphatases, which influence cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Huang2021PPFIA4).

In the context of colon cancer, PPFIA4 has been shown to interact with glycolysis-related genes, specifically PFKFB3 and ENO2. Overexpression of PPFIA4 leads to the upregulation of these genes, enhancing glycolysis and promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration. This interaction suggests that PPFIA4 may exert its oncogenic effects through the upregulation of PFKFB3/ENO2 signaling, contributing to tumor progression (Huang2021PPFIA4).

PPFIA4's role in synaptic organization and vesicle trafficking is also noted, as it interacts with other liprin proteins. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular signaling pathways and may influence processes such as migration and synaptic organization (Huang2021PPFIA4).
