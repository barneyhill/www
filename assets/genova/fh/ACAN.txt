# ACAN

## Overview
The ACAN gene encodes aggrecan, a critical proteoglycan in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, playing a pivotal role in maintaining cartilage structure and function. Aggrecan is characterized by its large size and complex structure, which includes multiple globular domains and glycosaminoglycan attachment regions. These structural features enable aggrecan to form large aggregates with hyaluronic acid and link protein, contributing to the viscoelastic properties of cartilage. As a proteoglycan, aggrecan is essential for the biomechanical properties of cartilage, allowing it to withstand compressive forces and facilitate joint movement. Mutations in the ACAN gene are linked to various skeletal disorders, including short stature and early-onset osteoarthritis, underscoring its importance in skeletal health (Gkourogianni2016Clinical; Aspberg2012The; Doege1991Complete).

## Structure
Aggrecan (ACAN) is a large proteoglycan with a complex molecular structure essential for cartilage function. Its primary structure consists of a core protein encoded by 7137 nucleotides, resulting in 2316 amino acids. This core protein includes several domains: three globular domains (G1, G2, and G3) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment regions (Doege1991Complete; Watanabe1998Roles).

The secondary structure of aggrecan features regions of alpha helices and beta sheets, particularly in the G1 domain, which contains an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold crucial for hyaluronan binding (Watanabe1997Identification). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these globular domains, with the G1 domain forming a stable interaction with hyaluronan through its A, B, and B' subdomains (Watanabe1998Roles).

In terms of quaternary structure, aggrecan interacts with other matrix components, forming large aggregates with hyaluronic acid and link protein, which are essential for cartilage's viscoelastic properties (Aspberg2012The). Post-translational modifications include glycosylation and sulfation, which contribute to the high charge density and hydration of the proteoglycan aggregate (Dudhia2005Aggrecan). Alternative splicing results in different isoforms, with some lacking specific domains like the epidermal growth factor-like domain (Doege1991Complete).

## Function
The ACAN gene encodes aggrecan, a major proteoglycan in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cartilage tissue. Aggrecan contributes to the biomechanical properties of cartilage by forming large supramolecular aggregates with hyaluronan and link protein, which are entrapped in the collagen II/IX/XI fibrillar network. This structure provides cartilage with its load-bearing properties, allowing it to resist compression and dissipate loads over joint surfaces (Lv2019Identification; Stattin2022Novel).

Aggrecan's extended central region contains keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains, which are flanked by globular protein domains (G1, G2, and G3). These domains mediate interactions with other components of the extracellular matrix, such as tenascin-C and fibulin-1, which are crucial for cartilage extracellular matrix assembly and organization (Stattin2022Novel).

In healthy human cells, aggrecan is primarily active in the extracellular matrix, where it plays a key role in maintaining cartilage integrity and facilitating joint function. Disruptions in aggrecan expression or function can lead to various skeletal disorders, highlighting its importance in cartilage health (Stattin2022Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACAN gene, which encodes the aggrecan protein, are associated with a variety of skeletal disorders. These include autosomal dominant short stature, often accompanied by advanced bone age and early onset osteoarthritis (Gkourogianni2016Clinical). Specific conditions linked to ACAN mutations include spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia Kimberley type (SEDK) and spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD). SEDK is characterized by short stature and early-onset progressive joint osteoarthritis, while SEMD presents with extremely short stature, brachydactyly, and midface hypoplasia (Sao2024Proteoglycan).

Familial osteochondritis dissecans, a disorder affecting cartilage and subchondral bone, has also been linked to ACAN mutations. A missense mutation in the G3 domain of aggrecan disrupts interactions with other proteins in the cartilage extracellular matrix, contributing to this condition (Stattin2010A). Additionally, heterozygous mutations in ACAN are a significant cause of idiopathic short stature, with affected individuals often displaying proportionate short stature and other skeletal abnormalities (Hauer2017Genetic).

Alterations in aggrecan expression or its interactions can lead to osteoarthritis and intervertebral disc degeneration, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining cartilage integrity (Gkourogianni2016Clinical).

## Interactions
Aggrecan (ACAN) is a key component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and participates in various interactions with other proteins. The C-terminal G3 domain of aggrecan is involved in binding to ECM proteins such as tenascin-R, tenascin-C, fibulin-1, fibulin-2, and fibrillin-1. These interactions are calcium-dependent but carbohydrate-independent, as demonstrated by the crystal structure of the aggrecan C-type lectin domain (CLD) in complex with a tenascin-R fragment (Aspberg2012The). 

Aggrecan also interacts with the complement protein C1q, primarily through its G3 domain. This interaction is typical for complement-activating ECM proteins and is involved in activating the classical pathway of the complement system. The D2267N mutation in the G3 domain reduces C1q binding and complement activation, potentially due to altered glycosylation (Melin2013The).

Alternative splicing of the G3 domain influences its binding interactions with ECM proteins. Variants containing epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motifs show enhanced binding to tenascin-C and tenascin-R. The presence of calcium is crucial for these interactions, as demonstrated by experiments using surface plasmon resonance technology (Day2004Alternative).
