# WASHC1

## Overview
WASHC1 is a gene that encodes the protein WASH complex subunit 1, a critical component of the WASH complex involved in actin cytoskeletal dynamics and endosomal sorting. The WASH complex is essential for the regulation of actin polymerization, facilitating the formation of branched actin filaments through the Arp2/3 complex, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as endocytosis and vesicle trafficking (Linardopoulou2007Human; Jia2010WASH). WASHC1, as part of this complex, plays a significant role in cholesterol metabolism by influencing the recycling of transmembrane proteins like the LDL receptor, thereby maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (Wijers2019The). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with endosomal membranes, where it contributes to the sorting and trafficking of endosomal cargo (Alekhina2017Cellular; Fokin2021Assembly).

## Function
The WASHC1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the WASH complex, which plays a significant role in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting in human cells. This complex is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, facilitating the formation of branched actin filaments through the Arp2/3 complex. These actin filaments are essential for various cellular processes, including the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, endocytosis, and vesicle trafficking (Linardopoulou2007Human; Jia2010WASH).

In the context of cholesterol metabolism, the WASH complex, including WASHC1, is crucial for the endosomal recycling of transmembrane proteins such as the LDL receptor (LDLR) and LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1). This recycling is vital for maintaining normal cholesterol levels by facilitating the hepatic clearance of LDL-C and HDL-C (Wijers2019The). The WASH complex also influences the trafficking and surface expression of the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), which is involved in HDL-C uptake (Wijers2019The).

WASHC1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with endosomal membranes, where it contributes to the sorting and trafficking of endosomal cargo, maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper signaling pathways (Alekhina2017Cellular; Fokin2021Assembly).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WASHC1 gene, a component of the WASH complex, have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly affecting cholesterol metabolism and neurological health. WASHC1 deficiency impairs the endosomal trafficking of lipoprotein receptors such as LDLR and LRP1, leading to elevated plasma levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol. This disruption in cholesterol homeostasis is associated with increased LDLR proteolysis by the inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL), contributing to hypercholesterolemia and potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases (Wijers2019The).

In addition to its role in cholesterol metabolism, alterations in WASHC1 expression or function can lead to developmental and neurological disorders. The WASH complex is crucial for maintaining endosomal morphology and trafficking, and its dysregulation may contribute to conditions such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Mutations in components of the WASH complex, including WASHC1, have been implicated in these disorders, highlighting the gene's significance in maintaining cellular and neurological health (Derivery2009The).

## Interactions
WASHC1, a subunit of the WASH complex, is involved in various protein interactions essential for its function in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. It is a part of a pentameric complex that includes FAM21, WASHC3, WASHC4, and WASHC5, which collectively drive localized actin polymerization by activating the Arp2/3 complex through the VCA domain of WASHC1 (Guo2023Structural). The WASH complex interacts with the Retromer complex, with FAM21 linking WASH to Retromer subunits VPS35 and VPS29, facilitating endosomal membrane recycling (Guo2023Structural).

WASHC1 also interacts with the SNX27 Retromer cargo adaptor, which is crucial for recycling specific transmembrane cargoes from endosomes to the plasma membrane (Guo2023Structural). The WASH complex is known to bind directly to liposomes, indicating its localization on endosomal membranes is partly due to lipid interactions (Derivery2009The). Additionally, WASHC1 interacts with dynamin, a protein involved in endosomal fission, and this interaction is independent of dynamin's activity (Derivery2009The). These interactions highlight the role of WASHC1 in maintaining endosomal morphology and function.
