# ATP7B

## Overview
ATP7B is a gene that encodes the ATPase copper transporting beta protein, a crucial component in the regulation of copper homeostasis in human cells. This protein is classified as a copper-transporting P-type ATPase and is primarily expressed in the liver, where it plays a vital role in the incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin and the excretion of excess copper into bile. The ATP7B protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple transmembrane segments and metal-binding domains that facilitate copper transport across cellular membranes. Mutations in the ATP7B gene are linked to Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder that results in copper accumulation and associated hepatic and neurological symptoms (Lutsenko2019Molecular; Bartee2007Hepatic; Coffey2013A).

## Structure
The ATP7B protein, also known as Wilson ATPase, is a copper-transporting P-type ATPase with a complex molecular structure. It consists of a single polypeptide chain with 1465 amino acid residues, organized into multiple domains. The primary structure includes eight transmembrane segments that form the copper translocation pathway, with a conserved CPC motif in the sixth segment crucial for copper binding and translocation (Lutsenko2019Molecular; Jayakanthan2019Biochemical).

The secondary structure features a combination of alpha helices and beta sheets. The N-domain, responsible for ATP binding, has a six-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helical hairpins, showing structural similarity to bacterial KdpB (Dmitriev2006Solution).

The tertiary structure includes a large cytoplasmic domain with ATP-binding and phosphorylation sites. The N-terminal region contains six metal-binding domains (MBDs) with a ferredoxin-like fold, each capable of binding copper ions (Banci2008Metal; Lutsenko2019Molecular).

ATP7B functions as a dimer in cells, although the significance of this quaternary structure is not fully understood (Lutsenko2019Molecular). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in protein stability and trafficking (Lutsenko2019Molecular). Alternative splicing of ATP7B generates protein variants, though their functional significance is not well understood (Lutsenko2007Function).

## Function
The ATP7B gene encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase that plays a crucial role in maintaining copper homeostasis in human cells. In healthy cells, ATP7B is primarily located in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of hepatocytes, where it facilitates the incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, a copper-dependent enzyme involved in iron mobilization (La2007Trafficking; Bartee2007Hepatic). When intracellular copper levels rise, ATP7B relocates to vesicular compartments near the plasma membrane to aid in the excretion of excess copper into bile, preventing toxic accumulation (La2010Mammalian; Bartee2007Hepatic).

ATP7B's activity involves binding cytosolic copper to an intramembrane CPC motif, transferring the γ-phosphate of ATP to an invariant aspartate residue, and releasing copper on the other side of the membrane. This cycle is coupled with intracellular trafficking, supporting the protein's biosynthetic and homeostatic functions (La2010Mammalian). The protein is also involved in copper delivery to other tissues and organs, such as the placenta, where it helps regulate copper supply to the fetus, and the mammary gland, where it facilitates copper secretion into milk (La2007Trafficking; La2010Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP7B gene are primarily associated with Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive copper accumulation in the liver and brain, leading to hepatic and neurological symptoms (Forbes1998Functional; Coffey2013A). Over 100 mutations have been identified in ATP7B, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations, which disrupt the gene's function as a copper-transporting ATPase (Forbes1998Functional; Vrabelova2005Mutation). The H1069Q mutation is particularly prevalent in European populations, accounting for a significant proportion of Wilson disease cases (Vrabelova2005Mutation; Kluska2018Whole‐exome).

These mutations can lead to defects in copper excretion and homeostasis, resulting in copper accumulation and subsequent oxidative stress and cell death (de2007Molecular; Coffey2013A). The clinical presentation of Wilson's disease varies widely, with some mutations associated with specific phenotypes, such as early hepatic or late neurological symptoms (de2007Molecular). The genetic complexity of ATP7B mutations, including cases of uniparental disomy and pseudodominant inheritance, contributes to the variability in disease expression (Coffey2013A). Understanding these mutations and their effects is crucial for diagnosing and managing Wilson's disease.

## Interactions
ATP7B, a copper-transporting ATPase, engages in several protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in copper homeostasis. It interacts with the copper chaperone ATOX1, which delivers copper to ATP7B in a copper-dependent manner. This interaction is particularly strong with domains 1, 2, and 4 of ATP7B, facilitating copper delivery to the secretory pathway (van2004Copperdependent).

ATP7B also interacts with the protein COMMD1 (MURR1), which is involved in copper excretion from the liver. This interaction is specific to ATP7B and does not occur with ATOX1 or ATP7A (Lim2006Copperdependent; Tao2003The).

The protein glutaredoxin 1 (GRX1) interacts with the N-terminal domain of ATP7B. This interaction is copper-dependent and suggests a role for GRX1 in maintaining ATP7B activity by facilitating copper binding for transport (Lim2006Copperdependent).

In the context of Wilson disease, the H1069Q mutation in ATP7B promotes interaction with the chaperone protein HSP70, which accelerates the degradation of the mutant protein. Inhibiting HSP70 can improve the stability and trafficking of ATP7B-H1069Q, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Concilli2020Pharmacoproteomics).
