# BTLA

## Overview
BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, functioning as an inhibitory receptor primarily expressed on lymphocytes such as B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells. The BTLA protein plays a crucial role in immune regulation by interacting with the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. This interaction is pivotal in modulating immune responses, maintaining peripheral tolerance, and preventing excessive immune activation. The BTLA protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic tail, which, upon phosphorylation, recruits phosphatases like SHP-1 and SHP-2 to mediate its immunosuppressive effects. BTLA's function as an immune checkpoint receptor is significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases, where its expression and interactions can influence disease progression and immune homeostasis (Shrestha2020Redesigning; Cheung2009T; Ning2021Roles).

## Structure
BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator) is a protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. It is composed of an immunoglobulin domain with a cytoplasmic tail that delivers inhibitory signals to immune cells (Shrestha2020Redesigning). The interaction between BTLA and its ligand, HVEM, involves the formation of antiparallel β-sheets between β-strands of BTLA and HVEM, with backbone hydrogen bonds playing a crucial role in forming these intermolecular β-sheets (Kuncewicz2020Fragments). 

BTLA's cytoplasmic tail contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which, upon phosphorylation, recruits tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2, leading to reduced cellular activation and growth (Shrestha2020Redesigning). This phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification that affects BTLA's function. 

The BTLA protein can form a quaternary structure by interacting with other proteins, such as HVEM, to modulate immune responses (Liu2021HVEM). The BTLA binding site on HVEM overlaps with that of glycoprotein D (gD), which also forms β-sheets with HVEM, indicating a shared binding mechanism (Kuncewicz2020Fragments). The structural details of BTLA, including its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, are crucial for its role as an immune checkpoint.

## Function
BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator) is an inhibitory receptor that plays a significant role in regulating immune responses in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed on lymphocytes, including B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells, and functions by interacting with its ligand, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), which is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily (Murphy2010Slow; Ning2021Roles). This interaction leads to the activation of tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in BTLA, recruiting SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, which mediate immunosuppressive effects (Ning2021Roles).

BTLA is involved in maintaining peripheral tolerance in T cells by forming a cis-heterodimeric complex with HVEM, which blocks other co-signaling molecules from binding to HVEM, thus maintaining T cell tolerance (Ning2021Roles). It also regulates the proliferation and cytokine secretion of γδ T cells, which are important for producing inflammatory cytokines at barrier sites to protect against pathogens (Ning2021Roles). In B cells, BTLA suppresses functions such as proliferation and cytokine secretion through its interaction with HVEM (Ning2021Roles). Overall, BTLA functions as an inhibitory receptor that regulates immune cell activation and maintains immune homeostasis (Ning2021Roles).

## Clinical Significance
BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator) is implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, and disrupted interactions. In cancer, high BTLA expression is associated with poor outcomes in several types, including gallbladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, melanoma, and lung cancer. It is linked to tumor progression and immune evasion, with polymorphisms like rs1982809 increasing susceptibility to cancers such as renal cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Andrzejczak2024BTLA; Ning2021Roles). In breast cancer, specific BTLA SNPs, such as rs1844089 and rs2705535, correlate with risk and clinical factors like tumor size and receptor status (Andrzejczak2024BTLA).

In autoimmune diseases, BTLA deficiency is linked to increased antigen-specific IgG responses and susceptibility to conditions like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and autoimmune hepatitis-like disease. In systemic lupus erythematosus, a reduced proportion of CD4+ BTLA+ T cells is noted, and BTLA deficiency accelerates lupus-like symptoms in mouse models (Ning2021Roles). In rheumatoid arthritis, increased BTLA expression in T cells is observed, with specific SNPs associated with disease susceptibility (Ning2021Roles).

In infectious diseases, BTLA plays a role in sepsis, where its deficiency in mice leads to altered immune responses, affecting leukocyte recruitment and bacterial clearance (Ning2021Roles).

## Interactions
BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator) is an immune checkpoint receptor that interacts with the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. This interaction is characterized by both cis and trans configurations. In the cis configuration, BTLA and HVEM form a stable heterodimeric complex on the same cell, which inhibits HVEM signaling by preventing its activation by ligands such as LIGHT, BTLA, and CD160 from neighboring cells (Cheung2009T). This cis-complex is predominant on naive T cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis by limiting trans-interactions and preventing NF-κB activation (Cheung2009T).

In the trans configuration, BTLA can interact with HVEM on adjacent cells, delivering inhibitory signals that modulate T cell activation. This interaction involves the recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases upon phosphorylation of BTLA's intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which suppress antigen receptor signaling (RodriguezBarbosa2019HVEM; Gonzalez2005A). The BTLA-HVEM interaction is also involved in forming a ternary complex with the TNF ligand LIGHT, indicating distinct binding sites on HVEM for these proteins (Gonzalez2005A).
