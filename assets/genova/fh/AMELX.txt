# AMELX

## Overview
The AMELX gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes the amelogenin protein, which is pivotal in the biomineralization of dental enamel. Amelogenin is a structural protein that constitutes the majority of the enamel matrix during tooth development, playing a critical role in the formation and organization of enamel crystallites. It is primarily categorized as a matrix protein due to its involvement in the extracellular matrix of developing enamel. The protein's ability to self-assemble into nanospheres is essential for the proper spacing and orientation of enamel crystals, thereby influencing the hardness and resilience of the enamel (Fincham1999The; Noh2016Role). Mutations in the AMELX gene can lead to amelogenesis imperfecta, a condition characterized by defective enamel formation, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Wang2024AMELX; TremilloMaldonado2023Alteration).

## Structure
The AMELX gene encodes the amelogenin protein, which plays a crucial role in enamel formation. The primary structure of amelogenin is characterized by a high content of proline (25-30%), histidine, glutamine, and leucine, contributing to its hydrophobic nature, although the 12-carboxy-terminal residues present a hydrophilic motif (Stephanopoulos2005Genes). The protein is secreted primarily as a 175 amino acid isoform, known as isoform 1, which is the most prevalent. Other isoforms include a 189 amino acid version (isoform 3) and a 159 amino acid version (isoform 2) (Stephanopoulos2005Genes).

Amelogenin contains specific domains such as the tyrosine-rich amelogenin protein (TRAP) domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for enamel biomineralization (Barron2010A). The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants that encode different isoforms, such as the leucine-rich amelogenin peptide (LRAP) (Barron2010A; Xia2016Truncated).

Post-translational modifications include cleavage by matrix metalloproteinase-20 (MMP20), resulting in various cleavage products that contribute to the heterogeneity of amelogenin molecules in the enamel matrix (Xia2016Truncated). The secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The AMELX gene encodes amelogenin, a protein that plays a critical role in the formation and mineralization of dental enamel, the hardest tissue in the human body. Amelogenin is primarily active in ameloblasts, the cells responsible for enamel production, and constitutes about 90% of the enamel matrix during tooth development (Gasse2013Common; Noh2016Role). 

Amelogenin proteins are involved in the self-assembly process that generates nanosphere structures, which are crucial for organizing the microstructure of the enamel matrix. These nanospheres act as spacers, preventing premature fusion of enamel crystallites and facilitating proper crystal growth and orientation (Fincham1999The). The proteins undergo proteolytic processing, which reduces their anionic character and promotes hydrophobic interactions, stabilizing the enamel matrix and influencing the binding affinity for hydroxyapatite (Fincham1999The).

The expression of amelogenin is developmentally regulated, and its proper function is essential for normal enamel biomineralization. Mutations in the AMELX gene can lead to amelogenesis imperfecta, a disorder characterized by enamel defects (Noh2016Role; Prakash2005Tooth). The protein's activity is primarily localized to the extracellular matrix of developing enamel, where it interacts with mineral surfaces to guide enamel formation (Fincham1999The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AMELX gene are primarily associated with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a hereditary condition that affects enamel formation. This condition is characterized by various enamel defects, including hypoplasia, hypomineralization, and hypomaturation, which result in discolored, fragile, or misshapen teeth (Wang2024AMELX; TremilloMaldonado2023Alteration). The AMELX gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes amelogenin, a critical protein in the enamel matrix. Mutations in this gene can lead to alterations in amelogenin, causing enamel malformations such as thin, rough, and stained enamel (Zhang2023Splicing; Hart2000Mutational).

Different mutations in the AMELX gene can lead to distinct phenotypes of AI. For instance, mutations in the signal peptide domain can result in hypoplastic AI, while those in the N-terminus and C-terminus domains can cause hypomineralized-hypomatured and hypoplastic AI, respectively (Leban2022An). The severity of enamel malformations is generally more pronounced in males due to the X-linked nature of the gene, with females often exhibiting a mosaic pattern of normal and affected enamel due to lyonization (chan2011target). Understanding the specific mutations and their effects is crucial for diagnosing and managing AI (Wang2024AMELX).

## Interactions
The AMELX gene encodes the amelogenin protein, which plays a crucial role in tooth enamel formation through its interactions with other proteins and molecules. Amelogenin interacts directly with ameloblastin (Ambn), another key enamel matrix protein, forming heteromolecular assemblies that are essential for enamel crystal nucleation and maturation. This interaction is facilitated by specific self-assembly motifs in ameloblastin, such as the Y/F-x-x-Y/L/F-x-Y/F motif, which are crucial for binding to amelogenin (Bapat2020CoImmunoprecipitation).

Amelogenin also binds to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) through its tyrosyl motif, particularly in the Tyrosine-rich amelogenin polypeptide (TRAP). This interaction is significant for enamel biomineralization and is similar to the binding seen between arthropodin and chitin. The GlcNAc binding motif is located in the 13-residue tyrosyl C-terminal domain of TRAP, which is absent in the leucine-rich amelogenin peptide (LRAP) (Ravindranath1999Tyrosyl).

Additionally, amelogenin interacts with thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a matricellular protein, as identified through functional proteomics. This interaction suggests a role for amelogenin in various cellular processes, including tissue regeneration and wound healing (Capolupo2017Identification). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of amelogenin in enamel formation and its potential involvement in broader physiological processes.
