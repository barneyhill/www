# C10orf105

## Overview
C10orf105 is a gene located on chromosome 10 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 10 open reading frame 105. This protein is categorized as a hypothetical protein due to the limited functional characterization available in current scientific literature. While the precise biological role of C10orf105 remains to be fully elucidated, preliminary studies suggest its involvement in cellular processes that may be significant in certain physiological or pathological contexts. Further research is necessary to determine the specific pathways and interactions in which the C10orf105 protein participates, as well as its potential implications in human health and disease.
