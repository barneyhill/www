# INHBB

## Overview
The INHBB gene encodes the inhibin beta B subunit, a crucial component of the activin and inhibin protein complexes, which belong to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. The inhibin beta B subunit is involved in forming activin B, a homodimeric protein that plays significant roles in various physiological processes, including energy metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and developmental processes. Activin B, through its interaction with specific receptors, influences cellular signaling pathways that regulate insulin secretion, adipocyte differentiation, and spinal cord development. The INHBB gene's expression and regulation are implicated in several clinical conditions, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Eriksson2012Genetic; Namwanje2016Activins; Wang2016Structure).

## Structure


## Function
The INHBB gene encodes the inhibin beta B subunit, which is a component of activins, proteins that play significant roles in various physiological processes. Activin B, formed by the homodimerization of the beta B subunit, is involved in energy metabolism, adipocyte differentiation, and glucose homeostasis. In adipocytes, activin B reduces the expression of proteins involved in lipolysis, indicating its role in adipogenesis and mature adipocyte function (Namwanje2016Activins). 

Activin B also plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism by modulating insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. It reduces calcium ion influx and insulin secretion in pancreatic islet cells after glucose stimulation, contrasting with activin A, which has the opposite effect (Namwanje2016Activins). This regulation is attributed to the selective phosphorylation of Smad3 by activin B, leading to distinct downstream effects (Namwanje2016Activins).

In addition to its metabolic functions, activin B is involved in the development of the spinal cord and myelination by supporting oligodendrocyte development (Namwanje2016Activins). It is also expressed in various tissues, including the gonad, forebrain, and spinal cord, indicating its involvement in developmental processes and tissue differentiation (Namwanje2016Activins).

## Clinical Significance
The INHBB gene, encoding the inhibin beta B subunit, plays a significant role in various clinical conditions due to its involvement in the regulation of reproductive processes and hormone secretion. Alterations in the expression of INHBB have been implicated in several cancers. In colorectal cancer, the INHBB gene is often hypermethylated, which is associated with gene silencing and downregulation in tumors compared to normal tissue. This hypermethylation is linked to worse overall survival in colorectal cancer patients (Mayor2009Longrange).

In breast cancer, genetic variants near the INHBB gene, such as rs4849887, have been associated with breast size and potentially influence breast cancer risk. INHBB is upregulated by estrogen and is highly expressed in fat cells, with its expression reduced by weight loss (Eriksson2012Genetic).

INHBB is also involved in developmental processes, as evidenced by its proximity to a chromosomal translocation breakpoint associated with split hand/foot malformation with long bone deficiency (SHFLD). Although no direct mutations in INHBB were found, its location suggests a potential role in limb development disorders (Babbs2007A).

## Interactions
INHBB, encoding the inhibin beta B subunit, participates in several protein interactions, primarily within the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. INHBB forms part of activin B, a disulfide-linked dimer, which interacts with type I and type II receptors to initiate intracellular signaling through the phosphorylation of Smad transcription factors (Wang2016Structure). This interaction is crucial for various cellular processes, including the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and anoikis resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells (Zou2018Inhibin).

INHBB also interacts with follistatin-288 (FST-288), a known binding partner that antagonizes activin signaling by blocking receptor interactions (Wang2016Structure). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the Sox9/INHBB axis promotes the secretion of activin B, which activates hepatic stellate cells through Smad2 phosphorylation, contributing to liver fibrosis and metastasis (Chen2021Sox9INHBB).

The protein's role in forming heterodimers with other TGF-β family members, such as INHA and TGFB2, is suggested by the presence of conserved cysteines that facilitate disulfide bond formation, potentially influencing tumor formation and progression (Daly2022Computational). However, there is no evidence of direct interactions between INHBB and nucleic acids in the provided context.
