# KRT27

## Overview
KRT27 is a gene that encodes keratin 27, a type I intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in the inner root sheath of hair follicles. Keratin 27 plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical stability of hair follicles, contributing to the hair follicle cycle and morphogenesis. The protein is characterized by a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is essential for its structural function, and it forms heterodimers with type II keratins to assemble into intermediate filaments. These interactions are vital for providing mechanical support to epithelial cells. KRT27 is involved in various protein-protein interactions within a network of keratin proteins, highlighting its significance in hair follicle biology and its potential implications in clinical conditions affecting hair and skin (Ho2022Update; Gao2021Proteomics).

## Structure
Keratin 27 (KRT27) is a type I intermediate filament protein primarily found in the inner root sheath of hair follicles. Its primary structure consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This central rod domain is crucial for the protein's structural integrity and function (Ho2022Update).

The secondary structure of KRT27 is characterized by coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate the formation of stable dimeric structures. These motifs are essential for the protein's ability to form higher-order assemblies, contributing to the mechanical stability of the hair follicle structure (Ho2022Update).

In terms of tertiary structure, KRT27 assembles into a filamentous network, which is a common feature of intermediate filament proteins. This network formation is vital for maintaining the structural framework within cells (Ho2022Update).

The quaternary structure of KRT27 involves the formation of heterodimers with type II keratins. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of intermediate filaments, providing mechanical support and resilience to epithelial cells (Ho2022Update).

Common post-translational modifications of KRT27 include phosphorylation, which can regulate its assembly and function within the cell (Ho2022Update).

## Clinical Significance
KRT27, a gene encoding a type I keratin protein, is primarily involved in hair follicle morphogenesis. Alterations in the expression of KRT27 have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly those affecting hair and skin. In AEC syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by skin fragility and hair abnormalities, KRT27 expression is significantly reduced, showing a 41-fold decrease. This downregulation is associated with the syndrome's clinical features, such as skin barrier defects and hair follicle abnormalities, suggesting that altered KRT27 expression contributes to the pathogenesis of AEC syndrome (Clements2012Mutations).

KRT27 is also implicated in hair growth disorders. In studies involving Krt71 knockout mice, a significant decrease in KRT27 expression was observed, indicating that mutations in related keratin genes can influence KRT27 expression and potentially lead to hair growth disorders (Zhang2023Development). Although specific mutations in KRT27 have not been detailed, its altered expression is associated with conditions like Woolly Hair and Hypotrichosis, which are characterized by abnormal hair growth and structure (Zhang2023Development). These findings underscore the importance of KRT27 in maintaining normal hair and skin physiology.

## Interactions
KRT27, or keratin 27, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in maintaining the structural integrity of hair follicles. It is part of a network of keratin proteins, including KRT24, KRT19, KRT14, and KRT10, which interact to regulate the hair follicle cycle. These interactions are essential for the structural stability and morphological changes of hair follicles, particularly during the anagen and catagen phases of the hair cycle (Gao2021Proteomics).

KRT27 is classified within a subcluster of type I keratin genes and is expressed in differentiated cells in the suprabasal layers of stratified epithelia or epithelial appendages. It is also expressed in the inner root sheath (IRS) of hair follicles, where it likely interacts with other keratins to maintain the structural framework necessary for hair formation (Gao2021Proteomics).

The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed using STRING and Cytoscape highlights KRT27 as a key node, indicating its significant role in the regulatory network of hair follicle development. This network analysis underscores the importance of KRT27 in the broader context of keratin interactions and hair follicle biology (Gao2021Proteomics).
