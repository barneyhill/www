# CABCOCO1

## Overview
CABCOCO1 is a gene that encodes the protein ciliary associated calcium binding coiled-coil 1, which is a member of the CLAMP superfamily of coiled-coil proteins. This protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including a coiled-coil domain and a CLAMP motif, which facilitate its calcium-binding activity. Unlike typical calcium-binding proteins that utilize EF-hand motifs, CABCOCO1 employs its acidic amino acid-rich coiled-coil domain for this function. The protein is predominantly localized in the sperm flagellum and is implicated in the regulation of sperm motility, playing a crucial role in spermatogenesis and flagellar movement. Its expression is notably high in the testis, underscoring its specialized function in reproductive biology. The evolutionary conservation of CABCOCO1 across species suggests its fundamental role in ciliary and flagellar functions, potentially influencing cellular processes such as signal transduction and communication (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1).

## Structure
The CABCOCO1 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain located at the C-terminal region, which is suggested to be responsible for its calcium-binding activity, in lieu of the EF-hand motif commonly found in other calcium-binding proteins (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1). The protein is rich in acidic amino acids such as aspartate and glutamate, which may contribute to its calcium-binding properties (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1). CABCOCO1 contains a CLAMP motif in the center and a leucine zipper domain within the CLAMP region, which are structural features that suggest a role in calcium-binding and possibly in the regulation of sperm flagellar movement (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1).

The protein's migration pattern in SDS-PAGE suggests it may form complex structures, possibly through interactions facilitated by its coiled-coil domain, although its migration is not affected by calcium binding (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1). The exact details of its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as any post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not specified in the available literature (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1). CABCOCO1 is a member of the CLAMP superfamily, which includes other coiled-coil proteins like the flagellar C1a complex subunit C1a-32 (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1).

## Function
CABCOCO1 is a novel coiled-coil protein with calcium-binding activity, primarily localized in the sperm flagellum, suggesting a significant role in sperm function. The protein is involved in the regulation of sperm flagellar movement, potentially through its calcium-binding properties, which are crucial for modulating flagellar motility and waveforms (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1). CABCOCO1 is expressed significantly in the testis, indicating its specific involvement in spermatogenesis and sperm motility (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1).

During spermatogenesis, CABCOCO1 localizes near the centrosome and later to the flagellum, suggesting its role in the structural organization of the sperm flagellum (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1). The protein's calcium-binding activity, demonstrated through various assays, is thought to be mediated by its acidic amino acid-rich coiled-coil domain, which may facilitate interactions with other proteins involved in flagellar motility (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1).

Although the specific function of CABCOCO1 in healthy human cells is not directly addressed, its conservation across species, including humans, suggests a fundamental role in ciliary and flagellar functions, potentially impacting processes like signal transduction and cellular communication (Kawashima2016CABCOCO1).
