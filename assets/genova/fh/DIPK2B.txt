# DIPK2B

## Overview
DIPK2B, or divergent protein kinase domain 2B, is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by DIPK2B is categorized as a kinase, which suggests its role in phosphorylation, a critical mechanism in cellular signaling and regulation. Research has highlighted its involvement in neurological and developmental disorders, as well as its potential impact on addiction behaviors and cardiovascular health. Notably, DIPK2B is an X-chromosome inactivation escapee, which may influence its expression patterns and functional implications across different biological contexts (Braun2022Sex; Du2023Regulation; Daiwile2024Incubation; Ramamoorthi2023Developmental).

## Clinical Significance
DIPK2B, also known as CXorf36, is implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders. Alterations in the expression of DIPK2B have been associated with conditions such as fragile X syndrome, autism, Kabuki syndrome, and intellectual disability. These associations suggest a potential role for DIPK2B in the etiology and progression of these disorders (Du2023Regulation).

In the context of substance use disorders, DIPK2B expression levels have been linked to methamphetamine (METH) addiction behaviors. Studies in rat models have shown that increased mRNA levels of DIPK2B correlate with compulsive METH-taking behavior and craving, indicating its involvement in the molecular mechanisms underlying addiction and relapse (Daiwile2024Incubation).

DIPK2B is also involved in sex-specific transcriptional programming in response to prenatal testosterone exposure, which may lead to altered cardiac gene expression profiles and increased susceptibility to cardiovascular dysfunctions in adulthood (Ramamoorthi2023Developmental).

Furthermore, DIPK2B is noted as an X-chromosome inactivation escapee, which may contribute to variability in gene expression and potentially provide a protective mechanism against certain stressors (Braun2022Sex).
