# SHTN1

## Overview
The SHTN1 gene encodes the shootin 1 protein, which is integral to neuronal development and cytoskeletal organization. Shootin 1 is primarily involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics, playing a crucial role in axon guidance and neural network formation. As a cytoskeletal regulatory protein, shootin 1 interacts with actin filaments and cell adhesion molecules, facilitating processes such as cell motility and polarization. It acts as a 'clutch molecule,' linking actin filament retrograde flow to the extracellular matrix, which is essential for generating traction forces necessary for cell movement. The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation and interactions with signaling pathways, such as those involving Rho-GTPases, which are vital for filopodia formation and neuronal polarization. Dysregulation of SHTN1 expression or function can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper neuronal architecture and function (Emerson2020Shootin‐1; Lin2022A; Kashirina2019Secretome).

## Structure


## Function
The SHTN1 (shootin 1) gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the organization of the cytoskeleton, particularly in neuronal cells. In healthy human cells, SHTN1 is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics through its interaction with actin filaments, which is crucial for cell motility and signaling pathways. This protein is primarily active in the growth cones of neurons, where it contributes to axon guidance and the formation of neural networks (Emerson2020Shootin‐1; Lin2022A).

SHTN1 facilitates the organization of the cytoskeleton by activating Rho-GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac1, which promote the formation of filopodia, essential for cell migration and polarization (Kashirina2019Secretome). It acts as a 'clutch molecule' linking growth cone actin filament retrograde flow to the extracellular matrix through the cell adhesion molecule L1-CAM, which is necessary for generating traction forces required for cell movement (Emerson2020Shootin‐1).

The precise regulation of SHTN1 is critical, as its overexpression can lead to defects such as surplus axons and impaired neuronal polarization, which are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (Emerson2020Shootin‐1; Lin2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SHTN1 gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. In intellectual disability (ID) patients, the SHTN1 gene is significantly down-regulated, which is associated with dysregulation of pathways related to the actin cytoskeleton and axonogenesis. This down-regulation is observed in patients with mutations in transcription factors such as CCNT2, CDK9, and TAF2, which impair the expression of SHTN1, potentially delaying neural polarization, a common issue in ID (InanlooRahatloo2019WholeTranscriptome).

In the context of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P), a genome-wide association study identified a susceptibility locus within the SHTN1 gene, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of NSCL/P. This finding highlights the gene's potential contribution to the genetic complexity of this condition (Wang2016Validation).

Additionally, the SHTN1 gene's role in axonogenesis is influenced by alternative splicing, with its isoforms SHTN1L and SHTN1S playing distinct roles. Disruption in the balance of these isoforms, particularly due to the splicing regulator PTBP2, can lead to axonal growth defects, which may have implications for neurological development and disorders (Zhang2019Axonogenesis).

## Interactions
SHTN1 (shootin 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in neuronal development by interacting with various proteins and facilitating key cellular processes. It interacts with F-actin and L1-CAM, which is crucial for transmitting forces generated by actin retrograde flow to the extracellular matrix, thereby coupling actin polymerization with neurite elongation (Liaci2021Neuronal). SHTN1 is phosphorylated by PAK1, enhancing its interaction with F-actin, which is essential for its function in neuronal polarization and axon differentiation (Liaci2021Neuronal).

In zebrafish, SHTN1 is a transcriptionally repressed target of the Semaphorin6A (Sema6A) and PlexinA2 (PlxnA2) signaling pathway, which are involved in axon guidance. This interaction is critical for linking growth cone actin filament retrograde flow to the extracellular matrix through L1-CAM, facilitating traction forces necessary for cell movement (Emerson2020Shootin‐1). The regulation of SHTN1 by these pathways is vital, as its overexpression can lead to surplus axons, while its inhibition can impair cell polarization and axon outgrowth (Emerson2020Shootin‐1).

SHTN1 also participates in cytoskeleton organization through the activation of Cdc42 and Rac1, promoting the formation of filopodia, which is crucial for cell adaptation to various conditions (Kashirina2019Secretome).
