# TMOD3

## Overview
Tropomodulin 3 (TMOD3) is a gene that encodes the protein tropomodulin 3, which is a crucial regulator of actin filament dynamics. As a member of the tropomodulin family, the protein is characterized by its ability to cap the pointed ends of actin filaments, thereby preventing their elongation and disassembly. This function is vital for maintaining the stability and organization of the cytoskeleton, influencing cell shape, motility, and intracellular transport (Parreno2018Multifunctional; Kumari2020Tropomodulins). TMOD3 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, exocytosis, and the maintenance of cell morphology, particularly in polarized epithelial cells (Weber2007Tmod3). The protein interacts with tropomyosin to stabilize actin filaments and is subject to regulation through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Parreno2018Multifunctional). Alterations in TMOD3 expression have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and retinal diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Liu2019MicroRNA145; Wang2020MicroRNA‑490‑3p).

## Structure
Tropomodulin 3 (TMOD3) is a protein characterized by its unique molecular structure, which includes distinct domains that contribute to its function in actin filament dynamics. TMOD3 contains an N-terminal domain that is largely unstructured and includes two tropomyosin-binding sites (TMBS1 and TMBS2) and an actin-binding site (ABS1) (Parreno2018Multifunctional; Uversky2011Systematic). The C-terminal domain of TMOD3 is more structured, featuring a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which is followed by a nonhomologous α-helix and a C-terminal tail (Parreno2018Multifunctional).

The N-terminal domain's intrinsic disorder is significant, with disorder scores above 0.5, indicating a high level of flexibility, which may facilitate interactions with tropomyosin and actin (Uversky2011Systematic). The second tropomyosin-binding site of TMOD3 is located in a transition region, suggesting a disorder-to-order transition upon binding (Uversky2011Systematic).

TMOD3 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by Akt2, which can inhibit its interaction with actin (Parreno2018Multifunctional). This phosphorylation occurs at Ser71, a site that is crucial for its regulatory role in actin dynamics (Parreno2018Multifunctional). Multiple splice variants of TMOD3 exist, potentially leading to isoforms with distinct functions (Kostyukova2008TropomodulinTropomyosin).

## Function
Tropomodulin 3 (TMOD3) is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating actin filament dynamics by capping the pointed ends of actin filaments, thereby preventing their elongation and disassembly. This capping function is essential for maintaining the stability and organization of the cytoskeleton, which influences cell shape, motility, and intracellular transport (Parreno2018Multifunctional; Kumari2020Tropomodulins).

In polarized epithelial cells, TMOD3 is localized to lateral membranes and is vital for maintaining cell morphology. It stabilizes F-actin on lateral membranes, which is crucial for maintaining cell height and structural integrity (Weber2007Tmod3). TMOD3 also interacts with tropomyosin to stabilize actin filaments, contributing to the organization of the spectrin-actin membrane skeleton (Weber2007Tmod3).

TMOD3 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration and exocytosis. It regulates actin dynamics in lamellipodia, acting as a negative regulator of actin assembly and cell migration by capping pointed ends and sequestering actin monomers (Parreno2018Multifunctional; Yamashiro2014Differential). In exocytosis, TMOD3 is crucial for cortical actin remodeling, facilitating vesicle docking and fusion (Parreno2018Multifunctional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMOD3 gene have been implicated in various pathological conditions. In the context of retinal diseases, miR-145 has been shown to regulate pathological retinal angiogenesis by targeting TMOD3. This regulation affects endothelial cell functions and actin dynamics, contributing to conditions like oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), where TMOD3 expression is downregulated, leading to increased neovascularization (Liu2019MicroRNA145).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), miR-490-3p targets TMOD3, resulting in reduced cell proliferation and invasion. This suggests that TMOD3 plays a role in cancer progression, with its expression being crucial for tumor cell behavior (Wang2020MicroRNA‑490‑3p).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), miR-145 enhances radiosensitivity by suppressing TMOD3 expression. High levels of TMOD3 are associated with poor survival outcomes, indicating its role in radioresistance. The suppression of TMOD3 by miR-145 suggests a potential therapeutic approach to overcome radioresistance in NSCLC (Li2021MiR145).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TMOD3 in various diseases, where its altered expression or interaction with specific microRNAs can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes.

## Interactions
Tropomodulin 3 (TMOD3) is involved in several protein interactions that regulate actin filament dynamics. TMOD3 binds to the pointed ends of actin filaments, preventing their depolymerization, and interacts with tropomyosin (Tpm), which enhances its capping activity and stabilizes the filaments (Parreno2018Multifunctional; Jo2016Tropomodulin3). The interaction between TMOD3 and Tpm3.1 is crucial for maintaining the actin mesh, particularly in processes like mouse oocyte maturation and exocytosis (Parreno2018Multifunctional; Jo2016Tropomodulin3).

TMOD3 also has a unique ability to bind both F-actin and G-actin, sequestering monomeric G-actin at submicromolar concentrations, a feature not shared by other tropomodulin isoforms (Parreno2018Multifunctional). This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation through Akt2, which can inhibit TMOD3's interaction with actin (Parreno2018Multifunctional).

In addition to its interactions with actin and tropomyosin, TMOD3 forms complexes with other proteins, such as small ankyrin 1.5 (sAnk1.5) in skeletal muscle, which helps stabilize the sarcoplasmic reticulum and maintain myofibril alignment (Parreno2018Multifunctional). These interactions highlight TMOD3's role in regulating actin dynamics across various cellular contexts.
