# ARC

## Overview
The ARC gene encodes the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein, a pivotal component in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, which is crucial for learning and memory processes. As an immediate-early gene, ARC is rapidly induced by neuronal activity and plays a significant role in modulating AMPA receptor trafficking and actin cytoskeletal dynamics, thereby influencing synaptic strength and plasticity (Chowdhury2006ArcArg3.1; Nikolaienko2018Arc). The protein exhibits a bilobar structure with homology to viral Gag capsid domains, allowing it to adopt flexible conformations and engage in various protein-protein interactions (Nikolaienko2018Arc). ARC's involvement extends beyond the synapse, as it translocates to the nucleus to participate in transcriptional regulation, further underscoring its multifaceted role in neural function and adaptability (Epstein2018The). Dysregulation of ARC expression and function is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and Fragile X Syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Chuang2016Rare; Leung2022Arc; Wilkerson2018Roles).

## Structure
The human Arc protein exhibits a bilobar structure in its C-terminal domain (CTD), which shows 3D homology to the Gag capsid domains of HIV and RSV. The protein consists of two globular domains linked by an unstructured hinge region. These domains are predominantly alpha-helical and carry opposite charges, with the N-terminal domain (NTD) having a pI of 9.6 and the CTD a pI of 4.89 (Nikolaienko2018Arc). Arc is a flexible protein capable of adopting open and closed conformational states and can undergo reversible self-oligomerization, forming oligomers of approximately twelve monomers at physiological pH and temperature (Nikolaienko2018Arc).

Arc's structure is influenced by post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and SUMOylation. Ubiquitination occurs at specific lysine residues, such as K24, K55, K252, K269, K293, and K343, with K268 and K269 being crucial for degradation and synaptic function (Nikolaienko2018Arc). Phosphorylation is another significant modification, with sites like S84, Y274, T278, and S206 playing roles in Arc's function and stability (Nikolaienko2018Arc). These modifications impact Arc's interactions and localization, contributing to its role in synaptic plasticity and cognition.

## Function
The ARC gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, which is essential for learning and memory. ARC is an immediate-early gene that is rapidly induced by neuronal activity and is involved in the regulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking in neurons. It interacts with the endocytic machinery, including proteins like endophilin and dynamin, to modulate AMPAR endocytosis, thereby influencing synaptic strength and plasticity (Chowdhury2006ArcArg3.1; Nikolaienko2018Arc).

ARC is also involved in the structural plasticity of dendritic spines by regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics. It interacts with actin-binding proteins such as drebrin A and WAVE1, which are crucial for filament stabilization and branching, affecting spine morphology and synaptic efficacy (Nikolaienko2018Arc). During long-term potentiation (LTP), ARC stabilizes F-actin and maintains cofilin phosphorylation, which is necessary for spine enlargement and synaptic strengthening (Zhang2020ArcArg3.1).

In addition to its cytosolic functions, ARC translocates to the nucleus, where it associates with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and influences transcriptional regulation, impacting synaptic strength and homeostatic plasticity (Epstein2018The). These multifaceted roles underscore ARC's importance in maintaining neural function and adaptability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ARC gene are associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), ARC is implicated in the formation of amyloid plaques and tau hyperphosphorylation, both of which are key pathological features of the disease. Dysregulated ARC expression is linked to spatial memory impairment in AD models, and a polymorphism in the ARC gene is associated with a decreased risk of developing AD (Leung2022Arc).

In schizophrenia, rare mutations and hypermethylation of the ARC gene have been identified. These genetic alterations can affect ARC expression and protein function, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Specific mutations in the ARC promoter region have been shown to decrease regulatory activity, impacting gene transcription (Chuang2016Rare).

ARC dysregulation is also linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). In ASDs, elevated levels of Arc protein have been observed, suggesting its potential as a biomarker. In FXS, increased Arc levels support synaptic changes that occur without new protein synthesis, contributing to cognitive dysfunction (Wilkerson2018Roles; Sibarov2023Arc).

## Interactions
The ARC protein, also known as Arc/Arg3.1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. ARC interacts with components of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery, such as endophilin-3 and dynamin-2, to promote the internalization of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, which is essential for synaptic depression and long-term depression (LTD) (Myrum2015Arc; Chowdhury2006ArcArg3.1). ARC specifically binds to the C-terminal half of dynamin 2 and certain isoforms of endophilin, enhancing receptor endocytosis and modulating AMPA receptor trafficking (Chowdhury2006ArcArg3.1).

ARC also interacts with the nuclear spectrin isoform βSpIVΣ5 in promyelocytic leukemia bodies, suggesting a role in transcription regulation (Bloomer2007Activityregulated). This interaction is mediated by the coiled-coil domain of ARC and is involved in the regulation of nuclear promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies, which are associated with various nuclear functions (Bloomer2007Activityregulated).

Additionally, ARC binds to stargazin, an AMPA receptor auxiliary subunit, and guanylate kinase-associated protein (GKAP), influencing protein turnover and synapse remodeling at the postsynaptic density (Hallin2021Structural). These interactions highlight ARC's role as a flexible hub protein capable of modulating synaptic strength and plasticity.
