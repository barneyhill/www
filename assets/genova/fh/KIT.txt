# KIT

## Overview
The KIT gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase known as c-Kit, which is integral to various cellular processes, including cell signaling, proliferation, and survival. As a transmembrane protein, c-Kit consists of an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like folds, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. This structural composition allows c-Kit to function as a receptor that is activated upon binding with its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), leading to autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of multiple signaling pathways. These pathways are crucial for the regulation of hematopoiesis, pigmentation, gametogenesis, and the function of interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract. Mutations in the KIT gene can result in constitutive activation of the c-Kit protein, contributing to the pathogenesis of various cancers and other diseases, highlighting its importance as a therapeutic target (Lennartsson2012Stem; Roberts2015Gene).

## Structure
The KIT proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in cellular signaling. The protein structure of KIT includes an extracellular domain composed of five immunoglobulin-like folds, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (Inizan2020The; Mol2003Structure). The kinase domain is characterized by a two-domain fold with an N-lobe and a C-lobe, where the N-lobe contains a control helix that modulates kinase activity (Mol2003Structure). 

The intracellular domain of KIT features a kinase insert domain (KID) and a juxtamembrane region (JMR), both of which are important for its regulatory functions. The KID contains multiple phosphorylation sites, including tyrosine and serine residues, which are critical for downstream signaling (Inizan2020The). The juxtamembrane domain plays a role in maintaining the autoinhibited state of the kinase by inserting into the cleft between the kinase lobes, disrupting the control helix, and blocking the DFG motif (Mol2004Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in KIT and are essential for its activation and function (Mol2003Structure). The protein also exhibits conformational flexibility, particularly in the kinase insert domain, which is important for its biological functions (Inizan2020The).

## Function
The KIT proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase known as c-Kit, which is crucial for various physiological processes in healthy human cells. c-Kit is activated by binding to its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), which exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. This activation triggers autophosphorylation and initiates signal transduction pathways essential for cell survival, migration, and proliferation (Lennartsson2012Stem). c-Kit plays a significant role in hematopoiesis, where it is expressed in early hematopoietic cells, including stem and progenitor cells, and is vital for their proliferation and survival (Lennartsson2012Stem). It is also involved in pigmentation, as it regulates the proliferation, survival, and migration of melanocytes (Lennartsson2012Stem).

In the immune system, c-Kit is expressed in mast cells and dendritic cells, where it supports their proliferation, survival, and function (Lennartsson2012Stem). It is also crucial for gametogenesis, protecting germ cells from apoptosis and supporting gametocyte function (Lennartsson2012Stem). c-Kit signaling is involved in the development and function of interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract, which regulate gut motility (Lennartsson2012Stem).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIT gene are associated with a variety of diseases and conditions, primarily due to its role as a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell signaling. Gain-of-function mutations in KIT are implicated in several neoplasms, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), mastocytoma, mast cell leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), seminomas, dysgerminomas, and NK/T-cell lymphomas of the sinonasal tract (Roberts2015Gene). These mutations often occur in exons 8, 9, 11, and 17, leading to constitutive activation of the KIT protein, which can drive tumorigenesis (Hirota1998GainofFunction; Curtin2006Somatic).

In GISTs, KIT mutations are common, with exon 11 mutations being the most prevalent. These mutations can be sporadic or familial, affecting prognosis and response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib (Roberts2015Gene; DebiecRychter2006KIT). In systemic mastocytosis, the D816V mutation in exon 17 is found in over 90% of adult cases, leading to autoactivation of the KIT receptor (Roberts2015Gene; Féger2002Kit).

KIT mutations are also significant in melanoma, particularly in subtypes occurring on mucosal membranes and acral skin, where they may serve as therapeutic targets (Curtin2006Somatic). The presence of KIT mutations in these various conditions underscores their clinical significance and potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
The KIT proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that engages in various protein interactions crucial for its signaling functions. The c-Kit receptor interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, which bind to specific tyrosine residues in the juxtamembrane domain. SHP-1 binds to tyrosine 569, while SHP-2 binds to tyrosine 567, both negatively regulating c-Kit signaling by modulating cell proliferation in response to stem cell factor (SCF) (Kozlowski1998SHP1).

The c-Kit receptor also interacts with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. The p85α subunit of PI3K binds to phosphorylated tyrosine 721, facilitating downstream signaling, although this interaction is not essential for all c-Kit-mediated responses (Masson2009Oncogenic). Additionally, Tyr900 in the kinase domain is a Src-dependent phosphorylation site that mediates interaction with c-Crk and the p85 subunit of PI3K, although it is a minor association site for p85 (Lennartsson2003Identification).

The c-Kit receptor also associates with Src family kinases through phosphorylated tyrosines 568 and 570, which are involved in the regulation of SRC kinase activity (Price1997Direct). These interactions highlight the complex network of signaling pathways involving c-Kit and its role in cellular processes.
