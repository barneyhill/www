# PRRT4

## Overview
Proline rich transmembrane protein 4 (PRRT4) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its proline-rich regions, which are known to facilitate protein-protein interactions, potentially influencing signaling pathways and cellular communication. While the specific functions of PRRT4 are not fully elucidated, its structural features suggest a role in membrane-associated activities, possibly impacting cellular dynamics and signaling networks. Further research is needed to fully understand the biological significance and potential clinical implications of PRRT4 (Qiu2020aarFDC).
