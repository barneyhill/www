# IGFN1

## Overview
The IGFN1 gene encodes the protein immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domain containing 1, which is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domains, which facilitate its role as a scaffolding protein involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and actin polymerization. IGFN1 is crucial for muscle cell biology, particularly in processes such as myoblast fusion and differentiation, which are essential for muscle development and repair. The protein interacts with various sarcomeric proteins, including filamin C and titin, and is associated with the Z-band in muscle fibers, indicating its role in maintaining muscle cell structural integrity. IGFN1's expression and function are modulated in response to muscle hypertrophy and atrophy, and it is implicated in several diseases, including cancer and genetic predispositions to certain conditions (Baker2010Identification; Cracknell2020Proteomic; Verma2018Novel).

## Structure
The IGFN1 protein is characterized by the presence of immunoglobulin-like (IG) and fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, which are distributed across its structure. The full-length IGFN1 protein contains 11 globular domains, with three located at the N-terminus and eight at the C-terminus, separated by a large unstructured region (Baker2010Identification; Cracknell2020Proteomic). This unstructured region is highly disordered and lacks globular domains, as indicated by disorder prediction tools (Baker2010Identification).

IGFN1 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, including IGFN1_v1, IGFN1_v2, and IGFN1_v3, which differ in their domain composition and exon structure. IGFN1_v1 lacks the unstructured region coded by exon 13, IGFN1_v2 includes a long N-terminal unstructured segment followed by eight globular domains, and IGFN1_v3 contains only the last four globular domains from the C-terminus (Baker2010Identification). These isoforms are expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle, with some variants also found in heart tissue (Cracknell2020Proteomic).

The protein's structure allows it to interact with various sarcomeric proteins, such as filamin C (FLNC) and titin, and it is implicated in cytoskeletal remodeling and actin polymerization (Baker2010Identification; Cracknell2020Proteomic).

## Function
The IGFN1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in muscle cell biology, particularly in skeletal muscle and heart tissues. IGFN1 is involved in myoblast fusion and differentiation, processes essential for muscle development and repair. This function is supported by its role in actin remodeling, as IGFN1-deficient myoblasts exhibit a higher G:F actin ratio, indicating defects in actin polymerization (Cracknell2020Proteomic). IGFN1 interacts with the actin nucleating protein COBL, stabilizing it and preventing COBL from forming actin ruffles, which suggests a regulatory role in actin dynamics (Cracknell2020Proteomic).

IGFN1 is also associated with the Z-band in muscle fibers, where it co-localizes with proteins like α-actinin, KY, and FLNC, indicating its involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells (Baker2010Identification). The protein's domain composition, which includes globular domains separated by unstructured segments, suggests a scaffolding role that facilitates local actin remodeling and muscle cell fusion (Baker2010Identification). IGFN1's expression is modulated in response to muscle hypertrophy and atrophy, highlighting its role in muscle dynamics (Cracknell2020Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
The IGFN1 gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In metastatic breast cancer, IGFN1 is frequently mutated compared to early-stage breast cancer, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Verma2018Novel). The gene is also associated with susceptibility to primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma in the Chinese population (Lu2022Recognition; Verma2018Novel). In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), novel splicing isoforms of IGFN1 have been identified, which are influenced by G-quadruplex structures in intron 15, potentially affecting disease pathogenesis and offering targets for therapeutic intervention (Verma2018Novel).

IGFN1 expression is linked to the response to radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer, indicating its potential role in treatment outcomes (Lu2022Recognition). Additionally, a missense mutation in IGFN1, identified as rs3738270, has been noted in the context of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), highlighting its involvement in genetic predispositions to this condition (Chattopadhyay2018Enrichment). Despite these associations, the specific functional role of IGFN1 in these diseases remains to be fully elucidated (Morgan2021The).

## Interactions
IGFN1 interacts with several proteins, primarily within the context of skeletal muscle. It specifically binds to the translation elongation factor eEF1A, with a preference for the eEF1A2 isoform. This interaction is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy, showing colocalization in the cytosol of myoblasts and myotubes (Mansilla2008Translation). IGFN1 also interacts with sarcomeric proteins such as titin, myotilin, and filamin C, suggesting its role in muscle structure and function (Mansilla2008Translation; Baker2010Identification).

Yeast two-hybrid screens and pull-down assays have identified IGFN1 interactions with proteins like MYBPC1, MYOM2, FLNC, ACTA1, TTN, PDLIM3, FAM96B, FHL2, and ZAK (Baker2010Identification). IGFN1 forms complexes with KY and FLNC, proteins associated with the Z-band, indicating its involvement in maintaining sarcomere integrity (Baker2010Identification). Additionally, IGFN1 interacts with the actin nucleating protein COBL, influencing actin remodeling and myoblast fusion (Cracknell2020Proteomic). These interactions highlight IGFN1's role in muscle cell function and structural organization.
