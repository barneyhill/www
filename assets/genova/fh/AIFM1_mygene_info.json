intermembrane space in healthy cells. Induction of apoptosis results in the translocation of this protein to the nucleus where it affects chromosome condensation and fragmentation. In addition, this gene product induces mitochondria to release the apoptogenic proteins cytochrome c and caspase-9. Mutations in this gene cause combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 6 (COXPD6), a severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, as well as Cowchock syndrome, also known as X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-4 (CMTX-4), a disorder resulting in neuropathy, and axonal and motor-sensory defects with deafness and cognitive disability. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 10.
