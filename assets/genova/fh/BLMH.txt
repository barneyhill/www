# BLMH

## Overview
The BLMH gene encodes the enzyme bleomycin hydrolase, a thiol-dependent cytoplasmic aminopeptidase that is part of the papain protease family. This enzyme is characterized by its hexameric structure and broad substrate specificity, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes. Bleomycin hydrolase is involved in the degradation of citrullinated filaggrin monomers in the skin, contributing to the maintenance of skin hydration and protection. It also participates in the central nervous system's processing of amyloid precursor protein, implicating it in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, BLMH is involved in detoxifying homocysteine-thiolactone, a compound with potential proinflammatory and pro-amyloidogenic effects. The gene's expression and activity are significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, where alterations in BLMH have been linked to disease progression and survival outcomes (Riise2019Bleomycin; Witucki2023Depletion; de2008Variation).

## Structure
Bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) is a thiol-dependent cytoplasmic aminopeptidase that belongs to the papain protease family, characterized by conserved active site cysteine, histidine, and asparagine residues (SuszyńskaZajczyk2014Hyperhomocysteinemia). The enzyme functions as a hexamer, with a native molecular mass of approximately 280 kDa, composed of six identical subunits, each with a molecular mass of about 48 kDa (Kamata2009Neutral). The primary structure of BLMH consists of a polypeptide chain of 454 amino acids (Takeda1996Cloning).

The tertiary structure of BLMH is characterized by a papain-like fold, typical of cysteine proteases, which suggests its inclusion in the papain superfamily (Takeda1996Cloning). This structure is crucial for its enzymatic activity, allowing it to exhibit broad substrate specificity. BLMH is known to bind single-stranded DNA with high affinity, although it lacks a DNA-binding motif in its sequence (Takeda1996Cloning).

Post-translational modifications of BLMH may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The enzyme's activity is inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitors like E-64 but not by cystatins, indicating specific regulatory mechanisms (Takeda1996Cloning).

## Function
Bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) is a cysteine protease expressed in various mammalian tissues, with particularly high levels in the skin. In healthy human cells, BLMH is involved in the degradation of citrullinated filaggrin monomers into free amino acids, which are crucial for skin hydration. This process contributes to the formation of natural moisturizing factors, essential for maintaining epidermal hydration, acidification, and protection against UV radiation (Riise2019Bleomycin). BLMH is responsible for the final step in the degradation of pro-filaggrin, and its absence leads to impaired filaggrin processing, resulting in defective corneocyte texture and stiffness (Riise2019Bleomycin).

BLMH also plays a role in the central nervous system, where it is involved in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to amyloid beta (Aβ), implicating it in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (Witucki2023Depletion). In the brain, BLMH is localized in neocortical neurons and dystrophic neurites of senile plaques (Witucki2023Depletion). Additionally, BLMH is involved in the detoxification of homocysteine-thiolactone, a harmful compound that can modify protein lysine residues, leading to impaired proteins with proinflammatory and pro-amyloidogenic properties (Witucki2023Depletion).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BLMH gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD patients, BLMH activity is reduced, which may contribute to the pathology by affecting amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation (SuszyńskaZajczyk2014Hyperhomocysteinemia; Witucki2023Depletion). BLMH depletion in mice leads to increased Aβ levels, impaired autophagy, and neurological deficits, suggesting a protective role in the central nervous system (Witucki2023Depletion). 

Alterations in BLMH expression also affect mTOR signaling and histone demethylase Phf8, which are crucial for cellular homeostasis and are linked to intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders (Witucki2023Depletion). The gene's interaction with hyperhomocysteinemia further modulates brain protein expression, contributing to neurodegeneration (SuszyńskaZajczyk2014Hyperhomocysteinemia). 

In the context of cancer, variations in the BLMH gene have been associated with survival outcomes in testicular germ cell cancer, where certain genotypes correlate with reduced survival and increased risk of disease progression (de2008Variation).

## Interactions
Bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. BLMH is a thiol-dependent cytoplasmic aminopeptidase that interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP), influencing its processing to amyloid beta (Aβ), which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (Witucki2023Deletion; Witucki2023Depletion). BLMH also interacts with the histone demethylase Phf8, affecting mTOR signaling and autophagy pathways, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and are linked to neurodegenerative diseases (Witucki2023Deletion; Witucki2023Depletion).

In the context of Huntington's disease (HD), BLMH is involved in the proteolysis of mutant huntingtin (Htt) protein. It acts as an endopeptidase, cleaving amyloid β peptide and potentially generating toxic fragments of Htt. This interaction is significant in the context of HD pathogenesis, as BLMH co-localizes with Htt in the cytoplasm and endosomes, suggesting a role in Htt cleavage and toxicity (Ratovitski2011Cysteine).

BLMH's interactions with these proteins highlight its involvement in critical cellular pathways and its potential impact on neurodegenerative diseases.
