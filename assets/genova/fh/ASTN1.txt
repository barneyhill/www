# ASTN1

## Overview
Astrotactin 1 (ASTN1) is a gene that encodes the astrotactin 1 protein, a critical component in the process of neuronal migration within the central nervous system. The protein is categorized as a cell adhesion molecule and is integral to the movement of neurons along glial fibers, a process essential for the proper development of the brain's laminar architecture. ASTN1 is characterized by its unique transmembrane topology, featuring two transmembrane helices and a large extracellular domain, which facilitates its role in neuron-glial adhesion. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including endoproteolytic cleavage, which is vital for its function. ASTN1 interacts with other proteins such as ASTN2 and N-cadherin, forming complexes that are crucial for its role in neuronal migration. Mutations or dysregulation of ASTN1 have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in brain development and potential involvement in conditions like autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia (Horn2018Ncadherin; Chang2017Cleave; Wilson2010Astn2).

## Structure
Astrotactin 1 (ASTN1) is a membrane protein involved in neuronal migration, characterized by a unique transmembrane topology. It is a two-transmembrane protein with both the short amino and long carboxyl termini located in the extracellular space (Chang2017Cleave). The primary structure of the largest isoform of human ASTN1 consists of 1,302 amino acids encoded by 23 exons, showing a 98% identity with the mouse Astn1 protein (Chang2017Cleave). 

The secondary structure includes two transmembrane helices (TMHs) and a large C-terminal extracellular domain (Lara2019Murine). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with the extracellular domain containing several domains that may interact with the extracellular matrix (Chang2017Cleave). 

ASTN1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including endoproteolytic cleavage in the second transmembrane helix, resulting in two fragments that remain linked by a disulfide bond (Chang2017Cleave; Lara2019Murine). This cleavage is catalyzed by a signal peptidase (Lara2019Murine). Human ASTN1 has four isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, which may lead to different functional forms of the protein (Chang2017Cleave).

## Function
Astrotactin 1 (ASTN1) is a critical protein involved in glial-guided neuronal migration, a process essential for the proper development of the central nervous system. ASTN1 functions as a cell adhesion molecule, facilitating the movement of neurons along glial fibers, particularly during the formation of the laminar architecture of cortical regions in the mammalian brain (Wilson2010Astn2). It is expressed on the cell surface of migrating neurons, where it acts as a ligand for neuron-glial adhesion, enabling the neurons to adhere to and migrate along glial fibers (Stitt1990Antibodies; Wilson2010Astn2).

ASTN1 interacts with ASTN2, which regulates its surface expression and trafficking, ensuring the proper localization and function of ASTN1 during migration (Wilson2010Astn2). This interaction is crucial for the polarized distribution of ASTN1 on the cell surface, which is necessary for the formation of new adhesion sites between neurons and glial fibers (Wilson2010Astn2).

ASTN1 also forms a complex with N-cadherin (CDH2), which provides a trans ligand for ASTN1, facilitating cell-cell adhesion and migration junction formation (Horn2018Ncadherin). This interaction is essential for the extension of the leading process of migrating neurons, highlighting ASTN1's role in the dynamic regulation of neuronal migration (Horn2018Ncadherin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the ASTN1 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders. ASTN1 is crucial for neuron-glial interactions during central nervous system development, and its dysfunction can lead to significant developmental issues. For instance, ASTN1 knockout mice exhibit cerebellar defects, including a reduced cerebellum size and poor balance, due to impaired cerebellar granule cell migration and abnormal Purkinje cell development (Chang2017Cleave). These findings suggest that disruptions in ASTN1 function could contribute to similar developmental brain disorders in humans.

While specific diseases directly linked to ASTN1 mutations are not detailed, the gene's role in neuronal migration suggests its potential involvement in conditions like autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, as these disorders have been associated with related genes such as ASTN2 (Wilson2010Astn2). The molecular mechanism of ASTN1 involves unique transmembrane topology and intramembrane proteolysis, which are essential for its function in neuronal migration and may be disrupted in disease states (Chang2017Cleave). Understanding ASTN1's role in these processes is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies for related neurological conditions.

## Interactions
Astrotactin 1 (ASTN1) is involved in several key protein interactions that facilitate neuronal migration. ASTN1 interacts with ASTN2, another member of the astrotactin gene family. This interaction is crucial for regulating the surface localization of ASTN1 during glial-guided neuronal migration. ASTN2 forms a complex with ASTN1, influencing its surface expression and contributing to the polarized distribution of ASTN1 on migrating neurons (Wilson2010Astn2). The interaction between ASTN1 and ASTN2 is calcium-independent and does not rely on any single conserved domain of ASTN2 (Wilson2010Astn2).

ASTN1 also interacts with N-cadherin (CDH2), forming a cis and trans asymmetric bridge complex essential for glial-guided neuronal migration. This interaction facilitates neuron-glia attachment and migration, with ASTN1 binding to CDH2 in both cis and trans configurations. The interaction is necessary for the proper migration of granule cell precursors in the cerebellum (Horn2018Ncadherin). Specific extracellular domains of ASTN1, including MACPF, FNIII, and ANX-like, are required for binding to CDH2 (Horn2018Ncadherin). These interactions highlight ASTN1's role in forming complexes that are critical for neuronal migration processes.
