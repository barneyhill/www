# IGF2

## Overview
Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in human growth and development. The IGF2 protein is a member of the insulin-like growth factor family, characterized as a peptide hormone with structural similarities to insulin. It functions primarily as a growth factor, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival through interactions with specific receptors, such as the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and the insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) (Bergman2012InsulinLike; Frasca1999Insulin). IGF2 is crucial during fetal development, where it promotes prenatal growth and regulates hematopoietic stem cells in adulthood (Barroca2017Paternal; Chen2015Role). Dysregulation of IGF2 expression is implicated in various growth disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Kasprzak2019InsulinLike; Livingstone2013IGF2).

## Structure
The insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) protein is a 67 amino acid peptide derived from a 180 amino acid preprohormone, which includes a 24 amino acid signal peptide and an 89 amino acid carboxy-terminal extension that are cleaved post-translationally (O’Dell1998Molecules). The primary structure of IGF2 shares 47% sequence identity with insulin, maintaining a similar three-dimensional structure due to conserved disulfide bridges and residues in the hydrophobic core (O’Dell1998Molecules).

The secondary structure of IGF2 includes α-helices and a small anti-parallel β-sheet. The α-helices are located in the regions of residues 11 to 21, 42 to 49, and 53 to 59, while the β-sheet involves residues 59 to 61 and 25 to 27 (Torres1995Solution). The tertiary structure is characterized by a well-defined global fold, with helices and side-chain positions stabilized by disulfide bridges and a hydrophobic core (Torres1995Solution).

IGF2 does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. The protein contains specific domains similar to proinsulin, including A, B, and C domains, with inter-domain disulfide bonds (O’Dell1998Molecules). IGF2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, and has splice variant isoforms contributing to its functional diversity (O’Dell1998Molecules).

## Function
Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is a critical regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in human cells. It primarily functions by binding to the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), activating key signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK, which are essential for cellular growth and metabolism (Bergman2012InsulinLike). IGF2 is synthesized as a pro-hormone and processed into a 67-amino acid bioactive protein, which is structurally similar to IGF1 and insulin (Bergman2012InsulinLike).

IGF2 is highly expressed during fetal development, playing a significant role in prenatal growth by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (Chen2015Role). It is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during adulthood, where it influences self-renewal and differentiation, maintaining tissue homeostasis and regeneration (Barroca2017Paternal). In the central nervous system, IGF2 contributes to cell survival and growth, with its expression being upregulated by inflammatory mediators (Suh2013Insulinlike).

IGF2 also interacts with the IGF2 receptor (IGF2R), which regulates its availability by capturing and degrading the ligand, thus modulating its biological activity (Bergman2012InsulinLike). This interaction highlights the complex regulatory mechanisms that control IGF2's function in growth and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IGF2 gene are associated with several growth disorders and cancers. Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is linked to a loss of methylation at the 11p15.5 region, leading to reduced paternal IGF2 expression and resulting in growth deficiencies (Forbes2020Disorders; Murrell2008Distinct). Conversely, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) involves a gain of methylation at the imprint control region, causing biallelic activation of IGF2 and leading to overgrowth and increased cancer risk (Murrell2008Distinct; Livingstone2013IGF2).

In cancer, IGF2 overexpression is frequently observed due to loss of imprinting (LOI), contributing to tumorigenesis in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), Wilms' tumor, and others (Kasprzak2019InsulinLike; Livingstone2013IGF2). In CRC, IGF2 LOI is an early event and is associated with increased tumor invasiveness and poor prognosis (Kasprzak2019InsulinLike). IGF2 dysregulation also plays a role in chemoresistance and cancer progression through its interactions with IGF1R and other pathways (Kasprzak2019InsulinLike; Livingstone2013IGF2). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IGF2 in both growth disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily through binding to various receptors. IGF2 binds with high affinity to the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R), a tyrosine kinase receptor, activating downstream signaling pathways such as MAP kinase and PI3 kinase, which are crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Chao2008IGF2:; Sélénou2022IGF2:). IGF2 also interacts with the insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A), where it binds with high affinity, leading to mitogenic effects rather than metabolic effects typically associated with insulin binding (Frasca1999Insulin).

IGF2 can bind to the IGF2 receptor (IGF2R), which facilitates its clearance through lysosomal degradation, acting as a tumor suppressor (Sélénou2022IGF2:). In the bloodstream, IGF2 is mostly bound in a ternary complex with the acid-labile subunit (ALS) and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP)-3 and -5, which regulate its bioavailability and activity (Sélénou2022IGF2:). These interactions highlight IGF2's role in growth regulation and its potential contribution to oncogenesis (Chao2008IGF2:).
