# PFN3

## Overview
Profilin 3 (PFN3) is a gene that encodes a testis-specific isoform of the profilin family of proteins, which are known for their role in actin-binding and cytoskeletal regulation. The protein encoded by PFN3, also known as profilin 3, is primarily involved in the process of spermiogenesis, contributing to the development and maturation of spermatozoa. Unlike other profilins, PFN3 exhibits a lower affinity for actin due to specific amino acid differences, yet it retains the ability to bind phosphoinositides and interact with proteins such as mDia3 and β-actin. This protein is crucial for the structural organization of the acroplaxome-manchette complex, which is essential for acrosome formation and spermatid head shaping. The absence or dysfunction of PFN3 can lead to male subfertility and conditions such as type II globozoospermia, underscoring its importance in male reproductive health (Behnen2009Testisexpressed; Umer2021Loss). Additionally, PFN3 has been implicated in cancer research, particularly in the context of gliomas, where its dysregulation may influence tumor biology (Gul2021Profilin).

## Structure
Profilin 3 (PFN3) is a testis-specific isoform of the profilin family, which are small actin-binding proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation. The primary structure of PFN3 includes a sequence of amino acids that allows it to interact with actin and other ligands, although it has a lower affinity for actin compared to other profilins like PFN1 due to conservative amino acid differences (Murk2021Profilin). PFN3 retains a conserved actin-binding site but lacks key residues such as His133 and Phe139, which are crucial for high-affinity binding to polyproline in PFN1 (Murk2021Profilin).

The secondary structure of PFN3 is characterized by a central 7-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and two alpha helices, similar to other profilins (Behnen2009Testisexpressed). This structural configuration contributes to its tertiary structure, which is crucial for its functional interactions. PFN3's phospholipid binding site is structurally comparable to that of PFN1 and PFN2a, allowing it to bind phosphoinositides (Murk2021Profilin).

PFN3 does not form quaternary structures involving multiple subunits, as it primarily functions as a monomer. It interacts with proteins such as mDia3 and β-actin, although it does not bind to VASP (Behnen2009Testisexpressed). PFN3's role in spermatid development is linked to its localization in the acroplaxome-manchette complex, which is crucial for acrosome formation and spermatid head shaping (Behnen2009Testisexpressed).

## Function
Profilin 3 (PFN3) is a testis-specific protein that plays a crucial role in spermiogenesis, particularly in the development of spermatozoa. It is involved in several key processes, including acrosome biogenesis, autophagy, manchette development, and mitochondrial organization. PFN3 is localized in the acroplaxome-manchette complex of developing spermatozoa, where it contributes to vesicle transport necessary for acrosome formation and is also found in the Golgi complex and proacrosomal vesicles (Umer2021Loss). 

PFN3 interacts with actin and is involved in actin dynamics, which is essential for cellular processes such as cell motility and structure. It binds to β-actin and phosphoinositides, indicating its role in actin polymerization and dynamics regulation (Behnen2009Testisexpressed). PFN3's interaction with mDia3 and its presence in the acroplaxome and manchette suggest its involvement in the structural organization and dynamics of these complexes in spermatids (Behnen2009Testisexpressed). 

The absence of PFN3 leads to male subfertility, characterized by impaired spermiogenesis, reduced sperm count and viability, and type II globozoospermia, highlighting its importance in male fertility (Umer2021Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PFN3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of male fertility, PFN3 plays a crucial role in spermiogenesis. Its deficiency leads to male subfertility characterized by reduced sperm count and vitality, as well as type II globozoospermia. This condition is marked by impaired acrosome biogenesis, abnormal manchette development, and mitochondrial disorganization, resulting in malformed sperm with reduced motility (Umer2021Loss). The absence of PFN3 disrupts autophagy, a process essential for acrosome development, by affecting the regulation of autophagy-related proteins such as Trim27, AMPK, and mTOR (Umer2021Loss).

In cancer research, PFN3 has been studied for its potential role in brain tumors. Dysregulation of PFN3 expression has been observed in glioma tissues, with significant variability in its transcriptional expression. This dysregulation may impact tumor biology, possibly through its involvement in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial in cancer development (Gul2021Profilin). The study of PFN3 in gliomas suggests that its genetic variability and expression patterns could have clinical significance, although further research is needed to fully understand its role in tumorigenesis (Gul2021Profilin).

## Interactions
Profilin 3 (PFN3) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. PFN3 interacts with actin monomers, which is a common feature of profilins, influencing actin polymerization dynamics (Behnen2009Testisexpressed). It also binds to mDia3, a member of the formin family, although this interaction is weaker compared to other profilins like PFN2a (Behnen2009Testisexpressed). PFN3 has been shown to interact with DIAPH3, another formin family member, but does not bind to VASP, a proline-rich protein (Behnen2009Testisexpressed).

PFN3 is part of a complex with ARPM1 in the sperm nucleus, which is important for spermatid head shaping. This complex is destabilized in PFN3-deficient mice, leading to the absence of ARPM1 in the nuclear fraction of sperm (Umer2021Loss). PFN3 also interacts with TRIM27, a protein involved in the regulation of autophagy, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Umer2021Loss). These interactions highlight PFN3's role in actin dynamics, protein complex stability, and autophagic processes, which are essential for proper spermiogenesis and male fertility.
