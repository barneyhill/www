# VSIG10

## Overview
VSIG10 is a gene that encodes the protein V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 10, which is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains. This protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, including both normal and cancerous tissues. The protein's extracellular domain comprises four Ig-like C2-type domains, which are integral to its function in immune regulation (Zhou2022VSet). VSIG10 is implicated in modulating immune responses, particularly through its expression in dendritic cell subsets, where it may play a role in dampening antitumor responses (Zhou2022VSet). The potential of VSIG10 as an immune checkpoint inhibitor is underscored by its ability to suppress CD4+ T-cell activation and cytokine production, suggesting its relevance in cancer immunotherapy (Zhou2022VSet). Further research is warranted to elucidate its precise mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target (Zhou2022VSet).

## Structure
VSIG10 is a protein encoded by the VSIG10 gene, characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains. The primary structure of human VSIG10 includes 540 amino acids, while the mouse version contains 558 amino acids, indicating a high degree of conservation between species (Zhou2022VSet). The extracellular domain (ECD) of VSIG10 contains four Ig-like C2-type domains, which are crucial for its function and are shared with other members of the VSIG family (Zhou2022VSet). 

The secondary and tertiary structures of VSIG10 have not been experimentally resolved through methods like X-ray crystallography; instead, they are predicted computationally (Zhou2022VSet). The protein also contains nine N-glycosylation sites, which are important for protein folding and stability. Notably, an N-glycosylation site at position 100 was lost in humans after divergence from chimpanzees, potentially affecting the protein's structure and function (KIM2015Loss).

VSIG10 is expressed in various tissues, including normal and cancer epithelial cells, and is predicted to be expressed by dendritic cell subsets, suggesting its involvement in immune regulation (Zhou2022VSet). Information on specific splice variant isoforms or quaternary structure is not provided in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
VSIG10 is a gene that encodes a protein with four Ig-like C2-type domains in its extracellular domain. It is highly expressed on both normal and cancer epithelial cells, with notable overexpression in adenocarcinoma. However, this overexpression is not observed in melanoma, prostate, breast, or pancreatic cancer (Zhou2022VSet). The gene's expression is also predicted in dendritic cell subsets in humans and mice, which play a role in dampening antitumor responses, suggesting its involvement in immune regulation (Zhou2022VSet).

A US patent indicates that a recombinant VSIG10-Fc fusion protein can suppress CD4+ T-cell activation and cytokine production, highlighting its potential as an immune checkpoint inhibitor (Zhou2022VSet). This suggests that alterations in VSIG10 expression or function could impact immune responses, potentially contributing to cancer progression or immune-related disorders. The development of anti-VSIG10 antibodies is proposed as a promising approach for dendritic cell-targeting immune checkpoint blockade cancer immunotherapy (Zhou2022VSet).

Further research is needed to explore VSIG10 as a potential biomarker or immune checkpoint, as the mechanisms by which it influences immune responses and its role in disease conditions are not fully understood (Zhou2022VSet).
