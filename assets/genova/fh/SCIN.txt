# SCIN

## Overview
The SCIN gene encodes scinderin, a calcium-regulated actin-severing and nucleating protein that is part of the gelsolin superfamily. Scinderin plays a pivotal role in cytoskeletal dynamics by modulating actin filament assembly and disassembly, which is crucial for maintaining cell structure and facilitating cellular processes such as movement and secretion (Trifaró2019Scinderin; Lin2019Aberrant). The protein's activity is regulated by calcium and phospholipid interactions, with specific domains responsible for its actin-binding and severing functions (Rodriguez1990Chromaffin; Trifaró2019Scinderin). Scinderin is involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and secretion, and has been implicated in cancer progression and drug resistance due to its role in cytoskeletal reorganization and apoptosis regulation (Lin2019Aberrant; Wang2022Scinderin). The SCIN gene's expression and its protein product's interactions are of significant interest in understanding tumorigenesis and potential therapeutic targets (Zhai2024Scinderin).

## Structure
Scinderin (SCIN) is an actin-severing and nucleating protein with a complex molecular structure. It consists of several domains responsible for its various activities, including actin-severing and nucleating functions. The actin-severing activity is primarily located in the NH2-terminal half, specifically in domains 1 and 2, while the actin nucleating activity is found in domain 5 (Trifaró2019Scinderin). Scinderin contains gelsolin-like domains, which are crucial for its actin-binding and severing functions (Rodriguez1990Chromaffin).

The protein has two PIP2-binding sites in domains 1 and 2, which inhibit its actin-severing activity (Trifaró2019Scinderin). Scinderin also has two calcium-binding sites that regulate its activity, interacting with actin in a calcium-dependent manner (Rodriguez1990Chromaffin). The SCIN gene is known to produce multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Trifaró2019Scinderin).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate scinderin's activity, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context (Rodríguez1992Ca2+). The protein's tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the context, but its domain organization suggests a complex folding pattern that facilitates its interaction with actin filaments.

## Function
Scinderin (SCIN) is a calcium-regulated actin depolymerizing protein that plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal dynamics. It is part of the gelsolin superfamily, which is involved in modulating dynamic actin assembly, essential for maintaining cell structure and facilitating movement (Lin2019Aberrant). SCIN functions by severing actin filaments and binding actin monomers, which is vital for the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. This activity is particularly important in secretory cells, where SCIN facilitates vesicle trafficking and secretion processes by modulating actin networks (Lin2019Aberrant).

In healthy human cells, SCIN is involved in the regulation of secretion processes, as it was initially identified in the adrenal medulla, a region known for its secretory activity (Lin2019Aberrant). SCIN also plays a role in inhibiting mitochondrial apoptosis by closing voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), which has been observed in cisplatin-resistant human bladder cancer cell lines overexpressing SCIN (Lin2019Aberrant). This suggests that SCIN's actin-severing function is not only crucial for cellular structure and movement but also for regulating apoptosis and potentially contributing to drug resistance mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
The SCIN gene, also known as Scinderin, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In gliomas, SCIN is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, correlating with higher tumor grades and reduced overall survival. Its expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9, which promote tumor progression and invasiveness (Wang2022Scinderin). In colorectal cancer, SCIN is significantly upregulated in patients with synchronous liver metastasis, correlating with poor overall and disease-free survival. Knockdown studies in colorectal cancer cell lines have shown that reducing SCIN expression leads to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Lin2019Aberrant).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), SCIN overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and is considered an independent prognostic factor. It is associated with immune cell infiltration and affects cancer-related pathways, including STAT3 and NF-kB signaling (Zhai2024Scinderin). Conversely, in some studies, SCIN downregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma has been associated with shorter overall and disease-free survival, indicating its complex role in cancer progression (Zhou2020Scinderin). These findings suggest that SCIN's expression and interactions significantly impact tumorigenesis and cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
Scinderin (SCIN) is an actin-severing and nucleating protein that interacts with actin filaments and phospholipids, playing a crucial role in cytoskeletal dynamics. It binds actin at multiple sites, including domains S1, S2, and a debated third site in domain S5, which is essential for its severing and nucleating activities (Trifaró2019Scinderin). Scinderin's interaction with actin is calcium-dependent, with two calcium-binding sites regulating its activity (Trifaró2019Scinderin).

Scinderin also interacts with phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2). These interactions are modulated by calcium and pH levels, influencing scinderin's binding affinity and distribution within cells (Rodríguez1992Ca2+). The binding of PIP2 involves sequences homologous to those in gelsolin, although scinderin has a unique sequence variation that might affect this interaction (Trifaró2019Scinderin).

Scinderin's interaction with phospholipids is competitive with G-actin, indicating shared binding domains (Rodríguez1992Ca2+). Additionally, scinderin interacts with mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), suggesting a role in drug resistance and cellular processes related to cancer (Trifaró2019Scinderin). These interactions highlight scinderin's involvement in various cellular processes, including exocytosis and cell signaling.
