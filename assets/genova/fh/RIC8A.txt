# RIC8A

## Overview
RIC8A is a gene that encodes the RIC8 guanine nucleotide exchange factor A, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways. The protein functions primarily as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and chaperone for G protein α-subunits (Gα), facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is crucial for G protein activation (Srivastava2020Ric‐8A). Structurally, RIC8A is characterized by an armadillo (ARM) and HEAT repeat domain architecture, forming a right-handed superhelix essential for its interaction with Gα subunits (Srivastava2019Structural). This interaction is vital for the proper folding and membrane association of Gα subunits, impacting various physiological processes such as cell division and neural development (Srivastava2019Structural). RIC8A's involvement in disease contexts, including breast cancer and neurological disorders, underscores its clinical significance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Muggerud2009Data; Cogram2022The).

## Structure
The RIC8A protein, also known as RIC8 guanine nucleotide exchange factor A, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by an armadillo (ARM) and HEAT repeat domain architecture. The protein consists of a core armadillo-like domain formed by a series of helical repeats, including both canonical ARM motifs and noncanonical HEAT motifs, which together create a right-handed superhelix (Srivastava2020Ric‐8A; Srivastava2019Structural). This superhelical structure is crucial for its function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and chaperone for G protein α-subunits (Gα) (Zeng2019Structure).

The C-terminal tail of RIC8A, particularly residues 427-492, plays a significant role in stabilizing the protein and enhancing its GEF activity. This region interacts with the armadillo core and is involved in organizing the GTP-binding site of Gα (Srivastava2020Ric‐8A; Srivastava2019Structural). Phosphorylation at specific residues, such as S435 and T440, by Casein Kinase II, enhances the protein's activity, indicating the importance of post-translational modifications in its function (McClelland2020Structure; Srivastava2020Ric‐8A).

RIC8A does not form a quaternary structure with Gα in the traditional sense but interacts extensively with Gα subunits, stabilizing them in a nucleotide-free state and facilitating GDP release (McClelland2020Structure). The protein's structure and interactions are distinct from those of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), despite some mechanistic similarities in activating Gα subunits (Zeng2019Structure).

## Function
RIC8A, also known as RIC8 guanine nucleotide exchange factor A, functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and chaperone for G protein α-subunits (Gα) in healthy human cells. It plays a critical role in G protein signaling by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Gα subunits, which is essential for their activation. This process involves Ric8A binding to monomeric Gα subunits, promoting nucleotide release from GαGDP, and forming a stable intermediate complex with nucleotide-free Gα. This interaction allows GTP to bind to Gα, disrupting the complex and liberating GαGTP, which underlies Ric8A's GEF activity (Srivastava2020Ric‐8A).

Ric8A also acts as a chaperone, aiding in the proper folding and membrane association of newly synthesized Gα subunits. In the absence of Ric8A, Gα subunits fail to associate with membranes and are rapidly degraded. Ric8A is required for the expression of properly folded Gα subunits in cell-free systems and elevates Gα subunit expression when coexpressed in cells (Srivastava2020Ric‐8A). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates signal transduction pathways that influence cellular and organismal physiology, including processes like cell division and neural development (Srivastava2019Structural).

## Clinical Significance
RIC8A has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions, although direct mutations in the gene are not commonly reported. In breast cancer, RIC8A is considered a potential tumor suppressor gene. Studies have shown that low expression of RIC8A is associated with aggressive breast cancer features, hormone receptor negativity, and TP53 mutations. The chromosomal region containing RIC8A is frequently deleted in breast cancer, correlating with recurrence and distant metastases, suggesting that its inactivation may contribute to breast cancer pathogenesis (Muggerud2009Data).

In the context of liver fibrosis, RIC8A expression is elevated in response to Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) administration, indicating its involvement in the signaling pathways contributing to liver disease. Pomegranate juice supplementation has been shown to reduce RIC8A expression, suggesting potential therapeutic modulation (Husain2021Proteomic).

RIC8A also plays a role in neurological disorders. In Fragile X Syndrome, inhibiting the interaction between RIC8A and neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1) has been shown to improve behavioral phenotypes in mouse models, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cogram2022The).

## Interactions
RIC8A, also known as synembryn-A, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that interacts with various G protein alpha subunits (Gα), including Gαi, Gαq, and Gαo. It facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on these subunits, forming a stable nucleotide-free complex that dissociates upon GTP binding, thereby activating the Gα proteins (Tall2003Mammalian). Ric-8A interacts preferentially with the GDP-bound or nucleotide-free forms of Gα proteins, stabilizing a nucleotide-free conformation that allows GTP binding and activation (Tall2003Mammalian).

Ric-8A also acts as a chaperone, assisting in the proper folding and membrane association of Gα subunits. In the absence of Ric-8A, newly synthesized Gα subunits fail to associate with membranes and are rapidly degraded (Srivastava2020Ric‐8A). The interaction of Ric-8A with Gα involves a broad surface of Gα, including the C-terminus/α5-helix, αN-β1 loop, switch I, and switch II regions (Srivastava2020Ric‐8A).

Ric-8A can also interact with the RGS14:Gαi1-GDP complex, inducing its dissociation and facilitating nucleotide exchange on Gαi1. This interaction is competitive, as Ric-8A and RGS14 bind to both distinct and overlapping sites on Gαi1 (Vellano2011Activation).
