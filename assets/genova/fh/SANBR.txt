# SANBR

## Overview
The SANBR gene encodes the SANT and BTB domain regulator of CSR, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells. This protein is characterized by the presence of two key domains: the SANT domain, which is associated with DNA binding, and the BTB domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and dimerization. The BTB domain facilitates the interaction of SANBR with co-repressors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), implicating it in transcriptional regulation. SANBR functions as a negative regulator of CSR, thereby preventing excessive DNA damage that could lead to autoimmunity and genomic instability. Its expression is modulated in response to specific immune stimuli, underscoring its role in fine-tuning immune responses (Zheng2021The).

## Structure
The SANBR protein, encoded by the NM_027860 mRNA, is a well-conserved protein expressed across various organisms, including invertebrates, vertebrates, and single-cell organisms. The full-length SANBR protein consists of 718 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 82 kD (Zheng2021The). Structurally, SANBR contains two significant domains: a SANT domain and a BTB domain. The SANT domain is located between amino acids 21-59, while the BTB domain spans amino acids 147-255. The BTB domain overlaps with a conserved domain of unknown function, which extends from amino acids 147-449 (Zheng2021The).

The BTB domain is crucial for the dimerization of SANBR, as demonstrated by dimerization assays in 293T cells, and is also involved in the inhibition of class switch recombination (CSR). Deletion mutants lacking the BTB domain only partially suppress CSR, indicating its importance in the negative regulation of CSR. In contrast, the SANT domain is not required for dimerization and is largely dispensable for CSR inhibition, though it may have roles in chromatin remodeling (Zheng2021The). The BTB domain also interacts with co-repressors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and SMRT, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Zheng2021The).

## Function
The SANBR gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells, a process essential for antibody diversity and effective immune responses. SANBR contains two key domains: the SANT domain, which is associated with DNA binding, and the BTB domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and dimerization (Zheng2021The). The BTB domain of SANBR mediates its interaction with co-repressors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and SMRT, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation by recruiting these co-repressors to transcriptional targets, thereby downregulating gene expression (Zheng2021The).

In healthy cells, SANBR functions as a negative regulator of CSR, preventing excessive activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated DNA damage, which could otherwise lead to autoimmunity, genomic instability, and lymphomagenesis (Zheng2021The). The protein's expression is upregulated in response to specific stimuli, such as anti-CD40 plus IL4 or LPS plus IL4, indicating its role in fine-tuning immune responses (Zheng2021The). While the SANT domain is not necessary for CSR inhibition, it may be involved in other functions like chromatin remodeling (Zheng2021The). SANBR's activity is primarily observed in B cells, where it contributes to immune cell development and function.

## Interactions
The SANBR protein, identified as a negative regulator of class switch recombination (CSR), contains a BTB domain that mediates dimerization and interacts with co-repressor proteins. The BTB domain of SANBR has been shown to dimerize in vitro, as demonstrated by size-exclusion chromatography and crosslinking experiments. This domain also binds to co-repressors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), similar to other BTB domain-containing proteins like PLZF. These interactions suggest that SANBR may function as a transcriptional regulator by recruiting co-repressors to transcriptional targets, potentially downregulating gene expression (Zheng2021The).

The BTB domain is crucial for the dimerization of SANBR in vivo, as demonstrated by dimerization assays in 293T cells. The ∆BTB mutant showed reduced binding to GFP-SANBR, indicating that the BTB domain mediates dimerization. In contrast, the ∆SANT mutant retained its ability to bind GFP-SANBR, suggesting that the SANT domain is not required for dimerization (Zheng2021The). Although the SANT domain of SANBR is not required for dimerization or inhibition of CSR, it may play a role in other functions, possibly involving chromatin remodeling (Zheng2021The).
