# SART1

## Overview
SART1 is a gene that encodes the spliceosome-associated protein known as spliceosome-associated factor 1, recruiter of U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. This protein is integral to the process of pre-mRNA splicing, where it facilitates the assembly of the spliceosome by recruiting the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex, a critical step in the removal of introns from pre-mRNA (Yokoyama2023SART1; Yokoyama2021SART1). Beyond its role in RNA splicing, the SART1 protein is also involved in mitotic progression, acting as a microtubule-associated protein that localizes to spindle poles during cell division, thereby contributing to spindle assembly and centrosome organization (Yokoyama2023SART1). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as centrosomal proteins and transcription factors, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and antiviral defense mechanisms (Song2010The; Teng2021Novel). Mutations or dysregulation of the SART1 gene have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Allen2012A; Henson2020A).

## Structure
The SART1 protein is a component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex, playing a crucial role in RNA splicing. It is a 110 kDa protein with distinct domains essential for its function in the spliceosome complex (Schimmel2010Positively). The primary structure of SART1 includes several lysine residues that are potential sites for post-translational modifications, specifically sumoylation. These lysine residues, particularly Lys 94 and Lys 141, are part of the sumoylation consensus motif ψKxE/D and are preferentially conjugated to SUMO-2 monomers and multimers (Schimmel2010Positively).

The presence of positively charged amino acids flanking these sumoylation sites enhances the efficiency of sumoylation, indicating that the surrounding amino acid composition plays a significant role in the protein's post-translational modification (Schimmel2010Positively). The study of SART1 also suggests that its molecular structure, including the secondary or tertiary structures, may influence the accessibility of these lysine residues to the sumoylation machinery (Schimmel2010Positively).

SART1 may exist in different isoforms due to splice variants, which can affect its role in splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Schimmel2010Positively).

## Function
The SART1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing and mitotic progression in human cells. SART1 is involved in the assembly of the spliceosome, specifically by recruiting the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex to the spliceosome, which is essential for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA (Yokoyama2023SART1; Yokoyama2021SART1). This function is critical for proper gene expression regulation and impacts various cellular processes.

In addition to its role in splicing, SART1 is a mitotic-specific microtubule-associated protein that localizes to spindle poles during mitosis, forming a structure known as the SART1 cap. This localization is crucial for spindle assembly and centrosome organization, as SART1 interacts with centrosomal proteins like Cep192 and Ninein, promoting spindle pole assembly and microtubule dynamics (Yokoyama2023SART1; Yokoyama2021SART1). The protein's interaction with microtubules is regulated by importins and RanGTP, highlighting its role in mitotic progression (Yokoyama2023SART1).

SART1 is essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division, and its knockout in mice is embryonically lethal, underscoring its vital role in organismal development (Yokoyama2023SART1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SART1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and developmental disorders. In colorectal cancer, SART1 has been identified as a determinant of drug resistance, specifically to chemotherapy drugs such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and SN38. Silencing SART1 in colorectal cancer cells enhances chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome drug resistance (Allen2012A).

In zebrafish, mutations in the sart1 gene result in developmental defects in the central nervous system, affecting the brain and eye. These mutations lead to decreased expression of vision-related genes and are associated with retinal dystrophies, such as cone-rod dystrophy and achromatopsia. The sart1 mutations also cause alternative splicing of key apoptotic genes, resulting in increased cell death, particularly in the eye and brain (Henson2020A).

SART1 is also involved in mitotic progression and centrosome biogenesis. Downregulation of SART1 in human cells leads to spindle assembly defects and reduced microtubule dynamics, which are critical for proper cell division. This suggests that SART1 overexpression in some cancer cells may contribute to tumorigenesis, making it a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target (Yokoyama2023SART1).

## Interactions
SART1 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the spliceosome complex. It is a component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex, playing a crucial role in mRNA splicing. SART1 interacts with the Usp4 deubiquitinating enzyme, forming the Usp4-Sart3 complex, which is essential for the deubiquitination of Prp3, a spliceosomal protein. This interaction is mediated by the HAT7 domain of SART3 and is necessary for the proper functioning of the spliceosome, including the reannealing of U4 and U6 snRNPs (Song2010The).

SART1 also interacts with transcription factors to regulate gene expression. It associates with the promoter region of the HNF4a gene, specifically the proximal P1 promoter, to modulate its expression. This interaction affects the transcriptional regulation of the HBV core promoter, highlighting SART1's role in antiviral defense mechanisms (Teng2021Novel).

In the context of viral infections, SART1 has been shown to influence the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and alternative splicing of specific mRNA isoforms, impacting the replication of viruses such as hepatitis B and C (Lin2015The).
