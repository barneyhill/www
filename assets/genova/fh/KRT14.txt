# KRT14

## Overview
The KRT14 gene encodes keratin 14, a type I intermediate filament protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells, particularly within the basal layer of the epidermis. Keratin 14 forms heterodimers with keratin 5, a type II keratin, to create a resilient cytoskeletal network essential for maintaining the mechanical stability of keratinocytes and the overall epidermal architecture (Guo2019Keratin). This protein is involved in critical cellular processes, including cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, through its interactions with desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, respectively (SÜMER2019Keratin). Mutations in the KRT14 gene are associated with several skin disorders, most notably epidermolysis bullosa simplex, which is characterized by skin fragility and blistering (Chan1994A). The gene's significance extends to its role in regulating epidermal homeostasis and barrier function, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Guo2019Keratin).

## Structure
Keratin 14 (KRT14) is a type I intermediate filament protein characterized by a central α-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. The primary structure of KRT14 includes specific amino acids such as glutamate, leucine, alanine, and glutamine, which are more abundant in the rod domain, while serine and glycine are prevalent in the head and tail domains (Strnad2011Unique). The secondary structure is defined by coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate the formation of heterodimers with keratin 5, a type II keratin, contributing to the quaternary structure of the protein (Ho2022Update).

KRT14 is involved in forming intermediate filaments that provide structural support to basal keratinocytes in the epidermis. The protein's tertiary structure involves filament assembly, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of the epidermis (Guo2019Keratin). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, play a role in the regulation of KRT14's function and interactions (Guo2019Keratin). Specific cysteine residues, like C373, are important for disulfide bonding, influencing the organization of keratin intermediate filaments and interactions with proteins such as 14-3-3σ and YAP1 (Guo2019Keratin).

## Function
Keratin 14 (KRT14) is a type I intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells, particularly in the basal layer of the epidermis. It forms heterodimers with keratin 5 (K5), creating a robust cytoskeletal network that provides mechanical resilience to keratinocytes, enabling them to withstand physical stress (Rugg1994A; Guo2019Keratin). This network is essential for the correct assembly of other keratins, such as K1 and K10, as cells differentiate, ensuring the structural stability of the epidermis (Rugg1994A).

KRT14 is involved in cell-cell and cell-basal lamina attachments through desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, respectively, which are critical for maintaining epidermal cohesion and integrity (SÜMER2019Keratin). The protein also plays a role in regulating epidermal homeostasis and barrier function through interactions with 14-3-3σ and YAP1, influencing cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis (Guo2019Keratin). The presence of KRT14 affects the nuclear retention of YAP, a key effector in mechanosensing and mechanotransduction, thereby impacting keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation (Guo2019Keratin). The absence of KRT14 leads to severe skin disorders, such as epidermolysis bullosa simplex, characterized by skin fragility and blistering (Chan1994A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT14 gene are primarily associated with epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a genetic skin disorder characterized by skin fragility and blistering. EBS is subdivided into several subtypes, with Dowling-Meara (EBS-DM) being the most severe. Mutations in KRT14, particularly in the helix boundary motifs and the helix initiation motif, are linked to EBS-DM, which involves severe generalized blistering (Bolling2011Mutations; Müller2006Novel). The KRT14 gene mutations often occur at mutational hotspots, such as the CpG-rich codon p.Arg125, which is highly mutable and frequently associated with EBS-DM (García2011Two; Bolling2011Mutations).

In addition to EBS, KRT14 mutations can lead to other conditions like epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (Müller2006Novel). The clinical manifestations of KRT14 mutations vary, ranging from severe blistering to milder forms with localized blistering, depending on the specific mutation and its location within the gene (Müller2006Novel). Some cases of EBS are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, where homozygous mutations result in the absence of functional K14 protein, leading to severe blistering (Chan1994A). Genetic heterogeneity is also noted, as not all EBS cases are linked to KRT14 mutations, indicating the involvement of other genes (Bolling2011Mutations).

## Interactions
Keratin 14 (KRT14) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the epidermis. KRT14 forms heterodimers with keratin 5 (KRT5) in the basal layer of the epidermis, providing structural support (SÜMER2019Keratin). It interacts with receptor-interacting protein kinase 4 (RIPK4), a key regulator of keratinocyte differentiation. This interaction occurs through the N-terminal kinase domain of RIPK4, although the kinase activity is not required for the interaction (SÜMER2019Keratin). KRT14 and RIPK4 colocalize in cells, particularly around the nucleus, but RIPK4 does not affect the formation of KRT14/KRT5 heterodimers (SÜMER2019Keratin).

KRT14 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which are major partners in regulating epidermal homeostasis and barrier function. This interaction is important for the proper localization and function of YAP1, a transcriptional effector involved in mechanosensing and mechanotransduction (Guo2019Keratin). The interaction with 14-3-3σ is reduced in Krt14C373A mutant mice, leading to altered keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation (Guo2019Keratin). Additionally, KRT14 interacts with vimentin, which is necessary for epithelial cell migration (VelezdelValle2016Epithelial).
