# GPR88

## Overview
GPR88 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 88, a member of the class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane helical structure and is predominantly expressed in the striatum, a region of the brain involved in motor and cognitive functions. Unlike many other GPCRs, GPR88 lacks certain conserved motifs, which suggests unique signaling mechanisms (Chen2022Activation). The protein plays a significant role in modulating neurotransmission, particularly in dopaminergic and glutamatergic pathways, and is involved in sensory processing, motor coordination, and risk-taking behaviors (Laboute2020The; Ehrlich2017Mapping). GPR88's interactions with various opioid and other GPCRs highlight its potential impact on neurological functions and its relevance as a target for neuropsychiatric disorders (Laboute2020The). Mutations in the GPR88 gene have been associated with developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, underscoring its importance in cognitive and motor functions (Yang2020Bioinformatics; Alkufri2016Deleterious).

## Structure
The GPR88 protein is a member of the class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7TM) helical structure. Unlike other rhodopsin family GPCRs, GPR88 lacks certain conserved motifs, such as the cysteines in the extracellular loops and the rotamer toggle switch W, as well as the P 5.50 -I/L 3.40 -F 6.44 motif. Instead, it features a Q 5.50 -L 3.40 -F motif, which is involved in receptor activation (Chen2022Activation). The Q204 5.50 residue forms a hydrogen bond with L128, contributing to signaling efficacy. The N 7.49 P 7.50 xxY 7.53 motif in TM7 is conserved among class A GPCRs and forms a unique polar network involving Y336 7.53 and H131 (Chen2022Activation).

The tertiary structure of GPR88 includes a distinct hydrogen-bonding network, with H131 linked to Q204 5.50, which is not commonly found in other GPCRs (Chen2022Activation). The intracellular side of the N 7.49 P 7.50 xxY 7.53 motif interacts with R138 and C351 G.H5.23 of Gi1, indicating a unique interaction interface (Chen2022Activation). The orthosteric pocket of GPR88 is hydrophobic, accommodating the lipophilic chain of the synthetic agonist 2-PCCA (Chen2022Activation). The protein's structure also suggests a potential for unique signaling mechanisms due to its non-conserved micro-switches in the transmembrane core (Chen2022Activation). However, specific details on the quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
GPR88 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) predominantly expressed in the striatum, with significant roles in modulating neurotransmission and sensory processing. It is involved in the regulation of dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling pathways, influencing neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (Laboute2020The; Ehrlich2017Mapping). GPR88 modulates the signaling of various GPCRs by inhibiting the recruitment of b-arrestins, sequestering them in intracellular compartments, which affects GPCR activity in a non-selective manner (Laboute2020The). This receptor is highly localized in neuronal compartments, including primary cilia, which may impact neuronal cell fate and migration (Ehrlich2017Mapping).

In terms of organismal outcomes, GPR88 plays a crucial role in sensory processing, motor coordination, and risk-taking behaviors. Mice lacking GPR88 exhibit delayed behavioral responses in sensory processing tasks and altered responses to dopamine receptor activation, indicating its importance in sensory gating and dopaminoceptive neuronal populations (Laboute2020The; Ehrlich2017Mapping). The receptor's activity is also linked to the regulation of striatal function and is considered a potential target for neuropsychiatric disorders (Ehrlich2017Mapping).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPR88 gene have been linked to several neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders. A homozygous deleterious mutation, p.C291X, in the GPR88 gene is associated with a familial developmental disorder characterized by chorea, speech delay, and learning disabilities. This mutation was identified in four sisters from a consanguineous family and was absent in a large cohort of controls, indicating its potential pathogenic role (Alkufri2016Deleterious). The clinical presentation includes purposeless choreiform movements and severe learning difficulties, with some patients showing psychomotor delay from infancy (Alkufri2016Deleterious).

GPR88 is also implicated in intellectual disability and is involved in G-protein coupled activity and multicellular organism development. Its deficiency in humans is theorized to manifest as developmental delay with pronounced speech acquisition impairment, learning disabilities, and hyperkinetic movement disorder at 8-9 years of age (Yang2020Bioinformatics). In knockout mice, the absence of GPR88 leads to behavioral abnormalities such as locomotor hyperactivity, motor coordination deficits, and impaired learning, which are relevant to conditions like schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders (Meirsman2017GPR88; Meirsman2016Mice). These findings highlight the gene's role in movement control and cognitive functions.

## Interactions
GPR88, a G protein-coupled receptor, is known to interact with various opioid receptors, including delta (dOR), kappa (kOR), and mu (mOR) opioid receptors. These interactions are characterized by close physical proximity and potential hetero-oligomerization, as demonstrated by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays. GPR88 modulates the signaling of these receptors by inhibiting both G protein and β-arrestin-dependent pathways. For instance, GPR88 expression reduces SNC80-induced dOR inhibition of cAMP accumulation and β-arrestin2 recruitment, indicating its role in modulating receptor signaling and trafficking (Laboute2020The).

GPR88 also interacts with other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in the striatum, such as muscarinic (M1, M4), dopaminergic (D2), and adenosine (A2A) receptors. It forms potential hetero-oligomers with these receptors, affecting their signaling pathways by dampening G protein-mediated signaling and β-arrestin recruitment (Laboute2020The). The interaction of GPR88 with the Gi1 protein involves specific transmembrane regions and intracellular loops, forming a unique signaling complex that differs from other GPCR-Gi/o complexes (Chen2022Activation). These interactions highlight GPR88's role in modulating neurotransmission and its potential impact on neurological functions.
