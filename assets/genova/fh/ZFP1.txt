# ZFP1

## Overview
ZFP1 is a gene that encodes the ZFP1 zinc finger protein, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. The ZFP1 zinc finger protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, due to its ability to interact with specific DNA sequences. This protein plays a crucial role in gene expression and regulation, impacting numerous biological pathways and processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
