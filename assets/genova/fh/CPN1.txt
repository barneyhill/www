# CPN1

## Overview
CPN1 is a gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of carboxypeptidase N, a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase enzyme. This enzyme is a crucial component of the carboxypeptidase N complex, which is involved in the regulation of peptide hormones and growth factors by cleaving C-terminal arginine and lysine residues. The protein product of CPN1, carboxypeptidase N subunit 1, plays a significant role in modulating inflammatory responses and maintaining homeostasis by inactivating anaphylatoxins and kinins in the extracellular space (Skidgel2007Structure). The enzyme is categorized as a metalloenzyme due to its requirement for zinc as a cofactor for its enzymatic activity (Skidgel2007Structure). Mutations in the CPN1 gene can lead to clinical conditions such as increased susceptibility to anaphylatoxin-mediated shock and chronic severe angioedema, highlighting its importance in immune regulation and homeostasis (MuellerOrtiz2009Targeted; Germenis2016Genetics).

## Structure
The CPN1 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of carboxypeptidase N, a serum alphaglobulin metalloenzyme. This subunit is a 50-kDa protein that is part of a tetrameric enzyme complex, consisting of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits (Riley1998Chromosomal). The catalytic subunit of CPN1 is characterized by a catalytic domain typical of metallocarboxypeptidases and requires zinc as a cofactor for its enzymatic activity (Skidgel2007Structure). The primary structure of the CPN1 protein includes 458 amino acids, with specific regions coding for a signal peptide and the first 16 residues of the mature protein (Riley1998Chromosomal; Cao2003DNA).

The tertiary structure of the catalytic subunit is described as having a pear-like shape, with a catalytic domain and a transthyretin (TT) domain. This structure is similar to other carboxypeptidases but includes unique features such as O-linked carbohydrates (Skidgel2007Structure). The quaternary structure of carboxypeptidase N involves the formation of a dimer of heterodimers, where each heterodimer consists of a catalytic and a non-catalytic regulatory subunit (Skidgel2007Structure). The interaction between the catalytic and regulatory subunits is facilitated by a hydrophobic surface patch on the catalytic subunit and the concave inner β-sheet of the leucine-rich repeat domain of the 83-kDa regulatory subunit (Skidgel2007Structure).

## Function
Carboxypeptidase N subunit 1 (CPN1) encodes the catalytic subunit of carboxypeptidase N, a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the regulation of peptide hormones and growth factors by cleaving C-terminal arginine and lysine residues. This enzymatic activity is essential for modulating inflammatory responses and maintaining homeostasis in the human body (Skidgel2007Structure; Cao2003DNA).

CPN1 is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it influences processes such as blood pressure regulation and immune response. It inactivates anaphylatoxins and kinins, which are involved in inflammation and coagulation, by cleaving their C-terminal residues (Skidgel2007Structure). The enzyme also plays a role in the plasminogen system, affecting thrombolysis and fibrinolysis, and is involved in the conversion of creatine kinase isoforms and the modification of hemoglobin, impacting oxygen affinity and vasoconstriction (Skidgel2007Structure).

CPN1's activity is significant in preventing the accumulation of kinins, especially in patients receiving ACE inhibitors, and in altering receptor specificity of kinins, converting them to des-Arg-kinins, which act on B1 receptors (Skidgel2007Structure). The enzyme's function is crucial for immune regulation and homeostasis, as demonstrated by its role in inactivating anaphylatoxins and other substrates in the blood (Skidgel2007Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CPN1 gene, which encodes the small subunit of carboxypeptidase N, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily related to immune response and inflammation. CPN1 deficiency can lead to increased susceptibility to anaphylatoxin-mediated shock, particularly due to the inability to inactivate complement components C3a and C5a. This deficiency results in heightened sensitivity to C5a-induced histamine release, which can cause lethal anaphylactic shock (MuellerOrtiz2009Targeted).

In humans, partial CPN1 deficiency has been linked to chronic severe angioedema. Documented cases include a 65-year-old man with reduced CPN synthesis due to a frameshift mutation in exon 1 and a missense mutation in exon 3 of the CPN1 gene, and a woman who developed angioedema after taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (MuellerOrtiz2009Targeted; Cao2003DNA). These mutations are rare among normal populations, suggesting a significant role in the deficiency phenotype (Germenis2016Genetics).

The enzyme's deficiency is suggested to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, as seen in familial cases where members experienced angioedema and other allergic symptoms (MATHEWS1980Familial).

## Interactions
Carboxypeptidase N subunit 1 (CPN1) is a component of the carboxypeptidase N enzyme complex, which is involved in the regulation of peptide hormones and growth factors. CPN1 interacts with other proteins to form a functional enzyme complex, specifically as part of a tetramer consisting of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits. The regulatory subunit, an 83 kDa protein, stabilizes the complex and prevents its clearance from circulation (Skidgel2007Structure; Talens2012Binding).

CPN1 is known to bind specifically to fibrinogen and fibrin, key components in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. This interaction does not require other plasma components and is characterized by an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 100 nM, indicating a specific and strong interaction (Talens2012Binding). The binding of CPN1 to fibrinogen and fibrin suggests a potential role in inhibiting fibrinolysis, possibly contributing to the regulation of hemostasis and venous thrombosis development (Talens2012Binding).

CPN1 is also sensitive to proteolytic cleavage by plasmin, which can enhance its activity. This cleavage results in structural changes, leading to the dissociation of the tetramer into more active heterodimers (QUAGRAINE2005Plasmin).
