# AURKC

## Overview
Aurora kinase C (AURKC) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein, known as aurora kinase C, which plays a pivotal role in cell division processes, particularly meiosis. As a member of the aurora kinase family, aurora kinase C is integral to the regulation of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, ensuring accurate chromosomal alignment and segregation during cell division (Slattery2009AuroraC; Quartuccio2015Functions). The protein is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), interacting with other proteins such as INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin, which are essential for its activation and function (Quartuccio2015Functions). AURKC is predominantly expressed in meiotic cells, with significant roles in spermatogenesis and early embryonic development, where it becomes the main kinase in the CPC during the initial embryonic cell cycles (Avo2011A). Mutations in the AURKC gene are linked to macrozoospermia, a condition affecting male fertility, and its dysregulation is associated with chromosomal instability in certain cancers (Eloualid2014Prevalence; Behvarz2021AURKC).

## Structure
Aurora kinase C (AURKC) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cell division, with a primary structure consisting of 309 amino acids (Bathula2019Identification). The secondary structure of AURKC includes 14 alpha-helices and 14 beta turns, as well as 3 gamma turns (Bathula2019Identification). The tertiary structure of AURKC was modeled using homology modeling techniques, resulting in a stabilized protein with an RMSD value of 0.82 Å after energy minimization (Bathula2019Identification). The kinase domain of AURKC is highly conserved and includes a β-stranded N-terminal lobe and an α-helical C-terminal lobe linked by a hinge region, forming a deep cleft for ATP binding (Willems2018The). 

AURKC often forms a quaternary structure as part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), interacting with proteins such as INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin (Quartuccio2015Functions). AURKC undergoes autophosphorylation for activation, which is a common post-translational modification that regulates its activity (Quartuccio2015Functions). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, with variant 1 being more effective at phosphorylating targets in oocytes (Quartuccio2015Functions).

## Function
Aurora kinase C (AURKC) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in meiosis, particularly in spermatogenesis, where it is essential for male fertility. It is involved in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, ensuring proper chromosomal alignment and segregation during cell division (Slattery2009AuroraC; Quartuccio2015Functions). AURKC localizes to centromeres and chromosome arms during meiosis and is involved in regulating the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), cytokinesis, and the correction of kinetochore-microtubule (K-MT) attachments (Quartuccio2015Functions).

In human oocytes and early embryos, AURKC is part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which is crucial for proper chromosome segregation during cell division. It becomes the predominant kinase in the CPC during the first three embryonic cell cycles, although both Aurora B and C are present initially (Avo2011A). AURKC's expression is regulated in a stage-specific manner, with high levels in meiotic cells, and it is dynamically localized during meiosis, indicating its role in chromosome alignment, condensation, and cytokinesis (Quartuccio2015Functions).

Mutations in AURKC are associated with macrozoospermia, a condition characterized by sperm with large, misshapen heads and multiple flagella due to meiotic arrest, highlighting its importance in cytokinesis and fertility (Quartuccio2015Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AURKC gene are associated with macrozoospermia, a condition characterized by the presence of large-headed spermatozoa and male infertility. The most common mutation linked to this condition is c.144delC, which results in a truncated, nonfunctional protein lacking its kinase domain, leading to meiotic failure and the production of abnormal sperm (Eloualid2014Prevalence; Ben2012Identification). This mutation is particularly prevalent among individuals of North African origin (Harbuz2009Rôle).

Other mutations, such as p.Y248* and p.C229Y, also contribute to macrozoospermia by disrupting normal meiotic processes. The p.Y248* mutation leads to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, resulting in the absence of the AURKC protein (Ben2012Identification). The p.C229Y mutation, although partially functional, fails to support proper chromosome segregation during meiosis (Fellmeth2016Characterization).

Alterations in AURKC expression levels have been linked to chromosomal instability, which can contribute to certain cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer. The gene's role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis during cell division is critical, and its dysregulation can lead to aneuploidy and tumorigenesis (Behvarz2021AURKC).

## Interactions
Aurora kinase C (AURKC) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell division and cancer biology. AURKC interacts with the inner centromere protein (INCENP), forming part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) along with other proteins like survivin and borealin. This interaction is essential for the activation of AURKC, as INCENP binds and activates AURKC both in vivo and in vitro. The phosphorylation of INCENP enhances the kinase activity of AURKC, stabilizing its activation loop and facilitating substrate binding (Abdul2019Structural; Li2004Direct).

AURKC also interacts with IκBα, a protein involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway. This interaction is characterized by AURKC phosphorylating IκBα at serine 32, which is crucial for the activation of NF-κB. The binding involves specific residues, with His164 and Arg165 of AURKC interacting with Val97 and Lys98 of IκBα. This interaction can be disrupted by small-molecule inhibitors, which have been shown to decrease the transformed growth of breast cancer cells (Han2017A).

These interactions highlight the role of AURKC in regulating key cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer.
