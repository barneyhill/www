# CUL1

## Overview
CUL1 is a gene that encodes the protein cullin 1, a crucial component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex plays a significant role in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcription. As a scaffold protein, cullin 1 facilitates the assembly of the SCF complex by interacting with other proteins, including Skp1, F-box proteins, and Rbx1. The activity of cullin 1 is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as neddylation, which enhance its function in ubiquitination pathways. CUL1 is implicated in several physiological processes, including immune response regulation and centrosome replication, and its dysregulation is associated with various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Yu1998Human; CHEN2015Cul1; Baek2021NEDD8).

## Structure
CUL1 (cullin 1) is a core component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, characterized by a highly elongated structure. The protein consists of a 415-amino-acid N-terminal domain (NTD) and a 360-amino-acid C-terminal domain (CTD) (Zheng2002Structure). The NTD features three cullin repeats, each comprising two short helices and three long helices, forming a three-helix bundle that creates an arc-shaped structure. The first repeat binds the Skp1-F-box Skp2 complex (Zheng2002Structure). The CTD includes a four-helix bundle, an α/β domain with a five-stranded intermolecular β-sheet, and two winged-helix motifs, forming a V-shaped groove where the RING domain of Rbx1 binds (Zheng2002Structure).

CUL1's quaternary structure involves its assembly with Rbx1, Skp1, and an F-box protein, forming the SCF complex. The interaction between CUL1 and Rbx1 is characterized by a stable intermolecular β-sheet (Rao2020CullinRING). Post-translational modification by NEDD8, known as neddylation, occurs at a specific lysine residue (K720) on CUL1, enhancing its ubiquitination activity (Baek2021NEDD8). This modification induces a conformational change, transitioning the CUL1-Rbx1 complex from a closed to an open conformation, which is crucial for its function (Duda2008Structural).

## Function
CUL1 (cullin 1) is a core component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is crucial for targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This process is essential for regulating various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcription. In healthy human cells, CUL1 is involved in the regulation of the G1/S transition of the cell cycle by targeting specific proteins, such as cyclin D and p21, for degradation. This regulation is vital for proper cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Yu1998Human).

CUL1 is also implicated in the modulation of lymphocyte signal transduction, affecting T and B cell development and activation. It plays a role in cytokine production, such as IL-8, in T cells, which is important for immune responses (Kawaida2005CUL1). The expression of CUL1 is high in immunological tissues like the spleen and tonsils, indicating its significant role in immune function (Kawaida2005CUL1). Additionally, CUL1 is involved in the regulation of centrosome replication, which is essential for proper cell division (Kawaida2005CUL1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the CUL1 gene, such as DNA amplification and mRNA upregulation, have been observed in various cancers, including melanoma, lung cancer, endometrioid carcinoma, bone cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Overexpression of CUL1 is associated with poor prognosis in cancers like gastric, breast, and colon cancer, and it has potential as a prognostic marker (Chang2023RNF126). In melanoma, CUL1 promotes cell proliferation by facilitating the G1-S phase transition and enhancing cap-dependent translation, which is crucial for the translation of oncogenic mRNAs. This process involves the degradation of DEPTOR, an inhibitor of mTORC1, leading to increased mTORC1 activity (CHEN2015Cul1).

In colorectal cancer, increased CUL1 expression is linked to metastasis and poor overall survival. It is considered an independent prognostic factor, influencing cell proliferation and metastasis (Wang2015Cullin1). In breast cancer, CUL1 promotes metastasis by regulating the expression of cytokines CXCL8 and IL11, contributing to cancer progression through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway (Huang2018CUL1).

CUL1 also plays a role in trophoblast cell invasion at the maternal-fetal interface, with its disruption potentially linked to preeclampsia, a condition characterized by gestational hypertension and proteinuria (Zhang2013CUL1).

## Interactions
CUL1 (cullin 1) is a key component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it acts as a scaffold protein. It interacts with Skp1 and an F-box protein at its N-terminal domain, and with ROC1/Rbx1 at its C-terminal domain, facilitating the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes for substrate ubiquitination (Sarikas2011The; Pan2004Nedd8). The C-terminal domain of CUL1 is crucial for its interaction with NLRP3, a protein involved in inflammasome assembly, where CUL1 represses NLRP3 activation by promoting its ubiquitination (Wan2019Cullin1).

CUL1 also interacts with TIP120A, which binds to unneddylated CUL1, inhibiting its neddylation and preventing the binding of Skp1 and F-box proteins, thus acting as a negative regulator of the SCF complex (Hwang2003TIP120A). The interaction with CAND1 is mutually exclusive with Skp1 binding, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for SCF complex assembly (Moon2006A). Neddylation of CUL1, facilitated by RBX1, is essential for the activation of the SCF complex, as it promotes the assembly of multi-ubiquitin chains (Pan2004Nedd8).
