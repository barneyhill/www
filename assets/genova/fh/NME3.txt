# NME3

## Overview
NME3 is a gene that encodes the protein NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 3, which is a member of the nucleoside diphosphate kinase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as mitochondrial dynamics, genome stability, and ciliary function. As a kinase, NME3 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial fusion by interacting with mitofusin proteins, thereby maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function under metabolic stress conditions (Chen2018Two). Additionally, NME3 contributes to genome stability by mitigating reactive oxygen species-mediated DNA damage and facilitating DNA repair (Chen2020NME3). The protein's interactions extend to ciliary function, where it associates with nephronophthisis proteins, playing a crucial role in renal development and ciliary transport (Hoff2018The). Clinically, alterations in NME3 expression or mutations can lead to various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and ciliopathies, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Honsho2020Mammalian; Chen2020NME3).

## Structure
The NME3 protein is a nucleoside diphosphate kinase that typically forms a hexameric structure, contributing to its quaternary structure (Chen2018Two). It contains a single NDPk_1 domain, which is characteristic of the NME protein family (Desvignes2009Nme). The protein's structure includes an N-terminal region essential for its localization to the outer mitochondrial membrane and its interaction with other proteins, such as MFN1 and MFN2, which are involved in mitochondrial fusion (Chen2018Two). 

The NME3 protein's secondary structure likely includes alpha/beta folds typical of nucleoside diphosphate kinases, although specific details on these folds are not provided in the context. The protein's tertiary structure is influenced by its ability to oligomerize, which is crucial for its function in mitochondrial dynamics (Chen2018Two). 

Post-translational modifications of NME3 include phosphorylation, which plays a significant role in its activity and interactions, particularly in processes like mitophagy under hypoxic conditions (Chen2024NME3). The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications on peroxisomes, dependent on the histidine at position 135 (Honsho2020Mammalian).

## Function
NME3 (NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 3) is a crucial protein involved in maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and genome stability in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in mitochondrial fusion by interacting with mitofusin proteins MFN1 and MFN2, which are essential for the fusion of the mitochondrial outer membrane. This interaction is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress such as glucose starvation (Chen2018Two). NME3's role in mitochondrial fusion is independent of its nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity, as demonstrated by its ability to restore fusion even when its catalytic activity is absent (Chen2018Two).

NME3 also contributes to genome stability by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DNA damage. Its knockdown leads to increased mitochondrial fragmentation, oxidative stress, and DNA single-strand breaks, indicating its importance in facilitating DNA repair (Chen2020NME3). NME3's localization to the mitochondrial outer membrane is necessary for its function in promoting mitochondrial elongation and reducing oxidative stress (Chen2020NME3). Additionally, NME3 is involved in mitophagy, particularly under hypoxic conditions, by regulating DRP1, a protein essential for the segregation of damaged mitochondria (Chen2024NME3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NME3 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. Low expression of NME3 is associated with poorer prognosis in various cancers, as it plays a role in maintaining genome stability by regulating mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress (Chen2020NME3). NME3's interaction with Tip60, a histone acetyltransferase, is crucial for DNA repair, and its deficiency can lead to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage, contributing to cancer progression (Chen2020NME3).

NME3 mutations can also result in neurodegenerative disorders. A homozygous mutation in NME3 has been linked to cerebellar developmental defects and reduced cerebellar foliation, potentially due to decreased plasmalogen levels (Honsho2020Mammalian). The H135Q mutation in NME3 impairs mitophagy, leading to increased susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiac injury and early onset cerebellar ataxia (Chen2024NME3).

NME3 is also implicated in nephronophthisis, a ciliopathy affecting renal development. It interacts with nephronophthisis proteins and is essential for ciliary function, with its depletion leading to ciliopathy-associated phenotypes (Hoff2018The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NME3 in various diseases, emphasizing its role in mitochondrial and ciliary functions.

## Interactions
NME3 interacts with various proteins and is involved in multiple cellular processes. It physically interacts with mitofusin (MFN) in mitochondria, influencing mitochondrial fusion (Honsho2020Mammalian). NME3 also forms a complex with Tip60, a histone acetyltransferase, which is crucial for DNA repair, particularly in serum-deprived cells. This interaction is dependent on the N-terminal 17-amino-acid region of NME3 (Tsao2016The). 

In the context of ciliary function, NME3 interacts with nephronophthisis proteins (NPHPs) such as NEK8, CEP164, and ANKS6. These interactions are essential for ciliary function and renal development, as demonstrated in vertebrate models like zebrafish and Xenopus laevis (Hoff2018The). NME3 is also involved in the transport of NPHPs in and out of the cilium, potentially providing substrates for ciliary GTPases (Hoff2018The).

NME3's interaction with the cytosolic membrane protein receptor Pex19 suggests its role in peroxisome division, as it is targeted and transported to peroxisomes via the Pex19-Pex3 pathway (Honsho2020Mammalian). These interactions highlight NME3's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and genome stability.
