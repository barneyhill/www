# ZNF185

## Overview
ZNF185 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 185 with a LIM domain, a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion. This protein is categorized as a zinc finger protein due to its characteristic zinc finger motifs, which facilitate interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. The LIM domain within ZNF185 is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling pathways. ZNF185 is expressed in multiple tissue types and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular structure and function, particularly in epithelial and endothelial cells. It is involved in keratinocyte differentiation and endothelial barrier function, highlighting its importance in tissue integrity and cellular communication. Additionally, ZNF185 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis in various cancers, including squamous cell carcinomas and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Suzuki2022ZNF185; Zhu2023The; Smirnov2018ZNF185).

## Structure
ZNF185 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of a LIM domain, which is a protein-protein interaction domain involved in cytoskeleton dynamics and cell lineage specification (Smirnov2018ZNF185). The protein is associated with the actin-cytoskeleton and is localized in both the cytoplasm and the cellular periphery. The actin-targeting domain is located at the N-terminus of the protein, which is necessary for mediating actin-cytoskeleton targeting, while the LIM domain is located at the C-terminus and is dispensable for actin binding (Smirnov2018ZNF185).

The primary structure of ZNF185 includes regions rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which coordinate zinc ions, typical of zinc finger proteins. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context. The LIM domain contributes to the tertiary structure by facilitating the folding necessary for functional interactions (Smirnov2018ZNF185).

ZNF185 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. The presence of splice variant isoforms can result in structural and functional diversity, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context provided. The protein interacts with E-cadherin, a component of adherens junctions, which are critical for cell-cell adhesion in epithelial tissues (Smirnov2018ZNF185).

## Function
ZNF185 is a zinc finger protein with a LIM domain that plays a significant role in the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion in healthy human cells. It is involved in the differentiation of keratinocytes, a process crucial for the development of the human epidermis. During keratinocyte differentiation, ZNF185 expression increases, and the protein localizes to the cell membrane, suggesting its association with the cytoskeleton and cell membrane (Smirnov2018ZNF185). ZNF185 interacts with E-cadherin, a component of adherens junctions, which are essential for maintaining epithelial integrity and cell-cell adhesion (Smirnov2018ZNF185).

In endothelial cells, ZNF185 is involved in maintaining endothelial barrier function by regulating the cAMP/PKA/RhoA signaling pathway. It acts as a substrate for protein kinase A (PKA) and is phosphorylated in response to cAMP signaling, which is crucial for its function. This phosphorylation helps stabilize cortical actin structures and prevent stress fiber formation, thereby maintaining cell junction stability and reducing endothelial permeability (Suzuki2022ZNF185). ZNF185's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function across different tissue types.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF185 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. Its downregulation is observed in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), including head and neck, cervical, and esophageal SCCs, where decreased expression is associated with poor differentiation and increased tumor grade (Smirnov2018ZNF185). The gene's expression is epigenetically silenced in high-grade tumors, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Smirnov2018ZNF185). ZNF185 interacts with E-cadherin, a key component of cell adhesion, and its depletion affects keratinocyte differentiation, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial integrity (Smirnov2018ZNF185).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ZNF185 is identified as a high-risk gene, with its expression linked to chemotherapy tolerance and poor survival outcomes (Zhu2023The). It is part of a prognostic model for predicting overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients, where high expression correlates with worse outcomes (Zhu2023The). The gene's involvement in tumor immune invasion suggests potential as a target for treatment strategies (Zhu2023The).

Alterations in ZNF185 expression or function can also impact endothelial barrier function, leading to increased vascular permeability and stress fiber formation, which may contribute to inflammatory conditions (Suzuki2022ZNF185).

## Interactions
ZNF185 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It physically interacts with E-cadherin, a key component of adherens junctions, which are crucial for maintaining epithelial integrity. This interaction suggests that ZNF185 contributes to cell-cell adhesion and epithelial differentiation (Smirnov2018ZNF185). ZNF185 is also a substrate for Protein Kinase A (PKA) in endothelial cells. It contains three distinct PKA phosphorylation motifs, and its phosphorylation by PKA is essential for its function. This phosphorylation leads to the translocation of ZNF185 to the cell membrane, where it interacts with actin and plectin, forming a complex that is important for maintaining cytoskeletal structures and preventing stress fiber formation (Suzuki2022ZNF185).

ZNF185's interaction with actin is crucial for regulating actin cytoskeletal structures. Knockdown of ZNF185 results in increased stress fiber formation and disrupted cell junctions, indicating its role in maintaining cytoskeletal organization and cell-cell adhesion (Suzuki2022ZNF185). Additionally, ZNF185 interacts with PKA regulatory subunits, and this interaction is necessary for the phosphorylation of RhoGDIα, which regulates RhoA activity, further influencing cytoskeletal dynamics (Suzuki2022ZNF185).
