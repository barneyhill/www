# ZNF791

## Overview
ZNF791 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 791, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to nucleic acids, thereby playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 791 is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interactions with microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miR-199 and miR-181, which modulate its expression by binding to specific sites within its sequence (SchnallLevin2011Unusually). This regulatory mechanism highlights the importance of ZNF791 in cellular processes and its potential impact on gene expression networks in mammalian cells.

## Structure


## Interactions
ZNF791 is a zinc finger protein that participates in various interactions with nucleic acids, particularly through its involvement with microRNAs (miRNAs). It is a target of miR-199, which contains multiple seed matches within ZNF791, leading to significant repression when miR-199a is present. This interaction has been confirmed through experimental methods such as luciferase assays, indicating that miR-199 can effectively repress ZNF791 by binding to its nucleic acid sequences (SchnallLevin2011Unusually).

Additionally, ZNF791 is targeted by miR-181, which contains multiple binding sites within its open reading frame (ORF). The presence of nine miR-181 8mer sites and one 7mer site in ZNF791 results in strong repression when miR-181a is introduced. This repression is mediated directly by the ORF sites, as demonstrated by mutational analysis that alters repression levels (SchnallLevin2011Unusually).

These interactions suggest that ZNF791 is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms involving miRNAs, which can modulate its expression and potentially its function as a transcription factor within the broader context of gene regulation in mammalian cells.
