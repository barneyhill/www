# GOLGA8F

## Overview
GOLGA8F is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A8 family member F, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. Golgins are a group of coiled-coil proteins primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. The golgin A8 family member F is implicated in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and facilitating vesicular transport processes. Although the specific functions of GOLGA8F are not fully elucidated, its role in cellular transport and Golgi structure suggests potential involvement in various cellular pathways and processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
