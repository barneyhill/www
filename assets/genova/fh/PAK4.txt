# PAK4

## Overview
PAK4 (p21-activated kinase 4) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. The PAK4 protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain, allowing it to interact with small GTPases such as CDC42. This interaction is crucial for its role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, influencing cell morphology and motility (Zhang2018PAK4; Ha2018CDC42). PAK4 is also implicated in cell survival pathways, where it exerts anti-apoptotic effects by phosphorylating key proteins involved in apoptosis (Dart2013P21activated). Clinically, PAK4 is significant due to its overexpression in various cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Dasgupta2021Targeting; Won2019PAK4).

## Structure
PAK4 (p21-activated kinase 4) is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of PAK4 includes a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain. The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, which are crucial for its function (Zhang2018PAK4). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, essential for its kinase activity (Zhang2018PAK4).

PAK4 contains a CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain, which is involved in its interaction with small GTPases like CDC42 (Ha2018CDC42). The kinase domain of PAK4 adopts a DFG-in conformation, with phosphorylated activation loop residue Ser474, indicating its active state (Ha2018CDC42). PAK4 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity (Baskaran2015An).

The quaternary structure of PAK4 includes the ability to form homodimers, and it can also form complexes with other proteins, such as CDC42 and Inka1, which influence its activity and conformation (Ha2018CDC42; Baskaran2015An). These interactions highlight the dynamic nature of PAK4's structure and its role in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
PAK4 (p21-activated kinase 4) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell morphology, adhesion, and motility. PAK4 promotes cytoskeletal changes by stimulating filopodia formation and causing the dissolution of stress fibers, leading to cell rounding and loss of focal adhesions (Dart2013P21activated; Abo1998PAK4). 

PAK4 is also significant in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the early G1 phase. It influences the cell cycle by modulating the levels of the cell-cycle regulatory protein p21, thereby affecting the activity of CDK4/CDK6 kinases and allowing cells to progress through the cell cycle (Nekrasova2011PAK4). 

In terms of cell survival, PAK4 promotes anti-apoptotic pathways by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and inhibiting caspase-dependent signaling pathways (Dart2013P21activated). It is also involved in immune defense, influencing immune cell biology and modulating actin dynamics during infections (Dart2013P21activated). 

PAK4 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting signaling pathways that regulate cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Dart2013P21activated). Its deletion results in embryonic lethality, highlighting its essential role in development (Dart2013P21activated).

## Clinical Significance
PAK4 is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression and gene amplification. It is highly expressed in several tumor types, including breast, gastric, prostate, lung, gallbladder, and ovarian cancers, where it plays a role in cell proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance (Won2019PAK4). In rhabdomyosarcoma, PAK4 is significantly upregulated, contributing to tumorigenesis and metastasis, and its inhibition has shown anti-tumor effects (Dasgupta2021Targeting). 

In bladder cancer, PAK4 is associated with advanced stages and poor survival, with its inhibition reducing cell proliferation and invasion (Chandrashekar2020Therapeutically). PAK4 also contributes to chemotherapy resistance by activating pathways like MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt, and its overexpression is linked to resistance to PD-1 blockade in immunotherapy (Naїja2021The; Yu2022The). 

PAK4's role in cancer progression is further supported by its involvement in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and its regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which enhances cancer cell migration and metastasis (Naїja2021The). These findings highlight PAK4 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
PAK4 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is a novel binding partner of Gab1, a scaffold protein essential for biological responses downstream from the Met receptor tyrosine kinase. This interaction is critical for epithelial cell dispersal, migration, and invasion in response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Paliouras2009Pak4). The association between PAK4 and Gab1 is specific and does not occur with other Gab family members like Gab2 or Gab3 (Paliouras2009Pak4). PAK4 also interacts with the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α, which is significant for pancreatic cancer cell migration. This interaction is mediated through PAK4's proline-rich domain and the SH3 domain of p85α (King2017PAK4).

PAK4 is a target of the small GTPase Cdc42, and this interaction is involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and filopodia formation (Abo1998PAK4). In the context of UV-induced genomic instability, PAK4 interacts with Cdc42, mediating cellular responses to genotoxic stress (Silva2019Proteomic). PAK4 also interacts with ribosomal proteins and RNA binding proteins, suggesting a role in translational regulation (Baldassa2010N‐terminal).
