# MELK

## Overview
Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and cancer progression. The MELK protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes a catalytic domain and a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, allowing it to participate in diverse protein interactions and signaling pathways (Canevari2013Structural; Rembacz2019Crystal). MELK is notably expressed in undifferentiated neural progenitors and plays a crucial role in maintaining multipotency and self-renewal capabilities, which are essential for the development of the central nervous system (Nakano2005Maternal). In the context of cancer, MELK is often overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Speers2016Maternal; Xu2020MELK). However, its role in cancer biology remains a subject of ongoing research and debate (Giuliano2018MELK).

## Structure
The maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is a serine/threonine kinase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of MELK consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes a catalytic domain located in the N-terminal region and a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (Rembacz2019Crystal). The secondary structure of MELK features a bilobal fold typical of serine/threonine kinases, with the N-terminal lobe comprising a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a conserved αC helix, while the C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical (Canevari2013Structural; Rembacz2019Crystal).

The tertiary structure of MELK includes the kinase domain and the UBA domain, which binds tightly to the kinase domain, contributing to its conformation and activity (Cao2013Structural). The UBA domain is connected to the catalytic domain by an unstructured linker and adopts a compact conformation with three α-helices in a 'U'-shaped fold (Canevari2013Structural). MELK can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure (Cao2013Structural).

Post-translational modifications of MELK include autophosphorylation, which is crucial for its activation and regulation (Cao2013Structural; Rembacz2019Crystal). Splice variant isoforms of MELK exist, which can affect its function and localization (Cao2013Structural).

## Function
Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the proliferation of multipotent neural progenitors (MNPs). MELK is essential for the transition of GFAP-positive progenitor cells to a highly proliferative GFAP-negative state, which is crucial for maintaining a pool of stem cells and the development of the central nervous system (Nakano2005Maternal).

MELK is expressed in undifferentiated neural progenitors and is associated with markers such as nestin and SOX2, indicating its role in maintaining multipotency and self-renewal capabilities. MELK-positive progenitors can form neurospheres, which can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, confirming their multipotent nature (Nakano2005Maternal).

MELK's activity is regulated by autophosphorylation and is influenced by various factors, including calcium ions and reducing agents. It interacts with several proteins, such as B-myb, which promotes the G1-S transition in the cell cycle, and ZPR9, which is involved in cell cycle regulation (Nakano2005Maternal; Beullens2005Substrate). These interactions highlight MELK's role in promoting cell proliferation and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase) is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression. In endometrial carcinoma (EC), MELK is overexpressed and correlates with high tumor grade, late stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. It activates mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways, contributing to tumor progression, and is regulated by transcription factors like E2F1 (Xu2020MELK). In breast cancer, MELK is highly expressed, particularly in basal-like and triple-negative subtypes, and is associated with radioresistance. Its inhibition can enhance radiosensitivity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Speers2016Maternal). MELK also interacts with Bcl-G, a pro-apoptotic protein, inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cancer cell growth (Lin2007Involvement).

In glioma, MELK is highly expressed and linked to poor prognosis, with its expression correlating with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, indicating a role in the tumor microenvironment (Yang2022MELK). In lung adenocarcinoma, MELK promotes growth and metastasis, influencing genes involved in metastasis and cell cycle progression (Tang2020MELK). Despite its association with aggressive cancer phenotypes, some studies suggest that MELK may not be essential for cancer cell proliferation, challenging its role as a therapeutic target (Giuliano2018MELK).

## Interactions
MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Bcl-G, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, in breast cancer cells. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of Bcl-G by MELK, potentially inhibiting Bcl-G's pro-apoptotic function and contributing to mammary carcinogenesis (Lin2007Involvement).

MELK also binds to the zinc finger-like protein ZPR9, leading to its nuclear accumulation and interaction with the transcription factor B-Myb, enhancing transcriptional activity (Beullens2005Substrate). In glioblastoma stem cells, MELK interacts with c-JUN, a target of JNK, in a cancer-specific manner (Ganguly2015MELK—a).

In the context of cell cycle regulation, MELK interacts with CDC25B, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and phosphorylates eIF4B at Ser406 during mitosis, which is crucial for protein synthesis and tumor cell survival (Wang2016Mitotic; Beullens2005Substrate). MELK also interacts with PRAS40 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, phosphorylating it to activate the mTORC1 pathway, promoting tumor progression (Zhang2019MELK).

These interactions highlight MELK's role in regulating apoptosis, transcription, and cell cycle progression, making it a potential target for cancer therapy.
