# ZNF671

## Overview
ZNF671 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 671, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and are often involved in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 671 functions primarily as a transcription factor and is implicated in the regulation of gene expression. It plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. The gene is frequently downregulated in various cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and others, often due to hypermethylation. This downregulation is associated with increased tumorigenicity, highlighting ZNF671's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in oncology (p&gt; ZNF671; Unknownauthors2024ZNF671restrainsendometrialcancercellgrowthandstemnessthroughtheWntβcateninpathway; Zhang2017Epigenetic; Zhan2020&lt).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF671 is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), ZNF671 is often hypermethylated, leading to its downregulation. This downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, as ZNF671 normally induces cell cycle arrest. Overexpression of ZNF671 in NPC cells suppresses proliferation and reduces tumorigenicity by inducing S phase arrest through the upregulation of p21 and downregulation of cyclin D1 and c-myc (Zhang2017Epigenetic).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ZNF671 is also downregulated and hypermethylated, correlating with poor prognosis. Its overexpression inhibits cancer cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis by downregulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This suggests that ZNF671 could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in NSCLC (Zhan2020&lt; ZNF671; p&gt).

ZNF671 is similarly downregulated in other cancers, such as glioblastoma, astrocytoma, melanoma, and breast cancer, where it negatively regulates processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion. This supports its role as a tumor suppressor across multiple cancer types (Zhang2019The). In endometrial cancer, ZNF671 suppresses tumor growth and cancer stemness by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Unknownauthors2024ZNF671restrainsendometrialcancercellgrowthandstemnessthroughtheWntβcateninpathway).
