# CLEC4C

## Overview
CLEC4C is a gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain family 4 member C protein, also known as CD303 or BDCA-2. This protein is a type II transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are crucial components of the immune system. The protein is characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which facilitates the binding of specific sugar moieties, playing a pivotal role in modulating immune responses. CLEC4C is involved in the regulation of type I interferon production and participates in endocytosis and signaling pathways that influence pDC function and maturation. The receptor's interaction with ITAM-containing adaptor molecules, such as the Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ), underscores its role in immune signaling (Geijtenbeek2009Signalling; Sancho2012Signaling). Mutations in the CLEC4C gene, such as the p.Lys210del variant, have been linked to immune-related pathologies, including juvenile sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS), highlighting its clinical significance (Lim2016CLEC4C).

## Structure
CLEC4C, also known as CD303 or BDCA-2, is a type II transmembrane protein that is part of the C-type lectin domain family. The protein is characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which is responsible for binding specific sugar moieties. Structurally, CLEC4C includes a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular CRD. The CRD is crucial for its function in recognizing and binding carbohydrates, which is a key aspect of its role in immune response regulation. 

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its stability, localization, and function. Glycosylation is a common modification for proteins involved in cell signaling and immune responses, potentially affecting the protein's interaction with other molecules. CLEC4C is primarily expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are integral to the body's immune defense mechanisms. The specific structural details regarding the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CLEC4C are not provided in the available context. However, the presence of the CRD and its role in carbohydrate binding are significant features of its molecular structure.

## Function
CLEC4C, also known as CD303 or BDCA-2, is a C-type lectin receptor primarily expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). It plays a significant role in the immune system by modulating immune responses through the recognition of glycan structures on pathogens. CLEC4C is involved in the inhibition of type I interferon production, which impacts antiviral defense mechanisms (Geijtenbeek2009Signalling; Sancho2012Signaling).

In healthy human cells, CLEC4C is active on the cell surface, where it participates in endocytosis and signaling pathways that influence pDC function and maturation. The receptor is associated with ITAM-containing adaptor molecules like Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ), which induce signaling pathways that can modulate TLR-induced gene expression (Geijtenbeek2009Signalling). This signaling does not independently induce gene expression but involves crosstalk with other pattern recognition receptors, providing flexibility in cytokine gene expression regulation (Geijtenbeek2009Signalling).

CLEC4C's proper localization to the cell surface is crucial for its function, as demonstrated by the p.Lys210del variant, which results in endoplasmic reticulum retention and impaired cell surface transport, affecting immune functions such as antigen presentation and cytokine production (Lim2016CLEC4C). This highlights the importance of CLEC4C in maintaining normal immune function and its potential role in immune-related pathologies (Lim2016CLEC4C).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLEC4C gene, such as the novel de novo variant p.Lys210del, have been associated with juvenile sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS). This specific variant results in impaired cell surface transport of the CLEC4C protein in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs), potentially contributing to neuroinflammation linked to ALS. The p.Lys210del variant alters the polybasic motif of the protein, leading to endoplasmic reticulum retention and reduced surface expression, which may affect cytokine levels, including IFNα, IL-6, and TNFα, crucial for immune responses (Lim2016CLEC4C).

The study suggests that the lack of surface expression of CLEC4C due to the p.Lys210del variant may increase ALS susceptibility. This variant was identified through whole-exome sequencing in a juvenile ALS patient and was not found in common genetic databases, indicating its novelty (Lim2016CLEC4C). The impaired transport of CLEC4C to the cell surface, as demonstrated in experiments with HeLa and Jurkat cells, supports the hypothesis that this mutation contributes to ALS pathology (Lim2016CLEC4C). These findings highlight the potential role of CLEC4C in ALS and suggest that it may be a target for therapeutic intervention.
