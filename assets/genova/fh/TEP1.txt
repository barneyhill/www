# TEP1

## Overview
Telomerase associated protein 1 (TEP1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the maintenance of telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. The TEP1 protein is a key component of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex, where it plays a structural and regulatory role by binding to the telomerase RNA component (TERC) and facilitating interactions with other molecules, thereby contributing to telomere length and stability (Rumšaitė2023The; CiminoReale2017miR3805pmediated). Additionally, TEP1 is part of the vault ribonucleoprotein complex, the largest known mammalian ribonucleoprotein complex, where it aids in the stabilization and recruitment of vault RNA (vRNA) (Liu2004Vault). The protein contains WD40 repeats and a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and complex assembly (Jin2016Two; Bateman2003The). TEP1's involvement in telomere maintenance and its interactions with various proteins and microRNAs underscore its significance in cellular processes such as aging, cancer, and disease pathogenesis (Rumšaitė2023The; CiminoReale2017miR3805pmediated).

## Structure
The TEP1 protein is a component of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex and is involved in the assembly and stability of the telomerase holoenzyme. It contains WD40 repeats, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Jin2016Two). TEP1 is also a part of the vault ribonucleoprotein complex, which is the largest known mammalian ribonucleoprotein complex, and plays a crucial role in the stabilization and recruitment of vault RNA (vRNA) to the vault particle (Liu2004Vault).

TEP1 has two isoforms: isoform1, which is 2627 amino acids long, and isoform2, which is 2519 amino acids long, lacking exons 5 and 6 compared to isoform1 (Jin2016Two). The C-terminal region of TEP1 contains a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain, which is also found in VPARP, suggesting potential interactions between these vault components (Bateman2003The). The vWA domain may bind to a metal ion and be involved in complex assembly, although it is unlikely to be a major site for major vault protein (MVP) binding (Bateman2003The). TEP1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and interactions.

## Function
TEP1 (telomerase associated protein 1) is a crucial component of the telomerase complex, which is responsible for maintaining telomere length and stability in human cells. It functions as a structural protein by binding to the telomerase RNA component (TERC) and acts as a regulatory subunit, facilitating the interaction of telomerase with other molecules (Rumšaitė2023The). TEP1 is involved in the stabilization of the telomerase holoenzyme, which is essential for telomere maintenance, a critical process for cellular replication and longevity (CiminoReale2017miR3805pmediated).

In addition to its role in telomere maintenance, TEP1 interacts with the BLM protein of Bloom syndrome, regulating its helicase activity, which suggests its involvement in telomere lengthening (Rumšaitė2023The). TEP1 is also implicated in the regulation of telomerase activity through its interaction with miR-380-5p, which targets TEP1 to inhibit telomerase activity, affecting cell growth and promoting an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype in certain cancer cells (CiminoReale2017miR3805pmediated).

TEP1's role in telomere elongation and protection contributes to chromosomal integrity, impacting cellular processes such as aging and cancer, where telomere maintenance is crucial for cell division and longevity (Rumšaitė2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TEP1 gene, which encodes telomerase associated protein 1, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of pituitary adenoma (PA), the TEP1 rs1713418 polymorphism is associated with tumor development and progression. The GG genotype of this polymorphism is less frequent in active and invasive PA, suggesting increased odds of these conditions under the recessive model (Gedvilaite2022Molecular).

In diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM), miR-380-5p-mediated repression of TEP1 leads to reduced telomerase activity, impairing cell growth and promoting apoptosis. This repression is linked to the emergence of an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype, which may affect cancer cell proliferation and resistance to telomerase-targeted therapies (CiminoReale2017miR3805pmediated).

TEP1 genetic variants have also been studied in relation to multiple sclerosis (MS). The rs1713418 SNP in the TEP1 gene may alter miRNA binding and gene regulation, potentially increasing the risk of MS (Rumšaitė2023The). These findings suggest that TEP1 plays a significant role in the development and progression of various diseases through its impact on telomerase activity and telomere maintenance.

## Interactions
TEP1 (telomerase associated protein 1) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in telomere maintenance and cellular processes. TEP1 is a component of the telomerase complex, where it binds to the telomerase RNA component (TERC) and interacts with the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), contributing to the stabilization and proper functioning of the telomerase enzyme (Rumšaitė2023The; CiminoReale2017miR3805pmediated). It also interacts with dyskerin, another protein involved in stabilizing the structure of telomerase (Rumšaitė2023The).

TEP1 is known to interact with the BLM protein, which is associated with Bloom syndrome, regulating its helicase activity and suggesting a role in telomere lengthening (Rumšaitė2023The). Additionally, TEP1 is part of the vault ribonucleoprotein complex, interacting with major vault protein (MVP) and vault poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (VPARP), which are involved in the transport of molecules such as mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Jin2016Two).

TEP1 is also a target of miR-380-5p, a microRNA that regulates telomerase activity by downregulating TEP1 expression, leading to reduced telomerase activity and cell growth in certain cancer cells (CiminoReale2017miR3805pmediated).
