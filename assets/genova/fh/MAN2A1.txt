# MAN2A1

## Overview
The MAN2A1 gene encodes the enzyme mannosidase alpha class 2A member 1, commonly referred to as Golgi α-mannosidase II. This enzyme is a type II transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the maturation of N-glycans, which are essential for proper glycoprotein function. Golgi α-mannosidase II is characterized by its complex structure, including a large luminal catalytic domain and a Zn2+ binding site crucial for its enzymatic activity (Moremen2014Mannosidase). The enzyme functions as a disulfide-linked homodimer and is involved in the conversion of oligomannose or hybrid structures to complex-type N-glycans within the Golgi apparatus (Moremen2014Mannosidase). This process is vital for various cellular functions, including protein folding and cell-cell interactions. The MAN2A1 gene has clinical significance, as its altered expression is associated with immune evasion in tumors and the formation of the oncogenic fusion gene MAN2A1-FER, which is implicated in several cancers (Chen2017MAN2A1–FER; Shi2020Inhibition).

## Structure
The MAN2A1 gene encodes Golgi α-mannosidase II, a critical enzyme in the maturation of N-glycans. The protein is characterized by a type II transmembrane domain structure, which includes a short cytoplasmic tail, a single transmembrane domain, a stem domain, and a large luminal catalytic domain (Moremen2014Mannosidase). The catalytic domain features a complex globular protein fold, comprising an NH2-terminal α/β domain, a three-helical bundle, and a β-sheet COOH-terminal domain. It also contains five internal disulfide bonds and a Zn2+ binding site essential for its catalytic activity (Moremen2014Mannosidase).

The enzyme functions as a 136 kDa disulfide-linked homodimer, indicating its quaternary structure (Moremen2014Mannosidase). The active site of Golgi α-mannosidase II is highly conserved, facilitating substrate binding and catalysis, with specific residues involved in zinc coordination (Shah2008Golgi). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common for this enzyme, which is crucial for its function in the Golgi apparatus (Moremen2014Mannosidase). The enzyme's structure and function are conserved across species, highlighting its evolutionary importance (Shah2008Golgi).

## Function
The MAN2A1 gene encodes Golgi α-Mannosidase II, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the maturation of N-glycans within the secretory pathway of vertebrate tissues. This enzyme is responsible for cleaving specific mannoside linkages in N-glycan structures, facilitating the conversion of oligomannose or hybrid structures to complex-type N-glycans. This process is essential for the proper functioning and maturation of glycoproteins, which are crucial for cell adhesion and recognition events in metazoan organisms (Moremen2014Mannosidase).

Golgi α-Mannosidase II is localized to the Golgi complex and acts in a sequential pathway for N-glycan biosynthesis, following the trimming of α1,2-mannose residues and the addition of a GlcNAc residue by MGAT1. The enzyme's activity is a committed step in N-glycan processing, and it employs an inverting glycosidase mechanism with a Zn2+ ion that contributes to substrate specificity and distortion at the transition state (Moremen2014Mannosidase).

In healthy human cells, MAN2A1 is involved in the synthesis of complex N-glycans, which are important for normal cellular functions, including protein folding, stability, and cell-cell interactions (Shi2020Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance
The MAN2A1 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in glycosylation processes. Altered expression of MAN2A1 is associated with T cell dysfunction in tumors, which can negatively impact the immune response to cancer. High expression levels of MAN2A1 in tumor tissues, such as melanoma and lung cancer, are linked to resistance against T cell-mediated killing, suggesting a role in immune evasion by tumors (Shi2020Inhibition). Inhibition of MAN2A1 has been shown to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapies, such as anti-PD-L1, by improving T cell infiltration and activation in the tumor microenvironment (Shi2020Inhibition).

The MAN2A1 gene is also part of a fusion gene with FER, known as MAN2A1-FER, which is expressed in several human tumors, including liver, prostate, and lung cancers. This fusion gene exhibits oncogenic activity by activating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway, leading to increased tumor growth and metastasis. The presence of MAN2A1-FER is associated with poor clinical outcomes and increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2017MAN2A1–FER).
