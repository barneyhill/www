# RALGAPA2

## Overview
RALGAPA2 is a gene that encodes the Ral GTPase activating protein catalytic subunit alpha 2, a critical component of the Ral GTPase-activating protein complex. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that regulates the activity of Ral GTPases, specifically RalA and RalB, by facilitating their conversion from an active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound state. The Ral GTPases are involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell proliferation. RALGAPA2 is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells, such as those in the colon and prostate, where it plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis by suppressing cell migration and invasion. Dysregulation of RALGAPA2 has been associated with increased Ral activity, contributing to cancer progression and other diseases (Iida2020Downregulation; Uegaki2019Downregulation).

## Structure


## Function
RALGAPA2 encodes a catalytic subunit of the Ral GTPase-activating protein complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of Ral GTPases, specifically RalA and RalB. These small GTPases are involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell proliferation. RALGAPA2 functions by converting Ral GTPases from an active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound state, thereby modulating their signaling pathways (Iida2020Downregulation; Wagner2020Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, RALGAPA2 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, such as those in the colon and prostate, where it plays a role in maintaining normal cellular functions. It is involved in suppressing cell migration and invasion, which are critical for preventing tumorigenesis. The protein is mainly active in the cytoplasm, where it influences signaling pathways that affect cell growth and differentiation (Iida2020Downregulation; Uegaki2019Downregulation).

The regulation of Ral GTPases by RALGAPA2 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the progression of diseases such as cancer. Its downregulation has been associated with increased Ral activity, leading to enhanced cell migration and invasion, which are key steps in cancer progression (Iida2020Downregulation; Uegaki2019Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
RALGAPA2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating Ral GTPases. In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), RALGAPA2 is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor gene, given its involvement in the Ral GTPase pathway, which is crucial for inhibiting tumorigenesis (Gao2020Identification). In breast cancer, RALGAPA2 expression is influenced by the MALAT1-miR-143-3p axis. The gene is a target of miR-143-3p, and its expression is inversely correlated with miR-143-3p levels. Alterations in this pathway, including a functional SNP rs3827693 in the 3'UTR of RALGAPA2, are associated with breast cancer risk and patient prognosis (Fattahi2020The).

In Behçet disease, RALGAPA2 is part of a protein-protein interaction network involved in immune response and cellular processes. It shows evidence of a recent soft selective sweep in East Asian populations, suggesting a role in the genetic architecture of the disease (Sezgin2022Diverse). Additionally, deletions encompassing RALGAPA2 on chromosome 20p11.2 have been linked to congenital hyperinsulinism and associated features, although the specific role of RALGAPA2 in these conditions remains unclear (Laver2024Chromosome).

## Interactions
RALGAPA2 is a component of the Ral GTPase-activating protein complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of Ral GTPases, including RalA and RalB. These GTPases are involved in various cellular processes such as cell growth and movement. RALGAPA2 interacts with RALGAPB to form a heterodimer that modulates the activity of RalA and RalB, influencing cell signaling pathways related to these processes (O’Donoghue2024Roles).

In the context of breast cancer, RALGAPA2 has been identified as a potential target of miR-143-3p, a microRNA with tumor-suppressive properties. The interaction between miR-143-3p and RALGAPA2 is suggested to be modulated by a functional SNP, rs3827693, located within the 3′UTR region of RALGAPA2 mRNA. This SNP is associated with breast cancer risk, and the presence of the allele G is reported to decrease breast cancer incidence by strengthening the interaction between RALGAPA2 and miR-143-3p (Fattahi2020The). The study indicates an inverse correlation between miR-143-3p and RALGAPA2 transcript levels, suggesting that miR-143-3p may suppress RALGAPA2 expression, although this interaction requires further validation (Fattahi2020The).
