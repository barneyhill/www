# SRGAP2C

## Overview
SRGAP2C is a human-specific gene that encodes the protein SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 2C, which plays a pivotal role in neuronal development and brain evolution. This gene emerged from a partial duplication of the ancestral SRGAP2A gene and is characterized by a truncated open reading frame, resulting in a protein that includes the F-BAR domain but lacks the last 49 amino acids. The SRGAP2C protein is involved in modulating synaptic development by interacting with its ancestral counterpart, SRGAP2A, to form an insoluble complex that targets SRGAP2A for proteasome-mediated degradation. This interaction leads to increased synaptic density and delayed synapse maturation, features that are characteristic of human cortical neurons (Schmidt2019The). The unique structural and functional attributes of SRGAP2C, including its role in enhancing neuronal connectivity and synaptic input integration, underscore its significance in human brain development and its potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders (Sassa2013The; Assendorp2022CTNND2).

## Structure
The SRGAP2C protein is characterized by a truncated open reading frame, resulting in a protein that includes the F-BAR domain but lacks the last 49 amino acids. This truncation is referred to as the Δ49 truncation and contributes to the formation of unstable and insoluble protein aggregates (Schmidt2019The). The F-BAR domain of SRGAP2C is involved in membrane deformation, typically inducing membrane protrusions rather than invaginations, which is a unique feature compared to other F-BAR domains (Sporny2016Molecular). 

SRGAP2C has acquired several non-synonymous mutations, specifically targeting five arginine residues, which are not present in its paralog SRGAP2B. These mutations have been under selective pressure during human evolution and are thought to play a role in the protein's function in synaptic development (Schmidt2019The). The protein's ability to form an insoluble complex with SRGAP2A and target it for proteasome-mediated degradation is a key aspect of its function, affecting synaptic density and maturation in human cortical neurons (Schmidt2019The). 

The SRGAP2C protein's structure and mutations contribute to its unique role in human brain development, distinguishing it from other SRGAP2 paralogs.

## Function
SRGAP2C is a human-specific paralog of the ancestral SRGAP2 gene, playing a crucial role in neuronal development and brain evolution. It emerged from a partial duplication of SRGAP2A and encodes a truncated protein that interacts with SRGAP2A to modulate its function. SRGAP2C inhibits the ancestral SRGAP2A, leading to increased synaptic density and delayed synapse maturation, which are characteristic of human cortical neurons (Schmidt2019The). This inhibition occurs through SRGAP2C's ability to bind to SRGAP2A, forming an insoluble complex that targets SRGAP2A for proteasome-mediated degradation (Schmidt2019The).

SRGAP2C's expression in the developing cortex mimics SRGAP2 deficiency, reducing leading process branching and accelerating neuronal migration, which may contribute to the development of the thicker human neocortex (Sassa2013The). It induces neoteny in dendritic spine maturation, resulting in spines with juvenile characteristics, such as longer necks and increased density, even in adult animals (Sassa2013The). These changes are thought to enhance neuronal connectivity and synaptic input integration, suggesting that SRGAP2C plays a significant role in these processes in the human brain (Sassa2013The).

## Clinical Significance
SRGAP2C, a human-specific paralog of the SRGAP2 gene, has been implicated in several neurological conditions due to its role in synaptic development and neuronal balance. Alterations in SRGAP2C expression are associated with an increased excitatory to inhibitory neuronal ratio, which can lead to seizure susceptibility. This is evidenced by chemically-induced seizure-like behaviors and spontaneous electrographic seizures observed in zebrafish models expressing SRGAP2C (UribeSalazar2024Zebrafish). The gene's influence on synaptic maturation and density, particularly its ability to delay synaptic maturation and increase synaptic density, suggests a potential link to conditions characterized by altered synaptic connectivity, such as epilepsy (Schmidt2019The).

SRGAP2C's interaction with its ancestral gene SRGAP2A, where it inhibits SRGAP2A's function by promoting its degradation, further underscores its role in synaptic development. This interaction is crucial for the unique synaptic traits observed in humans, which may contribute to neurological disorders if dysregulated (Schmidt2019The). The gene's expression in microglia and its impact on microglial membrane dynamics also suggest a role in neuroinflammatory conditions, as altered microglial function is a feature of various neurological diseases (UribeSalazar2024Zebrafish).

## Interactions
SRGAP2C is a human-specific paralog that interacts with its ancestral counterpart, SRGAP2A, to modulate synaptic development. SRGAP2C binds directly to SRGAP2A through their F-BAR domains, forming an insoluble complex that leads to the proteasome-mediated degradation of both proteins. This interaction results in the downregulation of SRGAP2A, increasing synaptic density and delaying synapse maturation, which are characteristic features of human cortical neurons (Schmidt2019The).

The interaction between SRGAP2C and SRGAP2A is facilitated by specific non-synonymous mutations in SRGAP2C, which enhance its ability to form a stable heterodimer with SRGAP2A. These mutations reduce membrane binding and increase the stability of the SRGAP2A:SRGAP2C complex, contributing to the unique function of SRGAP2C in synaptic development (Schmidt2019The).

SRGAP2C also plays a role in regulating the synaptic levels of other proteins, such as SYNGAP1 and CTNND2. It enhances the synaptic accumulation of CTNND2, which is necessary for the recruitment of SYNGAP1, thereby influencing synaptic maturation and neoteny in human neurons (Assendorp2022CTNND2). These interactions highlight the role of SRGAP2C in human brain evolution and its potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders.
