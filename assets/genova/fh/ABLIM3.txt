# ABLIM3

## Overview
ABLIM3 is a gene that encodes the actin binding LIM protein family member 3, a protein involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell-cell adhesion. This protein is characterized by the presence of four LIM domains and a villin headpiece (VHP) domain, which facilitate its interactions with actin filaments and other proteins at adherens junctions (Matsuda2010abLIM3; Krupp2006Actin). ABLIM3 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, lung, liver, and brain, and plays a significant role in embryonic development and cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance, motility, and signal transduction (Matsuda2010abLIM3; Krupp2006Actin). The protein's ability to bind actin and its involvement in the STARS-SRF pathway suggest its importance in cellular responses to mechanical stress and its potential role in cardiac pathology (Li2012The).

## Structure
The ABLIM3 protein is characterized by the presence of four LIM domains and a villin headpiece (VHP) domain. The LIM domains, located at the N-terminal end, are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and are crucial for the recruitment of ABLIM3 to cell-cell contact sites (Matsuda2010abLIM3; Krupp2006Actin). The C-terminal region contains a dematin-like domain, which includes the VHP domain, responsible for binding to actin filaments and associating with actin stress fibers (Matsuda2010abLIM3). 

The protein is predicted to localize in the nucleus with high reliability, although it is also found at adherens junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells, indicating its role in cell junctions and cytoskeletal organization (Matsuda2010abLIM3; Krupp2006Actin). ABLIM3 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, lung, liver, and brain, and is also present in fetal tissues, suggesting a role in embryonic development (Krupp2006Actin). 

While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ABLIM3 are not detailed in the available sources, the presence of conserved domains and its evolutionary conservation across species highlight its structural and functional significance (Krupp2006Actin).

## Function
ABLIM3, or actin binding LIM protein 3, is a component of adherens junctions (AJs) in epithelial and endothelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion and structural integrity. It contains four LIM domains and a dematin-like domain with a villin headpiece (VHP) domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and actin-binding activity, respectively (Matsuda2010abLIM3). The N-terminal LIM domains facilitate the recruitment of ABLIM3 to cell-cell contact sites, while the C-terminal dematin-like domain binds to actin filaments, linking AJ components to circumferential actin bundles (Matsuda2010abLIM3).

ABLIM3 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, lung, liver, and brain, and is involved in embryonic development (Krupp2006Actin). It is thought to function as a bridging molecule between signaling pathways and the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to the organization of filamentous actin and potentially playing a role in small GTPase activation or modulation of actin organization (Matsuda2010abLIM3). ABLIM3's actin-binding capabilities suggest its involvement in cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance, motility, and signal transduction (Krupp2006Actin).

## Interactions
ABLIM3, also known as Actin-binding LIM 3 protein, is involved in interactions with actin filaments and the cytoskeleton. It contains four LIM domains at its N-terminus and a villin headpiece domain at its C-terminus, which is responsible for F-actin binding. ABLIM3 is expressed in the heart and brain across several vertebrates, including humans, mice, zebrafish, and frogs. It directly interacts with F-actin and enhances the STARS (striated muscle activator of Rho signalling)-SRF (stress response factor) pathway. The STARS protein binds to actin stress fibers, activating actin polymerization and Rho GTPase, which is crucial for cell signaling and contractile function in cardiomyocytes. ABLIM3 may also play a role in the pathophysiological response to biomechanical stress by up-regulating STARS as an initial cellular adaptation mechanism. This process potentially involves LIM domain proteins, which enhance transcriptional activation by transmitting Rho signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In cardiac pathology, ABLIM3 might alter cytoskeletal organization, motility, and gene regulation (Li2012The).
