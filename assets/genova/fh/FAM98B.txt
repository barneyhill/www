# FAM98B

## Overview
FAM98B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 98 member B, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly RNA processing. The FAM98B protein is primarily associated with mRNA splicing, a crucial step in post-transcriptional modification, and is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating its multifaceted role in gene expression regulation. It interacts with several proteins and RNA molecules, influencing processes such as cancer progression and liver fibrosis. The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a biomarker in certain diseases (RapierSharman2022Transcriptomic; Liao2023LncRNAGm9866; Akter2017FAM98A).

## Function
FAM98B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily associated with RNA processing. The FAM98B protein plays a significant role in mRNA splicing, a critical step in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, which is essential for the accurate expression of genes. This protein is typically localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in multiple stages of gene expression regulation. Within the nucleus, FAM98B contributes to the splicing of pre-mRNA, ensuring that mature mRNA is correctly processed and exported to the cytoplasm for translation. In the cytoplasm, FAM98B may be involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the stability and translation of mRNA. Through these activities, FAM98B influences the overall gene expression profile of the cell, impacting various cellular functions and organismal outcomes. Its role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
FAM98B has been implicated in the progression of several cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions with other proteins. In colorectal cancer, FAM98B is overexpressed, and its expression correlates positively with PRMT1, a protein involved in methylation processes. The interaction between FAM98B and PRMT1 is crucial for maintaining PRMT1 expression and methylation patterns, which are important for cancer cell proliferation and colony formation. Knockdown of FAM98B reduces these malignant characteristics, highlighting its role in colorectal tumorigenesis (Akter2017FAM98A).

In non-Hodgkin’s B-cell lymphomas (BCNHL), FAM98B is significantly upregulated and identified as a potential biomarker. Its expression is associated with pathways related to the extracellular matrix, suggesting a role in the disease's molecular mechanisms. The gene's upregulation in BCNHL indicates its potential as a diagnostic marker (RapierSharman2022Transcriptomic; RapierSharman2022Joint).

FAM98B also influences breast cancer susceptibility through its interaction with the TGFB1 gene promoter. A specific genetic variant in TGFB1 affects its binding with FAM98B, altering promoter activity and potentially impacting cancer risk (Zhou2020Effect).

## Interactions
FAM98B is involved in several protein interactions that are significant in the context of cancer progression and liver fibrosis. In colorectal cancer, FAM98B interacts with PRMT1, an RNA binding protein, forming a complex that includes DDX1 and C14orf166. This complex is crucial for the expression of PRMT1 and is associated with cancer cell proliferation and growth. The interaction between FAM98B and PRMT1 was confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated strong binding in 293T cells. Knockdown of FAM98B was shown to reduce PRMT1 expression and alter methylation patterns in substrate proteins, indicating a regulatory role in protein arginine methylation (Akter2017FAM98A).

In liver fibrosis, FAM98B interacts with lncRNA-Gm9866, which regulates the TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway. This interaction was confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) analysis and co-localization studies in AML12 and JS-1 cells. Although lncRNA-Gm9866 does not affect the stability of FAM98B mRNA, it is suggested to regulate the transcription or maturation of FAM98B. Silencing FAM98B can mitigate the pro-fibrogenic and pro-apoptosis effects induced by lncRNA-Gm9866 overexpression, highlighting its role in liver fibrosis (Liao2023LncRNAGm9866).
