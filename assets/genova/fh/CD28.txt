# CD28

## Overview
CD28 is a gene that encodes the CD28 protein, a critical co-stimulatory receptor expressed on the surface of T cells. This protein is a type I transmembrane receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and plays a pivotal role in T cell activation and immune response regulation. The CD28 protein is characterized by its extracellular immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, which are essential for its structural integrity and function (Liu2019Structures; Krupa2021Prediction). Functionally, CD28 interacts with ligands CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells, providing a necessary second signal for T cell activation, which is crucial for cytokine production, cell survival, and differentiation (Esensten2016CD28). The gene and its encoded protein are also implicated in various T-cell neoplasms, where mutations can lead to altered signaling pathways and contribute to disease pathogenesis (Rohr2015Recurrent; Sakamoto2020Clinical).

## Structure
The CD28 protein is a type I transmembrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). It is composed of an extracellular immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Liu2019Structures; Krupa2021Prediction). The extracellular domain features a two-layered 'β sandwich' fold, consisting of two antiparallel β-sheets. The front sheet is formed by the A, G, F, C, C', and C'' strands, while the back sheet is formed by the A, B, E, and D strands. A disulfide bond stabilizes the structure by linking the F and B strands (Liu2019Structures).

CD28 forms a homodimer through a disulfide bond in the stalk region, with the dimeric interface primarily involving nonpolar residues on the A, F, G strands, and CC', EF loops (Liu2019Structures). The cytoplasmic domain of CD28 is dynamic and lacks secondary structures, as indicated by NMR relaxation experiments (Yang2017Dynamic). It interacts with lipid bilayers, with key tyrosines in the YxxM and PYAP motifs embedded in the membrane's hydrophobic core (Yang2017Dynamic). CD28 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which influence its function and interactions (Krupa2021Prediction).

## Function
The CD28 molecule is a critical co-stimulatory receptor on T cells, essential for their activation and function. It provides a necessary second signal for T cell activation alongside T cell receptor (TCR) ligation, influencing various cellular processes such as cytokine production, survival, and differentiation (Esensten2016CD28). CD28 interacts with ligands CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which are crucial for initiating and regulating immune responses (Esensten2016CD28). This interaction enhances TCR signaling and mediates unique signaling events, including phosphorylation and transcriptional changes, which are vital for T cell responses during antigen recognition (Esensten2016CD28).

CD28 signaling is involved in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, necessary for TCR signaling and CD28-autonomous functions. It activates pathways like the PI3K-PDK1-PKB pathway, which regulates apoptosis, protein synthesis, and cellular metabolism (Rudd2003Unifying). CD28 also influences transcriptional programs, stabilizing mRNA of cytokines like IL-2, crucial for T cell survival (Esensten2016CD28). It plays a role in the immunological synapse, organizing proteins necessary for effective TCR signaling (Esensten2016CD28). CD28 is vital for maintaining immune homeostasis, supporting regulatory T cell function, and preventing autoimmunity (Esensten2016CD28).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD28 gene are implicated in various T-cell neoplasms, including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). In ATL, CD28 gene alterations such as fusions, activating mutations, and copy number variations are found in 33% of patients, correlating with a more aggressive disease course and resistance to conventional treatments (Sakamoto2020Clinical). In PTCL, particularly angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), recurrent mutations like D124V and T195P enhance ligand binding and intracellular signaling, contributing to disease pathogenesis and poor survival outcomes (Rohr2015Recurrent; Lee2015A). These mutations increase the affinity for ligands such as CD86 and adaptor proteins like GRB2, leading to enhanced T-cell activation and proliferation (Rohr2015Recurrent).

In CTCL, CD28 mutations result in a gain of function, increasing T-cell proliferation and IL-2 secretion, which may accelerate tumor growth (Gmyrek2017Functional). These mutations are associated with increased binding to CD80 and CD86, driving clonal expansion of malignant cells (Gmyrek2017Functional). CD28 mutations and fusions are also linked to altered signaling pathways, impacting the pathogenesis of T-cell lymphomas (Vallois2018RNA).

## Interactions
The CD28 molecule is involved in several critical physical interactions with proteins that are essential for T cell activation and signaling. CD28 interacts with its ligands, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), on antigen-presenting cells, which is crucial for delivering a co-stimulatory signal necessary for T cell activation (Esensten2016CD28; Acuto2003CD28mediated). These interactions are characterized by high on-and off-rate constants, with CD28 binding to CD80 and CD86 with affinities of 4 µM and 20 µM, respectively (Acuto2003CD28mediated).

The cytoplasmic tail of CD28 contains conserved tyrosine-based signaling motifs, such as the YMNM motif, which is phosphorylated in response to TCR or CD28 stimulation. This motif binds to the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), facilitating the activation of PI3K and subsequent signaling pathways (Truitt1994Stimulation; June1994The). CD28 also interacts with Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing proteins like Grb2, which are involved in downstream signaling events (Alegre2001Tcell).

CD28 is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through proteins such as Vav1, which can be recruited via GRB2 binding. Vav1 activates Rho GTPases, key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and can bind to talin and vinculin, anchoring the actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane (Esensten2016CD28). These interactions highlight the role of CD28 in modulating T-cell responses through various protein-protein interactions.
