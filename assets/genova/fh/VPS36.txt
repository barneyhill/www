# VPS36

## Overview
VPS36 is a gene that encodes the vacuolar protein sorting 36 homolog, a crucial component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport II (ESCRT-II) in humans. The VPS36 protein is integral to the process of endosomal sorting, which is essential for the trafficking and degradation of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. This protein is characterized by its phosphoinositide-binding GLUE domain, which facilitates its interaction with specific phosphoinositides and ubiquitin, thereby playing a pivotal role in membrane targeting and cargo recognition. VPS36 is involved in the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation, impacting cellular signaling and homeostasis. The protein's interactions with other ESCRT components and regulatory proteins, such as Arl4A and RILP, underscore its significance in endosomal trafficking and its potential implications in diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Lin2023Endosomal; Verma2012Curcumin; Im2008Integrated).

## Structure
The VPS36 protein is a component of the human ESCRT-II complex, which plays a crucial role in endosomal sorting. The primary structure of VPS36 includes a phosphoinositide-binding GLUE domain at the N-terminal region, which is important for membrane targeting (Im2008Integrated). This domain interacts with specific phosphoinositides such as PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,5)P2 (Im2008Integrated). Unlike its yeast counterpart, the human VPS36 lacks Npl4-type zinc finger domains and instead interacts with ubiquitin via a nonconserved site on the GLUE domain (Im2008Integrated).

The secondary structure of VPS36 includes a dynamic helical domain, which is part of the novel helical domain not present in yeast (Im2008Integrated). The tertiary structure reveals that VPS36 contains two winged helix (WH) domains, with the N-terminal WH domain packing against the C-terminal WH domain in a head-to-tail manner (Im2008Integrated). The quaternary structure of the ESCRT-II complex, which includes VPS36, is described as a trilobal shape with extensive interfaces between VPS22 and VPS36 (Im2008Integrated).

VPS36 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may influence its function and interactions.

## Function
VPS36 is a component of the ESCRT-II complex, which plays a critical role in the endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. This process is essential for the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are involved in the degradation of proteins via lysosomes. In healthy human cells, VPS36 is active in the cytoplasm and endosomal compartments, where it contributes to the sorting and trafficking of proteins (Alfred2016When; Lin2023Endosomal).

The ESCRT-II complex, including VPS36, provides a scaffold for the assembly of the ESCRT-III complex, which is crucial for the invagination and budding of the endosomal membrane, leading to the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within MVBs (Alfred2016When). VPS36 contains a 'GLUE' domain that interacts with ubiquitin and phosphoinositide-bearing membranes, facilitating the recruitment of ESCRT-II to the endosome membrane and playing a role in cargo recognition (Li2015The).

VPS36 is also involved in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation. It interacts with the protein Arl4A, which modulates the association of VPS36 with other ESCRT components, affecting EGFR ubiquitination and degradation (Lin2023Endosomal). This interaction is important for maintaining cellular signaling and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the VPS36 gene, a component of the ESCRT-II complex, have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the interaction between VPS36 and the Arl4A protein is crucial for regulating the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Disruption of this interaction, such as through mutations in VPS36 that impair Arl4A binding, can lead to altered EGFR degradation rates, potentially affecting cancer progression (Lin2023Endosomal).

In neurodegenerative disorders, VPS36 is involved in protein trafficking and aggregate formation. Curcumin, a compound with potential therapeutic effects, has been shown to inhibit the formation of polyglutamine aggregates by downregulating VPS36. This suggests that alterations in VPS36 expression could influence the development of amyloid disorders, such as Huntington's disease, by affecting protein aggregation processes (Verma2012Curcumin).

In Drosophila models, mutations in VPS36 have been associated with increased apoptotic resistance and distinct phenotypes compared to other ESCRT-II components, indicating its unique role in cellular processes that could be relevant to tumor formation and growth (Herz2009Common).

## Interactions
VPS36 is a component of the ESCRT-II complex and participates in various protein-protein interactions essential for its function in endosomal sorting. VPS36 interacts with other ESCRT-II components, including VPS22 and VPS25, forming a core complex that is crucial for the recruitment and assembly of the ESCRT machinery on endosomal membranes (Wang2006RILP). This interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating a direct association between VPS36 and VPS22 (Wang2006RILP).

VPS36 also interacts with the protein Arl4A, which modulates its localization at multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and affects the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The interaction between VPS36 and Arl4A is critical for regulating EGFR ubiquitination and sorting into MVBs, impacting EGFR degradation (Lin2023Endosomal). Mutations in the VPS36 region critical for Arl4A binding reduce this interaction, affecting VPS36's localization but not its ability to form the ESCRT-II complex (Lin2023Endosomal).

Additionally, VPS36 interacts with RILP, a protein involved in endosomal membrane recruitment. This interaction is essential for the selective recruitment of ESCRT-II subunits to membranes, highlighting the specific regulatory role of RILP in endosomal trafficking (Wang2006RILP).
