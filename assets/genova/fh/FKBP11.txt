# FKBP11

## Overview
FKBP11 is a gene that encodes the FKBP prolyl isomerase 11 protein, a member of the FK506-binding protein family. This protein is characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity, which plays a critical role in protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. FKBP11 is particularly involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), assisting in the proper folding of antibodies during the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells (Preisendörfer2022FK506Binding). The protein is predominantly expressed in plasma cells and is crucial for the folding of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, acting as a plasma cell-specific antibody folding catalyst (Preisendörfer2022FK506Binding). FKBP11's activity can be inhibited by tacrolimus (FK506), highlighting its role in immune regulation (Preisendörfer2022FK506Binding). Additionally, FKBP11 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including bone formation, inflammation, and cancer progression, through its interactions with other proteins and pathways (Wang2017Weighted; Tsukamoto2013Role).

## Function
The FKBP11 gene encodes a protein that functions as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), which is involved in protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. This protein plays a crucial role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response related to the ER, by assisting in the correct folding of antibodies, particularly during the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells (Preisendörfer2022FK506Binding). FKBP11 is upregulated in response to ER stress and is regulated by the transcription factor XBP1, which is a key regulator of the UPR (Preisendörfer2022FK506Binding).

In healthy human cells, FKBP11 is predominantly expressed in plasma cells and is involved in the folding of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, acting as a plasma cell-specific antibody folding catalyst (Preisendörfer2022FK506Binding). The protein's activity can be inhibited by tacrolimus (FK506), indicating its role in the immune system's regulation (Preisendörfer2022FK506Binding). FKBP11 is also associated with increased serum levels of IgG3 and correlates with increased plasmablasts in autoimmune conditions, suggesting its involvement in immune regulation (Preisendörfer2022FK506Binding).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FKBP11 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), FKBP11 is overexpressed in B cells, leading to a breakdown of B cell tolerance and the initiation of plasma cell differentiation, which are characteristic features of lupus (Ruer‐Laventie2015Overexpression). This overexpression is associated with increased plasmablast differentiation, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune conditions like lupus (Ruer‐Laventie2015Overexpression).

In cancer, FKBP11 is overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Knockdown of FKBP11 in OSCC cells results in inhibited cell proliferation, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer progression through p53-related pathways (Qiu2021FKBP11). Similarly, in osteosarcoma, FKBP11 is highly expressed and contributes to the malignancy of cancer cells by promoting cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, while its silencing leads to increased apoptosis (Zeng2023FKBP11).

In acute aortic dissection (AAD), FKBP11 is upregulated and contributes to inflammation through interaction with the NF-kB pathway, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for AAD (Wang2017Weighted).

## Interactions
FKBP11, a member of the FK506-binding protein family, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in osteoblast cells. It interacts with the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5) to form a complex with CD81 and the prostaglandin F2 receptor negative regulator (FPRP). This complex is crucial for the dissociation of CD9, which is linked to the expression of interferon-induced genes and bone formation (Hanagata2011Osteoblastenriched; Tsukamoto2013Role). The interaction between FKBP11 and IFITM5 is dependent on the S-palmitoylation of specific cysteine residues on IFITM5, which is necessary for the formation of the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex (Tsukamoto2013Role).

In the context of acute aortic dissection, FKBP11 interacts with the NF-kB pathway, specifically with the p65 subunit. This interaction promotes the nuclear translocation of p65 and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, highlighting FKBP11's role in inflammatory processes (Wang2017Weighted). FKBP11 is also involved in the unfolded protein response, where it is regulated by the transcription factor XBP1, suggesting a role in protein folding and stress responses (Preisendörfer2022FK506Binding).
