# PRIM2

## Overview
PRIM2 is a gene that encodes the DNA primase subunit 2, a critical component of the eukaryotic DNA polymerase α-primase complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in DNA replication by synthesizing RNA primers necessary for the initiation of DNA strand synthesis. As a part of the primase enzyme complex, DNA primase subunit 2 is involved in the formation of RNA-DNA hybrid molecules, which are essential for the replication of both leading and lagging DNA strands. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain, which facilitate its interaction with other subunits within the polymerase complex and contribute to its functional flexibility during primer synthesis (Yuan2023Molecular; Frick2001DNA). The activity of PRIM2 is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer (Wang2022PRIM2).

## Structure
The PRIM2 protein, also known as DNA primase subunit 2, is a component of the eukaryotic DNA polymerase α-primase complex, which is essential for DNA replication. PRIM2 is composed of distinct structural domains, including an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), which are flexibly linked and allow for significant conformational changes during primer synthesis (Yuan2023Molecular). The NTD contains a small α/β subdomain that interacts with the Pri1 subunit and the C-terminal peptide of Pol1, facilitating the connection between the primase and polymerase within the Pol α complex (Yuan2023Molecular).

The CTD of PRIM2, also referred to as PRIM2 C, is involved in regulating RNA synthesis, including the length of RNA primers. It interacts with the primer 5′-triphosphate and the template 3′-overhang, which is believed to limit the RNA length synthesized by PRIM1 (Mullins2023A). The CTD also coordinates a 4Fe-4S cluster, which is crucial for its structural integrity (Yuan2023Molecular).

PRIM2 functions as part of a heterotetrameric complex, interacting with other subunits such as POLA1, POLA2, and PRIM1, to form the DNA polymerase α-primase complex (Mullins2023A). The structural flexibility of PRIM2 is essential for its role in primer synthesis, allowing it to accommodate the RNA/DNA duplex and facilitate the transition from RNA to DNA synthesis (Yuan2023Molecular).

## Function
PRIM2, also known as DNA primase subunit 2, is a crucial component of the DNA primase enzyme complex involved in DNA replication. In human cells, PRIM2 forms part of the Pol α/primase complex, which is essential for synthesizing RNA primers. These primers are necessary for DNA polymerase to initiate DNA strand synthesis during the S phase of the cell cycle (Frick2001DNA; MuziFalconi2003The). The Pol α/primase complex consists of four subunits, including the large primase subunit encoded by the PRIM2 gene, which plays a critical role in coordinating primase and polymerase activities (Frick2001DNA).

The large subunit of the primase, encoded by PRIM2, is involved in the initiation of primer synthesis, a process essential for the replication of both leading and lagging DNA strands. This subunit stabilizes the small primase subunit, facilitating the synthesis of RNA primers that are extended by DNA polymerase α to form RNA-DNA hybrid molecules (Frick2001DNA; MuziFalconi2003The). The interaction between the small and large subunits is vital for efficient primer synthesis, ensuring accurate DNA replication and cell division (Frick2001DNA).

## Clinical Significance
PRIM2 (DNA primase subunit 2) has been implicated in the progression of lung cancer, particularly in cases with p53 mutations. In lung cancer, PRIM2 is often upregulated, which is associated with enhanced DNA replication, mismatch repair, and cell cycle activation, contributing to tumor progression (Wang2022PRIM2). High expression levels of PRIM2 correlate with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for malignancy and survival prognosis (Wang2022PRIM2).

In p53-mutant lung cancer cells, PRIM2 expression is significantly increased, indicating its regulation by the p53 and RB signaling pathways. This upregulation is linked to increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), further supporting its role in tumor progression (Wang2022PRIM2). Knockdown of PRIM2 in lung cancer cells results in reduced CDK4 expression and increased cellular senescence, highlighting its role in cell cycle regulation (Wang2022PRIM2).

Additionally, PRIM2 has been identified as a target for dihydroartemisinin (DHA) treatment, which inhibits lung cancer cell proliferation by reducing PRIM2 expression and inducing ferroptosis. This suggests that targeting PRIM2 could be a novel therapeutic approach for lung cancer (p&gt; Dihydroartemisinin; Yuan2020&lt).

## Interactions
PRIM2, also known as DNA primase subunit 2, is a component of the human primase complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA replication by synthesizing RNA primers. PRIM2 interacts with the catalytic subunit of the primase, PRIM1, forming a heterodimer essential for primase activity. This interaction is vital for the initiation of RNA primer synthesis, which is subsequently extended by DNA polymerase alpha (Polα) (Baranovskiy2017Elaborated).

The p58 subunit of PRIM2 has two domains: an N-terminal domain with a mixed α/β-fold and a C-terminal domain containing an iron-sulfur cluster important for folding. These domains facilitate interactions with the DNA template and the RNA primer during synthesis (Baranovskiy2017Elaborated). PRIM2, particularly its p58C subunit, is responsible for holding the DNA:RNA duplex and recognizing the 5′-triphosphate group of the RNA primer, which is crucial for primase activity (Baranovskiy2017Elaborated).

PRIM2 also interacts with DNA polymerase alpha, specifically with its C-terminal domain, to regulate the transition from RNA primer synthesis to DNA elongation. This interaction is essential for tethering the primase to the replisome, ensuring efficient DNA replication (Kilkenny2012A).
