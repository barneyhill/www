# DYRK1B

## Overview
The DYRK1B gene encodes the protein dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1B, which is a member of the CMGC group of kinases. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and signaling pathways. DYRK1B is characterized by its ability to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate other substrates, influencing their stability and activity. It is involved in critical pathways such as the RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling cascade and the Hedgehog signaling pathway, impacting cell survival and differentiation (Singh2018DYRK1B; Ashford2015Identification). Mutations in the DYRK1B gene have been linked to metabolic disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Abu2017DYRK1B; Ashford2015Identification). The protein's interactions with molecular chaperones and other signaling molecules underscore its complex regulatory functions within the cell (Papenfuss2022Differential).

## Structure
The DYRK1B protein is a kinase involved in various cellular processes, characterized by a conserved kinase domain that is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The primary structure of DYRK1B includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, such as the DYRK homology box (DH) at the N-terminus and a PEST sequence at the C-terminus, which are important for autophosphorylation and degradation, respectively (Grygier2022Structural). 

The secondary structure of DYRK1B features a bilobal fold typical of CMGC group kinases, with an N-terminal lobe composed mainly of β-sheets and a C-terminal lobe primarily consisting of α-helices. This structure supports the active DFG-in conformation, essential for its kinase activity (Grygier2022Structural). 

In terms of tertiary structure, the protein's 3D shape is stabilized by interactions within the kinase domain, including a glycine-rich loop and DFG motif involved in ATP binding (Grygier2022Structural). The quaternary structure involves potential interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications, such as autophosphorylation at Tyr273, are critical for the stability and function of DYRK1B (Grygier2022Structural). The protein may also have splice variant isoforms, which result from alternative splicing of mRNA, although specific variants are not detailed in the context.

## Function
DYRK1B is a kinase involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation by promoting cell cycle arrest. This is achieved through mechanisms such as the degradation of cyclin D1 and the increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors like p21 CIP1 and p27 KIP1 (Ashford2015Identification; Becker2012Emerging). DYRK1B is also involved in the regulation of protein stability, particularly through phosphorylation, which stabilizes the CDK inhibitor p27 Kip1, maintaining its inhibitory effect on CDK2 and controlling the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle (Becker2012Emerging).

DYRK1B undergoes autophosphorylation, which is crucial for its kinase activity, and is a substrate for ERK2, linking it to the RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This connection suggests a role in signaling pathways that determine cell survival and differentiation (Ashford2015Identification). DYRK1B also influences microtubule stability and acetylation, which are essential for cellular processes associated with the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Singh2018DYRK1B). The kinase is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting organismal outcomes like growth and development (Abu2017DYRK1B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DYRK1B gene are associated with a rare form of metabolic syndrome known as abdominal obesity-metabolic syndrome 3 (AOMS3). This condition is characterized by early-onset coronary artery disease, hypertension, central obesity, and diabetes. Specific mutations, such as H90P and R102C, have been identified to co-segregate with AOMS3, leading to impaired chaperone-dependent maturation of the kinase domain and resulting in protein misfolding and aggregation (Keramati2014A; Abu2017DYRK1B). These mutations do not alter the specific activity of the mature kinase but cause the mutant protein to accumulate in detergent-insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates, contributing to the metabolic syndrome phenotype (Abu2017DYRK1B).

DYRK1B is also implicated in cancer, where it is overexpressed in certain tumors, such as pancreatic cancer, due to gene amplification. While some mutations found in cancer, like L28P and R102H, generally result in normal or reduced kinase activity, DYRK1B's role in oncogenesis may be context-dependent, potentially acting as an oncogene or even having tumor suppressor functions (Ashford2015Identification). The gene's interaction with ERK1/2, where phosphorylation at S421 enhances its kinase activity, suggests a complex regulatory mechanism that could influence its role in cancer and metabolic syndrome (Ashford2015Identification).

## Interactions
DYRK1B interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It is a client of the HSP90 chaperone and interacts strongly with the co-chaperone CDC37, which is crucial for its maturation and stability. This interaction is more pronounced in DYRK1B compared to its paralog DYRK1A, correlating with DYRK1B's thermal instability (Papenfuss2022Differential; Abu2017DYRK1B). Pathogenic mutations in DYRK1B enhance its interaction with CDC37, potentially impairing its maturation (Abu2017DYRK1B).

DYRK1B also interacts with the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. It is phosphorylated by ERK2 at the S421 site, which is crucial for its kinase activity. This phosphorylation event links DYRK1B to the RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, influencing cell fate decisions (Ashford2015Identification). DYRK1B's interaction with ERK1/2 suggests a regulatory role where ERK1/2 modulates DYRK1B activity and expression (Ashford2015Identification).

In the context of spinal cord development, DYRK1B interacts with the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, acting as a transcriptional repressor of Shh pathway components, which affects neuronal differentiation and apoptosis (Kokkorakis2024MirkDyrk1B).
