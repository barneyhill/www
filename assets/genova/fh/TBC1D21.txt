# TBC1D21

## Overview
TBC1D21 is a gene that encodes the TBC1 domain family member 21 protein, which plays a critical role in the formation and function of mitochondria and the axoneme in mammalian sperm. This protein is categorized as a regulator of small GTP-binding proteins, particularly those in the Rab family, which are essential for intracellular vesicular traffic and cytoskeleton remodeling. TBC1 domain family member 21 is specifically expressed in post-meiotic male germ cells and is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm tail, affecting the midpiece and axoneme structures necessary for sperm motility and fertility. The protein interacts with key components such as TOMM20 and DNAH7, which are involved in mitochondrial protein import and axoneme structure, respectively. Deficiency in TBC1D21 is linked to male infertility due to structural defects in sperm mitochondria and axoneme, and it has also been associated with exfoliation syndrome and exfoliation glaucoma in certain populations (Nakano2014Novel; Wang2020Deficiency).

## Function
The TBC1D21 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for the formation and function of mitochondria and the axoneme in mammalian sperm. This protein is involved in organizing and maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm tail, particularly affecting the midpiece and axoneme structures, which are essential for sperm motility and fertility (Wang2020Deficiency). TBC1D21 interacts with TOMM20, a component of the mitochondrial importing complex, and DNAH7, a component of the inner dynein arm of ciliary axonemes, suggesting its role in the proper import of mitochondrial proteins and the structural integrity of the axoneme (Wang2020Deficiency).

In healthy human cells, TBC1D21 is specifically expressed in post-meiotic male germ cells, localized at elongated spermatids and mature sperm, indicating its specialized role in spermatogenesis (Wang2020Deficiency). The protein is also involved in the regulation of small GTP-binding proteins, particularly those in the Rab family, which are essential for intracellular vesicular traffic and cytoskeleton remodeling (Wang2020Deficiency). Deficiency in TBC1D21 leads to structural defects in sperm mitochondria and axoneme, resulting in reduced motility and male infertility, highlighting its critical role in male reproductive health (Wang2020Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
The TBC1D21 gene is associated with male infertility, particularly due to its role in sperm tail structure and function. Deficiency in TBC1D21 in mice leads to male infertility characterized by defects in sperm tail structure, reduced sperm motility, and morphological abnormalities in sperm mitochondria and flagellum. These defects are consistent with teratozoospermia, a condition in humans characterized by abnormal sperm morphology. In Tbc1d21 knockout mice, there are ultrastructural defects in the sperm tail, specifically in the midpiece and axoneme, leading to decreased sperm motility and infertility. The loss of TBC1D21 affects its interactors, TOMM20 and DNAH7, which are involved in mitochondrial protein import and axoneme structure, respectively (Wang2020Deficiency).

In humans, TBC1D21 transcripts are downregulated in sperm from men with teratozoospermia, suggesting its crucial role in the formation of intact mitochondria and axoneme in sperm. This downregulation indicates that TBC1D21 deficiency can lead to male infertility (Wang2020Deficiency).

Additionally, TBC1D21 has been implicated in exfoliation syndrome (XFS) and exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) in Asian populations. A genome-wide association study identified significant variants in TBC1D21, suggesting a potential relationship with the LOXL1 gene, known to be involved in XFS/XFG pathogenesis (Nakano2014Novel).

## Interactions
TBC1D21 is known to interact with several proteins that are crucial for sperm tail formation and function. Two key interactors of TBC1D21 are TOMM20 and DNAH7. TOMM20 is a component of the mitochondrial importing complex, which is responsible for translocating proteins across the mitochondrial outer membrane. DNAH7 is a part of the inner dynein arm of ciliary axonemes and is highly expressed in the testes. The interaction between TBC1D21 and these proteins is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of mitochondria and axonemes in sperm cells. In TBC1D21-deficient sperm, TOMM20 and DNAH7 fail to align properly with the axoneme, leading to their detachment and dispersion, which results in structural defects in the sperm tail (Wang2020Deficiency).

The study also utilized a Duolink proximity ligation assay to confirm the physical co-localization of TBC1D21 with TOMM20 and DNAH7 in vivo, highlighting the importance of these interactions in sperm development. These findings suggest that TBC1D21 plays a critical role in the transportation, loading, or adhesion of mitochondria into the midpiece of sperm, although it is not essential for the formation of the annulus structure (Wang2020Deficiency).
