# DOCK7

## Overview
The DOCK7 gene encodes the dedicator of cytokinesis 7 protein, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) primarily involved in the activation of Rho family GTPases, such as Rac1 and Cdc42. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including axon formation, neuronal polarization, and the regulation of microtubule stability, which are essential for proper brain development and function (Kivrak2022Homozygosity). DOCK7 is highly expressed in the brain during early developmental stages and is crucial for interkinetic nuclear migration and neurogenesis of radial glial progenitor cells (Kivrak2022Homozygosity). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the c-Met receptor and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), underscore its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration (YAMAMOTO2012DOCK7; Murray2014Guanine). Mutations in the DOCK7 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 23 (EIEE23), and have implications in coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke (Li2018DOCK7ANGPTL3; Kivrak2022Homozygosity).

## Function
The DOCK7 gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is crucial for the activation of the Rho family GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Cdc42, through its DOCK homology region 2 (DHR-2) domain. This activation is essential for various cellular processes, including axon formation and neuronal polarization, which are critical during brain development (Kivrak2022Homozygosity). DOCK7 is highly expressed in the brain during early developmental stages and plays a significant role in regulating microtubule stability in nascent axons by activating Rac1 and inactivating the microtubule-destabilizing protein Op18. This regulation is vital for proper axon development, as demonstrated by in vitro experiments where DOCK7 knockdown in hippocampal neurons prevents axon formation, while its overexpression promotes the formation of multiple axons (Kivrak2022Homozygosity).

In addition to its role in neuronal development, DOCK7 is involved in the regulation of interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) and neurogenesis of radial glial progenitor cells during cortical development, in conjunction with TACC3 (Kivrak2022Homozygosity). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, influencing cell morphology, migration, and differentiation, which are crucial for brain development and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DOCK7 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. One such condition is early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 23 (EIEE23), a severe disorder characterized by frequent seizures, intellectual disability, and cortical blindness. Pathogenic variants in DOCK7, often truncating, have been linked to autosomal recessive EIEE23, with symptoms including dysmorphic features and early-onset epilepsy (Kivrak2022Homozygosity). A specific case involved a novel homozygous frameshift variant in the DOCK7 gene, resulting from segmental uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 1, which led to the homozygosity of the pathogenic variant (Kivrak2022Homozygosity).

Another disorder associated with DOCK7 mutations is characterized by early-onset epilepsy, intellectual disability, and behavioral impairments. Physical features such as low ear implantation and brachycephaly are also noted in affected individuals (Lopes2023Neurodevelopmental). The DOCK7 gene plays a crucial role in neurogenesis, glial cell differentiation, and neuroblast migration, and its dysfunction can lead to significant neurodevelopmental challenges (Lopes2023Neurodevelopmental).

In addition to neurological disorders, the DOCK7 gene has been implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS) through its association with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect serum lipid levels and atherosclerosis severity (Li2018DOCK7ANGPTL3).

## Interactions
DOCK7 is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the c-Met receptor in glioblastoma cells, a process mediated by the Gab1 scaffold protein. This interaction is enhanced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation, which is essential for glioblastoma cell invasion. Gab1 is necessary for the HGF-stimulated binding of DOCK7 to c-Met, suggesting that DOCK7 is recruited to the receptor complex upon Gab1 binding to the activated receptor (Murray2014Guanine).

DOCK7 also interacts with the E2 protein of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV). This interaction was confirmed in swine cells using proximity ligation assay and co-immunoprecipitation. However, this interaction does not appear to be involved in viral replication or pathogenicity (Vuono2023The).

In the context of human cancer cells, DOCK7 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). This interaction is crucial for the activation of the small GTPase Cdc42, leading to the formation of dendritic pseudopodia and affecting cellular migration (YAMAMOTO2012DOCK7). These interactions highlight DOCK7's role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration.
