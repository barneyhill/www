# RBM34

## Overview
RBM34 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 34, which is involved in various cellular processes through its role in RNA binding and regulation. The protein belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins characterized by the presence of RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which facilitate the interaction with RNA molecules. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of RNA splicing, stability, and translation, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular function. The precise biological roles and mechanisms of RBM34 are still under investigation, but it is implicated in several pathways that are essential for normal cellular operations and may have potential implications in disease contexts.
