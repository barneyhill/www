# GMPR

## Overview
The GMPR gene encodes the enzyme guanosine monophosphate reductase, a critical component of the purine salvage pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the NADPH-dependent conversion of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), a reaction that is essential for maintaining the balance of nucleotide pools within cells, thereby influencing DNA and RNA synthesis as well as energy metabolism (Spector1979Reaction; Li2006Crystal). Guanosine monophosphate reductase is primarily located in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Sommerville2019Identification). In humans, two isoenzymes, hGMPR1 and hGMPR2, have been identified, both of which exhibit similar kinetic properties and utilize NADPH as a coenzyme (Li2006Crystal). The enzyme's activity is modulated by various factors, including GTP and xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), which act as a nonessential activator and a competitive inhibitor, respectively (Spector1979Reaction). GMPR has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including non-shivering thermogenesis and monocytic differentiation, as well as diseases such as Alzheimer's and cutaneous melanoma (Liu2022Identification; Li2006Crystal; Liu2017Guanosine; Zhang2003Cloning).

## Function
The GMPR gene encodes the enzyme guanosine monophosphate reductase, which plays a critical role in the purine salvage pathway by catalyzing the irreversible, NADPH-dependent conversion of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP) (Spector1979Reaction; Li2006Crystal). This reaction is essential for maintaining the balance of guanine and adenine nucleotide pools within cells, impacting DNA and RNA synthesis and energy metabolism (Hedstrom2012The). GMPR activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular proliferation and differentiation (Sommerville2019Identification).

In humans, there are two isoenzymes, hGMPR1 and hGMPR2, which have similar kinetic properties and both prefer NADPH as a coenzyme (Li2006Crystal). The enzyme's activity is modulated by various activators and inhibitors, including GTP, which acts as a nonessential activator, and xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), a competitive inhibitor (Spector1979Reaction). GMPR is involved in various physiological processes, such as non-shivering thermogenesis, where it enhances the function of uncoupling protein-1 by reducing inhibition from endogenous guanine nucleotides (Li2006Crystal). Additionally, hGMPR2 has been shown to promote the monocytic differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells (Zhang2003Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GMPR gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A novel heterozygous variant in the GMPR gene, specifically the c.547G>C variant, has been identified in a patient with late-onset autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO), a mitochondrial disorder characterized by muscle weakness and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. This variant was associated with decreased GMPR protein levels and subtle changes in nucleotide homeostasis, although significant defects in mitochondrial DNA replication were not demonstrated (Sommerville2019Identification).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), GMPR1, a product of the GMPR gene, has been identified as a potential therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker. Its expression is upregulated in AD cases, linked to pathways involving the adenosine receptor and AMPK, which are associated with AD phenotypes. This upregulation correlates with higher phosphorylation levels of Tau, a protein involved in AD pathology (Liu2017Guanosine).

In cutaneous melanoma, GMPR has been highlighted as a potential target for treatment. Small molecule drugs like furazolidone may exert biological efficacy by binding to GMPR, suggesting its role in melanoma cell proliferation (Liu2022Identification).
