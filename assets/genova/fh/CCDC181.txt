# CCDC181

## Overview
CCDC181 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain-containing protein 181, a member of the coiled-coil domain protein family. This protein is characterized by its structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of microtubule dynamics. CCDC181 is primarily involved in the structure and function of motile cilia and sperm flagella, playing a crucial role in ciliary motility and sperm development. It is predominantly expressed in the testis and is associated with the microtubular manchette and sperm tail during spermatogenesis. The protein interacts with several other proteins, including members of the Hook family and protein phosphatase 1, indicating its involvement in regulating flagellar and ciliary motility. Additionally, CCDC181 has clinical significance due to its altered methylation patterns in various cancers, making it a potential biomarker for early detection and treatment monitoring (Wang2021Automatic; Schwarz2017Ccdc181).

## Structure
The CCDC181 protein, encoded by the Ccdc181 gene located on mouse chromosome 1, consists of 509 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 59.25 kDa (Schwarz2017Ccdc181). It is a member of the coiled-coil domain-containing protein family, characterized by at least one coiled-coil domain. Bioinformatics analysis has identified two putative coiled-coil domains in the C-terminal region of CCDC181, specifically between amino acid residues 333 to 385 and 458 to 488 (Schwarz2017Ccdc181). These domains are structural motifs that typically form alpha-helical structures, facilitating protein-protein interactions.

The protein sequence of CCDC181 shows highly conserved regions at the N- and C-terminus across species such as humans, mice, and Xenopus, indicating its evolutionary conservation and potential functional importance (Schwarz2017Ccdc181). CCDC181 interacts with Hook1, a protein involved in microtubule binding, and this interaction is mediated by the region between amino acids 393 to 448 (Schwarz2017Ccdc181). The protein also interacts with other members of the Hook family, Hook2 and Hook3, using the same interacting region (Schwarz2017Ccdc181). While the study does not provide specific details on the tertiary or quaternary structure, it suggests that CCDC181 may form homodimers (Schwarz2017Ccdc181).

## Function
CCDC181 is a microtubule-binding protein that plays a significant role in the structure and function of motile cilia and sperm flagella. It is involved in ciliary motility, primarily localizing to the proximal part of motile cilia, which suggests its role in generating ciliary movement rather than serving as a structural component of the ciliary microtubule skeleton (Schwarz2017Ccdc181). CCDC181 interacts with Hook1 in haploid male germ cells, localizing to the sperm tail and motile cilia, and is crucial for proper sperm development and motility (Schwarz2017Ccdc181). 

The protein is expressed predominantly in the testis, particularly during the post-meiotic phase of spermatogenesis, and is associated with the microtubular manchette and sperm tail in elongating spermatids (Schwarz2017Ccdc181). CCDC181 also interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is involved in regulating sperm motility, suggesting a role in the regulation of flagellar and ciliary motility (Schwarz2017Ccdc181). In human airway cilia, CCDC181 localizes to the proximal portion of the ciliary axoneme, indicating its involvement in ciliary structure or function (Blackburn2017Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance
CCDC181 has been identified as having clinical significance in several cancers due to its altered methylation patterns. In breast cancer, particularly ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early-stage cases, CCDC181 is frequently hypermethylated. This hypermethylation is significantly associated with HER2 positivity, making it a potential biomarker for early detection and monitoring of breast cancer treatment response (Wang2021Automatic). The methylation levels of CCDC181 are notably higher in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and these levels tend to decrease following surgical treatment, indicating its utility in assessing treatment efficacy (Wang2021Automatic).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CCDC181 is part of a prognostic risk model, where its expression levels, along with other genes, serve as independent markers for prognosis and potential drug targets (Gao2018Exploration). The gene is also dysregulated in both high and low-risk groups of LUAD, suggesting its involvement in cancer-related pathways (Zengin2021Comprehensive). Additionally, CCDC181 has been reported to show aberrant methylation in prostate and endometrial cancers, further supporting its role as a general female tumor marker (Wang2021Automatic).

## Interactions
CCDC181 is a microtubule-binding protein that participates in several protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of male germ cell development and ciliary function. It interacts with Hook1 in haploid male germ cells, localizing to the sperm tail and motile cilia. This interaction is crucial for the structural organization of the sperm tail and manchette, and it does not require the coiled-coil domains but is dependent on the SSF domain (Schwarz2017Ccdc181). CCDC181 also interacts with other Hook family members, Hook2 and Hook3, and can form homodimers (Schwarz2017Ccdc181).

The protein interacts with various isoforms of the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), including PP1α, PP1β, PP1γ1, and PP1γ2, through its N-terminal region. This interaction suggests a role in ciliary motility and spermatozoa morphogenesis (Schwarz2017Ccdc181). CCDC181 also interacts with the RING domain-containing protein CCNB1IP1, a putative ubiquitin E3 ligase essential for chiasmata formation during meiosis (Schwarz2017Ccdc181).

In bovines, CCDC181 interacts with the Theileria annulata protein SVSP454, potentially influencing microtubule dynamics during host cell mitosis (Li2021Screening). This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays (Li2021Screening).
