# CFAP57

## Overview
The CFAP57 gene encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 57, a crucial component in the assembly and function of motile cilia. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including multiple WD repeats and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and stabilization of protein complexes. CFAP57 plays a significant role in the organization and stabilization of inner dynein arms (IDAs) within the ciliary axoneme, a structure essential for ciliary motility. It is involved in the asymmetric targeting of IDAs and interacts with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery, highlighting its importance in ciliary function. Mutations in the CFAP57 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder marked by impaired ciliary movement, leading to respiratory issues and other clinical manifestations (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation; Lin2019FAP57WDR65; BustamanteMarin2019Mutation).

## Structure
The CFAP57 protein, also known as FAP57 or WDR65, is characterized by its structural domains that include multiple WD repeats and coiled-coil domains. The N-terminal region of CFAP57 contains several WD repeat domains, which are known for forming beta-propeller structures that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Lin2019FAP57WDR65; BustamanteMarin2019Mutation). The C-terminal region is predicted to be helical and contains coiled-coil domains, which are often involved in the stabilization of protein complexes (Lin2019FAP57WDR65; BustamanteMarin2019Mutation).

CFAP57 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of inner dynein arms (IDAs) in cilia, forming a sub-complex with other proteins such as FAP337, which is crucial for the organization of IDAs (Lin2019FAP57WDR65). The protein extends nearly the full length of the 96 nm repeat in cilia, indicating its role in connecting various components within the axoneme (Lin2019FAP57WDR65). The structural organization of CFAP57 is essential for its function in ciliary motility, although specific details on its tertiary and quaternary structures, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
The CFAP57 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the proper functioning of motile cilia in human cells. This protein is involved in the asymmetric targeting of a subset of inner dynein arms (IDAs) within the ciliary axoneme, a microtubule-based structure crucial for ciliary movement (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation; BustamanteMarin2019Mutation). In healthy human airway epithelial cells, CFAP57 expression increases in parallel with FOXJ1, a key gene for ciliogenesis, indicating its role in cilia formation (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation). The CFAP57 protein is localized along the entire length of the ciliary axoneme, as confirmed by immunofluorescent staining, which shows strong positive reactivity throughout the axoneme (BustamanteMarin2019Mutation).

CFAP57 is crucial for maintaining normal ciliary beat frequency and waveform, as well as normal ciliary length. Its absence or mutation leads to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), characterized by reduced ciliary beat frequency and altered waveform (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation; BustamanteMarin2019Mutation). The protein is thought to interact with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery, which is responsible for transporting ciliary components from the cytoplasm to the cilia (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation). CFAP57 is conserved across species with motile cilia, highlighting its evolutionary importance in ciliary function (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP57 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by defective ciliary function. PCD leads to chronic respiratory disease, reduced fertility, and randomization of the left/right body axis due to impaired motile cilia and sperm flagella (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation). A specific homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 11 of CFAP57 introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a loss of function of the CFAP57 protein. This mutation causes defective ciliary beating, evidenced by a significant reduction in ciliary beat frequency and altered ciliary waveform (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation). The mutation affects the inner dynein arms (IDAs) of the cilia, leading to reduced beat frequency and altered waveform, which are crucial for ciliary function (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation).

In human tracheal epithelial cells, silencing CFAP57 results in reduced ciliary motility, supporting its role in ciliary function (BustamanteMarin2019Mutation). The absence of CFAP57 in the axoneme due to the mutation leads to the observed ciliary dysfunction in PCD (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation). The gene's mutation disrupts the asymmetric targeting of a subset of ciliary inner dynein arms, which are essential for proper ciliary motility (BustamanteMarin2019Mutation).

## Interactions
CFAP57, also known as FAP57, is involved in several interactions crucial for the assembly and stabilization of inner dynein arms (IDAs) within cilia. It forms part of a sub-complex with FAP337, which is essential for stabilizing IDA binding. CFAP57 interacts with multiple regulators of IDA activity, including the I1 dynein-associated proteins. Biochemical studies have shown that CFAP57 co-immunoprecipitates with the FAP100 subunit of the MIA complex, IC138, and two dynein heavy chains (DHCs) of I1 dynein, as well as the FAP44 subunit of the I1 dynein tether head. These interactions suggest that CFAP57 is located near I1 dynein and the MIA complex (Lin2019FAP57WDR65).

CFAP57 also interacts with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery, which is responsible for transporting proteins from the cytoplasm to the cilia. The IFT-B complex, which CFAP57 may interact with, contains WD repeats and TPR proteins important for cargo interactions. A mutation in CFAP57 that results in the skipping of exon 11 disrupts its role as a scaffold for protein interactions, affecting ciliary function (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation).

In Tetrahymena, CFAP57 is positioned adjacent to the FAP43/44 complex, which is involved in the formation of the tether and tether head (T/TH) complex. This complex is crucial for the positional stability of the I1/f dynein motor domains and the stable anchoring of CK1 kinase, as well as the proper phosphorylation of the regulatory IC138 subunit (BustamanteMarin2020Mutation).
