# ADARB2

## Overview
ADARB2 is a gene that encodes the protein adenosine deaminase RNA specific B2 (inactive), which is a member of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family. Unlike other ADAR proteins, ADARB2 is catalytically inactive and does not directly participate in the A-to-I RNA editing process. Instead, it is believed to play a regulatory role by interacting with other ADAR proteins, potentially influencing RNA editing by competing for RNA substrate binding sites. This regulatory function is particularly significant in the brain, where ADARB2 is predominantly expressed, suggesting its involvement in neural function and development. Although the precise biological role of ADARB2 remains to be fully elucidated, it is associated with various neurological pathways and has been implicated in several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Gasparini2015Casecontrol; Olofsson2024Genomewide; Konki2019Peripheral).

## Function
The ADARB2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family, which is involved in the A-to-I RNA editing process. However, unlike other ADAR family members, ADARB2 is catalytically inactive and does not directly participate in RNA editing. Instead, it is thought to play a regulatory role by interacting with other ADAR proteins, potentially influencing RNA editing processes by competing for binding sites on RNA substrates (Gasparini2015Casecontrol). This competitive binding can affect the efficiency of RNA editing by other active enzymes, such as ADAR1 and ADARB1, particularly in brain regions where these proteins are co-expressed (Gasparini2015Casecontrol).

ADARB2 is primarily expressed in the brain, with the highest levels found in the spinal cord and midbrain, suggesting its involvement in neural function and development (Olofsson2024Genomewide). Although its precise role in healthy human cells is not fully understood, ADARB2 is associated with regulatory functions in RNA editing and related pathways, such as ATP/ITP metabolism and nucleobase metabolism (Olofsson2024Genomewide). Its expression in the brain indicates a potential role in neurotransmitter regulation and neurological pathways (Gasparini2015Casecontrol).

## Clinical Significance
The ADARB2 gene has been implicated in various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Although ADARB2 itself is catalytically inactive, it may play a regulatory role in RNA editing processes. Alterations in ADARB2 expression or interactions have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, DNA methylation differences in the ADARB2 gene have been linked to AD, with an AD-associated methylation signature found in both peripheral blood and anterior hippocampus brain tissue (Konki2019Peripheral). Variants in ADARB2 have also been associated with accelerated cognitive decline following the conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD (Konki2019Peripheral).

In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), inefficient RNA editing by ADARB2 is proposed to contribute to motor neuron death, particularly through the failure to substitute an arginine for a glutamine residue in the GluR2 Q/R site of glutamate AMPA receptors (Gasparini2015Casecontrol). Additionally, ADARB2 has been linked to various cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme, where its RNA editing activity affects pathways regulating tumor progression (Kung2018The). The gene has also been associated with metabolic parameters and longevity, suggesting a broader impact on human health (Kung2018The).
