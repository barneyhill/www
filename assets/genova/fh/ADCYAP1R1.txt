# ADCYAP1R1

## Overview
The ADCYAP1R1 gene encodes the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor (PAC1), a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes. The PAC1 receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure and is primarily involved in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, where it mediates the effects of the neuropeptide PACAP. This receptor is integral to the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity, leading to increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and influencing numerous intracellular signaling pathways. The PAC1 receptor is implicated in a wide array of biological functions, including neurodevelopment, stress response, immune modulation, and energy homeostasis. Variants and mutations in the ADCYAP1R1 gene have been associated with several psychiatric and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Yamamoto2021Pituitary; Mercer2016Functional; Shioda2016Pleiotropic).

## Structure
The ADCYAP1R1 gene encodes the PAC1 receptor, a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that binds the neuropeptide PACAP. The primary structure of the PAC1 receptor consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a protein with seven transmembrane helices (7TM) (Liao2018PAC1). The secondary structure includes α-helices in the transmembrane domain and β-sheets in the extracellular domain (ECD) (Liao2018PAC1). The ECD is characterized by a three-layered α-β-β/α fold and a conserved peptide binding interface (Liao2019Targeting).

The receptor's tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a seven-transmembrane domain architecture, with a large ECD linked to the TMD via a flexible linker (Liao2018PAC1). The ECD contains a unique 21-amino acid loop segment that contributes to maintaining the receptor in an open conformational state, facilitating high-affinity binding of PACAP (Liao2018PAC1). 

The PAC1 receptor has several splice variants, including PAC1Null, PAC1Hip, PAC1Hop, and PAC1HipHop, which result from alternative splicing of exons encoding Hip and Hop cassettes within the third intracellular loop (ICL3) (Liao2019Targeting). These variants may influence receptor selectivity for neuropeptides and G proteins (Liao2019Targeting). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation can affect receptor function and signaling, although specific details are not provided in the context (Liao2018PAC1).

## Function
The ADCYAP1R1 gene encodes the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor (PAC1), a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various molecular processes. PAC1 is primarily active in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, where it plays a crucial role in activating adenylate cyclase, leading to increased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and subsequent modulation of intracellular signaling pathways (Shioda2016Pleiotropic). This receptor is involved in neurodevelopment, stress response, and energy homeostasis, influencing a range of biological actions such as reproductive functions, thermoregulation, respiratory functions, circadian rhythm, feeding behavior, stress pathways, learning and memory, inflammatory reactions, and neurodevelopment (Shioda2016Pleiotropic).

In the context of immune responses, ADCYAP1R1 is critical for dendritic cell (DC) functions, particularly in contact hypersensitivity (CHS). It mediates the effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) on DCs, enhancing their migration and maturation by upregulating chemokine receptors like CCR7 and CXCR4, which are essential for DC migration to lymph nodes (Yamamoto2021Pituitary). The receptor's role in DC activation and migration underscores its importance in modulating immune responses (Yamamoto2021Pituitary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADCYAP1R1 gene, which encodes the PAC1 receptor, have been implicated in several psychiatric and neurological disorders. The gene is notably associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2267735, within the ADCYAP1R1 gene, affects the binding efficiency of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) to an estrogen response element (ERE), leading to decreased expression of ADCYAP1R1. This reduced expression is linked to increased PTSD symptoms, particularly in women with low serum estradiol levels (Mercer2016Functional).

The ADCYAP1R1 gene is also involved in the comorbidity of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and breast cancer. Changes in its expression are linked to neurological health complications, including impaired motor function and behavioral changes consistent with FTD phenotypes. The gene's up-regulation may influence the pathology of FTD by disrupting adrenocorticotropin and catecholamine levels (Momin2023Analysis).

Additionally, ADCYAP1R1 has been implicated in cluster headaches (CH). Genetic variants in this gene, such as SNP rs12668955, have shown a significant association with CH, suggesting a potential protective effect against the condition (Bacchelli2016A). These findings highlight the gene's role in pain processing and circadian rhythms, which are relevant to CH susceptibility (Gibson2019Genetics).
