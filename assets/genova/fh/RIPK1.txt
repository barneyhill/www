# RIPK1

## Overview
RIPK1 (receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in regulating cell death and inflammation. The RIPK1 protein is a serine/threonine kinase that is integral to the necroptotic signaling pathways, characterized by its kinase domain, RHIM (RIP homotypic interaction motif), and a C-terminal death domain. These structural features enable RIPK1 to interact with various proteins, such as RIPK3, to form necrosomes, which are essential for the execution of necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that promotes inflammation (Mompeán2018The; Liu2024The). Beyond its role in necroptosis, RIPK1 is involved in the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling pathway, mediating the activation of NF-κB and regulating apoptosis, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis and immune responses (Liu2021Regulatory; Ju2022The). Mutations in the RIPK1 gene have been linked to various immunological and inflammatory disorders, highlighting its critical function in immune regulation and inflammatory homeostasis (Lalaoui2019Mutations; CuchetLourenço2018Biallelic).

## Structure
RIPK1 (receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 1) is a protein involved in necroptotic signaling pathways, characterized by its complex molecular structure. The primary structure of RIPK1 includes a kinase domain, an intermediate domain containing the RHIM (RIP homotypic interaction motif), and a C-terminal death domain (Liu2024The). The RHIM motif is crucial for forming amyloid structures and interacting with other proteins like RIPK3, leading to the formation of necrosomes, which are essential for cell necroptosis (Liu2024The).

The secondary structure of RIPK1 features beta sheets, particularly in the RHIM-containing domain, which forms amyloid fibrils with a cross-beta spine (Mompeán2018The). The tertiary structure is characterized by a serpentine fold with parallel beta sheets forming a hydrophobic core, stabilized by interactions such as Cys-Ser ladders and hydrophobic interactions involving Ile and Val side chains (Mompeán2018The).

In terms of quaternary structure, RIPK1 forms a hetero-amyloid complex with RIPK3, which is energetically preferred over homo-amyloid formations due to favorable interaction energies (Mompeán2018The). This complex is crucial for the activation of necroptosis, with specific residues playing a significant role in maintaining its structure and function (Mompeán2018The).

## Function
Receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a critical regulator of cell death and inflammation in human cells. In healthy cells, RIPK1 plays a significant role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and regulating immune responses. It is involved in controlling apoptosis and necroptosis, two forms of programmed cell death. Apoptosis is generally non-inflammatory, while necroptosis is a lytic form of cell death that promotes inflammation by releasing cellular contents that act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Liu2021Regulatory).

RIPK1 is involved in the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling pathway, where it mediates the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor that promotes cell survival and inflammatory signaling. This process involves the transcriptional induction of prosurvival genes such as Bcl2, A20, and cFLIP, which protect against apoptosis (Ju2022The). RIPK1's activity is regulated through various mechanisms, including ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and proteolysis, which fine-tune its function and prevent inappropriate cell death and inflammation (Liu2021Regulatory).

RIPK1 also interacts with other proteins such as RIPK3, TRIF, and ZBP1, which are crucial for signaling in innate inflammation and cell death pathways. The RHIM domain of RIPK1 is particularly important for preventing necroptosis during development (Liu2021Regulatory). In summary, RIPK1 functions as a key regulator of cell death and inflammation, ensuring a balance between survival and programmed cell death pathways (Li2023Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RIPK1 gene are associated with several severe immunological and inflammatory conditions. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in RIPK1 can lead to combined immunodeficiency and early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These mutations result in impaired NF-κB activation, defective T and B cell differentiation, and increased susceptibility to necroptosis, contributing to recurrent infections and inflammatory conditions such as polyarthritis and intestinal inflammation (Li2018Human; Zhang2021RIPK1Associated; CuchetLourenço2018Biallelic).

Heterozygous mutations at the D324 residue of RIPK1, which prevent caspase-mediated cleavage, cause Cleavage-resistant RIPK1-Induced Autoinflammatory (CRIA) syndrome. This condition is characterized by periodic fever episodes, lymphadenopathy, and other inflammatory symptoms. These mutations lead to enhanced RIPK1 activation, promoting necroptosis and inflammation (Lalaoui2019Mutations; Zhang2021RIPK1Associated).

RIPK1 mutations have also been linked to infantile-onset IBD with inflammatory and fistulizing features. These mutations disrupt normal RIPK1 function, leading to abnormal cytokine production and immune dysregulation (Sultan2022RIPK1). The clinical significance of RIPK1 mutations underscores its critical role in maintaining immune and inflammatory homeostasis.

## Interactions
RIPK1 (receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 1) is a key regulator of cell death and inflammation, interacting with various proteins to mediate its functions. It binds to the intracellular death domain (DD) of Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), as well as to adaptor proteins TRADD and FADD through its DD (Newton2019Multitasking). RIPK1 also interacts with RHIM-containing proteins such as RIPK3, TRIF, and ZBP1 via its RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), which is crucial for necroptosis and other signaling pathways (Newton2019Multitasking).

In the TNFR1 signaling complex, RIPK1 associates with TRADD, TRAF2, and E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2, leading to the formation of polyubiquitin chains that recruit proteins like TAB2, TAB3, and NEMO, activating NF-κB and MAP kinases (Newton2019Multitasking). RIPK1's kinase activity is essential for necroptosis, where it forms a complex with RIPK3, leading to the phosphorylation of MLKL and subsequent cell death (Newton2019Multitasking; Cho2009Phosphorylation-Driven).

RIPK1 also interacts with caspase-8 and c-FLIP heterodimers, which cleave RIPK1 to prevent necroptosis by inhibiting its interaction with RIPK3 (Newton2019Multitasking). Additionally, RIPK1 is involved in the regulation of RIPK3 oligomerization, acting as both a promoter and inhibitor of RIPK3 activation depending on the context (Orozco2014RIPK1).
