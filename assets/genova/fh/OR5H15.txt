# OR5H15

## Overview
OR5H15 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily H member 15, which belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules within the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. Upon binding to specific odorants, the receptor initiates a signal transduction cascade that ultimately leads to the perception of smell. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR5H15 has been associated with other biological processes, including its involvement in the 'Olfactory transduction' pathway, which is significant in conditions such as neurolymphomatosis (Cerri2022Clinical; GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). Additionally, olfactory receptors like OR5H15 are expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the skin, where they may contribute to epidermal homeostasis (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Function
OR5H15 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules in the olfactory epithelium, a specialized tissue within the nasal cavity. Upon binding specific odorants, OR5H15 initiates a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. This process involves the activation of intracellular signaling cascades, leading to neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR5H15 has been implicated in other biological processes. For instance, it is part of the 'Olfactory transduction' pathway, which was found to be enriched in downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to neurolymphomatosis, a condition affecting nerve tissues (Cerri2022Clinical). Although the specific function of OR5H15 in healthy cells beyond olfaction is not detailed, its involvement in olfactory transduction suggests a broader role in sensory perception and possibly in other physiological processes where olfactory receptors are expressed, such as in the skin, where they may influence epidermal homeostasis (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).
