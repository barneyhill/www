# ZNF823

## Overview
ZNF823 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 823, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are typically involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression, cell differentiation, and development. The protein encoded by ZNF823 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer. Variants in ZNF823 have been associated with schizophrenia, where they may influence the expression of neuron-specific genes, and the gene is also part of a prognostic model for gastric cancer. Additionally, ZNF823 plays a role in the regulatory networks of periodontitis, highlighting its involvement in immune system signaling pathways (Sawle2016Identification; Hoffman2021Transethnic; Zheng2020Construction; Zeng2021Transethnic).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF823 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in gene regulation. In the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, ZNF823 is associated with schizophrenia (SZ). A specific variant, rs72986630, located in the 5' UTR of ZNF823, is predicted to drive its expression and is protective against SZ. This variant disrupts a binding site for the RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST), which is involved in silencing neuron-specific genes, suggesting that alterations in ZNF823 expression may be linked to SZ (Hoffman2021Transethnic; Zeng2021Transethnic).

In cancer research, ZNF823 has been identified as part of a tumor-specific mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA network in gastric cancer. It is included in a risk score model for gastric cancer prognosis, indicating its potential role in the disease's progression (Zheng2020Construction).

ZNF823 is also highlighted as a master regulator gene in periodontitis, with a large regulon size, suggesting its significant impact on the disease's regulatory network. It is associated with immune system signaling pathways, which may contribute to its role in periodontitis pathobiology (Sawle2016Identification).
