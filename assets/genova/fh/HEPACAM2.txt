# HEPACAM2

## Overview
HEPACAM2 is a gene that encodes the protein HEPACAM family member 2, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in cell adhesion and signaling processes. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular interactions and communication. HEPACAM2 is expressed in various tissues and has been implicated in several biological pathways, including those related to immune response and cancer progression. Its expression levels have been associated with clinical outcomes in diseases such as colon adenocarcinoma, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2022Identification; Wang2021Systematic). Additionally, mutations or dysregulation of HEPACAM2 have been linked to neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in both oncological and neurological contexts (Wu2018Analysis).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
HEPACAM2 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of cancer. In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), a type of colorectal cancer, HEPACAM2 expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2022Identification; Wang2021Systematic). High expression of HEPACAM2, along with genes like CLCA1, REP15, and B3GNT6, is linked to better prognosis in COAD patients (Wang2022Identification; Wang2021Systematic).

HEPACAM2 is also involved in immune response processes and pathways, such as the Chemokine signaling pathway and Ras signaling pathway, which are crucial in tumor progression and immune cell interactions (Wang2022Identification). The gene's expression is positively correlated with the infiltration of various immune cells, including MAIT and Th2 cells, which play roles in tumor progression and immune response (Wang2022Identification).

In addition to its role in cancer, HEPACAM2 has been associated with neurological disorders, including intellectual disabilities and movement disorders, due to mutations or altered expression that disrupt normal cellular interactions (Wu2018Analysis). These alterations can contribute to disease pathogenesis by affecting cell adhesion and signaling.
