# LRFN3

## Overview
LRFN3, or leucine rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 3, is a gene that encodes a synaptic adhesion protein known as SALM4. This protein is a member of the SALM/LRFN family, which is integral to the development and function of synapses in the central nervous system. SALM4 is categorized as a synaptic adhesion molecule and is involved in the regulation of synapse formation, maturation, and plasticity. It plays a critical role in maintaining synaptic balance by interacting with other synaptic proteins and modulating synaptic activity. Notably, SALM4 negatively regulates excitatory synapse density in the hippocampus, acting as a suppressor of synapse formation through its interactions with other SALM proteins and presynaptic receptors (Lie2018SALMLrfn; Lie2021SALM4).

## Function
LRFN3, also known as SALM4, is a synaptic adhesion molecule involved in the regulation of synapse development and function in the central nervous system. It is part of the SALM/LRFN family, which plays a crucial role in synapse formation, maturation, and plasticity. LRFN3 is expressed in neuronal synapses, dendrites, and axons, where it interacts with other synaptic proteins to modulate synaptic activity (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

LRFN3 has been shown to negatively regulate the density of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. In mice lacking LRFN3, there is an increase in excitatory synapse density, suggesting that LRFN3 acts as a suppressor of synapse formation. This regulation is achieved through its interaction with SALM3, where LRFN3 inhibits SALM3's trans-synaptic interaction with presynaptic LAR-RPTPs, thereby suppressing SALM3-dependent presynaptic differentiation (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

LRFN3 is also involved in complex molecular mechanisms that regulate synaptic activity, including interactions with excitatory synaptic proteins like PSD-95, NMDARs, and AMPARs. These interactions are crucial for maintaining synaptic balance and ensuring proper neural connectivity and signaling (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LRFN3 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders. LRFN3, also known as SALM4, is part of the SALM/LRFN family of synaptic adhesion molecules, which play a crucial role in synapse development and function. Although LRFN3 itself does not exhibit synaptogenic activity, it is involved in synapse regulation through interactions with other SALM proteins. Mice lacking SALM4 (Lrfn3 -/-) show increased excitatory and inhibitory synapse density in the hippocampus, indicating its role in synaptic balance (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

Alterations in LRFN3 expression have been associated with prostate cancer, where it is downregulated. However, its expression was not significantly correlated with disease-free survival in prostate cancer patients (Pan2022Expression). While the clinical significance of LRFN3 mutations in cancer is not fully detailed, its involvement in pathways such as DNA repair and cell cycle regulation suggests potential implications in tumorigenesis (Pan2022Expression).

Overall, LRFN3's role in synaptic regulation and its altered expression in certain cancers highlight its potential clinical significance, although further research is needed to fully understand its impact on human health.

## Interactions
LRFN3, also known as SALM4, is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in synaptic development and function. SALM4 interacts in cis with other members of the SALM family, including SALM2, SALM3, and SALM5, to inhibit their functions. This interaction suppresses SALM2-dependent facilitation of excitatory synapse development and SALM3/5 trans-synaptic interactions with presynaptic LAR-RPTPs (LAR, PTPσ, and PTPδ) (Lie2018SALMLrfn; Lie2021SALM4).

SALM4 also interacts with the presynaptic receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPσ, which is necessary for the regulation of NMDA receptor function, particularly GluN2B-containing NMDARs (Lie2021SALM4). In the absence of SALM4, there is an increase in excitatory and inhibitory synapse density, attributed to its interaction with SALM3, which inhibits SALM3's synaptogenic activity by preventing its interaction with presynaptic LAR-RPTPs (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory role of LRFN3 in synaptic organization, influencing both excitatory and inhibitory synapse development and function. The modulation of these interactions is crucial for maintaining synaptic balance and proper neural connectivity.
