# LBHD2

## Overview
The LBHD2 gene encodes the protein LBH domain containing 2, which is a member of the LBH domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an LBH domain, which is implicated in various cellular processes, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. LBH domain containing 2 is involved in several signaling pathways and may play a role in cellular development and differentiation. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential involvement in certain pathological conditions, although further research is needed to clarify these associations (Qiu2020aarFDC).
