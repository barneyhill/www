# SCNN1D

## Overview
The SCNN1D gene encodes the delta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in sodium ion transport across epithelial cells. This gene is part of the ENaC/DEG superfamily and is primarily expressed in tissues such as the lung, kidney, and trachea, where it contributes to maintaining sodium balance and fluid homeostasis. The delta subunit, when incorporated into the ENaC complex, can alter the channel's biophysical properties, including activation and inactivation kinetics, and may substitute for the gamma subunit in certain tissues like the brain (Ji2012δ; Zhao2019Proliferative). The SCNN1D gene's expression is developmentally regulated, with significant roles in mature tissue function, and its mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cardiovascular and respiratory disorders (Ahmad2023The; Ji2012δ).

## Structure
The SCNN1D gene encodes the delta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is part of the ENaC/DEG superfamily. The primary structure of the full-length δ ENaC protein consists of 802 amino acids, although splice variants exist with 638 and 704 amino acids due to alternative splicing events such as exon deletions and intron retention (Ji2012δ; Zhao2019Proliferative). These splicing events can lead to frame shifts and premature termination, resulting in different protein isoforms (Ji2012δ).

The δ ENaC protein is glycosylated, which affects its molecular weight in different expression systems (Ji2012δ). The extracellular domain comprises about 70% of the amino acid sequence, contributing significantly to the protein's structure (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial). The δ subunit can form functional channels when co-expressed with β and γ subunits, and it can also form a channel on its own, although its function is enhanced in combination with other subunits (Ji2012δ).

The δ ENaC subunit shares 34% sequence homology with the α subunit and is considered a pore-forming subunit, similar to the α subunit, while β and γ are accessory subunits (Paudel2021The). The δ ENaC channels exhibit unique characteristics such as a longer opening time and distinct responses to proton activation (Ji2012δ).

## Function
The SCNN1D gene encodes the delta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is crucial for sodium ion transport across epithelial cells. This channel is primarily active in the apical membrane of epithelial cells in tissues such as the lung, kidney, and trachea, where it plays a significant role in maintaining sodium balance and fluid homeostasis (Ji2012δ; Zhao2019Proliferative). The delta subunit, when part of the ENaC complex, can modify the channel's biophysical properties, such as activation and inactivation kinetics, and may substitute for the gamma subunit in certain tissues like the brain (Ji2012δ).

In the lungs, SCNN1D is involved in alveolar fluid clearance and airway fluid homeostasis, contributing to the regulation of alveolar epithelial type 2 progenitor cells (Zhao2019Proliferative). The delta subunit's presence in various tissues, including the trachea, kidney, and liver, suggests a broad role in physiological processes, potentially including signal transduction and cellular homeostasis (Ji2012δ). The SCNN1D gene's expression is developmentally regulated, with lower levels in fetal tissues compared to adult tissues, indicating its importance in mature tissue function (Ji2012δ).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SCNN1D gene, which encodes the delta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), have been linked to several clinical conditions. The SCNN1D gene is associated with monosomy 1p36 deletion syndrome, a condition characterized by developmental delays, craniofacial abnormalities, seizures, and heart diseases. This syndrome results from a deletion in the terminal distal part of chromosome 1, which includes SCNN1D (Ji2012δ).

Altered expression of SCNN1D is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases. Variants of the δ subunit are associated with blood pressure regulation, influencing parameters such as pulse pressure, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure. These variants are linked to vascular function and kidney function, suggesting a role in hypertension and vascular dysfunction (Ahmad2023The; LemmensGruber2023The).

In the respiratory system, SCNN1D is involved in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Children with genetic deletions of SCNN1D are predisposed to respiratory infections and nasal congestion, indicating its potential role in respiratory health (Zhao2019Proliferative). The δ subunit's involvement in ischemic signal transduction and its proton-sensitivity are crucial during cardiac and brain ischemia, highlighting its role in ischemic disorders (Ji2012δ).

## Interactions
The SCNN1D gene encodes the δ subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which participates in various protein interactions influencing its function and regulation. The δ subunit interacts with Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, through unknown residues, unlike the α, β, and γ subunits that interact via the PY motif (Miller2018Identification). The δ subunit also interacts with the protein Murr1, which affects sodium current and cell surface expression of ENaC proteins (Ji2012δ; Miller2018Identification).

In glial cells, δ ENaC interacts with syntaxin 1A, which down-regulates ASIC activity by reducing channel opening time (Ji2012δ). The δ subunit is also involved in modifying the activation and inactivation kinetics of channels composed of ASIC1 and ASIC2 subunits (Ji2012δ). Additionally, δ ENaC may interact with other ENaC subunits, COMMD1, syntaxins, Nedd4, and ERK1, suggesting its role in channel regulation and function (Ji2012δ).

The δ subunit's interaction with phosphatidylinositols and its role in exocytosis are also noted, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Ji2012δ). These interactions highlight the δ subunit's role as an accessory protein in ENaC function rather than a primary pore-forming subunit (Ji2012δ).
