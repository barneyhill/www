# DCHS2

## Overview
DCHS2, or dachsous cadherin-related 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cadherin superfamily, which is primarily involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The protein, characterized by multiple cadherin or cadherin-like repeats, plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue architecture and facilitating cellular communication. DCHS2 is implicated in processes such as planar cell polarity and tissue morphogenesis, which are essential for influencing cell shape and movement. It is notably involved in craniofacial development, interacting with key regulators like SOX9 to control cartilage differentiation and polarity. The gene's expression in the human brain and testis suggests additional roles in physiological processes, although these are not fully elucidated. Mutations in DCHS2 have been linked to psychiatric disorders, developmental syndromes, and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Karagyaur2024Novel; Derpoorter2022Whole; Adhikari2016A; Shivakumar2019Genetic).

## Structure
DCHS2, or dachsous cadherin-related 2, is a protein that is part of the cadherin superfamily, characterized by its role in cell-cell adhesion. The primary structure of DCHS2 includes at least 21 cadherin or cadherin-like repeats, which are integral to its function (Hulpiau2009Molecular). These repeats are typically involved in forming a beta-sheet structure in the secondary structure of cadherins, contributing to the protein's adhesive properties (Hulpiau2009Molecular). 

The tertiary structure of cadherins generally involves the folding of these repeats into a compact domain, although specific details for DCHS2 are not provided in the available context. The quaternary structure of cadherins often involves interactions with other cadherin molecules to form adhesive junctions, but specific interactions for DCHS2 are not detailed (Hulpiau2009Molecular).

DCHS2 is expressed in the human brain and testis, and its ectodomain is not homologous with other cadherin superfamily members analyzed, indicating a unique structural feature within this protein family (Hulpiau2009Molecular). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its function and localization. Additionally, DCHS2 can have splice variant isoforms, potentially influencing its role in cellular processes.

## Function
The DCHS2 gene encodes a calcium-dependent cell-adhesion protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion and signaling, particularly within the cadherin superfamily. This protein is involved in maintaining tissue architecture and facilitating cellular communication. DCHS2 is implicated in processes such as planar cell polarity and tissue morphogenesis, which are crucial for influencing cell shape and movement (Derpoorter2022Whole; Adhikari2016A).

In the context of craniofacial development, DCHS2 is part of a regulatory network that controls cartilage differentiation and polarity. This network includes interactions with SOX9, a key regulator of cartilage differentiation, highlighting DCHS2's role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of facial features (Adhikari2016A). The gene's involvement in craniofacial development is further supported by its association with facial traits such as columella inclination, nose protrusion, and nose tip angle, suggesting its importance in the evolutionary diversification of facial features in mammals (Adhikari2016A).

DCHS2 is also expressed in the cerebral cortex and testis, indicating its potential involvement in other physiological processes, although its specific functions in these tissues are not fully understood (An2014Frameshift).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DCHS2 gene have been implicated in several psychiatric and developmental disorders. In psychiatric conditions, specific genetic variants within the DCHS2 gene, such as rs11935573-G and rs12500437-G, have been associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia and depression. These variants are more prevalent in individuals with these disorders compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these mental health conditions (Karagyaur2024Novel). The rs11935573-G variant, in particular, is noted for causing changes in the polarity of the DCHS2 extracellular domain, which may contribute to psychiatric and cognitive disorders (Karagyaur2024Novel).

DCHS2 is also linked to developmental disorders, such as the Cerebrofacio-articular syndrome of Van Maldergem. Mutations in this gene are associated with impaired facial and joint development, gray matter dystopia in the brain, and variable neuropsychiatric developmental delays (Karagyaur2024Novel).

In cancer research, DCHS2 has been associated with survival outcomes in uterine cancer, potentially through its involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and development (Shivakumar2019Genetic).
