# PRICKLE2

## Overview
PRICKLE2 is a gene that encodes the prickle planar cell polarity protein 2, a crucial component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by the presence of PET and LIM domains, which are essential for its function in cellular signaling and membrane targeting (Sweede2008Structural). As a regulatory protein, prickle planar cell polarity protein 2 plays a significant role in neurodevelopmental processes, including synaptic signaling and plasticity, by interacting with key synaptic proteins such as PSD-95 and NMDA receptors (Hida2011Prickle2). It is also involved in the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, contributing to the asymmetric distribution of cellular structures necessary for proper vertebrate development (Sowers2013Disruption; Radaszkiewicz2023The). Mutations in the PRICKLE2 gene have been linked to various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Bayat2021PRICKLE2; Radaszkiewicz2023The).

## Structure
The PRICKLE2 protein is characterized by the presence of PET and LIM domains, which are crucial for its function in the planar cell polarity pathway. The PET domain is described as monomeric with a nonglobular conformation, exhibiting properties of intrinsically disordered proteins. It can adopt a helical conformation in the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) and lipid micelles, suggesting its role in membrane targeting (Sweede2008Structural). The LIM domains, which are protein interaction modules, interact with the PET domain to enhance protein folding, thermostability, and tolerance to proteolysis, indicating that they modulate the membrane penetration function of the PET domain (Sweede2008Structural).

The PET domain is relatively disordered, with a high content of charged and polar residues, typical of proteins involved in regulatory functions. It transitions to more ordered states upon ligand binding (Sweede2008Structural). The PET-LIM region presents a globular and monomeric conformation, with the LIM domains increasing the secondary structure content and modulating the membrane penetration of the PET domain (Sweede2008Structural).

Post-translational modifications of PRICKLE2 include farnesylation at a carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif, which is necessary for its membrane association and function in planar cell polarity signaling (Nagaoka2019Vangl2).

## Function
PRICKLE2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various neurodevelopmental processes, including cell fate determination, axon migration, dendritic arborization, and synapse formation (Sowers2013Disruption). In healthy human cells, PRICKLE2 is highly expressed in the hippocampal formation, a brain region associated with synaptic function and epilepsy pathogenesis (Sowers2013Disruption). The protein is localized in the postsynaptic density (PSD) and interacts with PSD-95 and NMDA receptors, playing a significant role in synaptic signaling and plasticity (Hida2011Prickle2).

PRICKLE2 is also involved in planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, which is essential for the asymmetric distribution of cellular structures within epithelial cells. This signaling is crucial for processes such as neurulation and body axis elongation during vertebrate development (Radaszkiewicz2023The). The protein interacts with Vangl2, another PCP protein, which regulates its levels through proteasomal degradation, ensuring proper PCP signaling (Nagaoka2019Vangl2). PRICKLE2's role in maintaining synaptic integrity and function is underscored by its involvement in the regulation of excitatory synapses and its association with disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy when mutated (Nagaoka2019Vangl2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRICKLE2 gene are implicated in several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. PRICKLE2 mutations have been associated with Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy (PME), Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In PME, specific mutations such as R148H, V153I, and V605F affect calcium signaling in the nervous system, suggesting a molecular mechanism for PRICKLE2-related PME (Radaszkiewicz2023The). In ASD, PRICKLE2 mutations, including E8Q and V153I, lead to decreased synaptic function and transmission, resulting in ASD-like symptoms in mice. PRICKLE2 haploinsufficiency is suggested to cause ASD (Sowers2013Disruption; Radaszkiewicz2023The). 

PRICKLE2 is also linked to epilepsy, with variants such as Pro41Leu and Thr227Arg associated with syndromes like Jeavons syndrome, characterized by myoclonic jerks and photosensitivity (Bayat2021PRICKLE2). In Alzheimer's Disease, lower Prickle2 mRNA levels are observed in transgenic AD mice, and upregulation of Prickle2 improves cognitive deficits and AD-like pathology (Radaszkiewicz2023The). These findings underscore PRICKLE2's role in synaptic dysfunction and its potential as a therapeutic target in these conditions.

## Interactions
PRICKLE2 is involved in several key protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and synaptic signaling. In the brain, PRICKLE2 is localized in the postsynaptic density (PSD) and interacts with PSD-95 and NMDA receptors, specifically forming complexes with the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits. This interaction is facilitated by the direct binding of PRICKLE2 to the C-terminal guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95, highlighting its role in synaptic function (Hida2011Prickle2).

PRICKLE2 also interacts with Vangl proteins, which are core components of the PCP pathway. It has been shown to stabilize GFP-Vangl1, influencing its localization and dynamics within cells. This interaction is important for maintaining the asymmetric distribution of PCP components, which is essential for proper cellular orientation and movement (Butler2015Control).

Additionally, PRICKLE2 is subject to proteasomal degradation mediated by its interaction with Vangl2. This process involves the ubiquitination of PRICKLE2, facilitated by Cullin-1, which targets it for degradation, thereby regulating its protein levels and ensuring proper PCP signaling (Nagaoka2019Vangl2).
