# IRAG2

## Overview
IRAG2, or inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor associated 2, is a gene that encodes a type II membrane protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly calcium signaling. The protein product of IRAG2 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) to regulate calcium ion release into the cytoplasm. This regulation is essential for maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis, which is crucial for various cellular functions such as muscle contraction, secretion, and cell growth (Prüschenk2021IRAG2). Beyond its role in calcium signaling, IRAG2 is implicated in diverse physiological processes, including platelet aggregation and nuclear-cytoskeletal interactions, through its involvement in the linker of nucleus and cytoskeletons (LINC) complex and interactions with other proteins like HCN4 channels (Peters2022Regulation; Prüschenk2022Function; Prüschenk2023Novel). These multifaceted roles underscore the importance of IRAG2 in both normal cellular function and potential pathological conditions.

## Function
IRAG2 (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor associated 2) is a type II membrane protein that plays a significant role in calcium signaling pathways. It is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and interacts with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), specifically types 1, 2, and 3, to regulate the release of calcium ions from the ER into the cytoplasm. This interaction is crucial for maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis, which is vital for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, secretion, and cell growth (Prüschenk2021IRAG2).

In murine pancreatic acinar cells, IRAG2 modulates basal calcium levels and affects amylase secretion, indicating its role in exocrine pancreatic function. The absence of IRAG2 leads to decreased basal calcium release and altered expression of IP3 receptor subtypes, which suggests that IRAG2 may stabilize IP3 receptors and influence calcium oscillations (Prüschenk2021IRAG2).

In murine platelets, IRAG2 is involved in platelet aggregation. It is phosphorylated in a cGMP-dependent manner, which enhances platelet aggregation, contrasting with IRAG1, which inhibits aggregation. This suggests that IRAG2 may play a role in thrombus formation and cardiovascular processes (Prüschenk2022Function).

## Interactions
IRAG2, also known as Jaw1 or lymphoid-restricted membrane protein (LRMP), is a type II membrane protein that participates in various protein interactions, primarily through its coiled-coil domain. It interacts with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) types 1, 2, and 3, influencing calcium (Ca2+) signaling in different tissues, including murine pancreatic acinar cells and intestinal tuft cells (Prüschenk2021IRAG2). In pancreatic acinar cells, IRAG2 modulates IP3 receptor activity, affecting Ca2+ oscillations and amylase secretion (Prüschenk2021IRAG2).

IRAG2 also interacts with Sad-1/UNC-84 (SUN) proteins, forming part of the linker of nucleus and cytoskeletons (LINC) complex, which is crucial for maintaining nuclear shape (Prüschenk2023Novel). It connects the cytoplasm to the nucleoplasm by interacting with microtubules through its cytosolic region (Prüschenk2023Novel).

In addition, IRAG2 interacts with hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN4) channels, reducing the cAMP-dependent shift in voltage-dependence, which suggests a regulatory role in cellular excitability (Peters2022Regulation). These interactions highlight IRAG2's involvement in various physiological processes, including immune response, taste perception, and pancreatic function (Prüschenk2023Novel).
