# SIGLEC7

## Overview
SIGLEC7 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 7, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes, where it functions as an inhibitory receptor involved in immune regulation. SIGLEC7 plays a critical role in recognizing sialic acid-containing glycoproteins on cell surfaces, which is essential for modulating immune responses and maintaining self-tolerance (Zheng2020The; Nicoll1999Identification). The protein's structure includes an extracellular region with immunoglobulin-like domains and a cytoplasmic tail containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs), which are crucial for its role in cell signaling (Yamakawa2020Discovery; Nicoll1999Identification). SIGLEC7's interactions with sialylated ligands on target cells can lead to the recruitment of phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, thereby modulating NK cell activity and contributing to immune regulation (Zheng2020The). The gene and its encoded protein have significant implications in various diseases, including cancer, where they are involved in mechanisms of immune evasion and are being explored as potential therapeutic targets (van2023Tumor; Chang2022Molecular).

## Structure
Siglec-7 is a type 1 membrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, encoded by a full-length cDNA sequence of 1748 base pairs, which translates into 467 amino acids (Nicoll1999Identification). The protein features an extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like domains: an N-terminal V-set domain and two C2-set domains, which act as spacers projecting the ligand-binding site away from the membrane surface (Yamakawa2020Discovery). The V-set domain is crucial for sialic acid binding and includes a conserved arginine residue at position 124, essential for this interaction (Yamaji2002A; Yamakawa2020Discovery).

The cytoplasmic tail of Siglec-7 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an ITIM-like motif, which are involved in negative regulatory signaling (Yamakawa2020Discovery). The protein is expressed as a monomer with a molecular mass of approximately 65 kDa (Nicoll1999Identification). Siglec-7 undergoes common post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, with eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites identified (Nicoll1999Identification).

The protein's structure is characterized by a β-sandwich fold in the V-set domain, formed by two β-sheets, which is typical of immunoglobulin-like domains (Yamakawa2020Discovery). The flexibility of the C-C′ loop within this domain is significant for ligand-binding specificity, particularly in interactions with sialosides (Yamakawa2020Discovery).

## Function
SIGLEC7, or sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 7, is a protein primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes, playing a crucial role in immune regulation. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in recognizing sialic acid-containing glycoproteins on cell surfaces, which is essential for modulating immune responses and maintaining self-tolerance (Zheng2020The; Nicoll1999Identification).

In NK cells, SIGLEC7 functions as an inhibitory receptor, mediating sialic acid-dependent ligand recognition. This interaction is crucial for reducing NK cell cytotoxicity towards target cells by recruiting SHP-1/2 phosphatases, which block signal conduction pathways and play a negative regulatory role (Zheng2020The). The presence of immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic tail is significant for its function in cell signaling, providing docking sites for phosphatases that mediate inhibitory signaling (Zheng2020The; Nicoll1999Identification).

In monocytes, SIGLEC7 can also trigger activating signals, leading to a pro-inflammatory response. This is associated with the phosphorylation of the ERK pathway and the production of cytokines and chemokines, indicating its role in pathogen recognition and immune response (Varchetta2012Engagement).

## Clinical Significance
SIGLEC7, a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin family, plays a significant role in immune regulation and has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. Alterations in SIGLEC7 expression or its interactions can contribute to tumor immune evasion. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), CLL B cells express higher levels of Siglec-7 ligands compared to healthy cells, which helps them evade natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This immune evasion is facilitated by the disialyl-T structure synthesized by the enzyme ST6GALNAC4, and high expression of this enzyme is associated with poor prognosis in CLL patients (Chang2022Molecular).

In the context of solid tumors, SIGLEC7 is exploited by cancer cells to suppress NK cell activity, aiding in immune escape. This is similar to the mechanism of PD-1, another immune checkpoint receptor (van2023Tumor). Targeting the Siglec-7/sialic acid axis with therapeutics, such as sialyltransferase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies, is being explored to enhance anti-tumor immunity (van2023Tumor; Lin2021Functions).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SIGLEC7 expression is down-regulated, and its lower expression levels are associated with more advanced disease stages and poorer prognosis (Yao2021Functional). These findings highlight the potential of SIGLEC7 as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
SIGLEC7, a sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin, participates in various interactions that modulate immune responses. It is known to bind sialylated glycoproteins on target cells, which can lead to the formation of inhibitory complexes with phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, thereby influencing natural killer (NK) cell activity (Zheng2020The).

SIGLEC7 interacts with leukosialin (CD43/sialophorin, gene name SPN) on K562 cells, a human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line. This interaction was identified using mass spectrometry and confirmed through proximity labeling, indicating that SPN is a significant counter-receptor for SIGLEC7 (Yoshimura2021Identification). The binding of SIGLEC7 to SPN is sialic acid-dependent, and SPN's high expression and antiadhesive properties may inhibit SIGLEC7 binding when not sufficiently modified with glycan epitopes (Yoshimura2021Identification).

SIGLEC7 also interacts with nucleolin (NCL) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU), although the direct interaction with NCL was not observed (Yoshimura2021Identification). These interactions highlight the complex network of SIGLEC7's involvement in immune regulation and its potential role in modulating NK cell function.
