# ANKRD11

## Overview
ANKRD11 is a gene located on chromosome 16q24.3 that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 11, a transcriptional co-regulator involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and its role in modulating transcription through interactions with histone deacetylases and acetyltransferases. ANKRD11 is crucial for the regulation of gene expression, acting as a coactivator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein and playing a significant role in neurodevelopment by influencing neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation. Mutations in ANKRD11 are associated with several developmental disorders, including KBG syndrome, highlighting its importance in normal human development and its potential implications in disease (Neilsen2008Identification; Parenti2021ANKRD11; He2024Insights).

## Structure
The ANKRD11 protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes several distinct domains that contribute to its function as a transcriptional co-regulator. The protein consists of 2,663 amino acids and features an ankyrin repeat domain (ANK), a transcriptional activation domain (AD), and two transcriptional repression domains (RD1 and RD2) (Parenti2021ANKRD11; He2024Insights). The ankyrin repeat domain, located at the N-terminus, comprises five consecutive ankyrin repeat motifs, each containing a 33-residue sequence that facilitates protein-protein interactions (He2024Insights). This domain follows a canonical helix-loop-helix-β-hairpin/loop configuration (He2024Insights).

The ANK domain is crucial for binding to the conserved N-terminal Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) region of the p160 coactivator, while the RD1 and RD2 domains are involved in recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) (He2024Insights). ANKRD11 also interacts with ADA3, part of the p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) complex, enhancing p53 activity through P/CAF-mediated acetylation (He2024Insights). The protein's structure allows it to act as a molecular bridge between coactivators or corepressors and histone deacetylases or histone acetyltransferases, regulating the transcription of target genes (He2024Insights).

## Function
The ANKRD11 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional co-regulator, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ANKRD11 is predominantly localized in the cell nucleus, where it regulates gene expression by interacting with transcriptional repressors and activators. It recruits chromatin remodelers, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases, to modulate transcriptional activity (Willemsen2009Identification; He2024Insights).

ANKRD11 acts as a coactivator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, enhancing its transcriptional activity by increasing p53 acetylation and DNA-binding ability. This interaction is crucial for p53's role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, contributing to genomic stability and tumor suppression (Neilsen2008Identification). ANKRD11 also interacts with other proteins, such as p14 ARF and PML, within nuclear foci, suggesting a role in the cellular response to DNA damage (Neilsen2008Identification).

In the context of neurodevelopment, ANKRD11 is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors, influencing neuronal plasticity and dendritic differentiation. Mutations in ANKRD11 are associated with developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in normal brain development (Parenti2021ANKRD11).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANKRD11 gene are primarily associated with KBG syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, short stature, distinctive facial features, and macrodontia of the upper central incisors (Gao2022Genetic; Low2016Clinical). The gene is located at 16q24.3, and its mutations can lead to haploinsufficiency or a dominant-negative effect, depending on the type of mutation (Parenti2021ANKRD11; Gao2022Genetic).

ANKRD11 mutations have also been identified in individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) and Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), which share overlapping clinical features with KBG syndrome (Parenti2021ANKRD11). These conditions are part of a broader group of disorders known as chromatinopathies, which are linked to chromatin regulators (Parenti2021ANKRD11).

In addition to genetic mutations, alterations in ANKRD11 expression or function can impact neurodevelopment and skeletal formation, contributing to the phenotypic variability observed in these syndromes (Bestetti2022Expanding). The gene's variants are associated with a wide range of developmental disorders, indicating its significant role in human development (Parenti2021ANKRD11).

## Interactions
ANKRD11 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin modification. It acts as a coactivator of the p53 protein, enhancing its transcriptional activity by increasing acetylation and DNA-binding activity. ANKRD11 associates with p53, p14 ARF, and PML within extranucleolar inclusions, forming a complex that is particularly active during DNA damage responses (Neilsen2008Identification). 

ANKRD11 also interacts with histone acetyltransferases such as P/CAF and hADA3, which are involved in the acetylation of p53 at Lys320, enhancing its transcriptional activity without affecting total p53 protein levels (Neilsen2008Identification). This interaction is crucial for the functional rescue of mutant p53, such as the R273H variant, by enhancing its DNA-binding activity (Neilsen2008Identification).

ANKRD11 is involved in recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) through its repression domains, interacting with the p160 coactivator family, including RAC3, to suppress nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation (Awamleh2022ANKRD11; He2024Insights). These interactions highlight ANKRD11's role in modulating gene expression and its potential as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer (Neilsen2008Identification).
