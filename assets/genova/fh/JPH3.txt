# JPH3

## Overview
JPH3 is a gene that encodes the protein junctophilin 3, which is a crucial component in the formation of junctional membrane complexes in excitable cells, particularly neurons. Junctophilin 3 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, characterized by its eight N-terminal 'membrane occupation and recognition nexus' (MORN) domains, a space-spanning alpha helix, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. These structural features enable it to anchor the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, facilitating intracellular calcium signaling essential for neuronal function and plasticity (Hu2017Epigenomic; Bourinaris2021Allelic). The gene is predominantly expressed in the brain, with significant roles in maintaining calcium homeostasis and neuronal excitability. Mutations in JPH3 are linked to Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), a neurodegenerative disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Seixas2012Loss; Schneider2012JPH3).

## Structure
Junctophilin 3 (JPH3) is a protein that plays a critical role in forming junctional membrane complexes between the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum in excitable cells. The protein contains eight N-terminal 'membrane occupation and recognition nexus' (MORN) domains, which are essential for binding to the plasma membrane (Hu2017Epigenomic). These MORN domains are followed by a space-spanning alpha helix and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD), which anchors the protein into the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (Hu2017Epigenomic). The C-terminal TMD is crucial for the protein's function, as it helps maintain the structural integrity of the junctional complexes (Bourinaris2021Allelic).

JPH3 is expressed in various brain regions, with the highest levels in the hippocampus, and is involved in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis (Hu2017Epigenomic; Bourinaris2021Allelic). The gene has four splicing variants, with variant 1 encoding a full-length 748-amino acid protein, while variants 2 and 3 are shorter isoforms, and variant 4 is a non-coding RNA (Hu2017Epigenomic). JPH3 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could affect its function and localization.

## Function
Junctophilin 3 (JPH3) is a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of junctional membrane complexes, which are essential for intracellular communication between the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in neurons. This protein is involved in the regulation of neuronal calcium flux, which is crucial for proper neuronal signaling and excitability (Seixas2012Loss; Bourinaris2021Allelic). JPH3 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it helps maintain the structural integrity and functional regulation of junctional complexes, facilitating calcium signaling pathways necessary for synaptic function and plasticity (Bourinaris2021Allelic; Piggott2021Junctophilins:).

In healthy human cells, JPH3 is involved in the production of afterhyperpolarization (AHP) currents, which are important for determining the frequency of action potentials. This function is achieved by coupling NMDA receptors, ryanodine receptors (RyRs), and small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels, which are essential for intracellular communication linking membrane depolarization to AHP current generation (Piggott2021Junctophilins:). The protein's activity is crucial for motor coordination and learning, as evidenced by knockout studies in mice that show impairments in these functions when JPH3 is absent (Piggott2021Junctophilins:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the JPH3 gene are associated with Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), a neurodegenerative disorder that shares similarities with Huntington's disease (HD) but is caused by different genetic mutations. HDL2 is linked to CTG/CAG repeat expansions in the JPH3 gene, which can lead to motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms (Seixas2012Loss; Schneider2012JPH3). The disease is characterized by a progressive akinetic-rigid syndrome and severe dementia, with onset typically occurring in the mid-twenties to late thirties (Schneider2012JPH3). 

In HDL2, the expanded CUG repeat in the JPH3 gene may lead to a decrease in translatable full-length JPH3 transcript and a loss of JPH3 protein expression, contributing to the disease pathogenesis (Seixas2012Loss). The presence of expanded polyglutamine tracts, common in HD, is not evident in HDL2, suggesting that the pathogenesis may not fully involve expanded polyglutamine toxicity (Seixas2012Loss). 

The JPH3 gene mutations are particularly prevalent in individuals of African descent, with a significant number of cases reported in South African and African-American populations (Schneider2012JPH3; Krause2015Junctophilin). The genetic basis of HDL2 in these populations suggests a founder effect, with a common haplotype indicating a potential predisposition to JPH3 expansion (Krause2015Junctophilin).

## Interactions
Junctophilin 3 (JPH3) is involved in the formation of a tripartite complex with Cav1.3 calcium channels, RyR2 ryanodine receptors, and KCa3.1 potassium channels in neurons. This complex is crucial for regulating neuronal excitability and slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) in hippocampal neurons. JPH3, along with JPH4, tethers these proteins at the junctions between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM), facilitating their physical interaction and functional coupling (Sahu2019Junctophilin).

The presence of JPH3 is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of this complex, as its knockdown leads to a significant reduction in the overlap between Cav1.3, RyR2, and KCa3.1, indicating disrupted interactions (Sahu2019Junctophilin). Super-resolution imaging techniques have demonstrated that these proteins are in close spatial proximity, with distances less than 10 nm, suggesting a tight interaction facilitated by JPH3 (Sahu2019Junctophilin).

JPH3 is also implicated in the coupling of NMDA receptors, RyRs, and SK channels, which are essential for afterhyperpolarization (AHP) currents. The absence of AHP in JPH3 knockout models suggests its critical role in the co-assembly of these channels, affecting neuronal excitability and action potential frequency (Piggott2021Junctophilins:).
