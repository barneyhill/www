# CFI

## Overview
Complement factor I (CFI) is a gene located on chromosome 4q25 that encodes a serine protease crucial for the regulation of the complement system, an integral part of the immune response. The protein product, complement factor I, is synthesized primarily in the liver and circulates in the blood as a heterodimer composed of a heavy chain and a light chain linked by a disulfide bond. The heavy chain includes domains such as the FI-membrane attack complex (FIMAC) domain, a CD5-like domain, and two low-density lipoprotein receptor domains, while the light chain contains the serine protease domain responsible for its enzymatic activity (Nilsson2011Complement; Nilsson2009Genetic). Complement factor I plays a pivotal role in maintaining immune homeostasis by cleaving activated complement components C3b and C4b, thereby preventing excessive complement activation and protecting host tissues from damage (Dreismann2021Functional; Nilsson2011Complement). Mutations in the CFI gene are associated with various diseases, including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and age-related macular degeneration, highlighting its clinical significance (Bienaime2010Mutations; van2013A).

## Structure
Complement factor I (CFI) is a serine protease with a complex molecular structure. It is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain that is cleaved into a heavy chain (50 kDa) and a light chain (38 kDa), linked by a disulfide bond (Nilsson2011Complement; Nilsson2009Genetic). The heavy chain comprises several domains: the FI membrane attack complex (FIMAC) domain, a CD5-like domain, and two low-density lipoprotein receptor domains (LDLr1 and LDLr2) (Nilsson2011Complement; Rodriguez2014New). The light chain contains the serine protease (SP) domain, which includes a catalytic triad formed by His362, Asp411, and Ser507 (Nilsson2011Complement; Nilsson2009Genetic).

The tertiary structure of CFI is compact, with a higher proportion of buried residues compared to other complement proteins (Rodriguez2014New). CFI undergoes glycosylation, with each chain containing three N-linked glycans (Nilsson2011Complement). The protein contains 40 cysteines, 36 of which form intra-domain disulfide bridges, while the remaining four connect different domains (Nilsson2011Complement). CFI is primarily expressed in the liver, but also by other cell types, and its expression is upregulated during inflammation (Nilsson2011Complement). The CFI gene is located on chromosome 4q25 and consists of 13 exons (Nilsson2009Genetic).

## Function
Complement factor I (CFI) is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the complement system, an essential component of the immune response. CFI is primarily active in the plasma and is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of activated complement components C3b and C4b, which are critical for the amplification of the complement cascade. This cleavage process requires the presence of specific cofactors such as Factor H (FH), C4b-binding protein (C4BP), complement receptor 1 (CR1), or CD46 (Nilsson2011Complement; Nilsson2009Genetic).

In healthy human cells, CFI functions to prevent excessive activation of the complement system, thereby protecting self-tissues from damage and maintaining immune homeostasis. By inactivating C3b and C4b, CFI inhibits the formation of the C3 convertase, a key enzyme in the complement pathways, thus preventing the overactivation of the immune response (Dreismann2021Functional; Nilsson2011Complement).

CFI is synthesized mainly in the liver and circulates in the blood as a heterodimer composed of a heavy chain and a light chain linked by a disulfide bond. The heavy chain includes domains such as the FI-membrane attack complex (FIMAC) domain, a CD5 domain, and two low-density lipoprotein receptor domains, while the light chain contains the serine protease domain (Nilsson2011Complement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFI gene, which encodes Complement Factor I, are associated with several diseases due to its role in regulating the complement system. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is one such condition, characterized by systemic thrombotic microangiopathy. Mutations in CFI can lead to a deficiency in Factor I, predisposing individuals to aHUS. These mutations are often heterozygous and can result in poor clinical outcomes, including end-stage renal disease or death (Bienaime2010Mutations).

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is another condition linked to CFI mutations. Rare, highly penetrant missense mutations in CFI, such as p.Gly119Arg, have been identified as high-risk factors for AMD. These mutations can lead to reduced serum levels of Factor I and impaired degradation of C3b, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Kavanagh2015Rare; van2013A).

CFI deficiency, a rare immunodeficiency, results in increased susceptibility to infections and can present with various clinical manifestations, including rheumatological and neurological symptoms. This deficiency is often due to bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations, leading to uncontrolled complement activation (Nanthapisal2018Cutaneous; Shields2019Classical).

## Interactions
Complement factor I (CFI) is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the complement system by interacting with various cofactors and substrates. CFI forms complexes with cofactors such as complement factor H (CFH), C4b-binding protein (C4BP), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), and complement receptor 1 (CR1) to cleave and inactivate complement components C3b and C4b. These interactions are primarily ionic and have low binding affinities, which are more observable in non-physiological low-salt conditions (Nilsson2011Complement).

The binding of CFI to C3b and C4b is influenced by these cofactors, which can induce conformational changes in CFI, making its active site accessible for substrate degradation. The presence of CFH increases the affinity between C3b and CFI, suggesting that CFH induces a conformational change in C3b that exposes peptide bonds for CFI cleavage (Nilsson2011Complement). The FIMAC domain of CFI may bind to the C345C domain of C3b/C4b, potentially blocking the active site or maintaining the serine protease domain in an inactive conformation until proper substrate presentation by cofactors (Nilsson2011Complement).

CFI's interactions with C3b and CFH are crucial for the formation of the regulatory trimolecular complex (TMC), and certain CFI variants can affect these interactions, impacting the cleavage of C3b (Hallam2022A).
