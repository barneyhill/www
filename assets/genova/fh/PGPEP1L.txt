# PGPEP1L

## Overview
The PGPEP1L gene encodes the protein pyroglutamyl-peptidase I like, which is involved in the hydrolysis of pyroglutamyl residues from the N-terminus of peptides. This protein is categorized as a peptidase, specifically functioning to remove pyroglutamate, a post-translational modification that can affect protein stability and function. The activity of pyroglutamyl-peptidase I like is crucial in various biological processes, including protein maturation and degradation, and it may play a role in regulating peptide hormone activity. Understanding the function and regulation of PGPEP1L is important for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
