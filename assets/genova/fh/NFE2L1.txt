# NFE2L1

## Overview
NFE2L1, also known as nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 1, is a gene that encodes the NFE2 like bZIP transcription factor 1, commonly referred to as Nrf1. This protein is a transcription factor that belongs to the cap 'n' collar (CNC) basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, which is involved in regulating the expression of genes critical for cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Chan1993Cloning; Ren2021The). Nrf1 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and undergoes complex post-translational modifications that enable its activation and translocation to the nucleus, where it binds to antioxidant-response elements (AREs) to modulate gene expression (Chandran2023Role; Chepelev2024Identification). The protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining proteostasis, redox balance, and lipid metabolism, and its dysfunction is linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, liver diseases, and metabolic syndromes (Xu2005Liverspecific; Zhang2016Molecular).

## Structure
The NFE2L1 protein, also known as Nrf1, is a transcription factor characterized by a complex molecular structure with multiple domains and isoforms. It contains nine structural domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), acidic domain 1 (AD1), asparagine/serine/threonine-rich (NST) domain, acidic domain 2 (AD2), serine repeat (SR) domain, Neh6L, CNC, bZIP, and C-terminal domain (CTD) (Ren2021The; Zhang2024Understanding). The CNC and bZIP domains are crucial for DNA binding and dimerization, enabling NFE2L1 to function as a transcription factor (Chan1993Cloning; Ren2021The).

NFE2L1 is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via its NTD, which contains an ER-targeting sequence (Chepelev2024Identification). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation in the ER and deglycosylation in the cytosol, which are essential for its activation (Chandran2023Role). Alternative splicing and selective use of translation initiation codons generate various isoforms, such as TCF11, NFE2L1α, and LCR-F1/NFE2L1β, each with distinct functions and cellular localizations (Ren2021The; Zhang2024Understanding).

The NFE2L1-616 isoform, derived from an intronic promoter, lacks the N-terminal residues that target other isoforms to the ER, resulting in its nuclear localization and strong transcriptional activity (Ho2023Characterization). This diversity in isoforms and modifications allows NFE2L1 to play versatile roles in cellular stress responses and gene regulation.

## Function
NFE2L1, also known as NRF1, is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organ integrity. It is involved in the regulation of genes through antioxidant-response elements (AREs), which are crucial for managing oxidative stress in cells (Biswas2010Role; Zhang2016Molecular). NFE2L1 is essential for the basal expression of genes involved in antioxidant and detoxifying processes, such as those encoding proteasome subunits and antioxidant response proteins (Chandran2023Role; Zhang2016Molecular).

In healthy human cells, NFE2L1 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and undergoes retrotranslocation to the cytosol, where it is degraded by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway under basal conditions. Upon proteasome inhibition, NFE2L1 is deglycosylated and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of proteasome subunit genes by binding to AREs (Chandran2023Role). This process is crucial for maintaining proteostasis and cellular health, particularly in response to oxidative stress and other cellular challenges (Zhang2016Molecular).

NFE2L1 also plays a role in regulating redox homeostasis and is involved in the expression of genes related to RNA metabolism, lipid metabolism, and protein folding and degradation (Chandran2023Role). Its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and deglycosylation, which are essential for its activation as a transcription factor (Chandran2023Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NFE2L1 gene, also known as NRF1, have been implicated in various diseases. In the brain, NFE2L1 is crucial for maintaining proteasome function, and its deficiency can lead to neurodegenerative conditions such as age-dependent forebrain atrophy and progressive motor ataxia. This is due to impaired proteasomal function and apoptotic neuron death, although these conditions are not typically associated with increased oxidative stress (Zhang2016Molecular; Lee2011Loss).

In the liver, NFE2L1 plays a protective role against oxidative stress and is involved in lipid homeostasis. Liver-specific knockout of NFE2L1 in mice results in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatic cancer, characterized by steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis (Xu2005Liverspecific; Zhang2016Molecular). NFE2L1 deficiency also affects glucose metabolism, leading to insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, as it disrupts normal insulin signaling and glucose utilization (Zhang2016Molecular).

In the kidneys, reduced NFE2L1 expression is associated with podocyte injury and kidney diseases, potentially due to lipid accumulation and impaired antioxidant defense (Elshani2023Transcription). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in various pathologies when its normal function is disrupted.

## Interactions
NFE2L1, also known as NRF1, is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It forms heterodimers with small Maf proteins, such as MafG, MafK, and MafF, which are essential for its DNA binding activity to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in target genes (Ren2021The). NFE2L1 also interacts with other transcription factors, including FosB, c-Jun, JunD, and ATF4, to form functional dimers that regulate gene expression. These interactions are crucial for differentially regulating subsets of genes with NF-E2/AP1-like ARE sequences (Zhang2016Molecular).

NFE2L1 undergoes post-translational modifications that influence its interactions and stability. It is subject to ubiquitination by HRD1 and deubiquitination by ubiquitin-specific proteases, affecting its degradation by the 26S proteasome (Zhang2024Understanding). The protein is also phosphorylated, interacting with Fbw7 and β-TrCP ubiquitin E3 ligases, which lead to its proteasomal degradation (Zhang2024Understanding). O-GlcNAcylation by OGT and HCF-1 can antagonize phosphorylation, leading to NFE2L1 accumulation in the nucleus (Chandran2023Role). These interactions and modifications highlight NFE2L1's role in cellular stress responses and gene regulation.
