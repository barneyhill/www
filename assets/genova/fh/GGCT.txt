# GGCT

## Overview
Gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase (GGCT) is a gene that encodes the enzyme gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase, which plays a pivotal role in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, a critical component of glutathione metabolism. This enzyme is classified as a transferase and is primarily involved in the conversion of gamma-glutamyl amino acids to 5-oxoproline, facilitating the turnover of glutathione and maintaining cellular redox balance (Oakley2008The; Bachhawat2017Glutathione). GGCT is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for cellular homeostasis, particularly in the renal tubule and across the blood-brain barrier, where it supports the synthesis and utilization of glutathione, a key antioxidant (Oakley2008The). The gene's expression and the enzyme's activity have significant implications in various physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer, where GGCT is often upregulated and associated with poor prognosis (Kageyama2018Mechanisms; Zheng2024Identified).

## Function
Gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase (GGCT) is an enzyme encoded by the GGCT gene, playing a crucial role in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, which is integral to glutathione metabolism. GGCT catalyzes the conversion of gamma-glutamyl amino acids to 5-oxoproline, a process essential for the turnover of glutathione and the maintenance of cellular redox balance (Oakley2008The; Bachhawat2017Glutathione). This enzymatic activity is particularly significant in the renal tubule and across the blood-brain barrier, where it contributes to the synthesis and utilization of glutathione, a key antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and detoxifies harmful compounds (Oakley2008The).

GGCT is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by processing gamma-glutamyl amino acids, which are substrates for further metabolic reactions (Bachhawat2017Glutathione). The enzyme's activity is crucial under normal metabolic conditions, ensuring the availability of gamma-glutamylcysteine for glutathione synthesis (Oakley2008The). GGCT's function is also implicated in the pathology of glutathione synthetase deficiency, where its inhibition could prevent the degradation of gamma-glutamylcysteine, allowing it to substitute for glutathione in redox and detoxification reactions (Oakley2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GGCT gene have been implicated in various cancers. GGCT is highly expressed in several cancer types, including breast, uterine cervical, lung, colon, esophageal, ovarian cancers, osteosarcoma, and glioma. High GGCT expression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and is suggested as a potential serum marker. In ovarian cancer, GGCT upregulation correlates with advanced disease stages and poor survival outcomes (Kageyama2018Mechanisms). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), GGCT is overexpressed and linked to poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival. It is considered an independent risk factor and is associated with poorer immune treatment responses (Zheng2024Identified).

GGCT is involved in several cancer-related pathways, including cell cycle regulation and RNA degradation. Its high expression is linked to poorer overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients, and it is considered an independent risk factor (Zheng2024Identified). GGCT knockdown has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kageyama2018Mechanisms). GGCT's role in glutathione metabolism and its potential involvement in metabolic reprogramming in tumors are also noted (Zheng2024Identified).

## Interactions
Gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase (GGCT) interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular pathways. One notable interaction is with Prohibitin-2 (PHB2), identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. GGCT promotes the translocation of PHB2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where PHB2 binds to the p21 promoter. This interaction is disrupted upon GGCT knockdown, leading to the upregulation of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which results in cell cycle arrest and senescence (Taniguchi2018Prohibitin2).

GGCT also interacts with the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L9 (MRPL9). Their simultaneous knockdown suppresses ERK phosphorylation, suggesting a role in the regulation of the ERK pathway (Saito2023Identification). Additionally, GGCT influences the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of STAT3, a transcription factor that activates the MET gene promoter. This interaction affects c-Met expression, a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cancer cell growth (Saito2023Identification).

These interactions highlight GGCT's role in modulating key signaling pathways, including those involving p21, ERK, and STAT3, which are crucial for cell proliferation and cancer progression.
