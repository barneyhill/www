# TRPC4AP

## Overview
TRPC4AP, or transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 4 associated protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the thyroid gland. The protein encoded by TRPC4AP functions as an adapter molecule, playing a crucial role in the NF-kB signaling pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation and survival. It is notably involved in thyroid development and function, interacting with key thyroid transcription factors and proteins. Additionally, TRPC4AP is associated with specific transient receptor potential cation (TRPC) channels, forming complexes that influence calcium signaling dynamics within cells. The gene has clinical significance, with mutations linked to congenital primary hypothyroidism and potential associations with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its importance in both endocrine and neurological contexts (Mace2010TRUSS; Choukair2020Identification; Poduslo2008Genome).

## Function
TRPC4AP, or transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 4 associated protein, plays a significant role in thyroid development and function. It is highly expressed in the thyroid gland and is involved in pathways related to thyroid gland development and hormone synthesis. TRPC4AP functions as an adapter molecule to IKBKG (NF-kB), a crucial component in the NF-kB signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and survival (Choukair2020Identification). This interaction is essential for maintaining thyroid physiology, as NF-kB controls the expression of thyroid proteins such as the sodium iodide symporter, TTF 1/NKX2-1, PAX8, TPO, and TG, which are vital for thyroid organogenesis and function (Choukair2020Identification).

TRPC4AP is also associated with thyroid transcription factors like NKX 2-1, PAX8, and FOXE1, which are essential for thyroid organogenesis (Choukair2020Identification). The protein's role in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal thyroid development and function, as evidenced by experiments showing significant reductions in thyroid size following TRPC4AP knockdown or knockout (Choukair2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TRPC4AP gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably congenital primary hypothyroidism (CH) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. In the context of CH, TRPC4AP is crucial for normal thyroid development. Studies using Xenopus laevis as a model organism demonstrated that knockdown or knockout of TRPC4AP results in significantly reduced thyroid size, indicating its essential role in thyroid growth and function. Whole exome sequencing in patients with CH identified variants in TRPC4AP, suggesting its potential involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Choukair2020Identification). These mutations may disrupt pathways related to thyroid hormone synthesis and iodine transport, contributing to thyroid dysfunction (Choukair2020Identification).

In Alzheimer's disease, TRPC4AP has been identified through haplotype analysis as a gene potentially linked to genetic susceptibility. Significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TRPC4AP were associated with the disease in extended pedigrees, suggesting a role in late-onset Alzheimer's (Poduslo2008Genome). Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, these findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in neurodegenerative processes. Additionally, TRPC4AP is involved in the regulation of Myc protein turnover, with its downregulation in cancer cells leading to Myc stabilization, which is often observed in cancers (Choi2010Myc).

## Interactions
TRPC4AP, also known as transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 4 associated protein, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with several TRPC ion channels, specifically TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5, but not with TRPC3, TRPC6, or TRPC7. These interactions were demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, confirming that TRPC4AP specifically associates with the TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 subfamily of ion channels (Mace2010TRUSS).

TRPC4AP also functions as an adapter molecule in the NF-kB signaling pathway. It interacts with the IKBKG (NF-kB essential modulator), which is crucial for thyroid development and function. This interaction is significant in the context of congenital primary hypothyroidism, where TRPC4AP variants may contribute to thyroid dysgenesis and dyshormonogenesis (Choukair2020Identification).

In the context of calcium signaling, TRPC4AP, also known as TRUSS, forms a signaling complex with TNF-R1 and TRPC channels. This complex is involved in reversing the reduction of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ storage in response to m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signaling, highlighting its role in modulating calcium dynamics in cells (Mace2010TRUSS).
