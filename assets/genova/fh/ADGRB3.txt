# ADGRB3

## Overview
ADGRB3, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B3, is a gene that encodes a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, specifically the protein Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 3. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane (7TM) structure and is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in neurons and glial cells. The protein plays a crucial role in synaptogenesis and synapse maintenance, influencing neuronal connectivity and communication. It features a large extracellular N-terminus with thrombospondin type 1 repeats and a GPCR-autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which is essential for its function and activation (Shiu2023Generation; Fu2023Stepwise). ADGRB3 is involved in various protein interactions that are significant for synaptic signaling and neuronal development, and its dysfunction is associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders (Gonda2021Genetic; Scuderi2019Biallelic).

## Structure
The ADGRB3 protein, also known as Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 3, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. It features a typical seven-transmembrane (7TM) structure, which is characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors (Shiu2023Generation). The protein has a large extracellular N-terminus that contains four thrombospondin type 1 repeats and a GPCR-autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain (Shiu2023Generation). The GAIN domain is crucial for the function of aGPCRs, promoting autoproteolytic cleavage into N-terminal (NTF) and C-terminal fragments (CTF) (Fu2023Stepwise). 

ADGRB3's GAIN domain contains a tethered agonist element known as the Stachel sequence, which is necessary for receptor activation (Fu2023Stepwise). The protein is primarily expressed in neurons and glial cells in the brain, with lower expression levels in other tissues such as skeletal muscle and lung (Shiu2023Generation). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ADGRB3 are not provided, the presence of the GAIN domain and its role in receptor activation are well-documented (Folts2019Adhesion). Information on post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The ADGRB3 gene encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B3, which plays a significant role in the central nervous system, particularly in synaptogenesis and synapse maintenance. This protein is highly expressed in the brain, especially in cerebellar Purkinje cells and excitatory neurons in the hippocampus and cortex, where it regulates synaptic connectivity and density (Gonda2021Genetic; Shiu2023Generation). ADGRB3 interacts with various proteins, including neuronal pentraxins and complement-like proteins C1QL1-4, which are crucial for excitatory synaptogenesis on cerebellar Purkinje cells (Bolliger2011The; Sigoillot2015The).

The protein modulates the actin cytoskeleton through RAC1 activity, influencing dendrite morphogenesis and synaptic structure (Lanoue2013The). It is involved in the regulation of dendritic arborization and branching, essential for forming functional neuronal networks (Lanoue2013The). ADGRB3's role in synaptic development is further supported by its interaction with the secreted C1QL proteins, which bind to BAI3 and regulate synapse density (Bolliger2011The). These molecular processes contribute to the protein's critical function in maintaining neuronal connectivity and communication in the brain.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADGRB3 gene are associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. A biallelic intragenic duplication in ADGRB3 has been linked to intellectual disability, cerebellar atrophy, and behavioral disorders. This genetic alteration can lead to a predicted out-of-frame transcript, potentially resulting in nonsense-mediated decay, which impacts brain function due to the gene's predominant expression in the brain (Scuderi2019Biallelic). Disruptions in ADGRB3 are also associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as mood instability, anxiety, hallucinations, and social closure, likely due to hippocampal dysfunctions (Scuderi2019Biallelic).

Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADGRB3 linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and addiction (Gonda2021Genetic). In schizophrenia, reduced ADGRB3 mRNA expression levels have been observed in the hippocampus of affected individuals (Shiu2023Generation). The gene is also implicated in anxious temperament, with a significant SNP identified in association with this trait (Gonda2021Genetic). These findings suggest that ADGRB3 plays a critical role in the genetic basis of various affective and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
ADGRB3, also known as BAI3, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling and function. It interacts with scaffold proteins such as CASK, LIN7C, DLG1, and SNTB2, which are crucial for synaptic function and neuronal development (Knapp2019Affinity). ADGRB3 is also associated with the γ-secretase complex, a group of proteins involved in proteolytic cleavage processes that may lead to the nuclear translocation of intracellular domains for gene regulation (Knapp2019Affinity). 

The GAIN domain of ADGRB3 undergoes mechanical unfolding and dissociation under force, which suggests a role in the mechanical activation of adhesion G protein-coupled receptors. This domain is sensitive to physiological tensile forces, indicating its potential involvement in cellular responses to mechanical stress (Fu2023Stepwise). 

While ADGRB3 is implicated in various intracellular processes, specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies. The interactions identified suggest that ADGRB3 is a key player in synaptic signaling and may influence gene regulation through its association with the γ-secretase complex (Knapp2019Affinity).
