# CMTM4

## Overview
CMTM4, or CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the MARVEL domain-containing family, characterized by its transmembrane properties. The CMTM4 protein is involved in several critical cellular processes, including the regulation of angiogenesis and the maintenance of endothelial barrier function. It plays a significant role in the endocytosis and recycling of VE-cadherin, a key protein in endothelial adherens junctions, thereby contributing to vascular integrity (Chrifi2018CMTM4). Additionally, CMTM4 has been implicated in cancer biology, where it acts as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts and influences immune evasion mechanisms by stabilizing PD-L1, a protein involved in immune checkpoint pathways (Tan2022Prognostic; Li2020ChemokineLike). The gene's expression and interactions have clinical significance, particularly in cancers such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target (Zhu2020Expression; Li2015CMTM4).

## Function
CMTM4 plays a crucial role in regulating angiogenesis and maintaining endothelial barrier function in healthy human cells. It is involved in the endocytosis and recycling of VE-cadherin, a protein essential for maintaining endothelial adherens junctions (AJs). CMTM4 promotes the internalization of VE-cadherin, enhancing its connections with the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for AJ stabilization and vascular integrity (Chrifi2018CMTM4). This process is linked to the Rab4 recycling pathway, which is crucial for the bioavailability of VE-cadherin at cell-cell junctions (Chrifi2018CMTM4).

CMTM4 is primarily localized in the cytosol and colocalizes with endocytic vesicle structures and VE-cadherin in AJs. It shows significant colocalization with Rab4, a marker for recycling vesicles, suggesting its role in recycling and lysosome activity in endocytosis (Chrifi2018CMTM4). Overexpression of CMTM4 enhances the internalization of membrane-bound VE-cadherin, promoting endothelial barrier function and recovery of transendothelial electrical resistance after thrombin stimulation (Chrifi2018CMTM4).

CMTM4 also influences cell cycle regulation and migration. While its silencing reduces migration capacity, overexpression decreases cell proliferation without affecting migration, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor gene (Chrifi2018CMTM4).

## Clinical Significance
CMTM4 is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CMTM4 is frequently downregulated, functioning as a tumor suppressor. Its reduced expression is associated with increased tumor growth and migration, although no correlation with clinical features like age or stage has been found (Li2015CMTM4). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CMTM4's expression is linked to immune characteristics and patient prognosis. High co-expression of CMTM4 with PD-L1 and CD4 is associated with better prognosis, suggesting its role in immune response modulation (Tan2022Prognostic).

In lung cancer, CMTM4 is less expressed in adenocarcinoma tissues, with negative expression correlating with shorter survival times. It acts as an independent prognostic factor and interacts with PD-L1, affecting cancer immunotherapy by protecting PD-L1 from degradation (Zhu2020Expression). CMTM4 also plays a role in ovarian cancer, where its expression is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis due to genetic alterations (Zhang2022Identification). These findings highlight CMTM4's potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
CMTM4 is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of endothelial cells and cancer. In endothelial cells, CMTM4 interacts with VE-cadherin, a key protein in adherens junctions, and is involved in its recycling and trafficking. This interaction is crucial for maintaining endothelial barrier integrity and promoting angiogenesis. CMTM4 colocalizes with Rab4 and Rab7 vesicles, indicating its role in the recycling and lysosome-directed pathways of VE-cadherin (Chrifi2018CMTM4).

In the context of cancer, CMTM4 has been identified as a regulator of PD-L1 stability. It binds to PD-L1, preventing its ubiquitination and degradation, which is significant for immune evasion in tumors. This interaction suggests a potential role for CMTM4 in tumor immunotherapy, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (Tan2022Prognostic; Li2020ChemokineLike). CMTM4's involvement in these interactions highlights its importance in both endothelial cell function and cancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts while promoting immune tolerance in others. However, specific details on its interactions with nucleic acids are not provided in the available context.
