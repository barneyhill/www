# NPEPL1

## Overview
NPEPL1, or N-acylaminoacyl-peptide hydrolase-like 1, is a gene that encodes the protein aminopeptidase like 1, which is categorized as an aminopeptidase enzyme. This protein is involved in the cleavage of amino acids from the N-terminus of peptide substrates, playing a crucial role in protein processing and turnover. NPEPL1 has been implicated in various biological processes and disease pathways, including cancer and neurological disorders. In colorectal cancer, NPEPL1 is part of a regulatory network involving non-coding RNAs that influence tumor progression. Additionally, genetic studies have linked NPEPL1 to structural changes in the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its involvement in neurological conditions (Shen2021LncRNA; Meng2020Multivariate). The gene's diverse roles in cellular processes and disease contexts highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the NPEPL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), NPEPL1 expression is influenced by the long non-coding RNA LINC00342, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA by sponging miR-19a-3p. This interaction affects NPEPL1 expression, contributing to CRC progression. Overexpression of miR-19a-3p reduces NPEPL1 expression, while LINC00342 overexpression counteracts this effect, promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Shen2021LncRNA).

In prostate cancer, higher expression levels of NPEPL1 are associated with an increased risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. NPEPL1 is part of a gene signature used to predict recurrence-free survival and castration resistance, demonstrating significant predictive accuracy (A2021Novel).

In Alzheimer's disease, NPEPL1 has been associated with changes in subcortical brain regions, specifically the putamen volumes, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathology (Meng2020Multivariate).

A novel long-range deletion involving NPEPL1 has been identified in a patient with autosomal-dominant pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b, although the clinical significance of NPEPL1 in this context is not fully understood (Yang2020A).

## Interactions
NPEPL1 (aminopeptidase like 1) is involved in interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in various cellular processes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), NPEPL1 is part of a regulatory axis involving the long non-coding RNA LINC00342 and microRNA miR-19a-3p. LINC00342 acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-19a-3p, which normally inhibits NPEPL1 expression. This interaction promotes CRC progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Shen2021LncRNA; Shen2020LncRNA).

NPEPL1 has also been identified in studies unrelated to cancer. In a multivariate genome-wide association study, NPEPL1 was associated with the volumes of the left and right putamen in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a potential role in neurological conditions (Meng2020Multivariate). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving NPEPL1 in these contexts are not detailed.

In a study on hereditary rectal cancer, NPEPL1 was found to form a fusion with STX16 in cancer tissue, although its role in hereditary cancer syndromes remains unclear (Wallander2021Massive). These findings indicate that NPEPL1 may participate in diverse biological interactions, influencing both cancer and neurological disease pathways.
