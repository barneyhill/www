# ARHGAP21

## Overview
ARHGAP21 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho GTPase activating protein 21, which is a member of the RhoGAP family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the Rho family of GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, and cell adhesion. Rho GTPase activating protein 21 functions as a negative regulator by catalyzing the conversion of active GTP-bound Rho GTPases to their inactive GDP-bound state, thereby influencing cellular dynamics and signaling pathways (Lazarini2013ARHGAP21; Barcellos2013ARHGAP21). The protein is characterized by several domains, including a PDZ domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a RhoGAP domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its recruitment to specific cellular locations (Ménétrey2007Structural). ARHGAP21 is implicated in critical physiological processes such as cell-cell adhesion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and hematopoiesis, and its dysregulation is associated with various clinical conditions, including hematopoietic disorders and mandibular prognathism (Perillo2015Genetic; Barcellos2013ARHGAP21).

## Structure
ARHGAP21 is a large protein consisting of 1,957 amino acids and contains several specific domains: an N-terminal PDZ domain, a central pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal RhoGAP domain (Anthony2011βArrestin; Ménétrey2007Structural). The PH domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for the recruitment of ARHGAP21 to intracellular membranes through its interaction with ARF1 (Ménétrey2007Structural). The PH domain does not bind phosphoinositides due to the absence of basic side chains in key residues, which typically form a positively charged groove for phosphoinositide binding (Ménétrey2007Structural).

The RhoGAP domain is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of active GTP-bound forms of Rho-family GTPases to their inactive GDP-bound state, playing a role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Lazarini2013ARHGAP21). ARHGAP21 undergoes post-translational modification through SUMOylation by SUMO2/3, with a specific lysine at position 1443 identified as a target site (Bigarella2012Post‐translational). This modification affects its subcellular localization and potentially its function in cell proliferation (Bigarella2012Post‐translational). The protein interacts with several other proteins, including β-arrestin 1, which binds to the RhoGAP domain, inhibiting its GAP function and promoting RhoA activation (Anthony2011βArrestin).

## Function
ARHGAP21 is a Rho GTPase activating protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell-cell adhesion, cellular migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in healthy human cells. It functions as a negative regulator of the Rho-GTPase Cdc42, which is involved in vesicle trafficking and focal adhesion kinase activity. ARHGAP21 is essential for the formation and strengthening of cell-cell adhesions, interacting with α-tubulin to modulate its acetylation, which is vital for maintaining cell polarity and cytoskeletal dynamics (Barcellos2013ARHGAP21).

The protein is localized in the nucleus, cytoplasm, or perinuclear region and is transiently redistributed to cell-cell junctions during adhesion formation. Its presence at these junctions is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues, as cells lacking ARHGAP21 exhibit weaker adhesions and increased migration (Barcellos2013ARHGAP21). ARHGAP21 also plays a role in regulating cell motility by modulating adhesion strength, which is important for normal cellular function and tissue integrity (Barcellos2013ARHGAP21).

In the context of hematopoiesis, ARHGAP21 is important for the erythroid commitment of progenitor cells, influencing the balance between erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation (XavierFerrucio2018Hematopoietic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARHGAP21 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. A variant of ARHGAP21, Gly1121Ser, has been linked to mandibular prognathism, a condition characterized by the protrusion of the lower jaw. This variant is rare in the Caucasian population and is predicted to be damaging, potentially affecting cell-cell adhesion and influencing mandibular growth (Perillo2015Genetic).

In the context of hematopoiesis, ARHGAP21 haploinsufficiency in mice leads to hematopoietic defects, including decreased red blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin levels, alongside increased white blood cells and neutrophils. These changes are attributed to impaired adhesion and mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells, affecting blood cell counts and cell adhesion properties (XavierFerrucio2018Hematopoietic).

ARHGAP21 deficiency also impacts the bone marrow microenvironment, resulting in an increase in osteoblastic lineage cells. This alteration may affect hematopoietic stem cell regulation and has implications in conditions like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), where ARHGAP21 expression is altered in mesenchymal stromal cells from patients (Pissarra2021Arhgap21).

In energy homeostasis, ARHGAP21 haploinsufficiency in mice is associated with lower body weight and increased energy expenditure, suggesting a role in metabolic regulation (Soares2019WholeBody).

## Interactions
ARHGAP21 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to ARF1 through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and C-terminal aCter helix, which is crucial for its recruitment to the Golgi complex and interaction with Golgi-associated ARF1 in HeLa cells (Ménétrey2007Structural). ARHGAP21 also interacts with ARF6 and is involved in actin dynamics by regulating the Arp2/3 complex and Cdc42 activity at the Golgi (Ménétrey2007Structural).

In cell-cell adhesion, ARHGAP21 interacts with Cdc42, influencing cell junction dynamics, although it does not co-localize with E-cadherin or α-catenin at these junctions (Barcellos2013ARHGAP21). It also interacts with α-tubulin, affecting microtubule stability and acetylation, which is essential for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration (Barcellos2013ARHGAP21).

ARHGAP21 binds to β-arrestin 1, which inhibits its GTPase-activating function, promoting RhoA activation following angiotensin II receptor stimulation (Anthony2011βArrestin). This interaction is specific to β-arrestin 1 and involves the Rho-GAP domain of ARHGAP21 (Anthony2011βArrestin).
