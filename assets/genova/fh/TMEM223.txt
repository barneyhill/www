# TMEM223

## Overview
TMEM223 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 223, which is categorized as an integral membrane protein located within the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein is associated with the mitochondrial ribosome and plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stability of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, particularly influencing complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase (Dennerlein2021Defining). TMEM223 is involved in the early stages of cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis, interacting with early assembly factors and facilitating the synthesis of COX1, a mitochondrial-encoded subunit of complex IV (Dennerlein2021Defining). Additionally, TMEM223 modulates the function of the CaV2.2 calcium channel, suggesting a role in calcium signaling pathways (Lacinova2020Modulation). The absence of TMEM223 leads to reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity, underscoring its critical function in mitochondrial energy production and respiratory chain assembly (Dennerlein2021Defining).

## Function
TMEM223 is a protein associated with the mitochondrial ribosome and plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, particularly affecting complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase. It is an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane, with its N-and C-termini facing the mitochondrial matrix (Dennerlein2021Defining). TMEM223 is involved in the early stages of cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis, interacting with early assembly factors such as C12ORF62 (COX14) and MITRAC12 (COA3), and is crucial for the synthesis of COX1, a mitochondrial-encoded subunit of complex IV (Dennerlein2021Defining). The absence of TMEM223 leads to a reduction in cytochrome c oxidase activity and affects mitochondrial energy production (Dennerlein2021Defining).

TMEM223 also interacts with the CaV2.2 calcium channel, where it modulates channel function by suppressing current amplitude and increasing cumulative inactivation during action potential trains, suggesting a negative modulatory effect (Lacinova2020Modulation). This interaction indicates a potential role in calcium signaling pathways, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains less defined.

## Interactions
TMEM223 is a mitochondrial ribosome-associated protein that interacts specifically with the 39S large ribosomal subunit (39S mtLSU) in human mitochondria. It is an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane, with its N-and C-termini facing the mitochondrial matrix (Dennerlein2021Defining). TMEM223 plays a role in the early stages of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly by interacting with early MITRAC complexes, particularly with C12ORF62 (COX14) and MITRAC12 (COA3), but not with proteins involved in later stages such as CMC1 or MITRAC7 (Dennerlein2021Defining). This interaction suggests that TMEM223 is involved in the initial steps of cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis, linking mitochondrial translation to the assembly of respiratory chain complexes (Dennerlein2021Defining).

The absence of TMEM223 results in a reduction of cytochrome c oxidase activity and affects the synthesis of the mitochondrial-encoded COX1 protein, indicating its crucial role in the translation and assembly processes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Dennerlein2021Defining). TMEM223's interactions are essential for the proper assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial function (Dennerlein2021Defining).
