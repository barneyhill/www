# SALL2

## Overview
SALL2 is a gene that encodes the spalt like transcription factor 2, a zinc finger transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, cell cycle regulation, and neuronal differentiation. The protein is characterized by multiple zinc finger domains, which facilitate its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Álvarez2021SALL; Hermosilla2017Developmental). SALL2 functions as a tumor suppressor in several cancers by regulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Riffo2022The). It also interacts with other transcription factors and protein complexes, influencing cellular homeostasis and cancer progression (Álvarez2021SALL; Hermosilla2024Casein). The gene's expression and activity are modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by Casein Kinase 2, which affects its stability and function (Hermosilla2024Casein). SALL2's role in cancer, particularly its potential as a therapeutic target, underscores its clinical significance (Ye2019Epigenetic).

## Structure
The SALL2 gene encodes a transcription factor characterized by multiple zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. The primary structure of SALL2 includes a sequence of amino acids that form two main isoforms, E1 and E1A, differing by 25 amino acids at the N-terminal domain (Hermosilla2017Developmental). These isoforms are produced through alternative promoter usage, with E1 containing a nuclear localization sequence and a repressor motif absent in E1A, indicating isoform-specific functions (Hermosilla2017Developmental).

The secondary structure of SALL2 includes zinc finger domains of the C2HC and C2H2 types, which are essential for its function as a transcription factor (Álvarez2021SALL). The tertiary structure is not explicitly detailed, but the presence of zinc finger motifs suggests a folded conformation that facilitates DNA interaction. SALL2 does not have a quaternary structure involving multiple subunits.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by Casein Kinase 2 (CK2), play a significant role in regulating SALL2's stability and function. CK2 phosphorylates SALL2 at specific residues, leading to its degradation via the proteasome pathway (Hermosilla2024Casein). This modification occurs at a conserved C-terminal PEST degradation motif, affecting the protein's stability (Hermosilla2024Casein).

## Function
SALL2 (spalt like transcription factor 2) is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in cell migration by regulating focal adhesion turnover and integrin β1 expression, which are essential for cell movement and adhesion dynamics (Riffo2022The). SALL2 promotes the autophosphorylation of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) at Y397, enhancing focal adhesion dynamics and facilitating cell detachment and migration (Riffo2022The). It directly binds to the ITGB1 promoter, increasing integrin β1 mRNA and protein levels, which are critical for focal adhesion assembly and disassembly (Riffo2022The).

In addition to its role in cell migration, SALL2 is involved in cell cycle regulation by repressing the expression of cyclins D1 and E1, thereby restraining the G1/S transition (Riffo2022The). It also acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis during genotoxic stress (Riffo2022The). SALL2 interacts with the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR and is required for nerve growth factor (NGF)-dependent neurite outgrowth, indicating its involvement in neuronal differentiation (Riffo2022The). These functions highlight SALL2's significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
SALL2 is implicated in various cancers, often acting as a tumor suppressor. In breast cancer, SALL2 is frequently methylated, leading to its downregulation and contributing to tamoxifen resistance. This resistance is linked to the activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway due to decreased PTEN expression, resulting in estrogen-independent growth (Álvarez2021SALL; Ye2019Epigenetic). Restoring SALL2 expression with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can resensitize tamoxifen-resistant cells to therapy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ye2019Epigenetic).

In ovarian cancer, SALL2 is often silenced by promoter hypermethylation, correlating with increased tumorigenicity (Hermosilla2017Developmental). In leukemia, reduced SALL2 expression is associated with accelerated tumorigenesis, and its absence in mouse models leads to enhanced tumorigenesis and lymphoma progression, indicating a tumor suppressor role (Álvarez2021SALL).

SALL2 also plays a role in glioblastoma multiforme, where it contributes to tumor development by maintaining stem-like characteristics in tumor cells. This role contrasts with its tumor suppressor function in other cancers (Álvarez2021SALL). Overall, SALL2's expression and interaction changes significantly impact cancer progression and treatment outcomes.

## Interactions
SALL2, a zinc finger transcription factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing its role in cellular processes. It is known to bind directly to the promoters of genes such as estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) and PTEN, facilitating their transcriptional upregulation (Álvarez2021SALL). SALL2 also interacts with key transcription factors like SOX2, OCT4, and Nanog, which are crucial for maintaining stemness and aggressive behavior in glioblastoma (Álvarez2021SALL; Hermosilla2017Developmental).

SALL2 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle inhibitors such as p21 and p16, and it represses oncogenes like c-MYC by binding to their promoters (Álvarez2021SALL). It also interacts with viral proteins, such as the polyoma large T antigen and HPV16 E6, which can lead to its inactivation and contribute to cancer development (Hermosilla2017Developmental).

In terms of protein complexes, SALL2 is associated with the NuRD complex and interacts with the alpha catalytic subunit of Casein Kinase 2 (CK2), which phosphorylates SALL2, leading to its degradation (Álvarez2021SALL; Hermosilla2024Casein). These interactions highlight SALL2's multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and its potential impact on cancer progression.
