# KLRC2

## Overview
The KLRC2 gene encodes the killer cell lectin-like receptor C2 (NKG2C), a type II transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. NKG2C plays a critical role in the immune system by recognizing and binding to non-classical HLA-E molecules on the surface of stressed or infected cells, thereby facilitating NK cell-mediated cytotoxic responses. This receptor forms heterodimers with CD94, which is essential for its function as an activating receptor, leading to the recruitment of the adaptor protein DAP12 and subsequent activation of NK cells. The expression and functionality of NKG2C are influenced by genetic polymorphisms and deletions in the KLRC2 gene, which can impact immune responses and are associated with various clinical conditions, including viral infections and transplant rejection (Vietzen2023Inhibitory; Goncalves2016Differential; Vietzen2022Deletion).

## Structure
The KLRC2 gene encodes the NKG2C receptor, a protein expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. The primary structure of KLRC2 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an activating receptor. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of KLRC2 forms a lectin-like domain, crucial for ligand binding, particularly with non-classical HLA-E molecules (Goncalves2016Differential).

In terms of quaternary structure, KLRC2 often forms heterodimers with CD94, which is essential for its role in immune signaling. This interaction is significant for the receptor's ability to recruit the adaptor protein DAP12, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), leading to activation signaling in NK cells (Ram2018Tracking).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, affecting the protein's stability and function. These modifications can influence the receptor's interaction with ligands and its overall activity in immune responses. Splice variants of KLRC2 may lead to different isoforms, potentially altering its function and expression in various tissues (Yang2022A).

## Function
The KLRC2 gene encodes the NKG2C receptor, a type II integral membrane protein that is part of the natural killer (NK) cell receptor complex. This receptor is primarily involved in the immune response by recognizing and binding to HLA-E molecules on the surface of stressed or infected cells. Upon binding, NKG2C forms heterodimers with CD94, which triggers cytotoxic responses and the release of proinflammatory molecules, promoting the differentiation and expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells (Goncalves2016Differential; Vietzen2022Deletion).

NKG2C is an activating receptor that associates with the ITAM motif of the adaptor protein DAP12, leading to the activation of NK cells. This activation is crucial for the cytotoxic activity of NK cells and the production of cytokines such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, which are important for the immune response against virally infected and tumorigenic cells (Goncalves2016Differential). The expression of NKG2C is influenced by polymorphisms in the KLRC2 gene, which can affect the number and functionality of NKG2C+ NK cells, impacting immune responses and potentially contributing to transplant rejection (Vietzen2022Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KLRC2 gene, which encodes the NKG2C receptor, have been associated with various diseases and conditions. KLRC2 deletion variants are linked to an increased risk of developing Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-associated lymphomas, such as Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (nHL). The absence of a strong NKG2C+ natural killer (NK) cell response, particularly in individuals with KLRC2 deletion variants, is associated with the progression of these lymphomas (Vietzen2023Inhibitory).

In the context of COVID-19, KLRC2 deletions are significantly associated with severe disease outcomes. Patients with these deletions are more likely to require hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. The KLRC2 del allele is identified as an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, with odds ratios indicating a higher risk for severe outcomes (Vietzen2021Deletion).

KLRC2 deletions also impact the immune response to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Individuals with the deletion have a reduced number of NKG2C+ NK cells, which affects their ability to control HCMV infection. This is particularly significant in immunocompromised individuals, such as lung transplant recipients, where the deletion is a risk factor for HCMV viremia and disease (Vietzen2017NKG2C; Muntasell2013NKG2C).

## Interactions
The KLRC2 gene encodes the NKG2C receptor, which is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. NKG2C forms heterodimers with CD94 and interacts with HLA-E, a non-classical MHC class I molecule. This interaction is crucial for NK cell-mediated immune responses, as it influences the activation of NK cell cytotoxic activity. The binding of NKG2C to HLA-E, which is stabilized by peptides derived from stressed or infected cells, triggers cytotoxic responses and the release of proinflammatory molecules. This process promotes the expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells, enhancing their immune function (Vietzen2022Deletion).

In the context of kidney transplantation, the interaction between NKG2C and HLA-E may play a role in antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). The presence of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) can lead to increased NK cell activity through this interaction, contributing to transplant rejection (Vietzen2022Deletion). Additionally, the study suggests that KLRC2 variants, which affect NKG2C expression, may influence the pathogenicity of DSA and the immune response in transplant recipients (Vietzen2022Deletion). However, these interactions do not significantly impact long-term graft survival (Vietzen2022Deletion).
