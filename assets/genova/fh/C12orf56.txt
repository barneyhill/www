# C12orf56

## Overview
C12orf56 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 12 open reading frame 56. While the specific biological function of this protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular processes and disease states. The protein encoded by C12orf56 is not currently categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, but its expression levels have been associated with significant clinical outcomes in several diseases. Notably, alterations in the expression of C12orf56 have been linked to cancer prognosis, particularly in colon and lung cancers, as well as potential associations with neurological conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and depression (He2024Identification; Power2012Dissecting; Li2021Genomewide; Liu2023Heterogeneous).

## Clinical Significance
C12orf56 has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels and potential genetic associations. In colon cancer, C12orf56 is expressed at higher levels in normal tissues compared to tumor samples, suggesting its downregulation may be associated with tumor progression. It is part of a prognostic model developed to predict survival in colon cancer patients, highlighting its potential role in cancer prognosis (He2024Identification).

In lung squamous cell carcinoma, low expression of C12orf56, along with other genes, is linked to poor prognosis in patients with TTN mutations. This suggests that C12orf56 may serve as a prognostic factor in lung cancer, particularly in the context of specific genetic mutations (Liu2023Heterogeneous).

C12orf56 has also been identified as a novel risk gene for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although its specific clinical significance in ALS remains unclear (Li2021Genomewide).

In the context of depression, the gene has shown suggestive evidence of association with young-onset depression, particularly in individuals with an age at onset below 30 years. However, this association appears to diminish with larger sample sizes, indicating a potential age-specific effect (Power2012Dissecting).
