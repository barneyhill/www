# ANKRD49

## Overview
ANKRD49 (ankyrin repeat domain 49) is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. The protein encoded by ANKRD49 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of apoptosis and cell survival, particularly in the context of spermatogenesis. It plays a crucial role in modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby influencing mitochondrial integrity and promoting cell survival in male germ cells (Zhou2019ANKRD49). Additionally, ANKRD49 is implicated in cancer progression, notably in gliomas and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it contributes to tumor metastasis through interactions that regulate matrix metalloproteinase expression (Sun2023ANKRD49; Sun2023ANKRD49a). The protein's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in oncology (Hao2017Upregulation; Sun2023ANKRD49).

## Structure


## Function
ANKRD49 (ankyrin repeat domain 49) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of spermatogenesis. The protein is primarily located in the nuclei of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and round spermatids, where it plays a significant role in modulating apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death essential for maintaining the balance of germ cells during sperm development (Zhou2019ANKRD49).

ANKRD49 functions as a cell survival modulator by influencing the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating apoptosis in male germ cells. Overexpression of ANKRD49 in GC-1 cells, a model for male germ cells, leads to decreased apoptosis by reducing levels of cleaved PARP and caspase 3, while increasing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. This suggests that ANKRD49 promotes cell survival through a mitochondrion-dependent pathway, as indicated by its effects on mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase 3 activity (Zhou2019ANKRD49).

The protein's role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and preventing the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential further underscores its protective function in germ cells. These activities are vital for ensuring genetic fidelity and fertility by maintaining a balanced ratio of germ cells to Sertoli cells (Zhou2019ANKRD49).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD49 has been implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers, particularly gliomas and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In gliomas, ANKRD49 is identified as an oncogenic protein and a poor prognostic factor. Its expression is significantly higher in glioma tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with higher disease grade and poorer overall survival. Knockdown of ANKRD49 in glioma cell lines results in impaired cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, particularly affecting the transition to the M phase. This suggests that ANKRD49 plays a crucial role in glioma progression and could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Hao2017Upregulation).

In NSCLC, ANKRD49 is associated with poor prognosis and is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous carcinoma. It promotes metastasis by activating the JNK-ATF2/c-Jun-MMP-2/9 signaling pathway, which enhances the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, facilitating cancer cell invasion and migration. Overexpression of ANKRD49 in NSCLC cell lines leads to increased lung metastasis, while its knockdown reduces metastasis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in NSCLC (Sun2023ANKRD49; Sun2023ANKRD49a).

## Interactions
ANKRD49, a protein encoded by the ANKRD49 gene, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It contains four ankyrin repeat motifs, which facilitate these interactions (Sun2023ANKRD49). In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ANKRD49 enhances the interaction between phosphorylated ATF2 (p-ATF2) and phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun) in the nucleus. This interaction forms a heterodimer that regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, crucial for cell migration and invasion (Sun2023ANKRD49; Sun2023ANKRD49a).

ANKRD49 has also been shown to interact with integrases from the Moloney murine leukemia virus. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that ANKRD49 interacts with both mouse and human integrases, suggesting a direct interaction not mediated by nucleic acids (Studamire2008Host). These interactions highlight ANKRD49's role in facilitating complex formation and signal transduction pathways, contributing to its involvement in cancer metastasis and other cellular functions.
