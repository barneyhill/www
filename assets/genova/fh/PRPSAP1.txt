# PRPSAP1

## Overview
PRPSAP1, or phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in nucleotide biosynthesis. The protein encoded by PRPSAP1 is a crucial component of the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS) enzyme complex, which is essential for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. As a regulatory protein, PRPSAP1 influences the assembly and activity of the PRPS complex, thereby playing a significant role in cellular metabolism and proliferation by modulating nucleotide availability (Karki2024Evolutionary; Minchenko2014Expression). It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other components of the PRPS complex, such as PRPS1 and PRPS2, to regulate their enzymatic activity (Ugbogu2022Contribution). Through these interactions, PRPSAP1 acts as a negative regulator, ensuring the proper balance of nucleotide synthesis necessary for DNA and RNA production (Srivastava2021NOTCH1driven).

## Function
PRPSAP1 (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase associated protein 1) plays a crucial role in the regulation and assembly of the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS) enzyme complex, which is essential for nucleotide biosynthesis. In healthy human cells, PRPSAP1 is involved in the formation of higher molecular weight PRPS complexes, which are important for maintaining cellular metabolism and nucleotide synthesis (Karki2024Evolutionary). It acts as a structural component that influences the assembly and regulation of the PRPS complex, affecting the kinetics of catalytic loop opening in PRPS1 and PRPS2, thereby adapting to the cell's metabolic needs (Karki2024Evolutionary).

PRPSAP1 is also implicated in the modulation of the PRPS complex's architecture, contributing to metabolic adaptation by tailoring enzymatic profiles according to tissue-specific demands (Karki2024Evolutionary). It is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular proliferation and metabolism by controlling nucleotide availability, which is essential for DNA and RNA synthesis (Minchenko2014Expression). The protein's regulatory role is further highlighted by its involvement in the proteasomal degradation pathway, where it is targeted by UBR7 to stabilize PRPS enzymes, ensuring proper nucleotide synthesis (Srivastava2021NOTCH1driven).

## Interactions
PRPSAP1, or phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase associated protein 1, is known to interact with PRPS1 and PRPS2, forming complexes that regulate the activity of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase. These interactions are crucial for modulating the enzyme's activity, which in turn influences the synthesis pathways of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides (Ugbogu2022Contribution). PRPSAP1 acts as a negative regulator of PRPS enzymatic activity, as evidenced by increased levels of PRPS1 upon PRPSAP1 knockdown, indicating its inhibitory role (Srivastava2021NOTCH1driven).

The interaction between PRPSAP1 and PRPS1 has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation assays, which show strong interactions between FLAG-tagged PRPS1 and endogenous PRPSAP1 (Srivastava2021NOTCH1driven). PRPSAP1, along with PRPSAP2, shares high amino acid sequence similarity and physically interacts with hPRPS1, although they do not contain an ATP-catalytic binding site and are not directly involved in the phosphoribosyl transferase reaction (Ugbogu2022Contribution). These interactions suggest that PRPSAP1 plays a significant role in the regulation of nucleotide biosynthesis by modulating the activity of PRPS enzymes.
