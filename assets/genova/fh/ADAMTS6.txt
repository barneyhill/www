# ADAMTS6

## Overview
ADAMTS6 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 6, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family of proteases. This protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and thrombospondin type 1 motifs, among other features (Kelwick2015The; PORTER2005The). ADAMTS6 is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix components and plays a crucial role in modulating cell-cell junctions and focal adhesions by interacting with microfibrillar molecules and cleaving proteins such as LTBP-1 and syndecan-4 (Cain2016ADAMTS10). The protein's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, which influence its function and interactions (Karoulias2020The). Clinically, mutations in the ADAMTS6 gene have been linked to cardiac and connective tissue disorders, as well as various cancers, highlighting its significance in both developmental and pathological processes (Prins2018Exomechip; Liang2020Prognostic).

## Structure
The ADAMTS6 protein is part of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a modular structure that includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, thrombospondin type 1 (TSP-1) motifs, and a spacer region (Kelwick2015The; PORTER2005The). The metalloproteinase domain contains a zinc-binding motif, HEXXHXXG/N/SXXHD, and a methionine residue within the sequence V/IMA/S, known as the 'Met-turn' (PORTER2005The). The catalytic domain adopts a metzincin architecture with a globular structure, featuring a five-stranded β-sheet and α-helices forming a hydrophobic pillow under the Zn2+ (Kelwick2015The).

ADAMTS6 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two main transcript variants. Variant 2 has an extended C-terminus with four potential TSP-1 repeats and a PLAC domain, making it highly homologous to the C-terminus of ADAMTS10 (Bevitt2005Analysis). This variant is more abundant in ARPE-19 cells and is modulated by TNFa (Bevitt2005Analysis). Post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation, C-mannosylation, and O-fucosylation are common in ADAMTS proteins, affecting their secretion and function (Kelwick2015The). The presence of a PLAC module with conserved cysteine residues is noted in several ADAMTS proteins, including ADAMTS6 (Kelwick2015The).

## Function
ADAMTS6 is a member of the ADAMTS family of proteases, which are involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix components. In healthy human cells, ADAMTS6 plays a role in modulating cell-cell junctions and focal adhesions. It disrupts these structures by depleting cell surface heparan sulfate, which is crucial for focal adhesion formation (Cain2016ADAMTS10). ADAMTS6 binds strongly to microfibrillar molecules and can cleave proteins such as LTBP-1 and syndecan-4, impacting microfibril integrity and cell surface interactions (Cain2016ADAMTS10; Karoulias2020The).

The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the heart and breast myoepithelial cells, and is associated with cytokines like TNFα (Kelwick2015The). ADAMTS6's enzymatic activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications, such as furin processing and glycosylation, which influence its function and interactions (Karoulias2020The). The protein's activity in disrupting focal adhesions and cell junctions suggests a role in tissue remodeling and development, potentially affecting processes like angiogenesis and wound healing (Kelwick2015The; Cain2016ADAMTS10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADAMTS6 gene have been linked to several cardiac and connective tissue disorders. In the context of cardiac health, ADAMTS6 is associated with cardiac development and myocardial connectivity. Mutations in this gene can lead to congenital heart defects such as double outlet right ventricle, atrioventricular septal defect, and ventricular hypertrophy (Prins2018Exomechip). The gene is crucial for the expression of the gap junction protein Cx43, which is essential for ventricular conduction. A reduction in Cx43 due to ADAMTS6 mutations is linked to QRS prolongation, indicating impaired myocardial connectivity (Prins2018Exomechip).

In addition to cardiac implications, ADAMTS6 is involved in regulating cell-cell junctions and focal adhesions. It disrupts these structures, potentially through its metalloprotease activity, which may affect microfibril integrity and cellular adhesion processes (Cain2016ADAMTS10). Alterations in ADAMTS6 expression have also been observed in various cancers. For instance, high expression levels of ADAMTS6 are associated with favorable survival outcomes in gastric cancer, while its expression trends differ in other cancers like esophageal and colon cancer (Liang2020Prognostic). These findings suggest that ADAMTS6 plays a significant role in both cardiac and cancer-related pathologies.

## Interactions
ADAMTS6 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in the structural organization of the extracellular matrix and cell adhesion processes. It binds strongly to fibrillin-1, specifically to the N-terminal fragments PF3 and PF4, with the binding site mapped to domains encoded by exons 6-8 of FBN1 (Cain2016ADAMTS10). This interaction suggests a role in microfibril integrity and organization. ADAMTS6 also binds to the C-terminal region of latent transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 1 (LTBP-1), with a dissociation constant (K D) of 59 ± 3.4 nM, indicating a strong affinity (Cain2016ADAMTS10). This binding is associated with the regulation of latent TGFβ signaling.

ADAMTS6 is involved in the cleavage of syndecan-4, affecting focal adhesions and cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) (Cain2016ADAMTS10). It interacts with fibronectin and the ectodomain of syndecan-4, with binding constants of 9.8 ± 3.8 nM and 12.9 ± 4.0 nM, respectively (Cain2016ADAMTS10). These interactions suggest that ADAMTS6 may function as a receptor sheddase, influencing cell-matrix interactions and microfibril organization. ADAMTS6 does not have reported interactions with nucleic acids in the provided context.
