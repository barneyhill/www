# ASIC3

## Overview
The ASIC3 gene encodes the acid sensing ion channel subunit 3, a protein that functions as a proton-gated ion channel within the epithelial sodium channel/degenerin (ENaC/DEG) family. This transmembrane protein is primarily expressed in peripheral sensory neurons and is highly sensitive to changes in extracellular pH, playing a crucial role in sensory perception, including nociception, mechanosensation, and chemosensation (Li2010ASIC3). ASIC3 channels are activated by acidic conditions, leading to sodium ion influx and contributing to neuronal excitability and signal transduction (Li2010ASIC3). The protein's structure includes two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular domain, forming homomeric or heteromeric trimers (Salinas2009Structural; Benarroch2014Acidsensing). ASIC3 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, such as pain perception during inflammation and ischemia, and is associated with clinical conditions like insulin resistance and sensory abnormalities (Yagi2006Sustained; Wu2010Association). Its interactions with other proteins, such as PSD-95 and stomatin-domain proteins, modulate its function and localization, underscoring its significance in sensory pathways (Eshcol2008Acidsensing; Moshourab2013Stomatin‐domain).

## Structure
ASIC3 is a protein that functions as a proton-gated cation channel, primarily permeable to Na+. It is part of the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) family, which includes several isoforms encoded by four different genes (Salinas2009Structural; Benarroch2014Acidsensing). The primary structure of ASIC3 consists of amino acid sequences forming two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2), short intracellular N- and C-termini, and a large extracellular domain (Salinas2009Structural; Benarroch2014Acidsensing).

The secondary structure includes α-helices and β-sheets, with the extracellular domain containing seven α-helices and 12 β-sheets distributed across various regions, such as the knuckle, finger, β-ball, palm, and thumb (Sherwood2012Structure). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional ion channel, with the extracellular domain resembling a 'clenched hand' (Salinas2009Structural).

ASIC3 forms trimers, which can be homomeric or heteromeric, contributing to its quaternary structure (Benarroch2014Acidsensing). The protein has three functional splice variants (a, b, and c) in humans, which are not present in rodents (CristoforiArmstrong2017Acidsensing). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are crucial for proper trafficking and proton sensitivity (Sherwood2012Structure).

## Function
ASIC3 (acid sensing ion channel subunit 3) is a proton-gated ion channel that plays a significant role in sensory perception, particularly in response to changes in extracellular pH. It is part of the epithelial sodium channel/degenerin (ENaC/DEG) family and is primarily expressed in peripheral sensory neurons. ASIC3 channels are highly sensitive to protons and are activated by a reduction in extracellular pH, which is common during various sensory stimuli. This activation leads to the influx of sodium ions, contributing to neuronal excitability and signal transduction (Li2010ASIC3).

ASIC3 is involved in multiple sensory modalities, including nociception, mechanosensation, and chemosensation. It is expressed in various tissues, such as lung epithelial cells, esophagus, carotid body glomus cells, and intervertebral disk cells, indicating its widespread role in sensory perception and tissue excitability (Li2010ASIC3). In sensory neurons, ASIC3 contributes to pain perception, particularly in response to acidic conditions associated with inflammation (Li2010ASIC3).

ASIC3 also plays a role in mechanosensation, as it is expressed in mechanoreceptors and is implicated in touch perception. Mice lacking ASIC3 show increased sensitivity to light touch, suggesting its involvement in mechanosensory complexes (Li2010ASIC3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ASIC3 gene are associated with various clinical conditions. The rs2288646 polymorphism in the ASIC3 gene is linked to insulin resistance in humans. Individuals carrying the rs2288646-A allele exhibit lower fasting serum insulin levels and improved insulin sensitivity, suggesting a potential role in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (Wu2010Association). ASIC3 is also implicated in sensory abnormalities, including pain perception. It is involved in detecting ischemic pain, particularly in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and is sensitive to lactic acid, which is relevant during myocardial ischemia (Yagi2006Sustained). ASIC3 expression is increased during inflammation and is modulated by proinflammatory mediators, playing a role in conditions like Crohn's disease and bladder pain syndrome (Wu2012Targeting). In Asic3 knockout mice, the absence of ASIC3 leads to enhanced insulin sensitivity and protection against glucose intolerance, indicating its involvement in glucose metabolism (Wu2012Targeting). Additionally, ASIC3 is associated with balance impairment in individuals with mild traumatic brain injury, with certain genetic variants linked to worse balance outcomes (Lee2019Association). These findings highlight ASIC3's potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic and sensory disorders.

## Interactions
ASIC3 interacts with several proteins that modulate its function and localization. One significant interaction is with the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95. This interaction occurs through the COOH terminus of ASIC3, which binds to the PDZ domain of PSD-95. The binding of PSD-95 to ASIC3 results in a decrease in ASIC3 cell surface expression and H+-gated current. This interaction is dependent on the localization of both proteins to lipid rafts, membrane microdomains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Disruption of these lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion abolishes the inhibitory effect of PSD-95 on ASIC3 (Eshcol2008Acidsensing).

ASIC3 also interacts with other PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as Lin-7b, which increases ASIC3 H+-gated current, contrasting with the inhibitory effect of PSD-95 (Eshcol2008Acidsensing). Additionally, ASIC3 is modulated by stomatin-domain proteins, which influence its role in mechanosensitivity. The absence of ASIC3 leads to enhanced mechanosensitivity in certain mechanoreceptors, highlighting its role in sensory neuron function (Moshourab2013Stomatin‐domain). These interactions underscore ASIC3's involvement in pain pathways and mechanosensation, with its modulation being crucial for its physiological roles.
