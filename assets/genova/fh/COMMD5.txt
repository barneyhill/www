# COMMD5

## Overview
COMMD5 is a gene that encodes the protein COMM domain containing 5, a member of the COMMD protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of a conserved C-terminal COMM domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions and dimerization (Burstein2005COMMD). The COMMD5 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the organization and function of the cytoskeleton, endosomal transport, and receptor trafficking, particularly the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Campion2018COMMD5HCaRG). It plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in kidney repair and cancer biology, where it exhibits dual roles as a tumor suppressor and oncogene depending on the context (Campion2021Does; Matsuda2014Hypertensionrelated). The protein's ability to form stable complexes with other COMMD family members, such as COMMD10, underscores its functional versatility and importance in cellular processes (Healy2018Structural).

## Structure
COMMD5 is a member of the COMMD protein family, characterized by the presence of a conserved C-terminal COMM domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and dimerization (Burstein2005COMMD). The COMM domain is leucine-rich and predicted to form a β-sheet structure, facilitating the formation of both homo- and heterodimeric complexes (Healy2018Structural; Burstein2005COMMD). COMMD5 has been shown to form a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with COMMD10, likely assembling into a heterotetramer, as indicated by size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) analyses (Healy2018Structural).

The structural analysis of related COMMD proteins, such as COMMD9, suggests that COMMD5 may share similar structural features, including a dimeric module formed by intertwined cone-shaped chains with an N-terminal three-stranded beta-sheet capped by an alpha-helix (Healy2018Structural). The N-terminal region of COMMD proteins is variable but likely maintains an alpha-helical topology (Healy2018Structural). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of COMMD5 are not fully elucidated, the conserved nature of the COMM domain across the family suggests a similar structural framework (Burstein2005COMMD).

## Function
The COMMD5 gene, also known as HCaRG, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is ubiquitously expressed in adult epithelial tissues and is involved in the establishment and maintenance of the epithelial cell phenotype (Campion2018COMMD5HCaRG). COMMD5 is associated with the cytoskeleton, where it binds to actin and tubulin, facilitating the organization and function of the cytoskeleton (Campion2018COMMD5HCaRG). This protein acts as a hook linking endosomes to the cytoskeleton, specifically binding to actin and tubulin, and regulates the transport of membrane receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Campion2018COMMD5HCaRG).

COMMD5 is involved in the endosomal transport and recycling of EGFR, playing a significant role in EGFR trafficking and activity. It interacts with the endosomal protein Rab5, which is crucial for the transport of endosomes containing EGFR (Campion2018COMMD5HCaRG). The protein is also implicated in kidney repair, as it accelerates the recovery of renal proximal tubules after acute injury (Matsuda2014Hypertensionrelated). COMMD5's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient intracellular transport (Campion2018COMMD5HCaRG).

## Clinical Significance
COMMD5 has been implicated in various cancers due to its dual role as a tumor suppressor and oncogene, influenced by its genetic alterations and chromosomal position. In renal, lung, and gastric cancers, COMMD5 expression is downregulated, suggesting a tumor suppressor function. Low expression levels in renal cancer are associated with poor prognosis and worse clinical outcomes (Campion2021Does). Conversely, COMMD5 amplification is linked to tumor progression in cancers such as lymphoma, leukemia, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and oral squamous cell carcinoma (Campion2021Does).

In HCC, high COMMD5 expression correlates with poor overall survival, particularly in patients with advanced tumor grades, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Wang2021Transcriptional). Genetic mutations in COMMD5, especially those outside the conserved COMM domain, may disrupt its function, leading to malignant cell conversion (Campion2021Does). The gene's subtelomeric position on chromosome 8q24 may influence its expression through telomere position effects, affecting cancer progression and cellular senescence (Campion2021Does). These findings highlight the complex role of COMMD5 in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
COMMD5, a member of the COMMD protein family, is known for its ability to form both homo- and heterodimeric complexes through its C-terminal COMM domain. This domain is crucial for mediating interactions with other COMMD proteins. Notably, COMMD5 preferentially binds to COMMD10, forming a stable heteromeric complex. This interaction has been confirmed through GST pulldown experiments and size exclusion chromatography, which demonstrated a 1:1 stoichiometric complex of COMMD5 and COMMD10. The complex is monodisperse in solution and likely forms a heterotetramer, suggesting that the COMM domains of COMMD5 and COMMD10 may form either homodimers that assemble into a tetramer or heterodimers that create a heterotetramer (Healy2018Structural).

The interaction between COMMD5 and COMMD10 was further validated by co-transforming GST-tagged COMMD5 or its COMM domain with His-tagged COMMD10 or its COMM domain into Escherichia coli, followed by purification using glutathione sepharose beads and size exclusion chromatography (Healy2018Structural). These findings highlight the role of COMMD5 in forming stable protein complexes, although there is no specific mention of interactions with nucleic acids in the provided context.
