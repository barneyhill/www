# IFNL3

## Overview
The IFNL3 gene encodes the protein interferon lambda 3, a member of the type III interferon family, which plays a crucial role in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. As a cytokine, interferon lambda 3 is involved in modulating immune responses by activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway upon binding to its receptor complex, which includes IFNLR1 and IL10R2. This activation leads to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are essential for antiviral activity (Hemann2017Interferon; Santer2020Differential). The IFNL3 gene is of significant clinical interest due to its association with genetic polymorphisms that influence the response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and the efficacy of interferon-based therapies (Chinnaswamy2014Genetic). The protein's structure, characterized by alpha-helical formations, is critical for its function and interaction with receptors, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for managing viral infections (Egli2014The; Walter2020The).

## Structure
The IFNL3 protein, also known as interferon lambda 3, is a member of the type III interferon family and exhibits a molecular structure characterized by alpha-helical formations with a unique topology. The protein forms a compact bundle of shorter helices with kinks, similar to the IL-10 family cytokine IL-22 (Walter2020The). IFNL3 interacts with its receptors, IFNLR1 and IL10R2, to form a 1:1:1 signaling complex. The binding involves loops at the junction of the IFNLR1 domains and a separate site for IL10R2, with the complete receptor complex being formed cooperatively (Walter2020The).

The structural integrity of IFNL3 is crucial for its antiviral potency. A notable feature is the 'proline flip' in the B loop region, where Pro-77 moves towards helix F, affecting the position of Arg-180. This movement is essential for forming a bivalent salt bridge with Asp-91 on IFNLR1, which is critical for antiviral activity (Walter2020The). The protein's structure is further stabilized by van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions, particularly in its interaction with the IL-28RA receptor (Egli2014The). The IFNL3 protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may influence its function and stability.

## Function
Interferon lambda 3 (IFNL3) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. It functions by binding to the interferon lambda receptor 1 (IFN-λR1), which is expressed on various immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and epithelial cells. This binding activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are crucial for antiviral responses (Hemann2017Interferon; Santer2020Differential).

In CD4+ T cells, IFNL3 enhances the expression of IFN-λR1 upon T cell receptor stimulation, which increases the cells' responsiveness to IFNL3 and promotes an antiviral state, inhibiting infections such as HIV-1 (Santer2020Differential). IFNL3 also modulates immune responses by influencing the balance of T-helper cells, promoting a shift towards Th1 responses, which are essential for controlling viral infections (Syedbasha2017Interferon).

The activity of IFNL3 is particularly prominent in epithelial cells, where it induces a robust ISG response, contributing to the innate immune defense against viral pathogens at mucosal surfaces (Santer2020Differential). This cytokine's ability to induce a less inflammatory response compared to type I interferons makes it a potential therapeutic agent for managing viral infections (Hemann2017Interferon).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the IFNL3 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs12979860 and rs8099917 are associated with the response to interferon-based therapies and the spontaneous clearance of HCV. The rs12979860 C allele is linked to a sustained virological response (SVR) and is considered protective, especially in European American populations (Chinnaswamy2014Genetic). Similarly, the rs8099917 SNP is associated with virological responses in Japanese and Australian cohorts (Chinnaswamy2014Genetic).

The SNP rs4803217 is another variant of interest, where the C allele is associated with better clinical outcomes in HCV infection. This SNP is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs12979860, suggesting that allele-specific expression differences may be context-dependent and influenced by other SNPs in the IFNL3 region (Knapp2014Detection). The presence of the G allele in rs4803217 is linked to HCV clearance, while the T allele correlates with HCV persistence, potentially due to the regulation of microRNAs that target the 3' untranslated region of IFNL3 (Hemann2017Interferon).

These genetic variations in IFNL3 influence the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and the immune response, affecting the progression and treatment outcomes of HCV infections (Egli2014The). The IFNL3 genotype also impacts immune cell populations, with responder genotypes showing altered immune cell trafficking and higher ISG expression, which may enhance viral clearance (O’Connor2016IFNL34).

## Interactions
IFNL3, also known as interferon lambda 3, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to modulate immune responses. It primarily engages with the IFN-λ receptor complex, which includes IL10RB and IFNLR1, to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the expression of antiviral and immunomodulatory genes (Santer2020Differential). 

The IFNL3 promoter is regulated by interactions with transcription factors such as NF-κB p65 and IRF7. These factors form a complex that enhances IRF7's binding to the IFNL3 promoter, increasing transcriptional activity. This interaction is stronger than that between IRF3 and p65, indicating a specific regulatory mechanism for IFNL3 expression (Roy2021Functional). 

Mutational analysis has shown that specific binding sites on the IFNL3 promoter are crucial for these interactions. The NF-κBb site is essential for p65 binding, while the IRFb site is critical for IRF7-mediated transcription. Changes in DNA helix phasing can affect these interactions, with IRF7 being more sensitive to such changes than p65 (Roy2021Functional). 

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network governing IFNL3 expression and its role in the immune response.
