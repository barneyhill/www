# ARL6IP6

## Overview
ARL6IP6 is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 6 interacting protein 6, which plays a significant role in cellular processes related to membrane trafficking and protein transport. This protein is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it interacts with GTPases to facilitate intracellular signaling and vesicle movement. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring the correct processing and transport of proteins within the cell. The ARL6IP6 gene has been associated with various pathological conditions, including ischemic stroke and syndromic cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, indicating its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Abumansour2015ARL6IP6).

## Function
ARL6IP6 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 6 interacting protein 6) is involved in cellular processes related to membrane trafficking and protein transport. It interacts with GTPases, which are crucial for intracellular signaling and vesicle movement. ARL6IP6 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to protein sorting and cellular homeostasis. These activities are essential for maintaining the proper function and organization of cellular components, ensuring that proteins are correctly processed and transported to their intended destinations within the cell. The involvement of ARL6IP6 in these processes highlights its role in maintaining cellular integrity and function, which is critical for overall organismal health. Despite its importance in these cellular processes, specific details about the molecular mechanisms by which ARL6IP6 operates in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated. The gene has also been implicated in certain pathological conditions, such as ischemic stroke and syndromic cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, suggesting that disruptions in its normal function can lead to significant clinical manifestations (Abumansour2015ARL6IP6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARL6IP6 gene have been implicated in a syndromic form of Cutis Marmorata Telangiectatica Congenita (CMTC), a congenital vascular anomaly. This condition is characterized by major dysmorphism, developmental delay, transient ischemic attacks, and cerebral vascular malformations. A study identified a homozygous truncating mutation in ARL6IP6 as the likely cause of this syndromic form of CMTC in a consanguineous Saudi family, suggesting that ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attacks may represent a milder end of a phenotypic spectrum that includes autosomal recessive CMTC at its severe end (Abumansour2015ARL6IP6).

In a reported case, a four-year-old boy with a mutation in ARL6IP6 presented with various congenital and developmental abnormalities, including brachy-plagiocephaly, livedo reticularis, bilateral congenital glaucoma, hypospadias, and a patent foramen ovale. Neurologically, he experienced abnormal movements, focal seizures, and transient ischemic attacks, with brain imaging showing generalized atrophy and vascular changes. Dermatologically, he was diagnosed with CMTC and had skin lesions suggestive of psoriasiform spongiotic dermatitis. He also had congenital hypothyroidism (Abumansour2015ARL6IP6). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of ARL6IP6 mutations in syndromic presentations involving neurological, dermatological, and systemic manifestations.
