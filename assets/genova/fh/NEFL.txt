# NEFL

## Overview
The NEFL gene encodes the neurofilament light chain (NFL), a key structural protein within the neuronal cytoskeleton. NFL is categorized as an intermediate filament protein, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of neurons. It is predominantly expressed in mature neurons of both the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it forms part of the neurofilament complex alongside neurofilament medium (NEFM) and neurofilament heavy (NEFH) subunits. These complexes are essential for maintaining axonal caliber and facilitating axonal transport, which are vital for proper nerve cell function and communication (Gentil2013Heterogeneity; Dubois2005Micea). Mutations in the NEFL gene are linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Jordanova2003Mutations; Stone2021A).

## Structure
The NEFL gene encodes the neurofilament light chain (NFL) protein, a crucial component of the neuronal cytoskeleton. The primary structure of NFL consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure of NFL is predominantly α-helical, with the rod domain exhibiting about 80% α-helical content (Nefedova2024Neurofilament). This rod domain is composed of three coiled-coil segments: coil 1A, coil 1B, and coil 2, separated by linker regions (Nefedova2024Neurofilament).

The tertiary structure of NFL involves the folding of these coiled-coil domains into a stable configuration, which is essential for its function in forming intermediate filaments. The quaternary structure of NFL involves its assembly into dimers and tetramers, depending on conditions such as ionic strength and protein concentration (Nefedova2024Neurofilament). These assemblies contribute to the formation of the extensive fibrous network in the cytoplasm of neurons, which is crucial for axonal stability and function (Jordanova2003Mutations).

NFL undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its assembly and function. Mutations in the NEFL gene can lead to neurodegenerative disorders like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, often resulting in protein aggregation and abnormalities in NFL self-assembly (Nefedova2024Neurofilament).

## Function
The NEFL gene encodes the neurofilament light chain (NFL), a critical component of the neuronal cytoskeleton. In healthy human cells, NEFL is primarily expressed in mature neurons within both the central and peripheral nervous systems. It plays a vital role in maintaining neuronal shape and integrity by forming intermediate filaments, which are essential for the structural stability and function of neurons (Gentil2013Heterogeneity).

Neurofilaments, including the light chain encoded by NEFL, are composed of three subunits: NEFL, NEFM (medium), and NEFH (high molecular weight). These subunits assemble into 10 nm filaments that are crucial for maintaining axonal caliber and supporting axonal transport, which is vital for nerve cell function and communication (Dubois2005Micea). The NEFL subunit contains a conserved central α-helical 'rod' domain that forms coiled-coil dimers, which then associate to form tetramers and assemble into filaments. These filaments are insoluble in non-ionic detergents, highlighting their structural robustness (Gentil2013Heterogeneity).

In the absence of NEFL, neurofilament assembly is disrupted, leading to reduced axonal caliber and impaired neuronal function, as observed in various neurodegenerative conditions (Dubois2005Mice). This underscores the importance of NEFL in maintaining the structural integrity and proper function of neurons.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NEFL gene, which encodes the neurofilament light chain, are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, a hereditary neuropathy affecting motor and sensory nerves. NEFL mutations can lead to both axonal (CMT2E) and demyelinating (CMT1F) forms of the disease. These mutations include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and deletion mutations, with missense mutations being the most common (Abe2009Neurofilament; Stone2021A). Missense mutations in NEFL disrupt neurofilament assembly, while nonsense mutations result in a lack of neurofilaments due to the absence of NEFL protein (Stone2021A). 

Clinical features of patients with NEFL mutations include early onset of gait problems, distal muscle weakness, sensory loss, and pes cavus deformity. Electrophysiological studies often show reduced motor nerve conduction velocities and chronic neurogenic alterations (Jordanova2003Mutations). The inheritance pattern is typically autosomal dominant for in-frame deletion and missense mutations, and autosomal recessive for nonsense mutations (Stone2021A). 

NEFL mutations can also lead to a wide range of clinical phenotypes, including weakness of the lower extremities, foot deformities, and deafness, with varying presentations even within the same family (Züchner2004The). The genetic heterogeneity of NEFL mutations contributes to the clinical variability observed in CMT (Jordanova2003Mutations).

## Interactions
The NEFL gene encodes the neurofilament light (NF-L) protein, which is a crucial component of the neurofilament network in neurons. NF-L interacts with other neurofilament proteins, such as neurofilament medium (NF-M) and neurofilament heavy (NF-H), to form obligate heteropolymers essential for the structural integrity of neurofilaments in vivo (Lee1993Neurofilaments). NF-L alone cannot form a filament network and requires co-expression with NF-M or NF-H for proper assembly (Lee1993Neurofilaments).

In the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, certain NEFL mutations affect the protein's ability to form homopolymers, but these mutants can still participate in heteropolymer formation with NF-M, indicating a retained ability to co-assemble into functional filaments under specific conditions (Stone2019Charcot–Marie–Tooth). NF-L also interacts with proteins involved in axonal transport, such as stathmin and Stat3. This interaction modulates microtubule dynamics, with NF-L depletion enhancing the interaction between Stat3 and stathmin, thereby stabilizing microtubules and preventing axonal degeneration (Yadav2016Neurofilament).

O-GlcNAcylation of NF-L is another critical factor influencing its interactions and assembly. This post-translational modification mediates interactions with proteins like INA and is disrupted by mutations associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, leading to altered assembly and aggregation of NF-L (Huynh2023OGlcNAcylation).
