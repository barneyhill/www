# UGP2

## Overview
The UGP2 gene encodes the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2, which is a crucial component of carbohydrate metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate and uridine triphosphate (UTP) into UDP-glucose, a key metabolite involved in glycogen synthesis, glycosylation of proteins and lipids, and galactose metabolism (Durrant2020Defects; Knop1970Uridine). As a member of the pyrophosphorylase family, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 is characterized by its octameric structure, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Führing2012Octamerization). The protein's function is vital for maintaining normal levels of nucleotide sugars, which are necessary for proper cellular functions, including energy storage and cell signaling (Durrant2020Defects). Mutations in the UGP2 gene have been linked to various diseases, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Perenthaler2019Loss; Wolfe2020UDPglucose).

## Structure
The human UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (UGP2) protein is a key enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism, catalyzing the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate and UTP to UDP-glucose. The primary structure of UGP2 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the UGP2 gene. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the catalytic domain featuring a mixed eight-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices, resembling a Rossmann fold (Yu2012The).

The tertiary structure of UGP2 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which includes three domains: an N-terminal domain, a catalytic domain, and a C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain is flexible and may be involved in regulatory functions, while the C-terminal domain contains a left-handed β-helix structure (Yu2012The). The quaternary structure of UGP2 is characterized by its octameric assembly, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This octameric form is stabilized by conserved residues in the C-terminal β-helix, facilitating end-to-end and side-by-side interactions between subunits (Führing2012Octamerization; Yu2012The).

UGP2 exists in two isoforms, hUGP1 and hUGP2, generated by alternative splicing, with no significant differences in their oligomerization and activity (Führing2012Octamerization). The protein's structure and function are crucial for understanding its role in nucleotide sugar metabolism and potential drug targeting (Führing2015A).

## Function
The UGP2 gene encodes UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) from glucose-1-phosphate (Glc1P) and uridine triphosphate (UTP) in the cytoplasm of healthy human cells (Durrant2020Defects; Führing2015A). UDP-Glc is a key metabolite involved in various biosynthetic pathways, including glycogen synthesis, glycosylation of proteins and lipids, and galactose metabolism (Durrant2020Defects; Knop1970Uridine).

In glycogen synthesis, UDP-Glc serves as a glucose donor for glycogen synthase, facilitating the storage of glucose as glycogen, which is crucial for energy storage and regulation (HIGUITA2003A). The enzyme also contributes to the biosynthesis of glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids, which are essential for cell signaling and structural integrity (Durrant2020Defects).

UGP2's activity is vital for maintaining normal levels of nucleotide sugars, which are necessary for proper cellular functions, including energy storage and cell signaling (Durrant2020Defects). The enzyme's function is also linked to the metabolism of galactose, as it can be epimerized to UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) by UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, further supporting glycosylation processes (Durrant2020Defects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the UGP2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs), UGP2 is essential for tumor growth and maintenance. It is regulated by the YAP/TEAD complex and is critical for the N-glycosylation of proteins such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which are important for cell proliferation. High expression of UGP2 in PDACs correlates with poor prognosis, and its knockdown leads to decreased tumor growth and reduced EGFR expression (Wolfe2020UDPglucose).

In the context of neurological disorders, a recurrent mutation in UGP2 has been identified in individuals with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). This mutation leads to a loss of function in the UGP2 gene, resulting in symptoms such as infantile spasms, severe developmental delay, and microcephaly. The mutation is predicted to cause a missense variant in UGP2 isoform 1 and a translation start loss in isoform 2, significantly impacting brain function (Perenthaler2019Loss).

UGP2 is also involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. It is a target gene of TP53, which inhibits endothelial cell apoptosis. Reduced expression of UGP2 is associated with increased atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaque development, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis (He2022UGP2).

## Interactions
UGP2 (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2) is involved in several protein-protein interactions, forming part of multiprotein complexes. In interactome profiling studies, UGP2 has been identified as a potential interaction partner of microsomal cytochrome b5 (CYB5A). It co-fractionates with CYB5A and other proteins such as EPHX1 in high-molecular-weight complexes, suggesting that UGP2 is part of these multiprotein assemblies (Mezentsev2022Protein). This interaction indicates that UGP2 may play a role in metabolic pathways involving CYB5A.

UGP2 is also known to form octameric structures essential for its enzymatic function. The octamerization of UGP2 is crucial for its activity, as demonstrated by studies showing that mutations affecting its oligomerization state can lead to loss of function. This structural organization is important for the enzyme's role in carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of UDP-glucose (Führing2012Octamerization).

These interactions and structural characteristics highlight UGP2's role in cellular processes such as glycosylation and energy storage, and its involvement in complex protein networks within the cell.
