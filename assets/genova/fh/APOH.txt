# APOH

## Overview
The APOH gene encodes apolipoprotein H, also known as β2-glycoprotein I, a plasma glycoprotein that plays a multifaceted role in lipid metabolism and coagulation. As a member of the complement control protein (CCP) superfamily, apolipoprotein H is characterized by its ability to bind anionic phospholipids, which is crucial for its involvement in lipid metabolism and the modulation of blood coagulation (Sanghera1997Identification; Mehdi2000A). The protein is predominantly expressed in the liver and is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 17 q23-qter (Sanghera1997Molecular). Apolipoprotein H is implicated in various physiological processes, including the activation of lipoprotein lipase and the inhibition of prothrombinase activity, which underscores its significance in maintaining lipid homeostasis and cardiovascular health (Gambino1999The; Lee1983beta). Additionally, APOH is involved in immune responses and has been linked to autoimmune disorders, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, due to its role in the production of antiphospholipid antibodies (Kamboh2004Single; Mehdi1999Genetic).

## Structure
Apolipoprotein H (APOH), also known as beta-2-glycoprotein I, is a plasma glycoprotein composed of 326 amino acids. It belongs to the complement control protein (CCP) superfamily and is characterized by five repeating units, each approximately 60 amino acids long, known as GP-I domains or Sushi domains (Steinkasserer1991Complete; Mehdi2000A). The protein's structure is rich in cysteine and proline, with frequent Cys-Pro linkages, and it primarily consists of beta sheets and random coils, with minimal alpha-helical content (Lozier1984Complete).

The fifth domain of APOH is particularly significant due to its role in binding anionic phospholipids. This domain contains a hydrophobic sequence at positions 313-316, crucial for binding to cardiolipin, and includes a cluster of positively charged amino acids and three disulfide bonds (Sanghera1997Identification; Mehdi2000A). Mutations in this region, such as Trp316Ser and Cys306Gly, disrupt the protein's ability to bind phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin (Sanghera1997Identification; Mehdi2000A).

APOH undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, with five glucosamine-containing oligosaccharide attachment sites (Lozier1984Complete). The protein is expressed primarily in the liver, and its gene is located on chromosome 17 q23-qter (Sanghera1997Molecular).

## Function
Apolipoprotein H (APOH), also known as β2-glycoprotein I, is a plasma glycoprotein involved in several molecular processes, primarily related to lipid metabolism and coagulation. APOH is known for its high affinity for triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles and plays a role in activating lipoprotein lipase, which is crucial for triglyceride metabolism and clearance (Gambino1999The; Lee1983beta). It is associated with various lipoprotein classes, including chylomicrons, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), although the majority of APOH is found in the lipoprotein-free plasma fraction (Gambino1999The).

APOH also exhibits anticoagulant properties by inhibiting prothrombinase activity on human platelets, suggesting a role in modulating blood coagulation (Gambino1999The). In addition, APOH has been implicated in the oxidative modification of LDL, where it inhibits LDL oxidation and reduces cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, potentially playing a protective role against atherosclerosis (Lin2001Evidence). These functions highlight APOH's involvement in maintaining lipid homeostasis and cardiovascular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the APOH gene, which encodes apolipoprotein H (β2-glycoprotein I), are associated with several clinical conditions, particularly those involving thrombosis and autoimmune disorders. The APOH gene is a significant factor in the production of antiphospholipid antibodies (APA), which are implicated in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). These antibodies target phospholipid-binding proteins, leading to an increased risk of thrombosis (Kamboh2004Single; Mehdi1999Genetic).

Specific polymorphisms in the APOH gene, such as the Trp316Ser and Cys306Gly mutations, affect the protein's ability to bind phospholipids, which is crucial for its role in coagulation and immune response. These mutations can lead to reduced binding to phosphatidylserine, impacting the production of APA and potentially offering protection against apoH-dependent thrombosis (Sanghera1997Identification).

Additionally, the APOH *3 B allele, which is identical to the chimpanzee's wild type, has been linked to a high prevalence of APA in certain populations, suggesting a genetic predisposition to autoimmune conditions (Kamboh2004Single). The presence of the -1CÔA mutation at the transcriptional initiation site is associated with reduced gene expression and lower plasma levels of β2-glycoprotein I, which may influence the occurrence of APA and related autoimmune conditions (Mehdi2003A).

## Interactions
Apolipoprotein H (APOH), also known as β2-glycoprotein I, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its physiological functions. APOH interacts with negatively charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine, through its fifth domain. This interaction is essential for its role in lipid metabolism and coagulation (Sanghera1997Identification). Structural mutations in this domain can disrupt its phospholipid binding ability, affecting its function in processes like coagulation and immune response (Sanghera1997Identification).

APOH also interacts with the Plasmodium berghei protein EXP-1 during the liver stage of Plasmodium development. This interaction occurs specifically with the C-terminal region of EXP-1 and is crucial for the parasite's intrahepatic development. The binding of APOH to EXP-1 facilitates the uptake of APOH into the parasite, potentially aiding in the transport of lipids or cholesterols necessary for the parasite's growth (Sá2017Plasmodium). Disruption of this interaction, either by truncating the C2 region of EXP-1 or down-regulating APOH expression, significantly impairs Plasmodium development in the liver (Sá2017Plasmodium).
