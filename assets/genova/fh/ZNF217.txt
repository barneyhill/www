# ZNF217

## Overview
ZNF217 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 217, a transcriptional regulator characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and transcriptional repression. The protein is categorized as a transcriptional repressor due to its ability to recruit histone-modifying complexes to specific genomic loci, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. ZNF217 is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation, through its interactions with nuclear proteins such as CtBP1, CtBP2, and LSD1. The gene is of particular interest in oncology, as its amplification and overexpression have been linked to the progression and poor prognosis of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, and brain cancers (Collins1998Positional; Quinlan2006Specific; Littlepage2012The).

## Structure
ZNF217 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of eight C2H2 Kruppel-like zinc finger motifs, which are involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Collins1998Positional). The protein also contains a proline-rich transcription activation domain, which suggests a role in transcriptional regulation (Collins1998Positional). The ZNF217 gene produces alternately spliced open reading frames (ORFs) of 3,186 and 3,324 base pairs, resulting in protein isoforms of 1,062 and 1,108 amino acids (Collins1998Positional).

ZNF217 interacts with C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs) through specific motifs, including the PXDLS and RRT motifs. These motifs are crucial for binding to CtBP2, with the PXDLS motif fitting the consensus sequence for CtBP binding and the RRT motif providing additional contact points (Quinlan2006Specific). The interaction with CtBP is significant for ZNF217's function as a transcriptional repressor (Quinlan2006Specific).

The protein's structure allows it to act as a transcriptional repressor, potentially by recruiting CtBP to silence specific genes, although ZNF217 itself has not been shown to directly bind DNA (Quinlan2006Specific). The exact molecular structure of ZNF217, including its tertiary and quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available context.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF217 is implicated in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, colon, bladder, and brain cancers, where its amplification is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression (Huang2005ZNF217). In breast cancer, ZNF217 overexpression is linked to decreased differentiation, increased mesenchymal marker expression, and reduced E-cadherin expression, promoting a mesenchymal/progenitor cell phenotype. This contributes to accelerated tumor formation, increased tumor volume, and metastasis, particularly to the lungs (Littlepage2012The). High ZNF217 expression is also associated with resistance to chemotherapy and reduced metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients (Littlepage2012The).

In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, high ZNF217 mRNA levels correlate with poor relapse-free survival and resistance to endocrine therapy, such as Tamoxifen (Nguyen2014A). ZNF217 enhances ERα ligand-dependent genomic activity, promoting ERα-dependent transcription of estrogen-regulated genes, which contributes to the aggressiveness of ER+ breast cancers (Nguyen2014A).

In B cell lymphomas, ZNF217 mutations lead to transcriptional deregulation and altered chromatin accessibility, affecting interferon signaling and contributing to drug resistance (Briest2023Frequent). These mutations are associated with aggressive lymphoma types and result in significant transcriptomic changes, including altered expression of genes related to immune signaling (Briest2023Frequent).

## Interactions
ZNF217 is known to participate in various protein-protein interactions, forming complexes that play significant roles in transcriptional regulation and chromatin modification. It interacts with several nuclear proteins, including Jarid1b/Plu-1, G9a, LSD1, CoREST, and CtBP1, which are involved in histone modification. These interactions suggest that ZNF217 functions as a transcriptional repressor by assembling histone-modifying proteins at specific DNA sites, contributing to activities such as H3K4me3 demethylation, H3K9 methylation, and H3K27 methylation (Banck2009The).

ZNF217 also interacts with CtBP2 through specific motifs, including a PXDLS motif and an RRT motif, which bind to different sites on CtBP2. These interactions are crucial for ZNF217's role in transcriptional repression, as mutations in these motifs reduce binding and repression activity (Quinlan2006Specific).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, ZNF217 interacts with LSD1, a histone demethylase, affecting the epigenetic regulation of genes such as CDH1 by altering histone methylation levels on their promoters (Si2019The). These interactions highlight ZNF217's role in modulating gene expression and its potential impact on cancer progression.
