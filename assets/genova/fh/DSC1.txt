# DSC1

## Overview
The DSC1 gene encodes the protein desmocollin 1, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is integral to the formation and function of desmosomes, which are specialized cell structures that facilitate strong cell-to-cell adhesion. Desmocollin 1 is primarily expressed in the epidermis, where it contributes to the mechanical stability and cohesion of keratinocytes in the spinous and granular layers. The protein is characterized by its extracellular cadherin repeats, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular anchor domain, which enable it to interact with other desmosomal components such as desmoplakin and plakoglobin. These interactions are essential for the assembly and maintenance of desmosomes, thereby playing a critical role in tissue integrity. Additionally, desmocollin 1 is involved in cholesterol metabolism through its interaction with apolipoprotein A-I, although it does not facilitate cholesterol efflux. Alterations in DSC1 expression or function are associated with skin disorders like pemphigus foliaceus and may have implications in cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Donetti2005Desmocollin; Celentano2016Desmosomes; Choi2017Desmocollin).

## Structure
Desmocollin 1 (DSC1) is a protein encoded by the DSC1 gene, characterized by its role in cell-cell adhesion within desmosomes. The molecular structure of DSC1 includes five extracellular cadherin repeats (EC1-5), a single-pass transmembrane domain, and an intracellular anchor (IA) domain (Choi2017Desmocollin). The primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming these domains. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of cadherin proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

DSC1 exists in two alternatively spliced forms, DSC1a and DSC1b, which differ in their carboxyl termini. The longer isoform, DSC1a, is necessary for recruiting desmoplakin and plakoglobin to assemble desmosomes, while DSC1b lacks this capability (Choi2017Desmocollin). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other desmosomal proteins, such as plakoglobin, which are crucial for its function in desmosome assembly (Myklebust2012Expression).

Post-translational modifications of DSC1 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are common in cadherin proteins, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. The extracellular domains are critical for its interaction with other proteins, such as apolipoprotein A-I, which impacts cholesterol metabolism (Choi2017Desmocollin).

## Function
Desmocollin 1 (DSC1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell-to-cell adhesion through the formation of desmosomes, which are specialized structures that provide mechanical strength to tissues by linking adjacent cells (Lapcik2023Desmocollin1). In healthy human cells, DSC1 is primarily active in the epidermis, where it is localized in the desmosomes of the more superficial spinous and granular layers, contributing to the structural integrity and adhesion of cells in these layers (Donetti2005Desmocollin). DSC1 is not detected in the stratum corneum, indicating its role is limited to the living layers of the epidermis (Donetti2005Desmocollin).

DSC1 is also involved in cholesterol metabolism, where it binds with apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a key player in cholesterol efflux and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) formation. However, DSC1's binding to apoA-I does not facilitate cholesterol efflux, suggesting that DSC1 may sequester plasma membrane cholesterol, acting as a negative regulator of the apoA-I-mediated cholesterol removal pathway (Choi2017Desmocollin). This interaction highlights DSC1's role in regulating cholesterol distribution in the plasma membrane, impacting the stability and function of proteins involved in cholesterol efflux (Choi2017Desmocollin).

## Clinical Significance
Desmocollin 1 (DSC1) is implicated in several diseases due to its role in cell adhesion within epithelial tissues. Mutations or altered expression of DSC1 can lead to skin disorders such as pemphigus foliaceus, an autoimmune disease characterized by superficial epidermal blisters. This condition arises from autoantibodies targeting desmosomal components, including DSC1, which disrupts keratinocyte adhesion and results in acantholysis (Celentano2016Desmosomes).

While the context does not provide specific details on DSC1 mutations in cancer, it suggests that desmosomal proteins, including DSC1, may play a role in cancer by affecting cell adhesion and signaling pathways. Desmosomal molecules are considered potential cancer markers and therapeutic targets, indicating that irregularities in DSC1 could contribute to tumorigenesis (Celentano2016Desmosomes).

In summary, DSC1 is clinically significant in the context of autoimmune skin diseases like pemphigus foliaceus and potentially in cancer, where its normal interactions and expression levels are crucial for maintaining epithelial integrity and function.

## Interactions
Desmocollin 1 (DSC1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and cancer progression. In breast cancer cells, DSC1 interacts with desmoglein 2 (DSG2), cadherins such as CDH1 and CDH3, and receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3 (HER3/ERBB3), which are important for desmosome formation and cell proliferation (Lapcik2023Desmocollin1). DSC1 also forms complexes with cadherin 17 (CDH17) and p120-catenin in colorectal cancer cells, influencing cell migration and invasion. This interaction is modulated by the cell phenotype, promoting migration in mesenchymal cells while inhibiting it in epithelial cells (Bartolomé2024A). The DSC1/CDH17 complex is associated with junction plakoglobin (JUP), contributing to the stability of circulating tumor cell clusters (Bartolomé2024A).

DSC1's interaction with CDH17 is mediated through their extracellular domains, and this association is confirmed by immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy (Bartolomé2024A). The presence of DSC1 in these complexes is linked to poor prognosis in aggressive colorectal cancer subtypes, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Bartolomé2024A).
