# NARS1

## Overview
The NARS1 gene encodes the enzyme asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase 1, a member of the cytoplasmic Class IIa family of tRNA synthetases. This enzyme is pivotal in protein synthesis, facilitating the attachment of asparagine to its corresponding tRNA, a critical step in translating genetic information into functional proteins (Wang2020Loss). The NARS1 protein is characterized by a 7 beta-strand structure and includes several domains, such as a unique N-terminal extension, an anticodon binding domain, and a catalytic domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and structural integrity (Vinogradova2021Associations; Manole2020De). NARS1 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with significant roles in brain development, where it supports the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (Wang2020Loss). Mutations in the NARS1 gene have been linked to neurological disorders, including microcephaly and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, underscoring its clinical significance (Wang2020Loss; Beijer2024Dominant).

## Structure
The NARS1 protein, or asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is a member of the cytoplasmic Class IIa family of tRNA synthetases. It is responsible for attaching asparagine to its corresponding tRNA, a crucial step in protein translation (Wang2020Loss). The molecular structure of NARS1 includes a 7 beta-strand protein structure, characteristic of the Class IIa family (Wang2020Loss). NARS1 contains several domains, including a unique N-terminal extension (UNE-N), an anticodon binding domain (ABD), and a catalytic domain (Vinogradova2021Associations). The UNE-N domain is specific to eukaryotes and has been noted for its chemokine activity (Manole2020De).

Mutations in NARS1 can affect its structure and function, particularly in the catalytic domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Beijer2024Dominant). The protein functions as a class II homodimer, and mutations can disrupt dimer formation, affecting its aminoacylation capacity (Manole2020De). Structural modeling has shown that mutations at the N and C termini can disrupt the protein homodimer and ATP-binding or catalytic domain (Manole2020De). These structural features are essential for the proper function of NARS1 in protein synthesis.

## Function
The NARS1 gene encodes the enzyme asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, which plays a critical role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of asparagine to its corresponding tRNA. This process is essential for the accurate translation of genetic information into functional proteins, a fundamental aspect of cellular function and organismal development (Wang2020Loss; Beijer2024Dominant). NARS1 is a member of the cytoplasmic Class IIa family of tRNA synthetases and is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, including the brain, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular viability (Wang2020Loss).

In healthy human cells, NARS1 is particularly crucial during brain development, where it supports the proliferation of radial glial cells (RGCs), which are essential for the formation of neural structures (Wang2020Loss). The enzyme's activity ensures adequate protein synthesis, which is necessary for the growth and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and the development of cortical brain organoids (Wang2020Loss). The expression of NARS1 is highest during early neural development, indicating its role in the generation of NPCs and the maintenance of normal brain size and function (Wang2020Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NARS1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders. Biallelic missense and frameshift mutations in NARS1 have been linked to microcephaly and neurodevelopmental delay in patients from multiple families. These mutations result in reduced NARS1 protein levels, impaired enzyme activity, and decreased global protein synthesis, leading to reduced proliferation of radial glial cells and smaller cortical brain organoids, a characteristic of microcephaly (Wang2020Loss). The study of patient-derived cells and cortical organoids has shown that these mutations disrupt cell cycle regulation and increase apoptosis, contributing to the clinical presentation of microcephaly (Wang2020Loss).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, NARS1 mutations have been implicated in axonal Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease. Dominant NARS1 variants, including missense mutations and an in-frame deletion, have been identified in families with axonal peripheral neuropathy. These mutations are associated with sensorimotor axonal neuropathy and, in some cases, mild spasticity and cerebellar ataxia. Functional studies suggest that these variants affect the catalytic domain of the NARS1 protein, potentially reducing its function and contributing to the neuropathy phenotype (Beijer2024Dominant).
