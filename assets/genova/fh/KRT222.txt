# KRT222

## Overview
KRT222 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 222, which is a member of the keratin family of proteins. Keratins are structural proteins that form intermediate filaments, providing mechanical support and resilience to epithelial cells. Keratin 222 is categorized as a type II keratin, typically expressed in specific epithelial tissues, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular integrity and function. The expression and regulation of KRT222 are essential for normal cellular processes, and alterations in this gene may be implicated in various pathological conditions, although specific clinical associations remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to understand the precise biological functions and interactions of keratin 222 within the cellular environment.
