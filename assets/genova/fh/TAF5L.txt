# TAF5L

## Overview
TAF5L is a gene that encodes the TATA-box binding protein associated factor 5 like, a protein integral to the transcriptional machinery of eukaryotic cells. This protein is a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which is crucial for the initiation of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II. TAF5L is involved in various histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, such as STAGA, PCAF, and TFTC, which play significant roles in histone acetylation and gene activation. The protein is characterized by a conserved WD40-repeats domain, facilitating protein-protein interactions, and a TAF5_NTD2 domain, which is involved in TAF-TAF interactions (Wang2020TAF5L). TAF5L is particularly important in the regulation of gene expression related to the MYC regulatory network, influencing processes such as cell cycle progression and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (Seruggia2019TAF5L).

## Structure
The TAF5L protein is characterized by the presence of specific domains that contribute to its function in transcriptional regulation. It contains a conserved WD40-repeats domain at its C-terminal, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions through a closed beta propeller structure. This domain is highly conserved across species, from invertebrates to vertebrates, indicating its evolutionary significance (Wang2020TAF5L). The N-terminal of TAF5L includes a TAF5_NTD2 domain, which is typically involved in TAF-TAF interactions, although the NTD1 domain present in human TAF5 is absent in TAF5L (Wang2020TAF5L).

TAF5L is a component of various histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, such as STAGA, PCAF, and TFTC, which are involved in histone acetylation and gene activation. These complexes play a role in recruiting transcription factors and co-activators, highlighting the importance of TAF5L in transcriptional regulation (Seruggia2019TAF5L). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these aspects are not provided in the context. The structural features of TAF5L suggest its involvement in maintaining the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells through the MYC regulatory network (Seruggia2019TAF5L).

## Function
TAF5L is a critical component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which is essential for the initiation of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II. It plays a significant role in maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by participating in the MYC regulatory network. TAF5L is involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to promoter and enhancer regions, which is associated with active histone marks such as H3K4me1, H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3, promoting transcriptional activity (Seruggia2019TAF5L).

TAF5L is a part of various histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, including STAGA, PCAF, and TFTC, which acetylate histone residues to influence gene expression. It predominantly regulates the MYC regulatory network, crucial for cell cycle progression, DNA replication, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolism, particularly glycolysis (Seruggia2019TAF5L). TAF5L also plays a role in the transcriptional activation of c-Myc and Oct4, key factors in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells (Seruggia2019TAF5L).

In the SAGA complex, TAF5L contributes to transcription regulation by interacting with various modules responsible for histone acetylation, a crucial process for chromatin remodeling and gene expression (Timmers2021SAGA).

## Interactions
TAF5L is involved in various protein interactions, primarily as a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which is essential for the initiation of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II. Within this complex, TAF5L interacts with other TATA-box binding protein associated factors (TAFs) and the TATA-binding protein (TBP), facilitating the assembly and stability of the TFIID complex. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of numerous genes (Seruggia2019TAF5L).

In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), TAF5L has been shown to interact with TAF6L, another component of the TFIID complex. These interactions are part of the GNAT-HAT complexes, which are involved in histone acetylation and gene activation. TAF5L and TAF6L regulate gene expression through the MYC regulatory network, influencing the transcriptional activation of c-Myc and Oct4, which are critical for maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs (Seruggia2019TAF5L).

TAF5L also participates in protein-protein interactions in the clam Meretrix petechialis, where it acts as a transcriptional coactivator of MITF, a critical immune-related transcription factor. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal TAF5-NTD2 domain of TAF5L, highlighting its role in immune response regulation (Wang2020TAF5L).
