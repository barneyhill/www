# DEPDC7

## Overview
DEPDC7 is a gene that encodes the DEP domain containing 7 protein, which is involved in intracellular signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by the presence of a DEP domain, a globular structure that facilitates interactions with other proteins in signaling pathways, particularly those related to G-protein and Wnt signaling (Liao2017DEPDC7). Additionally, DEPDC7 contains a GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain, suggesting a role in regulating GTPase activity and cellular communication (Liao2017DEPDC7). The protein is predominantly expressed in liver tissue, where it is believed to contribute to normal liver function and act as a tumor suppressor, as its expression is reduced in liver cancer (Liao2017DEPDC7). DEPDC7 also interacts with proteins involved in immune response regulation, such as CARMA2, indicating its involvement in modulating immune responses and inflammation (Zotti2018CARD14CARMA2). The gene's clinical significance extends to various conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and mood disorders, highlighting its multifaceted role in human health (PalmaGudiel2020Twin; Lee2021Unveiling).

## Structure
DEPDC7 encodes a protein that contains a DEP domain, which is a globular protein domain of approximately 80 to 90 amino acids. This domain is involved in membrane-associated processes and is characterized by a three-helix bundle, a β-hairpin 'arm' with two β-strands, and two short β-strands at the C-terminal region. The core structure of the DEP domain is stabilized by three α-helices composed of highly conserved hydrophobic amino acids (Liao2016Identification; Liao2017DEPDC7).

The DEPDC7 protein consists of 511 amino acids and includes a GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain, which suggests a role in regulating GTPase activity (Liao2017DEPDC7). The protein is involved in various signaling pathways, including G-protein and Wnt signaling pathways (Liao2017DEPDC7). 

While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of DEPDC7 are not provided, the presence of the DEP domain indicates a potential for interaction with other proteins in signaling pathways. The protein's expression is notably high in normal liver tissue, and it is involved in liver-selective cell communication (Liao2017DEPDC7). Information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms is not available in the provided context.

## Function
The DEPDC7 gene encodes a protein that is primarily involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to cell communication and organization. The protein contains a Dishevelled, EGL-10, and Pleckstrin (DEP) domain, which is a globular protein domain present in numerous signaling proteins involved in G-protein and Wnt signaling pathways. This domain suggests that DEPDC7 plays a significant role in cell signal transduction processes (Liao2017DEPDC7). The protein also includes a GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain, which is typically involved in the regulation of GTPases, further implicating DEPDC7 in signal transduction and cellular communication (Liao2017DEPDC7).

In healthy human cells, DEPDC7 is highly expressed in liver tissue, indicating its potential role in maintaining normal liver function. Its expression is significantly reduced in liver cancer, suggesting that it may act as a tumor suppressor (Liao2017DEPDC7). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other signaling molecules to regulate cellular functions, including cell growth and differentiation (Liao2016Identification). Despite these insights, the precise molecular functions of DEPDC7 in healthy cells remain not fully understood.

## Clinical Significance
DEPDC7 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and genetic variations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DEPDC7 is downregulated, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Overexpression of DEPDC7 in hepatoma cell lines inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for liver cancer (Liao2017DEPDC7). The gene is located on chromosome 11p13, a region frequently deleted in HCC, further supporting its involvement in tumor suppression (Liao2017DEPDC7).

DEPDC7 is also associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), a condition affecting the spine. A specific missense variant in DEPDC7 has been linked to rapid progression of OPLL, with an odds ratio of 9.09, indicating a strong genetic association (Lee2021Unveiling).

In the context of mental health, DEPDC7 methylation has been associated with depressive symptomatology, suggesting a role in mood disorders (PalmaGudiel2020Twin). Additionally, DEPDC7 interacts with CARMA2, a protein involved in inflammatory skin disorders like psoriasis, indicating its role in immune response regulation (Zotti2018CARD14CARMA2). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of DEPDC7 across various conditions.

## Interactions
DEPDC7 (DEP domain containing 7) is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cellular signaling pathways. It has been identified to interact with CARMA2 and CARMA3 proteins, acting as a positive regulator and activating the NF-κB signal transduction pathway. This interaction suggests that DEPDC7 may be involved in modulating immune responses and inflammation through NF-κB signaling (Liao2016Identification).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DEPDC7 is downregulated, and its overexpression in hepatoma cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This indicates that DEPDC7 may function as a tumor suppressor, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Liao2017DEPDC7).

Additionally, DEPDC7 is potentially regulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in antler mesenchymal and cartilage tissues, where it is involved in cell migration processes. Overexpression of certain lncRNAs leads to the downregulation of DEPDC7, suggesting a regulatory interaction between these lncRNAs and DEPDC7 (Chen2020Screening). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of DEPDC7 in different biological contexts.
