# TTC4

## Overview
TTC4 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 4, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing TTC4 to function as a co-chaperone. The protein is involved in several critical cellular processes, including the regulation of apoptosis and the cell cycle in vascular endothelial cells (VECs). TTC4 interacts with chaperone proteins such as HSP70 and HSP90, playing a significant role in promoting cell survival and maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions (Crevel2008The; He2020Promoting). Additionally, TTC4 is implicated in DNA replication through its interaction with CDC6 and in innate immune responses by modulating TBK1 activity, thereby enhancing antiviral defense mechanisms (Shang2018Quantitative; Crevel2008The). These diverse functions underscore the importance of TTC4 in cellular regulation and its potential implications in health and disease.

## Function
TTC4, a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat domain proteins, plays a significant role in regulating apoptosis and the cell cycle in vascular endothelial cells (VECs). It functions as a co-chaperone, interacting with the heat shock protein HSP70, which is crucial for its anti-apoptotic activity. This interaction is essential for the suppression of apoptosis, as demonstrated by the fact that knocking down HSP70 negates TTC4's ability to inhibit apoptosis (He2020Promoting). TTC4's interaction with HSP70 upregulates the Akt signaling pathway, which is known to inhibit apoptosis, thereby promoting cell survival under stress conditions (He2020Promoting).

In addition to its role in apoptosis, TTC4 is involved in maintaining cell viability by regulating the cell cycle. Overexpression of TTC4 in VECs has been shown to decrease apoptosis, as evidenced by reduced nuclear DNA condensation, DNA fragmentation, and cleaved PARP levels, particularly under conditions of serum and FGF-2 deprivation (He2019MROH7‐TTC4). These findings suggest that TTC4 is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing apoptosis in healthy human cells.

## Interactions
TTC4, a protein with tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, is involved in various protein-protein interactions. It interacts with HSP70 and HSP90, two chaperone proteins, suggesting a role as a co-chaperone. These interactions are crucial for TTC4's function, as demonstrated by its ability to suppress apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells through its interaction with HSP70. This anti-apoptotic function is dependent on HSP70, as inhibition of HSP70 negates TTC4's effect (Crevel2008The; He2020Promoting).

TTC4 also interacts with CDC6, a replication initiation protein, indicating a potential role in DNA replication. This interaction is stronger with human CDC6 compared to its Drosophila counterpart, and mutations in TTC4 can disrupt this interaction without affecting its interactions with HSP90 and HSP70 (Crevel2008The).

In the context of innate immunity, TTC4 interacts with TBK1, a kinase involved in immune response signaling. This interaction positions TTC4 as a positive regulator of Sendai virus-induced innate immunity, enhancing the expression of IFNB1 and other immune response genes (Shang2018Quantitative). These interactions highlight TTC4's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including apoptosis regulation, DNA replication, and immune response modulation.
