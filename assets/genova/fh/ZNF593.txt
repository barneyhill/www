# ZNF593

## Overview
ZNF593 is a gene in Homo sapiens that encodes the zinc finger protein 593, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of a classical C2H2 zinc finger domain. This protein is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation within the nucleus, where it modulates the activity of transcription factors, notably acting as a negative modulator of the Oct-2 transcription factor. The zinc finger domain of ZNF593 facilitates protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, which are crucial for its regulatory functions. Despite its well-ordered zinc finger domain, the protein is largely unstructured, with significant portions of its N- and C-terminal regions being disordered. While the precise molecular pathways and broader biological roles of ZNF593 are not fully understood, its involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests it plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and gene expression dynamics (Lynch2019Zinc; Hayes2008The).

## Structure
ZNF593 is a zinc finger protein from Homo sapiens characterized by a classical C2H2 zinc finger domain. This domain spans residues 24-92 and includes a canonical N-terminal β-hairpin and an atypical helix-kink-helix motif for zinc ion coordination (Hayes2008The). The zinc finger domain is well-ordered, as indicated by low backbone root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values and high heteronuclear NOE values for residues 36-71 (Hayes2008The). The presence of the zinc ion is crucial for maintaining the structure, as demonstrated by the collapse of the NMR spectrum upon the addition of EDTA, which chelates the zinc ion (Hayes2008The).

The protein is composed of 115 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 13.2 kDa. Approximately 65% of ZNF593 is disordered, with the N- and C-terminal regions being largely unstructured and highly mobile (Hayes2008The). Structural analysis identified significant homologs, including the second zinc finger of dsRBP-Zfa, the human enhancer binding protein MBP-1, and ZFY-swap, which share structural similarities with ZNF593 (Hayes2008The). The protein was expressed and purified using a wheat germ cell-free expression system, and its structure was analyzed using NMR spectroscopy (Hayes2008The).

## Function
ZNF593 is a zinc finger protein that plays a role in transcriptional regulation in human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it is involved in modulating the DNA-binding activity of transcription factors, particularly the Oct-2 transcription factor, which is part of the POU domain-containing protein family. ZNF593 acts as a negative modulator of Oct-2, potentially influencing gene expression by interacting with specific octamer sites upstream of the TATA box (Hayes2008The).

The protein contains a classical C2H2 zinc finger domain, which is a common motif in nucleic acid-binding proteins. This domain is crucial for protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, suggesting that ZNF593 may have a role in regulating various cellular activities, including differentiation, development, and possibly tumor suppression (Hayes2008The). The structure of ZNF593, determined through NMR spectroscopy, reveals a well-ordered zinc finger domain, while the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are highly disordered, indicating a predominately unstructured protein (Hayes2008The).

Although the exact molecular pathways and organismal outcomes of ZNF593's functions in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, its involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and gene expression dynamics.

## Interactions
ZNF593 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a negative modulator of the DNA-binding activity of the Oct-2 transcription factor. It is speculated that ZNF593 may inhibit Oct-2 by either directly binding to the octamer sequence or through direct interaction with Oct-2 itself (Hayes2008The). Despite its role in modulating Oct-2, no direct interaction with the consensus binding sequence of Oct-1/Pou2f1 and Oct-2/Pou2f2 has been found, suggesting that ZNF593's inhibition is not due to competitive binding (Lynch2019Zinc).

The protein contains a classical C2H2 zinc finger domain, which is typically involved in nucleic acid recognition, and shares structural similarities with other proteins such as the double-stranded RNA-binding protein Zfa and the human enhancer binding protein MBP-1 (Hayes2008The). These structural features, including a kinked alpha-helix and a cluster of basic residues, may facilitate interactions with nucleic acids (Hayes2008The).

ZNF593's yeast ortholog, Bud20, is involved in pre-60S ribosome subunit export, indicating a potential conserved function in ribosome assembly, which may suggest interactions with components of the ribosome (Lynch2019Zinc). However, specific protein interactions of ZNF593 in humans remain to be fully elucidated.
