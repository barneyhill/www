# DYNC1I1

## Overview
The DYNC1I1 gene encodes the dynein cytoplasmic 1 intermediate chain 1, a crucial component of the cytoplasmic dynein-1 complex, which is a motor protein complex involved in intracellular transport. This protein plays a pivotal role in retrograde transport along microtubules, facilitating the movement of organelles, vesicles, and protein complexes within eukaryotic cells. The dynein cytoplasmic 1 intermediate chain 1 is characterized by its structural features, including WD40 repeats that form a β-propeller ring, which is essential for its interaction with other components of the dynein complex. It is particularly significant in neuronal function, where it contributes to axonal transport, and in cochlear hair cells, where it is involved in autophagosome transport and degradation. Additionally, DYNC1I1 has regulatory roles in gene expression, influencing limb development through its exonic enhancers. Mutations or deletions in this gene are linked to various congenital disorders, including split-hand/split-foot malformation, intellectual disabilities, and hearing loss, underscoring its clinical significance (Kuta2010Mouse; Ambrosetti2023Split; Zhang2022Dync1li1; Tayebi2014Deletions).

## Structure
The DYNC1I1 gene encodes the intermediate chain 1 (IC1) of the cytoplasmic dynein-1 complex, a motor protein involved in intracellular transport. The protein is approximately 74 kDa and features a C-terminal region with tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) 40 repeats that form a β-propeller ring structure. This structure anchors to the heavy chain (HC) of dynein-1, providing a stable platform for light chains (LCs) and other binding partners (Rao2024Structure). The N-terminus of the IC1 includes a single α-helix (SAH) followed by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which serves as a recruitment site for LCs (Rao2024Structure).

The IC1 interacts with dynein-1's cofactor Nde1/Ndel1 and dynactin's largest subunit, p150 Glued, through its N-terminal coiled-coil region. These interactions are crucial for dynein activation and motility (Rao2024Structure). The IC1 also plays a role in the autoinhibition and activation of dynein-1, with the IC-LC complex wrapping around the HC in the autoinhibited state and trailing behind the HC in the active conformation (Rao2024Structure).

In humans, there are two homologs of the IC for dynein-1: IC1 and IC2, with IC1 primarily expressed in the brain. These homologs have multiple splicing isoforms that can form homodimers and heterodimers, binding to all light chains (LCs) (Rao2024Structure). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect binding selectivity and interactions, diversifying the function of the IC1 (Rao2024Structure).

## Function
The DYNC1I1 gene encodes a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, which is a motor protein responsible for retrograde transport along microtubules in eukaryotic cells. This complex is crucial for intracellular transport, including the movement of organelles, vesicles, and protein complexes, toward the minus end of microtubules (Kuta2010Mouse; Zhang2022Dync1li1). In neurons, DYNC1I1 is involved in axonal transport, contributing to the proper functioning of neurons by facilitating the transport of organelles and other cellular components along axons (Pfister2006Genetic).

DYNC1I1 is also essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis in cochlear hair cells by regulating the transport and degradation of autophagosomes. The deletion or knockdown of DYNC1I1 leads to unstable dynein complexes and impaired transportation of autophagosomes to lysosomes, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes and triggering apoptosis in hair cells. This process is crucial for preventing the accumulation of harmful substances and ensuring cell survival (Zhang2022Dync1li1).

In addition to its role in transport, DYNC1I1 contains exonic enhancers that regulate the expression of DLX5 and DLX6 genes, which are crucial for limb development. Deletions of these enhancers are associated with split-hand/split-foot malformation, highlighting DYNC1I1's regulatory role in gene expression (Tayebi2014Deletions; Ambrosetti2023Split).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deletions involving the DYNC1I1 gene are associated with several congenital and developmental disorders. Notably, deletions of exonic enhancers within DYNC1I1, specifically exons 15 and 17, are linked to split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM), a congenital limb defect characterized by median clefts of the hands and feet. These exons act as enhancers for the DLX5 and DLX6 genes, which are crucial for limb development. Disruptions in these enhancers can lead to SHFM by reducing the expression of DLX5 and DLX6 (Tayebi2014Deletions; Ambrosetti2023Split; Delgado20157q21.3).

In addition to limb malformations, deletions in the DYNC1I1 region have been associated with intellectual disabilities and hearing loss. Some cases report additional phenotypes such as craniofacial abnormalities and developmental delays, suggesting a broader impact of these deletions beyond limb development (Ambrosetti2023Split; RamosZaldívar2016A). The variability in clinical presentation indicates a complex genotype-phenotype correlation, with some deletions also affecting other genes in the region, potentially contributing to the diverse symptoms observed (Ambrosetti2023Split; RamosZaldívar2016A).

## Interactions
DYNC1I1, a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, participates in several key interactions with other proteins. It acts as a scaffold within the dynein complex, binding to the dynein heavy chain, three light chain dimers, and the dynactin complex, which serves as a cargo adaptor. The N-terminal region of DYNC1I1 forms a coiled-coil structure that interacts with the p150 subunit of dynactin, while the C-terminal region contains WD40 repeats that form a beta-propeller structure for interaction with the dynein heavy chain (Kuta2010Mouse).

DYNC1I1 also interacts with NF-κB/p65, influencing its nuclear translocation and thereby regulating IL-6 expression in gastric cancer cells. This interaction was demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation, showing that DYNC1I1 can bind to NF-κB/p65, affecting its distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Gong2019DYNC1I1).

Additionally, DYNC1I1 interacts with sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2), with evidence suggesting a stronger interaction with the IC1 isoform compared to IC2. This interaction is involved in the subcellular localization of SK2, particularly in the context of glioblastoma (Neubauer2018Cytoplasmic).
