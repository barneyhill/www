# SBF2

## Overview
The SBF2 gene encodes the protein SET binding factor 2, which is a member of the myotubularin family and functions as a pseudophosphatase. Despite its lack of intrinsic phosphatase activity due to inactivating substitutions in its phosphatase domain, the protein plays a significant role in phosphoinositide-mediated signaling pathways, particularly in the peripheral nervous system. SET binding factor 2 is characterized by several domains, including a GRAM domain, a DENN domain, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitate its involvement in membrane association and signaling processes (Senderek2003Mutation; Tersar2007Mtmr13Sbf2deficient). The protein forms a tetrameric complex with myotubularin-related protein-2 (MTMR2), enhancing MTMR2's phosphatase activity and playing a crucial role in endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics (Berger2006Multilevel; Tersar2007Mtmr13Sbf2deficient). Mutations in the SBF2 gene are linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B2, highlighting its clinical significance in neuropathic conditions (Senderek2003Mutation; Robinson2005The).

## Structure
The SBF2 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the myotubularin family, characterized as a pseudo-phosphatase due to inactivating substitutions in its phosphatase domain (Senderek2003Mutation; Tersar2007Mtmr13Sbf2deficient). The protein structure includes several domains: a GRAM domain, a DENN domain, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Senderek2003Mutation). The PH domain is involved in binding phosphoinositides, specifically PI-3,4,5-P3, which is crucial for membrane association (Berger2006Multilevel; tersar2008function). The DENN domain, although not fully understood, is suggested to play a role in membrane trafficking and signaling processes (Berger2006Multilevel; tersar2008function).

SBF2 forms a tetrameric complex with MTMR2, significantly enhancing the phosphatase activity of MTMR2 (Berger2006Multilevel; Tersar2007Mtmr13Sbf2deficient). The coiled-coil domains in SBF2 mediate dimerization, which is essential for the formation of this complex (Berger2006Multilevel). The protein also contains a unique stretch of 500 amino acids with no homologies to other proteins, contributing to its distinct functional properties (Tersar2007Mtmr13Sbf2deficient). SBF2 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in the brain, and has multiple splice variant isoforms, which may contribute to its functional diversity (Senderek2003Mutation).

## Function
The SBF2 gene, also known as SET binding factor 2, encodes a protein that is a member of the myotubularin family and functions as a pseudophosphatase. Despite lacking intrinsic phosphatase activity due to alterations in its phosphatase motif, SBF2 plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide-mediated signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of myelination in the peripheral nervous system (Senderek2003Mutation; Chen2014Identification). 

SBF2 forms a complex with myotubularin-related protein-2 (MTMR2), an active phosphatase, significantly enhancing MTMR2's enzymatic activity towards phosphoinositides such as PI-3-P and PI-3,5-P2. This interaction is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions, including endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics (Berger2006Multilevel; Chen2014Identification). 

In healthy human cells, SBF2 is predominantly cytosolic but can associate with membrane structures under specific conditions, such as hypo-osmotic stress, where it binds to vacuole membranes. This membrane association is facilitated by its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which binds to phosphoinositides, suggesting a role in subcellular localization and signaling (Berger2006Multilevel). The SBF2-MTMR2 complex is thought to regulate phosphoinositide levels, impacting processes like signal transduction and cytoskeletal rearrangement, which are vital for nerve function and myelination (Senderek2003Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SBF2 gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B2 (CMT4B2), a severe demyelinating peripheral neuropathy characterized by focally folded myelin sheaths. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and leads to symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy, and slowed nerve conduction (Senderek2003Mutation). The SBF2 gene, also known as MTMR13, is part of the myotubularin family and functions as a pseudophosphatase. It forms a complex with MTMR2, enhancing its enzymatic activity, which is crucial for phosphoinositide signaling in peripheral nerves (Robinson2005The; Tersar2007Mtmr13Sbf2deficient).

Alterations in SBF2 expression or mutations can disrupt this complex, leading to the characteristic myelin abnormalities seen in CMT4B2 (Chen2014Identification). Specific mutations, such as a frameshift mutation c.4571delG, result in a truncated protein that may impair the SBF2-MTMR2 interaction, affecting nerve function (Chen2014Identification). Additionally, a missense mutation in SBF2 has been linked to thrombocytopenia, suggesting that SBF2 mutations may have broader implications beyond neuropathy (Abuzenadah2013Identification).

## Interactions
SBF2, also known as SET binding factor 2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It forms a complex with myotubularin-related protein-2 (MTMR2), which is significant for regulating MTMR2's phosphatase activity. This interaction enhances MTMR2's enzymatic activity towards phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, suggesting a regulatory role in phosphoinositide signaling (Berger2006Multilevel). SBF2 is an inactive phosphatase that acts as a molecular scaffold, forming a tetrameric complex with MTMR2, which consists of dimers of each protein (Berger2006Multilevel).

SBF2 also interacts with Rab GTPases through its N-terminal DENN domain, exhibiting guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity towards Rab28. This interaction is involved in vesicular trafficking and signaling processes (gegenschatz2012structural). Additionally, SBF2 contains a classical PI-3,4,5-P3 binding PH-domain, which may have regulatory functions on cell growth (gegenschatz2012structural).

The interaction between SBF2 and MTMR2 is mediated by coiled-coil domains, which are essential for their stable homodimerization and subsequent complex formation (Berger2006Multilevel). These interactions are particularly relevant in the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, where mutations in SBF2 or MTMR2 lead to similar neuropathic phenotypes (Robinson2005The).
