# PRAMEF14

## Overview
PRAMEF14, or Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma Family Member 14, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. PRAMEF14 is particularly noted for its expression in certain types of cancer, where it may contribute to oncogenic pathways. The protein encoded by PRAMEF14 is involved in the regulation of gene expression and may interact with other cellular proteins to influence tumorigenesis. Its expression pattern and potential involvement in cancer make it a subject of interest for therapeutic research and clinical studies (Qiu2020aarFDC).
