# NIPA2

## Overview
NIPA2 is a gene located on chromosome 15q11-q13 that encodes the NIPA magnesium transporter 2, a transmembrane protein primarily involved in the selective transport of magnesium ions (Mg2+) across cellular membranes. This protein is characterized by its eight transmembrane regions, which facilitate its role as a membrane transport protein, specifically in early endosomes and the plasma membrane (Goytain2008Functional). NIPA2 is crucial for maintaining magnesium homeostasis within cells, a process vital for numerous cellular functions, including neural excitability and synaptic strength (Xie2014Functional). The gene's location within the 15q11.2 region, which is susceptible to microdeletions, has been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, such as childhood absence epilepsy and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its clinical significance (Butler2017Clinical; Jiang2012NIPA2).

## Structure
The NIPA2 protein is a selective magnesium transporter characterized by its primary structure, which consists of 129 amino acids. It is predicted to have eight transmembrane regions, indicating its role as a membrane transport protein (Goytain2008Functional). The secondary structure of NIPA2 includes these transmembrane helices, supporting its function in magnesium transport (Goytain2008Functional). 

NIPA2 is highly selective for Mg2+ and does not transport other cations like Na+, Cl-, or H+ (Goytain2008Functional). The protein is localized primarily to early endosomes and the plasma membrane, with its distribution regulated by magnesium levels (Goytain2008Functional). 

While the tertiary and quaternary structures of NIPA2 are not detailed in the available context, its functional properties suggest a channel-like behavior, as evidenced by Mg2+-evoked currents in experimental models (Goytain2008Functional). The NIPA2 gene is located on chromosome 15q11-q13 and is part of a gene family that includes NIPA1, NIPA3, and NIPA4, although NIPA2 is unique in its high selectivity for magnesium (Goytain2008Functional; Quamme2010Molecular).

## Function
The NIPA2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a highly selective magnesium (Mg2+) transporter, playing a crucial role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis in human cells. NIPA2 is primarily localized in early endosomes and the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the uptake of extracellular magnesium ions into the cytoplasm (Goytain2008Functional; Xie2014Functional). This transport is essential for various cellular processes, including the regulation of neural excitability and synaptic strength, as magnesium is involved in the gating and activation of channels and receptors such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) (Xie2014Functional).

In response to low extracellular magnesium levels, NIPA2 is recruited to the plasma membrane, enhancing its transport activity to maintain intracellular magnesium concentrations (Rafi2020The). The protein's activity is characterized by its electrogenic, voltage-dependent, and saturable transport of Mg2+, with a high selectivity over other cations (Goytain2008Functional). NIPA2's role in magnesium metabolism is critical for normal cellular and neurological functions, as it ensures the proper functioning of enzymes and cellular processes dependent on magnesium (Xie2014Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NIPA2 gene have been associated with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Studies have identified specific mutations, including two novel missense mutations (c.532A>T, p.I178F; c.731A>G, p.N244S) and a small novel insertion, in patients with CAE. These mutations were not found in control groups, suggesting a potential role of NIPA2 as a susceptibility gene for this condition (Jiang2012NIPA2). The NIPA2 gene is located in the 15q11.2 region, which is prone to microdeletions. These microdeletions have been linked to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy, developmental delay, and behavioral issues (Butler2017Clinical; Vanlerberghe201515q11.2).

The 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion, which includes NIPA2, is associated with intellectual disabilities, language delays, and neurobehavioral disturbances. This microdeletion is characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, meaning not all individuals with the deletion exhibit clinical symptoms (Butler2017Clinical). The NIPA2 gene encodes a selective magnesium transporter, and its mutations may disrupt magnesium homeostasis, affecting neurological function and contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in these disorders (Jiang2012NIPA2; Sha202215q11.2).

## Interactions
NIPA2, a magnesium transporter protein, participates in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in intracellular signaling and transcriptional modulation. It is part of a broader protein interaction network that includes proteins such as ACVR1C, SMAD2, ACVR1, UXS1, SMAD3, SMAD4, CHUK, BMP5, BMPR1A, TGFBR1, SMAD9, SMAD1, SMAD5, and ACVR1B. These interactions are involved in physiological and pathological processes, including signal transduction, transcriptional modulation, and regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (Rafi2020The).

NIPA2 is also associated with the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) superfamily and BMP receptors, specifically interacting with BMP receptors ACVR1 and TGFBR1. It interacts with six members of the SMAD superfamily, which are crucial for intracellular signaling and transcriptional modulation (Butler2023Prader–Willi). These interactions are significant in the context of bone morphogenesis and potentially other cellular functions (Rafi2020The).

The protein's interactions are part of a network involving other proteins such as NIPA1, CYFIP1, and TUBGCP5, which collectively contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders (Rafi2020The). These interactions highlight NIPA2's role in various biological processes, including magnesium ion transmembrane transporter activity.
