# PER3

## Overview
The PER3 gene encodes the protein period circadian regulator 3, which is a pivotal component of the mammalian circadian clock system. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein involved in the maintenance of circadian rhythms, which are essential for synchronizing biological processes with the 24-hour day-night cycle. PER3 contains PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in the circadian feedback loop. The gene's expression is rhythmic and occurs in various tissues, influencing the timing of physiological processes and sleep regulation. Polymorphisms in PER3 have been associated with variations in sleep patterns and circadian rhythm disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in sleep-related conditions and its potential role in mood disorders and cancer (Archer2018Phenotyping).

## Structure
The PER3 protein is a crucial component of the mammalian circadian clock, characterized by its distinct molecular structure. It contains two PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domains, PAS-A and PAS-B, which are essential for protein-protein interactions. These domains feature a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet covered by α-helices, forming a structure that facilitates homodimerization through the PAS-B β-sheet surface. A conserved tryptophan residue, Trp359, plays a critical role in this process (Kucera2012Unwinding).

The PAS-A domain in PER3 also contributes to homodimer formation, with interactions mediated by antiparallel αC helices. However, the αC helices in PER3 do not approach each other as closely as in PER1 due to the presence of a bulky arginine residue (Arg176) (Kucera2012Unwinding). The N-terminal region of PER3, predicted to have a helix-loop-helix motif, further stabilizes homodimers (Kucera2012Unwinding).

PER3 is capable of binding heme within its PAS domains, a feature confirmed through UV/VIS spectroscopy (Kucera2012Unwinding). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its stability and function. Splice variants of PER3 can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its regulatory roles.

## Function
The PER3 gene plays a significant role in the regulation of circadian rhythms, which are essential for maintaining the body's internal clock. PER3 is involved in the transcriptional/translational feedback loop that governs circadian rhythms by interacting with other clock proteins such as PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2. These interactions help inhibit the expression of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes by the CLOCK/BMAL1 transcription factor, thereby influencing the circadian period and phase in peripheral tissues (Archer2018Phenotyping; Matsumura2017Multiple).

PER3 is expressed rhythmically in various human tissues, including the central nervous system and peripheral tissues like the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle. It stabilizes PER1/2 in complexes that suppress the promotion by BMAL1/CLOCK, affecting the timing of transcriptional repression and the circadian period length (Archer2018Phenotyping; Matsumura2019Role). The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors binding to E-box and D-box motifs, contributing to its high amplitude and phase of expression (Archer2018Phenotyping).

PER3 also influences sleep regulation and diurnal preferences, with polymorphisms in the gene linked to variations in sleep patterns and circadian rhythm sleep disorders (Archer2018Phenotyping). These molecular processes underscore the importance of PER3 in maintaining circadian rhythms and related physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
The PER3 gene is clinically significant due to its association with various diseases and conditions through its polymorphisms and expression changes. In the context of addiction and anxiety, the PER3 VNTR 4-repeat allele has been linked to heroin dependence and more severe insomnia in alcohol-dependent patients (Archer2018Phenotyping). Polymorphisms in PER3 are also associated with anxiety and addiction phenotypes, with certain alleles correlating with higher anxiety levels (Archer2018Phenotyping).

In cancer, altered PER3 expression is observed in several types, including colorectal cancer, where down-regulation is linked to more aggressive tumors and worse prognosis. Overexpression of PER3 can reduce chemoresistance and tumor renewal ability (Archer2018Phenotyping). In non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, higher PER3 expression correlates with better survival outcomes (Archer2018Phenotyping).

PER3 polymorphisms are also implicated in sleep disorders. The length polymorphism in PER3 is associated with delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) and extreme diurnal preference, with the shorter allele linked to DSPS (Archer2003A). Additionally, PER3 variants are linked to circadian preferences and mental disorders, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (Archer2018Phenotyping). The gene's role in circadian rhythm regulation suggests its involvement in conditions like seasonal affective disorder and advanced sleep phase disorder (Archer2018Phenotyping).

## Interactions
PER3 (period circadian regulator 3) is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. In the context of adipogenesis, PER3 interacts with PPARγ, a nuclear receptor crucial for adipocyte differentiation. This interaction occurs through the N-terminal region of PER3, which contains conserved Per-ARNT-SIM (PAS) motifs. The interaction was demonstrated using coimmunoprecipitation assays and GST pulldown assays, showing that PER3 forms a complex with PPARγ in COS-7 cells. This interaction is specific, as PER3 does not interact with other proteins like RXRα or luciferase (Costa2011Circadian). PER3 inhibits PPARγ's transcriptional activity, thereby blocking adipocyte cell fate and differentiation (Costa2011Circadian).

In the context of DNA damage response, PER3 interacts with ATM and Chk2 proteins, playing a role in checkpoint activation. PER3 is necessary for ATM-dependent Chk2 activation, as its depletion impairs Chk2 activation following DNA damage. Overexpression of PER3 enhances Chk2 phosphorylation, indicating its role in activating the ATM-Chk2 pathway (Im2010Per3).

In human adipogenesis, hPER3 interacts with hHSP90AA1, which in turn interacts with the promoter of hNotch1, acting as a bridge between hPER3 and hNotch1. This interaction represses the Notch1 pathway, promoting adipogenesis (Wan2021hPER3).
