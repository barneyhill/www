# CCDC110

## Overview
The CCDC110 gene encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 110, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific functions of the CCDC110 protein are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular pathways and may play a role in the regulation of cell division and structural organization within the cell. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their contributions to cellular function and potential implications in human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
