# KRT72

## Overview
KRT72 is a gene that encodes keratin 72, a type II keratin protein, which is integral to the structural integrity and function of hair follicles. As a member of the intermediate filament protein family, keratin 72 is characterized by its central alpha-helical rod domain, which facilitates the formation of coiled-coil dimers essential for the mechanical strength and resilience of hair follicles (Ho2022Update). This protein is predominantly expressed in the inner root sheath (IRS) of hair follicles, particularly in the IRS cuticle, where it plays a crucial role in the differentiation and structural support of hair shaft cells (Jacinto2021A). KRT72 interacts with other keratin proteins, contributing to cellular stability and hair formation, and is involved in processes such as keratinocyte differentiation and fatty acid biosynthesis, which are vital for hair structure and function (Huang2024Integration). While specific human hair disorders linked to KRT72 mutations have not been identified, its role in maintaining hair follicle integrity underscores its importance in normal hair growth and development (Jacinto2021A).

## Structure
KRT72 (keratin 72) is a type II keratin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair follicles. The primary structure of KRT72 consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This configuration is typical of intermediate filament proteins, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers (Ho2022Update).

The secondary structure of KRT72 is characterized by alpha-helices, which are essential for the protein's ability to form stable coiled-coil structures. These helices contribute to the protein's mechanical strength and resilience, which are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of hair follicles (Ho2022Update).

In terms of tertiary structure, KRT72 forms coiled-coil formations, which are critical for its function in epithelial cells. The quaternary structure involves heterodimerization with type I keratins, allowing the formation of intermediate filaments that provide structural support to epithelial tissues (Ho2022Update).

Common post-translational modifications of KRT72 include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence the protein's function and interactions within the cell (Ho2022Update). These modifications are important for the regulation of keratin filament assembly and stability.

## Function
KRT72 (keratin 72) is a type II keratin protein that plays a significant role in the structural integrity and function of the hair follicle's inner root sheath (IRS) in healthy human cells. It is highly specific to the IRS, particularly expressed in the IRS cuticle, which is one of the compartments of the IRS along with the Henle and Huxley layers (Jacinto2021A). The keratinocytes in these compartments synthesize IRS keratins, including KRT72, which contribute to the formation and maintenance of the hair shaft by providing mechanical resilience and structural support (Jacinto2021A).

KRT72 is involved in the differentiation of hair follicle cells, ensuring the proper assembly and function of keratin intermediate filaments, which are crucial for maintaining the mechanical stability of epithelial cells (Jacinto2021A). Although specific human hair disorders related to KRT72 mutations have not been identified, its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the hair follicle suggests its importance in normal hair growth and development (Jacinto2021A). The availability of monospecific antisera against KRT72 and other IRS keratins facilitates further research into their specific functions and potential implications in hair biology (Jacinto2021A).

## Interactions
KRT72, a type II hair keratin gene, is involved in the structural integrity of hair and epithelial cells. It is known to interact with other keratin proteins, contributing to cellular stability and hair formation. In the context of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), KRT72 is predicted to interact with KRT78, a gene associated with MPM, and is noted for its higher abundance in epithelioid samples. This interaction provides a potential mechanistic basis for differentiating between epithelioid and sarcomatoid tumors (Karunakaran2021Malignant).

In studies involving Angora rabbits, KRT72, along with other keratins such as KRT73, KRT77, KRT82, and KRT32, is upregulated in processes like keratinocyte differentiation and fatty acid biosynthesis, which are crucial for hair structure and function. These proteins are highlighted for their roles in skin development and epidermal and epithelial cell differentiation, influencing hair fiber quality (Huang2024Integration). The study emphasizes the importance of keratin proteins in hair physiology and their potential interactions in regulating wool fiber characteristics (Huang2024Integration).
