# SIGLEC14

## Overview
SIGLEC14 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 14 (Siglec-14), which is a type-I transmembrane protein involved in the modulation of immune responses. Siglec-14 is part of the Siglec family, which are sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins, and it functions as an activating receptor in the immune system. The protein is characterized by its three immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail, which facilitate its role in immune signaling (Angata2006Discovery). Siglec-14 interacts with the DAP12 signaling adaptor to activate pro-inflammatory pathways, such as p38 MAPK and AKT, enhancing cytokine production in response to bacterial infections (Ali2014Siglec-5). Additionally, Siglec-14 can exist in a soluble form due to alternative splicing, which can suppress pro-inflammatory responses, indicating its regulatory role in inflammation (Huang2018Soluble). The gene's polymorphisms have been linked to various clinical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and susceptibility to infections, highlighting its significance in human health (Macauley2014Siglec-mediated).

## Structure
Siglec-14 is a type-I transmembrane protein composed of 396 amino acid residues. Its structure includes three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The first two Ig-like domains of Siglec-14 are nearly identical to those of Siglec-5, while the third Ig-like domain is unique to Siglec-14 (Angata2006Discovery). The protein features an essential arginine residue crucial for sialic acid recognition, a conserved aromatic amino acid, and an arginine residue in the transmembrane domain, which facilitates its association with the activating adapter protein DAP12 (Angata2006Discovery).

Siglec-14 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in a soluble form known as sSiglec-14. This soluble variant is generated by the retention of intron 5, which contains a termination codon that prevents the translation of the transmembrane domain (Huang2018Soluble). The soluble form of Siglec-14 is found in human blood and has been shown to suppress pro-inflammatory responses in myeloid cells (Huang2018Soluble). The presence of a G-quadruplex structure in intron 5 may regulate the splicing efficiency of SIGLEC14 pre-mRNA, influencing the production of the soluble form (Huang2018Soluble).

## Function
SIGLEC14 encodes a protein that plays a significant role in modulating immune responses in human cells. It is part of a paired receptor system with Siglec-5, where Siglec-14 acts as an activating receptor, counterbalancing the inhibitory effects of Siglec-5. This dynamic is crucial in the immune response to pathogens like Group B Streptococcus (GBS) (Ali2014Siglec-5).

Siglec-14 enhances pro-inflammatory responses by activating signaling pathways such as p38 MAPK and AKT, leading to increased production of cytokines like IL-8 and TNF in response to bacterial infections (Ali2014Siglec-5). It also plays a role in enhancing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages, which is critical for the secretion of IL-1β, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine (Tsai2019Siglec14).

In addition to its membrane-bound form, Siglec-14 can exist in a soluble form (sSiglec-14) generated through alternative splicing. This soluble form can suppress pro-inflammatory responses by interfering with the interaction between membrane-bound Siglec-14 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), suggesting a regulatory role in controlling inflammation (Huang2018Soluble).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SIGLEC14 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. A notable polymorphism in SIGLEC14 results in a null allele, which is common in human populations, particularly in East Asia. This null allele is linked to a reduced risk of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, suggesting a protective role against inflammatory responses in the lungs (Huang2018Soluble; Macauley2014Siglec-mediated). However, the same polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth in infants from Group B Streptococcus (GBS)-positive pregnancies. The absence of Siglec-14 in these cases may lead to a blunted immune response, making fetuses more susceptible to GBS-induced infections (Ali2014Siglec-5).

The SIGLEC14-null allele also affects immune responses to bacterial infections, as it results in increased susceptibility to immune suppression by GBS, potentially influencing the risk of premature delivery (Ali2014Siglec-5). Additionally, soluble Siglec-14, generated through alternative splicing, can suppress pro-inflammatory responses, indicating its role in modulating inflammation (Huang2018Soluble). These findings highlight the complex role of SIGLEC14 in both protective and adverse immune responses.

## Interactions
Siglec-14, encoded by the SIGLEC14 gene, is involved in various protein interactions that modulate immune responses. It forms a complex with the DAP12 signaling adaptor, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This interaction is crucial for activating downstream signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways, leading to enhanced pro-inflammatory responses (Angata2006Discovery; Ali2014Siglec-5).

Siglec-14 also interacts with Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on myeloid cells. This interaction is significant in the context of inflammatory responses, as it can be modulated by the soluble form of Siglec-14 (sSiglec-14), which interferes with the membrane-bound Siglec-14 (mSiglec-14) and TLR2 interaction, thereby suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Huang2018Soluble).

Additionally, Siglec-14 interacts with vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein, to enhance NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. This interaction is stronger than with other Siglecs, such as Siglec-5, and leads to increased IL-1β production, highlighting Siglec-14's role in promoting inflammasome activation (Tsai2019Siglec14).
