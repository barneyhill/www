# NDUFA10

## Overview
NDUFA10 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A10, an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a critical step in ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. Although NDUFA10 does not possess direct enzymatic activity, it plays a vital role in the assembly and stability of complex I, located in the matrix arm of the complex. The protein is characterized by a deoxyribonucleoside kinase (dNK) domain, suggesting a potential role in nucleotide binding, particularly with deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), which may influence mitochondrial DNA synthesis and function (Hoefs2010NDUFA10; MolinaGranada2022Most). NDUFA10's involvement in mitochondrial function underscores its significance in cellular energy metabolism and its potential implications in various diseases, including Leigh syndrome and Alzheimer's disease (Hoefs2010NDUFA10; Yang2023An).

## Structure
The NDUFA10 protein is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It is characterized by a dNK domain, which is shared with deoxyribonucleoside kinases, indicating a potential role in nucleotide binding (MolinaGranada2022Most; Elurbe2016The). The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 42 kDa and is located in the matrix arm of complex I (MolinaGranada2022Most).

NDUFA10 undergoes various post-translational modifications (PTMs), including oxidations, S-nitrosylations, acetylations, myristoylations, and phosphorylations, which are crucial for regulating its function and activity (Muñoz2008Mass). Specific modifications include dimethylation of arginine and lysine residues, as well as acetylation and hydroxylation, which may influence the protein's activity and stability (Muñoz2008Mass).

The protein exists in different isoforms, with a notable D/N substitution at position 120, resulting from a genetic variation, which affects its electrophoretic mobility (Muñoz2008Mass). This polymorphism is specific to certain species, such as Wistar rats, and highlights the diversity in NDUFA10's structure and function (Muñoz2008Mass).

## Function
NDUFA10 is an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. This complex is responsible for transferring electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Hoefs2010NDUFA10). NDUFA10 is located in the matrix arm of complex I and is involved in the assembly and stability of the complex, although it does not have direct enzymatic activity (MolinaGranada2022Most).

A significant function of NDUFA10 is its interaction with deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP). It binds dGTP tightly, suggesting a role in regulating nucleotide availability within mitochondria, which may impact DNA synthesis and mitochondrial function (MolinaGranada2022Most). This binding is highly specific to dGTP, with no affinity for other nucleotides like dATP, dTTP, or dCTP (MolinaGranada2022Most). The interaction between NDUFA10 and dGTP may serve as a mechanism to protect dGTP from degradation, allowing for rapid expansion of the mitochondrial dGTP pool when needed (MolinaGranada2022Most).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NDUFA10 gene are linked to several diseases, primarily due to its role in mitochondrial complex I. Mutations in NDUFA10 have been associated with Leigh syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative disorder. Patients with Leigh syndrome often exhibit complex I deficiency, leading to symptoms such as developmental delays, hypotonia, and neurological abnormalities. Specific mutations, such as those affecting the start codon or causing amino acid substitutions, result in decreased activity and assembly of complex I, contributing to the disease's pathology (Hoefs2010NDUFA10; Minoia2017Widening).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), low expression levels of NDUFA10 correlate with cognitive decline, as indicated by lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores. This downregulation is linked to aberrant m6A modification due to low METTL3 expression, impacting mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Yang2023An).

In diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), NDUFA10-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor. The CAV3 gene has been shown to alleviate DCM by stabilizing NDUFA10, preventing its degradation and improving mitochondrial function. This interaction highlights the importance of NDUFA10 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity in cardiac tissues (Guo2024CAV3).

## Interactions
NDUFA10, a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, is involved in several interactions crucial for its function. It specifically binds to deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), with studies showing that most mitochondrial dGTP is tightly bound to NDUFA10. This interaction is highly selective, as demonstrated by photoaffinity labeling and UV-crosslink assays, which showed no binding to other nucleotides like dATP, dTTP, or dCTP (MolinaGranada2022Most). The binding of dGTP to NDUFA10 is suggested to play a regulatory role in nucleotide availability, potentially influencing mitochondrial and cytosolic deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pools (MolinaGranada2022Most).

NDUFA10 is also involved in protein interactions within mitochondrial complex I. It is an accessory subunit located in the matrix arm of complex I and is associated with the stability and assembly of the complex. The interaction of NDUFA10 with dGTP may resemble feedback inhibition mechanisms seen in deoxyribonucleoside kinases, although no kinase activity has been detected in vitro (MolinaGranada2022Most). These interactions highlight the role of NDUFA10 in maintaining mitochondrial function and dNTP balance, linking oxidative metabolism to DNA synthesis (MolinaGranada2022Most).
