# PELI2

## Overview
PELI2 is a gene that encodes the protein pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 2, which is a member of the Pellino family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein is characterized by its RING-like domain, which is essential for its E3 ligase activity, and a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain that facilitates interactions with phosphorylated proteins. PELI2 plays a pivotal role in immune signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by toll-like receptors (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1R), by promoting the ubiquitination of key signaling molecules such as IRAK1. This ubiquitination is crucial for the activation of downstream pathways, including the TAK1-dependent pathway leading to NF-kB activation, which is vital for immune and inflammatory responses (Moynagh2014The; Kim2012Pellino). Additionally, PELI2 is involved in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the stabilization of mRNAs in response to inflammatory stimuli, underscoring its importance in modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis (Cristea2021K+; Kim2012Pellino).

## Structure
PELI2, a member of the Pellino family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, features a conserved carboxyl-terminal region with cysteine and histidine residues that resemble a RING motif, which is characteristic of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This RING-like domain is crucial for its E3 ligase activity, facilitating the formation of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains on substrates such as IRAK1 (Ordureau2007The; Moynagh2014The). The protein also contains a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which is involved in recognizing phosphothreonine residues and mediating interactions with phosphorylated IRAK1 (Smith2009Identification; Humphries2018The).

The structure of PELI2 includes a cryptic phosphothreonine-binding FHA domain, which, along with an additional 'wing' structure, is conserved across the Pellino family. This domain is essential for recognizing phosphorylated targets (Moynagh2014The). PELI2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by kinases like IRAK1 and TBK1/IKKε, which enhance its E3 ligase activity (Ordureau2007The; Humphries2018The). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
PELI2, a member of the Pellino family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, plays a crucial role in immune signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by toll-like receptors (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1R). It is involved in the ubiquitination of IRAK1, facilitating both Lys-63 and Lys-48 linked polyubiquitination, which is essential for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the TAK1-dependent pathway leading to NF-kB activation. This process is vital for immune and inflammatory responses (Kim2012Pellino).

PELI2 is also implicated in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, acting as a positive regulator of NF-kB activation and contributing to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα. It is essential in the priming step of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, although it does not directly induce poly-ubiquitination of NLRP3 (Cristea2021K+; Humphries2018The).

In addition to its role in immune signaling, PELI2 is involved in the post-transcriptional control of gene expression, stabilizing mRNAs such as KC and IL-6 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in macrophages. This stabilization is crucial for maintaining mRNA levels and ensuring proper inflammatory responses (Kim2012Pellino).

## Clinical Significance
PELI2 plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammatory responses, and alterations in its expression or function can have clinical implications. Mutations or changes in the expression of PELI2 can impact the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a critical component of the immune response. This can lead to impaired production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, which are essential for effective immune function (Humphries2018The). 

In the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), PELI2 expression is upregulated, correlating inversely with miR-802 expression. miR-802 targets PELI2, and its downregulation in ARDS contributes to increased inflammatory cytokine production. Overexpression of miR-802 can suppress PELI2 expression, reducing inflammation and lung injury, suggesting that the miR-802/PELI2 axis could be a therapeutic target for ARDS (You2019MiR802).

PELI2's interaction with IRAK1 also plays a role in modulating inflammasome activation. Alterations in this interaction can lead to dysregulated NLRP3 activation, potentially contributing to inflammatory diseases (Humphries2018The). These findings highlight the importance of PELI2 in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential involvement in inflammatory disorders.

## Interactions
PELI2, a member of the Pellino E3 ubiquitin ligase family, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate immune signaling pathways. PELI2 interacts with IRAK1, a key molecule in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling pathways. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination of IRAK1, which is necessary for the activation of TAK1, a kinase involved in the NF-kB signaling pathway (Kim2012Pellino). PELI2 facilitates the formation of the IRAK1-TAK1 complex, which is essential for TAK1 activation and subsequent downstream signaling events (Kim2012Pellino).

PELI2 also plays a significant role in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. It interacts with NLRP3 and promotes its K63-linked polyubiquitination, which is essential for the priming and activation of the inflammasome. This interaction is mediated through PELI2's FHA and RING-like domains (Humphries2018The). PELI2 limits the interaction between IRAK1 and NLRP3, preventing IRAK1's inhibitory effects on NLRP3 activation, thereby facilitating the assembly and activation of the inflammasome (Humphries2018The). These interactions highlight PELI2's role in modulating immune responses through its involvement in key signaling pathways.
