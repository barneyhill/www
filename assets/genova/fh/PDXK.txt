# PDXK

## Overview
The PDXK gene encodes the enzyme pyridoxal kinase, a member of the kinase family, which is pivotal in the metabolism of vitamin B6. Pyridoxal kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of vitamin B6 vitamers—pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and pyridoxamine—into pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the active form of the vitamin. This enzyme is essential for numerous biochemical processes, as PLP serves as a cofactor for over 160 enzymatic reactions, including those involved in neurotransmitter synthesis. The structural configuration of pyridoxal kinase, characterized by a Rossmann fold and a dimeric quaternary structure, facilitates its function in the cytoplasm where it maintains PLP levels necessary for cellular metabolism. Mutations in the PDXK gene can lead to reduced enzymatic activity, resulting in clinical conditions such as polyneuropathy, which may be ameliorated by PLP supplementation (Chelban2019PDXK; Gandhi2012Crystal). Additionally, PDXK has been implicated in cancer biology, with its expression levels influencing tumor progression and patient prognosis (fan2023Pyridoxal).

## Structure
The human PDXK gene encodes pyridoxal kinase, an enzyme involved in the phosphorylation of vitamin B6. The primary structure of pyridoxal kinase consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes nine α-helices and ten β-strands, forming a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices, which is characteristic of the ribokinase superfamily (Li2002Crystal). The tertiary structure of pyridoxal kinase features a Rossmann fold, a common motif in nucleotide-binding proteins, which facilitates the binding of ATP and pyridoxal substrates (Musayev2007Crystal). 

The quaternary structure of pyridoxal kinase is typically dimeric, with two identical monomers related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis. This dimeric form is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions (Li2002Crystal). The enzyme's active site includes a unique 12-residue loop that prevents premature ATP hydrolysis, a feature not observed in other kinases of the ribokinase superfamily (Li2002Crystal). Pyridoxal kinase also exhibits post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and stability (Musayev2007Crystal).

## Function
The human gene PDXK encodes pyridoxal kinase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of vitamin B6 by catalyzing the phosphorylation of its vitamers—pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and pyridoxamine—into their active form, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) (Chelban2019PDXK; Gandhi2012Crystal). PLP serves as a vital cofactor for over 160 enzymatic reactions, including those involved in neurotransmitter production, such as serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (Gandhi2012Crystal). 

Pyridoxal kinase is a homodimeric enzyme, with each monomer containing an active site that binds ATP and requires Mg2+ ions for its activity (Musayev2007Crystal; Chelban2019PDXK). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it ensures the conversion of vitamin B6 into PLP, maintaining adequate levels necessary for cellular metabolism and function (di2011Vitamin). 

Mutations in the PDXK gene can impair the enzyme's ability to bind ATP, leading to reduced enzymatic activity and conditions such as polyneuropathy, which may be responsive to PLP supplementation (Chelban2019PDXK). The enzyme's activity is essential for the vitamin B6 salvage pathway, which is crucial for maintaining PLP levels in cells (di2011Vitamin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PDXK gene are associated with autosomal recessive axonal polyneuropathy and optic atrophy. These mutations lead to reduced enzymatic activity of pyridoxal kinase, resulting in low levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), which is crucial for neurological function. Affected individuals may experience severe symptoms, including becoming wheelchair-bound and blind if untreated. PLP supplementation has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, such as muscle power and independent walking ability, by restoring PLP levels (Chelban2019PDXK).

Alterations in PDXK expression have also been linked to cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), PDXK is overexpressed, promoting tumor viability and migration through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting PDXK as a potential therapeutic target in CRC (fan2023Pyridoxal).

In Drosophila models, human PDXK variants have been shown to affect genome integrity and glucose metabolism, potentially increasing cancer risk by compromising DNA integrity. These variants exhibit reduced catalytic activity, indicating a loss-of-function effect (Mascolo2019The).

## Interactions
Pyridoxal kinase (PDXK) is known to interact with various proteins, playing a crucial role in vitamin B6 metabolism. One significant interaction is with roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. PDXK binds to roscovitine at the pyridoxal-binding site, rather than the ATP-binding site, indicating a direct interaction. This binding is confirmed through affinity chromatography and microsequencing techniques, and it occurs in various tissues, including the brain, liver, and kidney (Bach2005Roscovitine).

PDXK also interacts with pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes. These interactions are facilitated by a common motif found in these enzymes, which allows for the direct transfer of PLP from PDXK to the acceptor proteins. This motif includes an alpha-helix, a beta-strand, and loop regions, which are spatially accessible for protein-protein interactions (Aleshin2023Protein–Protein).

Mutations in the PDXK gene, such as p.Ala228Thr and p.Arg220Gln, can disrupt its enzymatic activity and interactions, leading to reduced PLP levels and associated polyneuropathy. These mutations affect the protein's ability to bind substrates, highlighting the importance of PDXK's interactions in maintaining PLP levels (Chelban2019PDXK).
