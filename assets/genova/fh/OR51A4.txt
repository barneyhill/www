# OR51A4

## Overview
OR51A4 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily A member 4, which is a part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein functions as a transmembrane receptor involved in the detection and transduction of odorant signals, playing a critical role in the sense of smell. The receptor is predominantly expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the vast diversity of odor detection by adhering to the 'one neuron-one receptor rule' (Yoshihito2012Olfactory). Alterations in the OR51A4 gene have been implicated in various health conditions, including cancer and eating disorders, highlighting its potential significance in both olfactory function and disease pathology (Kim2013Assessment; Peng2020Integrated).

## Function
OR51A4 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by seven transmembrane α-helical regions. These receptors play a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. The ligand-binding sites of olfactory receptors, including OR51A4, are primarily located in the transmembrane regions, forming a binding pocket that interacts with odorant molecules (Yoshihito2012Olfactory).

In healthy human cells, OR51A4 is predominantly active in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity of odor detection and olfactory signaling. Each olfactory neuron typically expresses a single functional OR gene, following the 'one neuron-one receptor rule,' which is essential for olfactory coding (Yoshihito2012Olfactory). The expression of OR genes, including OR51A4, is regulated by specific molecular mechanisms, although the exact processes remain partially understood. The receptor's activity in the olfactory epithelium is crucial for the discrimination of a vast number of odorants, allowing humans to perceive a wide range of smells (Yoshihito2012Olfactory).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OR51A4 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In metastatic lung squamous cell carcinoma, a nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant (SNV) in OR51A4, where guanine is replaced by adenine at position 4967678, has been identified. This mutation is linked to primary tumors, lymph node metastasis, and tumor progression, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression and treatment resistance (Peng2020Integrated).

In the context of anorexia nervosa, the OR51A4 gene has shown significant expression changes. It is up-regulated more than two-fold after weight restoration, suggesting that its expression may be influenced by factors such as hormonal changes and inflammation during renourishment. These changes in expression could play a role in the physiological and psychological changes associated with eating disorders (Kim2013Assessment; Shih2016Contemporary).

Additionally, OR51A4 has been mentioned in studies on genetic diversity related to HIV-1, where it is identified as having potentially deleterious variants. However, specific diseases or conditions related to these variants are not detailed (Thami2023Whole). The gene is also noted in the context of Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), where it is enriched in MODY patients, though specific associations with diseases are not provided (MosconaNissan2024Whole).
