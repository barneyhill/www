# ORAI3

## Overview
ORAI3 is a gene that encodes the ORAI calcium release-activated calcium modulator 3, a protein that is integral to the function of calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. These channels are essential for calcium signaling, a critical process in various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, immune response, and cell proliferation. The ORAI3 protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein, featuring four transmembrane domains that contribute to its role in forming the channel's pore structure. ORAI3 is known for its ability to heteromerize with other ORAI isoforms, such as ORAI1 and ORAI2, to form functional CRAC channels, which are activated by the depletion of calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (Tiffner2021IsoformSpecific; Yoast2020The). The gene's expression and the protein's function have been implicated in various physiological processes and pathophysiological conditions, including cancer, where it may serve as a potential therapeutic target (SanchezCollado2021Role; Dubois2021ORAI3).

## Structure
The ORAI3 protein is a member of the ORAI family, which forms calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. Structurally, ORAI3 is composed of four transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4), with TM1 forming the pore region of the channel. The TM1 domain is conserved across ORAI isoforms, while TM2, TM3, and TM4 share about 80% sequence identity, contributing to the distinct functional properties of each isoform (Tiffner2021Transmembrane). The pore region is lined by TM1 residues, with TM2 and TM3 surrounding it, and TM4 forming an additional ring (Tiffner2021Transmembrane).

ORAI3 can exist in different oligomeric states depending on the activation stimulus. Under resting conditions, ORAI3 predominantly forms dimers. When activated by C-STIM1, it transitions to a tetrameric state, forming a Ca2+-selective pore. However, when activated by 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate (2-APB), ORAI3 remains in a dimeric state, forming a nonselective cation pore (Demuro2011Subunit).

The transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) plays a crucial role in the channel's activity, with specific mutations affecting its function. Increased hydrophobicity in TM3 can reduce the constitutive activity of ORAI3, highlighting the importance of this domain in regulating the channel's function (Tiffner2021Transmembrane).

## Function
ORAI3 is a protein that plays a significant role in calcium signaling within healthy human cells. It is part of the ORAI family, which forms calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, crucial for various cellular functions. ORAI3, along with ORAI1 and ORAI2, contributes to the formation of these channels by heteromerizing with STIM1, a process essential for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (Tiffner2021IsoformSpecific; Yoast2020The). 

In terms of molecular activity, ORAI3 exhibits a high level of fast calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI), which serves as a negative feedback mechanism to limit calcium entry, thereby contributing to the diversity of calcium signaling events (Yoast2020The). ORAI3 is also involved in store-independent calcium entry pathways, such as the arachidonate-regulated calcium (ARC) entry, highlighting its versatility in calcium regulation (Motiani2013Emerging).

ORAI3 is active in various tissues, including the brain, heart, lung, kidney, and skeletal muscle, where it fine-tunes immune cell responses and muscle function (Tiffner2021IsoformSpecific). It plays a role in maintaining cellular functions like proliferation and migration, and its activity is crucial for proper heart function and immune responses (Tiffner2021IsoformSpecific).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ORAI3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ORAI3 is overexpressed, and its silencing leads to reduced cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor growth and survival (Arora2021Orai3; Dubois2021ORAI3). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ORAI3 overexpression is associated with poorer survival and contributes to cisplatin resistance by enriching cancer stem cell populations (SanchezCollado2021Role). In prostate cancer, increased ORAI3 expression promotes cell proliferation through the formation of store-independent ARC channels, which are activated by arachidonic acid (SanchezCollado2021Role).

In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subtypes, ORAI3 is highly expressed and contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation and migration. Its expression is regulated by estrogen receptor α, and its knockdown reduces tumor growth and invasion (Motiani2012Orai3; SanchezCollado2021Role). ORAI3 also plays a role in hypoxia responses in certain breast cancer subtypes, affecting processes related to cell migration and immune responses (Azimi2019ORAI1). These findings highlight ORAI3 as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
ORAI3 is involved in various interactions that are crucial for its function in calcium signaling. It forms part of the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel complex by interacting with STIM1, a protein that senses calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum. This interaction facilitates calcium entry into the cell (Yoast2020The). ORAI3 can heteromerize with other ORAI isoforms, such as ORAI1 and ORAI2, to form functional CRAC channels. These heteromeric channels are activated by modest store depletion and exhibit varying calcium-dependent inactivation strengths, with ORAI3 showing the highest inactivation (Yoast2020The).

ORAI3 also interacts with TRPC channels, forming stable complexes that enhance store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in cells overexpressing TRPC3 or TRPC6 (Liao2007Orai). In breast cancer cells, ORAI3 is implicated in tumorigenesis by contributing to SOCE-mediated signaling, where it acts as a negative regulator of ORAI1-mediated SOCE in certain cell types (Yoast2020The). These interactions highlight ORAI3's role in modulating calcium signaling pathways and its potential involvement in various physiological and pathophysiological processes.
