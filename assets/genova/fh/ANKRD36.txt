# ANKRD36

## Overview
ANKRD36 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 36 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are essential for various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal organization. The ANKRD36 protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it is believed to play a role in maintaining cellular structure and function, particularly through its involvement in cytoskeletal organization. This protein's interactions are crucial for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. While the precise molecular functions of ANKRD36 remain to be fully elucidated, its ability to interact with other proteins suggests a significant role in influencing cellular pathways and outcomes (Alanazi2023Investigations; Iqbal2021Integrated; Pan2022A).

## Function
ANKRD36 encodes a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat motifs, which are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are integral to various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal organization. The ANKRD36 protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it may contribute to maintaining cellular structure and function. Its role in the cytoplasm suggests involvement in organizing the cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. By participating in these processes, ANKRD36 likely plays a role in ensuring proper cellular function and stability. The specific molecular activities of ANKRD36, while not fully elucidated, are likely linked to its ability to interact with other proteins, thereby influencing cellular pathways and outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
The ANKRD36 gene has been identified as a significant biomarker in the progression of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), particularly in its advanced phases such as the accelerated and blast crisis phases. Mutations in ANKRD36, including c.1183_1184 delGC and c.1187_1188 dupTT, have been found exclusively in patients with advanced-phase CML, suggesting their role as early indicators of disease progression (Alanazi2023Investigations; Iqbal2021Integrated). These mutations lead to structural changes in the ANKRD36 protein, potentially affecting its interactions and contributing to the pathogenesis of CML (Iqbal2021Integrated).

Beyond CML, ANKRD36 is associated with various health conditions. It is upregulated in type 2 diabetes mellitus, correlating with chronic inflammation, and plays a role in diabetic kidney disease by influencing lipid metabolism and inflammation (Alanazi2023Investigations; Pan2022A). In hypertension, ANKRD36 interacts with YY1, affecting blood pressure regulation (Alanazi2023Investigations). The gene is also implicated in other cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma and proximal gastric cancer, where its expression is linked to poor survival and tumor growth (Iqbal2021Integrated). Despite these associations, specific leukemia-related mutations in ANKRD36 have not been found in databases like TCGA or cBioPortal (Iqbal2021Integrated).
