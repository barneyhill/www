# RBM47

## Overview
RBM47 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 47, a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA editing, splicing, and transcript stability. The protein is characterized by the presence of three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are essential for its RNA-binding activity and function in RNA processing (Fossat2014C; Vanharanta2014Loss). RBM47 is highly conserved across vertebrate species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Fossat2014C). Functionally, the protein plays a critical role in C to U RNA editing, alternative splicing, and transcriptional regulation, impacting cell fate decisions and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Vanharanta2014Loss; Radine2019The). Additionally, RBM47 has been implicated in cancer biology, acting as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, including colorectal and breast cancer, by influencing processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis (Rokavec2017Pan-cancer; Vanharanta2014Loss).

## Structure
RBM47 is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein characterized by the presence of three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for its RNA-binding activity (Fossat2014C; Vanharanta2014Loss). These RRMs are typical features of proteins involved in RNA processing, including RNA editing, splicing, and transcript stability (Vanharanta2014Loss). The protein is 64 kDa in size and is highly conserved across vertebrate species, with a 94.3% identity between mouse and human RBM47 (Fossat2014C).

The primary structure of RBM47 includes specific phenylalanine residues within the RRM domains, which are essential for its function. For instance, the phenylalanine residue at position 115 is critical for binding to pre-mRNA and regulating alternative splicing (Kim2019RBM47regulated). The secondary structure of RBM47 likely involves the typical alpha helices and beta sheets found in RRM domains, although specific details are not provided in the context.

RBM47 can form homodimers, which is an aspect of its quaternary structure, but it does not form heterodimers with its isoforms (Kim2019RBM47regulated). The protein's ability to dimerize is important for its regulatory functions in alternative splicing (Kim2019RBM47regulated). RBM47 is expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes (Fossat2014C; Guo2022RBM47).

## Function
RBM47 (RNA binding motif protein 47) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various molecular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a critical role in C to U RNA editing, a post-transcriptional modification process essential for proper RNA function. RBM47 interacts with the deaminase APOBEC1 and can substitute for A1CF, facilitating the editing of Apob transcripts, which are crucial for lipid metabolism. This editing activity is particularly significant in tissues like the liver and small intestine, where RBM47 is highly expressed (Fossat2014C).

RBM47 also regulates cell fate decisions by controlling the p53-p21 axis at the transcriptional level. It enhances p53 promoter activity, thereby increasing p53 and p21 expression, which are vital for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Radine2019The).

In addition to its role in RNA editing and transcriptional regulation, RBM47 influences alternative splicing by binding to intronic regions near splice sites, affecting exon inclusion and exclusion. This activity underscores its involvement in pre-mRNA processing and highlights its broad impact on RNA metabolism (Vanharanta2014Loss). RBM47 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, reflecting its diverse roles in RNA processing and regulation (Fossat2014C).

## Clinical Significance
RBM47 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In colorectal cancer (CRC), down-regulation of RBM47 is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, leading to poor patient survival (Rokavec2017Pan-cancer). The gene's expression is repressed by EMT-inducers such as STAT3, SNAIL, and TGF-β, contributing to CRC progression (Rokavec2017Pan-cancer).

In breast cancer, RBM47 acts as a suppressor by stabilizing mRNAs like DKK1, a Wnt signaling antagonist. Loss of RBM47 function is linked to increased metastatic potential, particularly in claudin-low and basal subtypes, which are associated with poor outcomes (Vanharanta2014Loss). Mutations in RBM47, such as the I281fs mutation, have been identified in metastatic breast cancer, further supporting its role in inhibiting metastasis (Vanharanta2014Loss).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RBM47 inhibits tumor progression by regulating UPF1, a known tumor suppressor, through mRNA stability and expression (Guo2022RBM47). Its expression is also decreased in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and osteosarcoma, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis (Li2023A; Qin2022RBM47SNHG5FOXO3).

## Interactions
RBM47 is known to participate in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and regulation. It interacts with the deaminase APOBEC1 and the RNA-binding protein A1CF as part of the editosome complex, which is responsible for C to U RNA editing. RBM47 can substitute for A1CF in this complex, facilitating APOBEC1-mediated editing of Apob transcripts (Fossat2014C).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), RBM47 interacts with the splicing factor hnRNPM. This interaction is mediated through specific RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) in both proteins, and they colocalize in cells. The interaction suggests a cooperative role in regulating alternative splicing events associated with tumor progression (Xu2021RNAbinding).

RBM47 also binds to AXIN1 mRNA in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), stabilizing it and inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is crucial for tumor progression (Shen2020The). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RBM47 interacts with UPF1, a known tumor suppressor, by binding to its 3'UTR and enhancing its mRNA stability (Guo2022RBM47). These interactions highlight RBM47's multifaceted role in RNA regulation and cancer biology.
