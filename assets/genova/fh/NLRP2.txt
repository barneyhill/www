# NLRP2

## Overview
NLRP2 is a gene that encodes the NLR family pyrin domain containing 2 protein, which is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family. This protein is characterized by its tripartite domain structure, including an N-terminal pyrin domain, a central NACHT domain, and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats, which are integral to its role in immune response regulation (Le2013Pyrin). NLRP2 is primarily involved in the formation of inflammasomes, which are multiprotein complexes that activate inflammatory caspases and cytokines, such as IL-1β, in response to pathogenic stimuli (Hu2016Structural). Additionally, NLRP2 functions as a negative regulator of type I interferon signaling and modulates NF-κB activity, highlighting its role in maintaining immune homeostasis and influencing inflammatory pathways (Rossi2019NLRP2; Yang2018NLRP2). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with reproductive and developmental disorders, as well as its involvement in various immune-inflammatory conditions (Basingab2021The; Mu2019Mutations).

## Structure
The NLRP2 protein is a member of the NLR family, characterized by a tripartite domain structure. It includes an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD), a central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT), and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (Le2013Pyrin). The PYD is involved in protein-protein interactions, crucial for forming inflammasomes, which are multimeric protein complexes that activate inflammatory caspases (Hu2016Structural). The NACHT domain is essential for ATP binding and oligomerization, containing conserved nucleotide-binding motifs that are critical for its function (Maharana2018Deciphering). The LRRs are involved in ligand sensing and are a common feature in proteins that participate in immune responses (Le2013Pyrin).

The NLRP2 protein is expressed in various tissues, including neural astrocytes, where it forms an inflammasome complex with the adaptor protein ASC and caspase-1 (Basingab2021The). This complex is activated by extracellular ATP, leading to the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β (Minkiewicz2013Human). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity of NLRP2, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The NLRP2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, which plays a crucial role in regulating inflammatory and immune responses. NLRP2 functions as a negative regulator of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-mediated type I interferon (IFN) signaling. It interacts directly with TBK1, disrupting its interaction with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), thereby interfering with TBK1-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and subsequent IFN production. This suggests that NLRP2 helps maintain immune homeostasis during viral infections by modulating the IFN signaling cascade (Yang2018NLRP2).

NLRP2 is also involved in the formation of inflammasomes, multiprotein complexes that activate inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β. In human astrocytes, the NLRP2 inflammasome is activated by ATP, leading to the processing of inflammatory procaspase-1 into its active form and the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18, which are crucial for the innate immune response (Minkiewicz2013Human).

Additionally, NLRP2 has been shown to regulate NF-κB signaling, with conflicting reports on whether it acts as a positive or negative regulator. It is involved in proinflammatory and antiapoptotic responses, particularly in proximal tubular epithelial cells, where it enhances NF-κB activity and suppresses apoptosis (Rossi2019NLRP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NLRP2 gene have been linked to several reproductive and developmental disorders. In humans, mutations in NLRP2 are associated with female infertility characterized by early embryonic arrest, often observed in patients undergoing assisted reproductive technologies like IVF and ICSI (Mu2019Mutations). These mutations can lead to decreased protein expression, resulting in early embryonic arrest (Mu2019Mutations). NLRP2 is also implicated in multilocus imprinting disturbance (MLID), which can cause recurrent pregnancy loss and developmental disabilities in offspring (Mahadevan2017Maternally).

NLRP2 mutations have been identified in familial cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS), a disorder characterized by fetal overgrowth and predisposition to embryonic tumors. These mutations are associated with epimutations at imprinted loci, such as IC2 (KvDMR1), which are known causes of BWS (Meyer2009Germline). The gene's role in genomic imprinting and methylation is suggested to contribute to the development of BWS (Meyer2009Germline).

Altered expression of NLRP2 is also linked to immune-inflammatory responses and neurological disorders. It is involved in regulating pro-inflammatory signaling and cytokine production, impacting conditions like axial spondyloarthropathy and potentially contributing to neurological conditions such as stroke and autism spectrum disorder (Basingab2021The).

## Interactions
NLRP2 is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in immune response regulation. It forms part of the inflammasome complex, interacting with proteins such as ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and caspase-1. This complex is activated by ATP and is involved in the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18 in human astrocytes (Minkiewicz2013Human).

NLRP2 also interacts with the IKK complex, specifically IKKα, to modulate NF-κB activity. This interaction affects the phosphorylation of NF-κB subunits, such as p65, influencing cytokine production and inflammatory responses in proximal tubular epithelial cells (Rossi2019NLRP2).

In antiviral immunity, NLRP2 acts as a negative regulator by interacting with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). This interaction disrupts the TBK1-IRF3 complex, inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation and subsequent interferon production, thus modulating the immune response to viral infections (Yang2018NLRP2).

These interactions highlight NLRP2's role in regulating both pro-inflammatory and antiviral pathways, contributing to its involvement in various diseases and immune responses.
