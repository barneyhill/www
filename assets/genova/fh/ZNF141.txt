# ZNF141

## Overview
ZNF141 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 141, a member of the C2-H2 (Krüppel) family of zinc finger proteins. This protein is characterized by its ten zinc finger motifs and a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is known for its role in transcriptional repression (Ali2022Structural; Vissing1995Repression). Zinc finger protein 141 is involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, playing a significant role in modulating gene expression across various human tissues, including the brain, liver, and testis (Ali2022Structural). The protein's function is critical for normal cellular processes and development, with mutations in ZNF141 linked to developmental disorders such as postaxial polydactyly type A (Kalsoom2012Whole). Additionally, alterations in ZNF141 expression have been associated with certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both developmental biology and oncology (Wang2021The; Gaykalova2015Outlier).

## Function
ZNF141 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. It is part of the C2-H2 (Krüppel) family of zinc finger proteins, characterized by ten zinc finger motifs and a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which includes box A and box B subdomains (Ali2022Structural; Vissing1995Repression). The KRAB domain is a potent transcriptional repression domain, mediating interactions with DNA and other proteins to modulate transcription (Vissing1995Repression).

ZNF141 is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, kidney, lungs, liver, pancreas, placenta, spleen, skeletal muscle, and testis, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Ali2022Structural). The protein is involved in the repression of RNA Polymerase II and III promoters, as well as RNA binding and splicing, contributing to normal cellular processes and development (Ali2022Structural). The KRAB domain of ZNF141 is noted for its transcriptional repression activity, which is essential for regulating gene expression in healthy human cells (Vissing1995Repression). Mutations in ZNF141, such as the T474I variant, have been linked to developmental disorders, underscoring its importance in normal development (Ali2022Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF141 gene have been linked to postaxial polydactyly type A (PAPA), a congenital disorder characterized by the presence of extra digits on the hands or feet. Specifically, a missense mutation, c.1421C>T, resulting in an amino acid change from threonine to isoleucine (T474I), has been identified as a cause of this condition. This mutation leads to structural changes in the ZNF141 protein, affecting its stability and function, which are crucial for normal limb development (Ali2022Structural; Kalsoom2012Whole). The mutation is located in a highly conserved region of the protein, and its pathogenicity has been supported by various computational predictions (Ali2022Structural).

Alterations in the expression of ZNF141 have also been associated with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), where the gene is found to be upregulated. This suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of this type of lymphoma, highlighting the importance of ZNF141 in cancer biology (Wang2021The). Additionally, ZNF141 has been identified as a candidate gene with significant methylation changes in head and neck cancer, indicating its potential involvement in tumorigenesis through epigenetic modifications (Gaykalova2015Outlier).
