# NPIPA3

## Overview
The NPIPA3 gene encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member A3, which is part of a family of proteins involved in the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport. This protein is associated with the nuclear pore complex, a critical structure that facilitates the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Although the specific functions of NPIPA3 are not fully elucidated, proteins in this family are generally implicated in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity and regulating gene expression by modulating the transport of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. The NPIPA3 protein is categorized as a nuclear pore complex-associated protein, and its interactions and functions are of interest in understanding cellular transport mechanisms and their implications in various diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
