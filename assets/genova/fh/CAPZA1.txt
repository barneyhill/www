# CAPZA1

## Overview
CAPZA1 is a gene that encodes the capping actin protein of muscle Z-line subunit alpha 1, a critical component of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein functions as a capping protein, specifically binding to the barbed ends of actin filaments to regulate their polymerization and dynamics. Such regulation is essential for maintaining cellular processes like cell shape, motility, and division, particularly in muscle cells where it contributes to muscle contraction and structural integrity (Avenarius2017Heterodimeric; Lu2022FAM21C). CAPZA1 is also involved in auditory function by regulating the structure of stereocilia in cochlear and utricle hair cells. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as FAM21C and LRP1-ICD, further underscore its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and its potential implications in cancer progression and other diseases (Lu2022FAM21C; Tsugawa2018CAPZA1).

## Function
CAPZA1 encodes the alpha subunit of the capping protein complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating actin filament dynamics by binding to the barbed ends of actin filaments, thereby preventing further polymerization. This regulation is essential for maintaining the structure and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for various cellular processes, including cell shape, motility, and division (Lu2022FAM21C). In healthy cells, CAPZA1 is involved in the prolongation of F-actin, which is critical for maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton (Lu2022FAM21C).

CAPZA1 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in muscle cells, where it contributes to muscle contraction and structural integrity. It is also involved in the regulation of stereocilia length and width in cochlear and utricle hair cells, which are essential for auditory function (Avenarius2017Heterodimeric). The protein's capping function is crucial for preventing excessive actin polymerization, thereby maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing the malignant progression of diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma (Lu2022FAM21C). CAPZA1's role in actin filament capping is shared with other subunits like CAPZA2, suggesting potential functional overlap in maintaining cytoskeletal stability (Huang2020Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAPZA1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CAPZA1 is shown to inhibit cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of CAPZA1 in HepG2 cells enhances these properties, while overexpression in MHCC97H cells reduces them. In vivo studies demonstrate that CAPZA1 overexpression leads to fewer metastases and longer survival, suggesting its role in inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by regulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling (Huang2017CAPZA1). Conversely, low expression of CAPZA1 in HCC tissues is associated with increased invasion and migration due to actin cytoskeleton remodeling, driven by interactions with FAM21C (Lu2022FAM21C).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), high CAPZA1 expression correlates with worse overall survival and is linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints, suggesting a role in tumor immune escape (Qin2023NcRNAregulated). In gastric cancer, CAPZA1 overexpression is associated with the inhibition of autophagy, leading to the accumulation of oncogenic factors like CagA, which may increase cancer risk (Tsugawa2018CAPZA1). Genetic polymorphisms in CAPZA1 have also been linked to gastric mucosal atrophy in the context of Helicobacter pylori infection (Yamaguchi2023Polymorphism).

## Interactions
CAPZA1, a capping protein of the actin cytoskeleton, participates in several significant protein interactions. It interacts with actin filaments, playing a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics by capping the barbed ends of actin filaments, which is essential for regulating actin polymerization and cellular processes such as cell motility and muscle contraction (Huang2017CAPZA1).

CAPZA1 is known to interact with FAM21C, a subunit of the WASH complex, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This interaction inhibits the capping ability of CAPZA1, promoting actin filament polymerization and cytoskeleton remodeling, which enhances the invasion and migration of HCC cells (Lu2022FAM21C).

In the context of Helicobacter pylori infection, CAPZA1 interacts with the LRP1-ICD, a nuclear protein, to regulate the expression of LAMP1, a lysosomal-associated membrane protein. This interaction is crucial for the suppression of LAMP1 expression, affecting autolysosome formation and potentially influencing gastric carcinogenesis (Tsugawa2018CAPZA1).

CAPZA1 also forms a heterodimer with the beta subunit of the capping protein complex, CAPZB, which is involved in actin filament stabilization and dynamics (Santio2020PIM1). These interactions highlight CAPZA1's role in various cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer progression.
