Nuclear receptors have been shown to regulate pathways involved in embryonic development, as well as in maintenance of proper cell function in adults. Members of this family are characterized by discrete domains that function in DNA and ligand binding. This gene encodes a retinal nuclear receptor that is a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Defects in this gene are a cause of enhanced S cone syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.
