# CCNA1

## Overview
Cyclin A1 is a protein encoded by the CCNA1 gene, belonging to the cyclin family, which is integral to cell cycle regulation. As a regulatory protein, cyclin A1 primarily functions by forming complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases, notably CDK2, to facilitate transitions between the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. This protein is predominantly expressed in the testes, where it plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis and meiotic cell cycle progression. Cyclin A1 is also involved in DNA repair processes, particularly in the non-homologous end-joining pathway, by interacting with proteins such as Ku70. Its expression is tissue-specific, with significant implications in various cancers, where its altered expression and interactions contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Vocca2012CCNA1; He2019Cyclin; Leung2020Evaluation).

## Structure
Cyclin A1 (CCNA1) is a member of the cyclin family, characterized by a conserved cyclin box domain, which is crucial for its function in cell cycle regulation. The primary structure of cyclin A1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Vocca2012CCNA1).

The tertiary structure of cyclin A1 forms a compact, globular shape, which is typical for proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. This structure allows cyclin A1 to interact with other proteins, such as CDK2, forming a quaternary structure that is essential for its role in cell cycle progression and DNA repair (Vocca2012CCNA1).

Cyclin A1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and stability. These modifications are important for its function in meiosis and spermatogenesis (Vocca2012CCNA1).

There are three transcript variants of cyclin A1: isoform 'a' is the longest, isoform 'b' has an alternate splice site resulting in a protein 1 amino acid shorter, and isoform 'c' has a distinct 5' UTR and a 44 amino acid shorter N-terminus (Vocca2012CCNA1). These isoforms may have different roles or regulatory mechanisms in various tissues and conditions.

## Function
Cyclin A1, encoded by the CCNA1 gene, is a crucial regulator of the cell cycle, particularly involved in the G1/S and G2/M phase transitions. It forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases, primarily CDK2, to facilitate these transitions, which are essential for cell cycle progression and DNA replication (Vocca2012CCNA1; He2019Cyclin). Cyclin A1 is predominantly expressed in the testes, where it plays a significant role in spermatogenesis by regulating meiotic cell cycle progression (Liu1998Cyclin; Leung2020Evaluation).

In healthy human cells, cyclin A1 is localized in the nucleus and is involved in DNA double-strand break repair, a critical process for maintaining genomic stability. It competes with CDK2-cyclin A2 for binding to Ku70, a key component of the non-homologous end-joining repair pathway, thereby facilitating DNA repair (Vocca2012CCNA1). Cyclin A1 also modulates cell survival pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, promoting cell survival in response to growth factors (Vocca2012CCNA1).

Cyclin A1's expression is tissue-specific, with high levels in the testis and lower levels in other tissues, including the brain. Its role in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair is crucial for normal cellular function and organismal fertility (Vocca2012CCNA1; van2004Cyclin).

## Clinical Significance
Cyclin A1 (CCNA1) is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In cervical cancer, CCNA1 methylation is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cervical cancer screening, especially when combined with high-risk HPV testing (Yang2009Methylation). In prostate cancer, overexpression of CCNA1 is associated with increased tumor invasion and metastasis, correlating with proteins like VEGF, MMP2, and MMP9, and enhancing androgen receptor-mediated gene activation (Wegiel2008Multiple). In breast cancer, elevated CCNA1 levels correlate with VEGF expression and increased invasiveness, indicating its role in tumor progression (Syed2013Cyclin).

In oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), CCNA1 is upregulated, correlating with tumor invasiveness and poor prognosis, making it a potential prognostic biomarker (He2019Cyclin). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), CCNA1 hypermethylation is linked to an increased risk of second primary tumors, supporting its role in field cancerization (Rettori2013TIMP3). In papillary thyroid carcinoma, CCNA1 is overexpressed, driven by PITX2, contributing to tumor cell proliferation (Liu2013Cyclin).

## Interactions
Cyclin A1 (CCNA1) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins that regulate the cell cycle and other cellular processes. It forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), which is essential for spermatogenesis and contributes to leukemogenesis. This complex also plays a role in DNA double-strand break repair by competing with CDK2-cyclin A2 for binding to Ku70, a key component of the non-homologous end-joining repair pathway (Vocca2012CCNA1). Cyclin A1 interacts with E2F1 and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), influencing cell cycle progression and apoptosis regulation in leukemia cells (Vocca2012CCNA1).

In the context of cancer, cyclin A1 interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) to bind to VEGF and MMP2 promoters, enhancing their expression and contributing to prostate cancer invasion (Vocca2012CCNA1). The deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a can bind cyclin A1, preventing its ubiquitination and degradation, which leads to cyclin A1 accumulation and increased cell proliferation in bladder cancer cells (Vocca2012CCNA1).

Cyclin A1 is also regulated by the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) protein, which binds to the CCNA1 promoter, influencing its expression in leukemia cells (Pandey2019WT1). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of CCNA1 expression and may affect leukemia cell proliferation (Pandey2019WT1).
