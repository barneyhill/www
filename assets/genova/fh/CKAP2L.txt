# CKAP2L

## Overview
CKAP2L, or cytoskeleton-associated protein 2-like, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the regulation of cell division, particularly during mitosis. The CKAP2L protein is a crucial component of the mitotic spindle apparatus, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation and genomic stability. It is categorized as a structural protein due to its involvement in the organization of microtubules and its localization to key cellular structures such as the centrosome and spindle poles. Disruptions in CKAP2L function can lead to genomic instability, which is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and genetic disorders like Filippi syndrome. The protein's interactions with other cell cycle regulators and its role in cancer progression underscore its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Liu2023Prognostic; Li2020CKAP2L).

## Structure


## Function
The CKAP2L gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in cell division, particularly during the mitotic phases. It is a component of the mitotic spindle, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis (Li2020CKAP2L). CKAP2L is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, especially at the G2/M checkpoint, ensuring the correct progression of cells through mitosis (Li2020CKAP2L). The protein is located in the centrosome, spindle, midbody, and spindle pole, highlighting its involvement in the structural organization necessary for cell division (Upregulation; Xiong2019&lt; p&gt).

In healthy human cells, CKAP2L is crucial for the division of neural progenitor cells, where it helps maintain genomic stability by preventing the formation of multipolar spindles and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation (Upregulation; Xiong2019&lt; p&gt). The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of microtubules, which are vital for maintaining cell structure and facilitating cell division (Jeon2006A). Disruptions in CKAP2L function can lead to genomic instability, which may affect cellular and organismal health, underscoring its importance in normal cellular processes (Li2020CKAP2L).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CKAP2L gene are primarily associated with Filippi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by growth retardation, microcephaly, intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and syndactyly. These mutations lead to defects in spindle organization, such as mitotic spindle defects, lagging chromosomes, and chromatin bridges, which are critical for normal cell division (Liu2023Prognostic; Karakaya2021Identification).

In cancer, CKAP2L is often overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis across various tumor types, including prostate cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Its elevated expression is associated with tumor progression, increased cell proliferation, and metastasis. In prostate cancer, CKAP2L is a target of miR-326, and its knockdown reduces tumor growth and cell proliferation (Li2022CKAP2L). In lung adenocarcinoma, CKAP2L promotes cancer progression by affecting the MAPK signaling pathway (Upregulation; Xiong2019&lt; p&gt). In ccRCC, CKAP2L is linked to advanced clinical stages and poor survival outcomes, potentially through the activation of signaling pathways like JAK-STAT and WNT (Liu2023Prognostic).

CKAP2L's role in the tumor immune microenvironment is also significant, as its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and immunotherapy markers, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response (Yi2023Pancancer).

## Interactions
CKAP2L is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in cell cycle regulation and cancer progression. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CKAP2L is suggested to interact with proteins such as CDK1, CDCA8, BUB1, and KIF20A, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor proliferation (Liu2023Prognostic). These interactions may influence tumor cell proliferation by affecting mitotic processes.

In prostate cancer, CKAP2L is a direct target of miR-326, a microRNA that binds to the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of CKAP2L mRNA, exerting a carcinostatic effect. This interaction leads to reduced expression of genes involved in the mitotic cell cycle, including cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclins (Li2022CKAP2L). The miR-326/CKAP2L axis is shown to induce cell cycle G2/M arrest, affecting chromosome segregation and spindle assembly (Li2022CKAP2L).

In ovarian cancer, CKAP2L expression is regulated by IGF2BP2, which enhances CKAP2L protein translation in an m6A-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the oncogenic effects of IGF2BP2, as silencing CKAP2L reduces these effects (Xu2022IGF2BP2). These interactions highlight CKAP2L's role in cancer progression through its involvement in cell cycle and mitotic regulation.
