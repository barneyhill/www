# CDH23

## Overview
CDH23 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 23, a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is integral to calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion processes. Cadherin 23 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its extensive extracellular domain composed of 27 cadherin repeats, which are crucial for its role in mechanotransduction within the inner ear. This protein forms part of the tip-link complex in hair cells, essential for converting mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals, a process vital for hearing and balance (Jaiganesh2018Zooming; Siemens2004Cadherin). The interaction of cadherin 23 with protocadherin 15, stabilized by calcium ions, is fundamental to its function. Mutations in the CDH23 gene are linked to auditory and visual disorders, including Usher syndrome type 1D and nonsyndromic hearing loss, underscoring its importance in sensory function and cellular integrity (Ramzan2020Identification; Mizutari2015High).

## Structure
The CDH23 protein is a member of the cadherin superfamily, characterized by its role in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. It consists of 27 extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats and a non-canonical 28th domain, forming a significant portion of the tip-link filament in hair cells, which is crucial for mechanotransduction in the inner ear (Jaiganesh2018Zooming). Each EC repeat is approximately 110 residues long, and the entire ectodomain spans about 3,000 residues. The linker regions between these repeats are highly conserved and bind calcium ions, essential for the protein's function (Jaiganesh2018Zooming).

The N-terminal end of CDH23 exhibits a typical cadherin fold with canonical calcium-binding sites, while the protein's structure is notably stiff, suggesting limited elasticity, which is important for force conveyance to the hair-cell transduction channel (Jaiganesh2018Zooming). The EC1-EC2 domains of CDH23 interact with protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) through a unique mechanism involving polar amino acids that bind calcium ions, distinct from the classical strand-swap binding mode of other cadherins (Elledge2010Structure).

CDH23 is anchored to the cell membrane via a transmembrane helix and a cytosolic domain, which interacts with various proteins involved in the transport and localization of the transduction apparatus (Jaiganesh2018Zooming). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Jaiganesh2018Zooming).

## Function
The CDH23 gene encodes cadherin 23, a protein that plays a critical role in the mechanotransduction process in the inner ear, which is essential for hearing and balance. Cadherin 23 is a component of the tip link, an extracellular filament that connects the tips of stereocilia in hair cells. This structure is crucial for gating mechanotransduction channels in response to mechanical stimuli such as sound waves, thereby converting them into electrochemical signals (Elledge2010Structure; Siemens2004Cadherin). 

Cadherin 23 interacts with protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) to form these tip links, and this interaction is stabilized by calcium ions, which are essential for maintaining the rigidity and proper function of the complex (Elledge2010Structure; Sotomayor2012Structure). Mutations in CDH23 can disrupt its interaction with PCDH15, leading to hearing impairments (Elledge2010Structure).

In addition to its role in the inner ear, cadherin 23 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial tissues through strong cell-cell adhesion, mediated by homophilic interactions. This function is important for suppressing metastasis in certain cancers (Singaraju2019Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDH23 gene are associated with several auditory and visual disorders. Usher syndrome type 1D (USH1D) is a condition characterized by congenital hearing loss and progressive vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa. This syndrome is typically caused by nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations in CDH23, which result in a truncated protein (Zhang2020Targeted; Mizutari2015High). Nonsyndromic hearing loss, specifically DFNB12, is another condition linked to CDH23 mutations. DFNB12 is usually associated with missense mutations that lead to severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss, often with congenital or prelingual onset (Miyagawa2012Prevalence; Ramzan2020Identification).

CDH23 mutations have also been implicated in age-related and noise-induced hearing loss, although the mechanisms are not fully understood (Usami2022Variants). Additionally, germline mutations in CDH23 have been linked to familial and sporadic pituitary adenomas, suggesting a broader role for this gene in disease pathogenesis beyond sensory impairments (Zhang2017Germline). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its critical role in maintaining normal sensory and cellular functions.

## Interactions
CDH23 interacts with several proteins, forming critical complexes in the inner ear. It forms a heterotetrameric complex with protocadherin-15 (PCDH15) to create tip links in hair cells, essential for mechanotransduction. This interaction involves CDH23 homodimers interacting in trans with PCDH15 homodimers, with the extracellular cadherin (EC) domains playing a crucial role (Pan2012Structures; Elledge2010Structure; Jaiganesh2018Zooming).

CDH23 also interacts with harmonin through PDZ-domain interactions. The cytoplasmic tail of CDH23 contains PDZ-binding motifs that bind to the PDZ2 domain of harmonin, anchoring it to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is crucial for the stability of the cadherin 23/harmonin complex, which is part of the upper tip-link density (UTLD) protein complex in stereocilia (Siemens2002The; Pan2012Structures).

Additionally, CDH23 interacts with MAGI-1, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein, through its C-terminal PDZ-binding site. This interaction is mediated by the PDZ4 domain of MAGI-1, suggesting that MAGI-1 could replace harmonin's PDZ2 binding at CDH23's C terminus, providing a connection with the cytoskeleton (Xu2008MAGI-1).
