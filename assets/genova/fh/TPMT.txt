# TPMT

## Overview
Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is a gene that encodes the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase, which is a cytosolic methyltransferase involved in the metabolism of thiopurine drugs. These drugs, including azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and 6-thioguanine, are commonly used in the treatment of leukemia, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory bowel diseases (MlinaricRascan2012SAdenosylmethionine:; Evans2004Pharmacogenetics). The TPMT enzyme catalyzes the S-methylation of thiopurine drugs, converting them into inactive metabolites, thus modulating their therapeutic and toxic effects (Derijks2010Pharmacogenetics). Genetic polymorphisms in the TPMT gene result in variable enzyme activity among individuals, which can significantly influence drug efficacy and the risk of adverse reactions (Tai1997Enhanced; Evans2004Pharmacogenetics). Understanding the genetic variations in TPMT is crucial for personalized medicine, as it allows for the optimization of thiopurine therapy to enhance treatment outcomes and minimize toxicity (Evans2001Preponderance; Franca2021Understanding).

## Structure
Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is an enzyme with a complex molecular structure that includes primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary elements. The primary structure of TPMT is encoded by the TPMT gene, which can undergo genetic polymorphisms leading to various isoforms that affect enzyme activity (Wu2007Structural). The secondary structure of TPMT features a classic Class-I methyltransferase fold, characterized by a nine-stranded beta-sheet and several helices (Wu2007Structural). This structure is crucial for its function in catalyzing the S-methylation of thiopurine drugs.

The tertiary structure of TPMT forms a globular protein, and the enzyme exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, influenced by factors such as protein concentration and the presence of reducing agents (Wu2007Structural). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is significant for its enzymatic activity.

TPMT contains a Rossmann fold, a common motif for binding cofactors like S-adenosylmethionine, which is essential for its methyltransferase activity (Wu2007Structural). Variants such as TPMT*3A, *3B, and *3C can lead to misfolding and aggregation, affecting the enzyme's stability and function (Wang2005Human). These structural insights are critical for understanding the enzyme's role in drug metabolism and the impact of genetic variations.

## Function
Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of thiopurine drugs, such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), and 6-thioguanine, which are used in the treatment of leukemia, inflammatory bowel diseases, and as immunosuppressants (MlinaricRascan2012SAdenosylmethionine:; Evans2004Pharmacogenetics). TPMT catalyzes the S-methylation of these drugs, converting them into inactive metabolites like 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP), thereby reducing their cytotoxic potential (MlinaricRascan2012SAdenosylmethionine:; Derijks2010Pharmacogenetics).

The enzyme's activity is characterized by genetic polymorphisms, resulting in varying levels of TPMT activity among individuals. This variation affects the balance between active and inactive metabolites, influencing drug efficacy and toxicity (Tai1997Enhanced; Evans2004Pharmacogenetics). In healthy human cells, TPMT activity is crucial for preventing the accumulation of toxic thioguanine nucleotides, which can lead to hematopoietic toxicity (Tai1997Enhanced; Evans2004Pharmacogenetics).

TPMT activity is also regulated by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which stabilizes the enzyme and enhances its function, thereby modulating the cytotoxic effects of thiopurine drugs (MlinaricRascan2012SAdenosylmethionine:; Milek2009Sadenosylmethionine). Understanding TPMT's role in drug metabolism is essential for optimizing thiopurine therapy and preventing adverse drug reactions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TPMT gene, which encodes the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase, have significant clinical implications due to their impact on the metabolism of thiopurine drugs. These drugs, including mercaptopurine and azathioprine, are used in the treatment of various conditions such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Evans2001Preponderance; Saxena2022A). Genetic polymorphisms in TPMT lead to variations in enzyme activity, categorized into high, intermediate, and deficient methylators, which affect drug detoxification and therapeutic efficacy (Spire‐Vayron1998Genotypic).

Patients with TPMT deficiency, often due to mutations such as TPMT*2 and TPMT*3A, are at increased risk of severe hematopoietic toxicity when treated with standard doses of thiopurine drugs. This is because low TPMT activity results in the accumulation of cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides, leading to myelosuppression and other toxicities (Tai1997Enhanced; Evans2001Preponderance). Heterozygous individuals have an intermediate risk of toxicity, necessitating careful management of thiopurine therapy (Franca2021Understanding). Genotyping for TPMT variants is crucial in clinical settings to tailor drug dosages and prevent adverse effects, highlighting the importance of personalized medicine approaches in optimizing treatment outcomes (Evans2001Preponderance; Franca2021Understanding).

## Interactions
Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) interacts with various substrates and co-factors, playing a crucial role in the metabolism of thiopurine drugs. One significant interaction is with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which acts as a methyl donor in the methylation process catalyzed by TPMT. This interaction is essential for the enzyme's function, as SAM binding induces conformational changes in TPMT, affecting its interaction with substrates like selenocysteine (Sec) and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) (Urbančič2019Methylation).

TPMT also interacts with S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a co-product of the methylation reaction, which can act as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. This interaction highlights the regulatory mechanisms controlling TPMT activity (Blissing2017Thiopurine).

Genetic polymorphisms in TPMT can alter its interactions and stability. For instance, the TPMT *3A variant, which includes mutations A154T and Y240C, shows altered interactions with SAM-binding residues, leading to structural deformation and increased solvent exposure of the thiopurine-binding site. These changes result in decreased enzymatic activity and stability, with the variant being rapidly degraded in vivo (Rutherford2008Four).

TPMT's interactions with substrates and co-factors are critical for its enzymatic function and are influenced by genetic variations that can impact drug metabolism and therapeutic outcomes.
