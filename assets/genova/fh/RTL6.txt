# RTL6

## Overview
RTL6 is a gene that encodes the protein retrotransposon Gag like 6, which is part of the Gag-like protein family. These proteins are typically involved in the structural assembly of retrotransposons, which are genetic elements that can move around and integrate into different locations within the genome. The RTL6 gene is expressed in various tissues, suggesting a potential role in cellular processes that require structural assembly or genomic rearrangement. Although the precise biological function of the RTL6-encoded protein remains to be fully elucidated, its classification as a Gag-like protein indicates a possible involvement in the regulation of genomic stability and expression. Further research is needed to clarify its interactions and clinical significance, as current understanding is limited.
