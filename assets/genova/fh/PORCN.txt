# PORCN

## Overview
The PORCN gene encodes the porcupine O-acyltransferase, a membrane-bound enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the Wnt signaling pathway. This enzyme is categorized as an O-acyltransferase and is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the post-translational modification of Wnt proteins through palmitoylation. This modification is crucial for the secretion and functional activity of Wnt proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and embryonic development. The PORCN protein's structure, characterized by multiple transmembrane helices, allows it to interact with substrates and inhibitors, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases where Wnt signaling is dysregulated. Mutations in the PORCN gene are linked to developmental disorders such as focal dermal hypoplasia, underscoring its essential role in normal physiological functions (Liu2012Deletion; Bostwick2019Focal; Liu2022Mechanisms).

## Structure
The PORCN protein is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident membrane-bound O-acyltransferase involved in the palmitoleoylation of Wnt proteins, a modification essential for Wnt signaling. Structurally, PORCN is characterized by 11 transmembrane helices (TMs) interspersed with 6 intervening α-helices (IH) and 2 β-strands. This configuration forms a complex structure that facilitates its enzymatic activity (Liu2022Mechanisms).

The tertiary structure of PORCN reveals two distinct cavities: a cytosolic cavity formed by TMs 7-10 for palmitoleoyl-CoA binding, and a lumenal cavity formed by TMs 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 for the Wnt ligand. A zinc ion is coordinated by residues in the cytosolic loop between TM9 and TM10, contributing to the protein's structural stability (Liu2022Mechanisms).

PORCN shares a similar fold with other members of the MBOAT family, such as DltB, HHAT, DGAT-1, and ACAT-1, with conserved acyl-CoA binding positions. Despite variations in the number of transmembrane helices among MBOATs, they all utilize six transmembrane helices to form a catalytic core for the acyl-transfer reaction (Liu2022Mechanisms).

The protein's interaction with inhibitors like LGK974, which occupies the palmitoleoyl-CoA binding site, highlights its potential as a target for cancer treatment by disrupting Wnt signaling (Liu2022Mechanisms).

## Function
The PORCN gene encodes the enzyme Porcupine, a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase that plays a critical role in the Wnt signaling pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the post-translational modification of Wnt proteins through the attachment of a palmitoleic acid to a serine residue, a process known as palmitoylation. This modification is essential for the secretion and activity of Wnt proteins, enabling them to bind to the carrier protein WLS and interact with Frizzled receptors on the cell surface (Proffitt2012Precise; Liu2022Mechanisms).

PORCN is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the transport of Wnt proteins to the cell surface, impacting cell proliferation, differentiation, and embryonic development (Liu2012Deletion). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the proper functioning of all Wnt pathways, as it regulates the secretion and signaling of Wnt ligands, which are vital for various physiological processes (Proffitt2012Precise; Liu2022Mechanisms).

Mutations in the PORCN gene can lead to developmental disorders such as focal dermal hypoplasia, highlighting its essential role in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (Yu2021Structural; Liu2012Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PORCN gene are primarily associated with focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH), also known as Goltz syndrome. This rare genetic disorder is characterized by developmental defects affecting the skin, skeleton, and eyes. Common features include atrophic and hypoplastic skin areas, nodular fat herniation, and limb malformations such as ectrodactyly, oligodactyly, and syndactyly. Ocular anomalies like anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and colobomas are also prevalent (Bornholdt2009PORCNmutations; Bostwick2019Focal). FDH is an X-linked dominant disorder, predominantly affecting females, as it is often lethal in hemizygous males, with surviving males typically being mosaic (Arlt2022Novel; Bostwick2019Focal).

The PORCN gene encodes a protein crucial for the secretion and function of Wnt proteins, which are essential for embryonic development. Mutations in PORCN disrupt Wnt signaling, leading to the phenotypic features of FDH (Barrott2011Deletion; Liu2012Deletion). In addition to FDH, PORCN mutations have been linked to other conditions such as the pentalogy of Cantrell and limb-body wall complex (Smigiel2011Co‐occurrence; Lombardi2011Mutation). The clinical presentation of these disorders can vary significantly due to factors like lyonization and postzygotic genomic mosaicism (Clements2009PORCNgene).

## Interactions
The PORCN protein interacts with several key proteins and inhibitors, playing a crucial role in the Wnt signaling pathway. PORCN facilitates the acylation of Wnt proteins, a modification essential for their signaling function. It interacts with palmitoleoyl-CoA, a substrate for Wnt acylation, through a specific binding site that includes residues such as Trp300 and His336, which stabilize the palmitoleoyl-CoA in a curled-up conformation (Liu2022Mechanisms). PORCN also interacts with the WNT3A protein, where specific residues form hydrophilic and hydrophobic contacts to bind WNT3A, and disulfide bonds help maintain the necessary structure for interaction (Liu2022Mechanisms).

The inhibitor LGK974 binds to the cytosolic pocket of PORCN, overlapping with the palmitoleoyl-CoA binding site, thus acting as a competitive inhibitor (Liu2022Mechanisms). PORCN also forms complexes with Fab 2C11, a mouse monoclonal anti-human PORCN antibody, which does not interfere with its activity (Liu2022Mechanisms). The structural model of PORCN reveals that it does not interact with nucleic acids, focusing instead on its interactions with Wnt proteins and inhibitors (Liu2022Mechanisms). These interactions are critical for the acylation process and the subsequent signaling activities of Wnt proteins.
