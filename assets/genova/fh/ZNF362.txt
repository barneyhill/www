# ZNF362

## Overview
ZNF362 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 362, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a significant role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling. ZNF362 is involved in cellular responses to environmental stimuli, such as engineered nanomaterials, and is implicated in processes like DNA repair and replication stress response. The protein's interaction with other chromatin-associated proteins, such as TOP2B, suggests its involvement in chromatin state transitions and transcriptional regulation during specific developmental phases, including human germline cell development. Despite its identified roles, the precise functions of ZNF362 in normal physiological conditions remain to be fully elucidated, with current research focusing on its response to external stressors and potential compensatory roles in genetic models (Srivastava2018Replisome; Li2017SingleCell; del2023An).

## Structure
ZNF362 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. The primary structure of ZNF362 is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, typical of zinc finger proteins, which facilitate the coordination of zinc ions necessary for maintaining the structural integrity of the zinc finger motifs. The secondary structure of ZNF362 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in proteins with zinc finger domains. These structural elements contribute to the protein's ability to interact with DNA.

The tertiary structure of ZNF362 involves the folding of its zinc finger domains into a stable conformation that is essential for its function. This folding is critical for the protein's ability to bind DNA and perform its regulatory roles. Zinc finger proteins like ZNF362 typically do not form quaternary structures, as they function as monomeric units.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination may occur in ZNF362, influencing its function and stability. These modifications can regulate the protein's activity and interactions within the cell. Additionally, splice variants of ZNF362 may exist, leading to different isoforms that could have diverse functional roles within the cell.

## Function
ZNF362 is a transcription factor that plays a role in the cellular response to environmental stimuli, particularly engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). It is involved in chromatin plasticity and the recruitment of repressor complexes, which are crucial for modulating chromatin structure and potentially providing an epigenetic memory of environmental stimuli. This function is particularly noted in lung-derived cell lines, where ZNF362 expression is linked to lung function and is induced by exposure to carbon black and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) at specific concentrations (del2023An).

ZNF362 may also be involved in the regulation of gene expression and DNA repair, especially in response to metal-ion toxicity and other stressors. Its role in the replication stress response is suggested by its interaction with proteins involved in DNA damage response, such as TOP2B, indicating a potential function in resolving replication fork stalling and recruiting repair machineries (Srivastava2018Replisome).

Despite these insights, the specific function of ZNF362 in healthy human cells remains unclear, as studies have primarily focused on its response to external stressors and its potential compensatory role in certain genetic models (del2023An).

## Interactions
ZNF362 is identified as a zinc finger protein that may play a role in regulating gene expression during specific phases of human germline cell development. The ARACNe method has highlighted ZNF362 as a top candidate gene for regulating the gene expression network in retinoic acid-responsive phase fetal germ cells (FGCs), suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation during this phase (Li2017SingleCell).

In terms of protein interactions, ZNF362 is part of the TOP2B interactome, which includes interactions with various proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. TOP2B interacts with members of the cohesin complex and CTCF, and ZNF362 is among the zinc finger proteins identified in this interactome. However, specific details on the interactions of ZNF362 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided, and the focus is primarily on the general role of TOP2B in chromatin state transitions (UuskülaReimand2016Topoisomerase).

There is also a suggestion that ZNF362 may have overlapping or compensatory functions with ZNF384 in leukemogenesis, as ZNF384 knockout mice maintain a normal hematopoietic system, potentially due to the preserved expression of ZNF362 (Dickerson2024Investigating). However, specific interactions of ZNF362 in this context are not detailed.
