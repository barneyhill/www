# CDC40

## Overview
The CDC40 gene encodes the cell division cycle 40 protein, a crucial component of the spliceosome complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is characterized by its WD40 repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its structural conformation, forming a beta-propeller structure. CDC40 plays a significant role in the second step of splicing by stabilizing interactions within the spliceosome, ensuring efficient removal of introns from pre-mRNA. While primarily associated with splicing, CDC40 also indirectly supports cell cycle progression by processing cell cycle-related genes. Its ubiquitous expression across human tissues underscores its fundamental role in cellular processes. Alterations in CDC40 expression or function have been implicated in various cancers, including lung, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by disrupted splicing and cell cycle regulation (YEHUDA1998Identification; Hu2021Abstract).

## Structure
The CDC40 protein, also known as PRP17 in yeast, is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which are motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to the protein's structural conformation (Li2001Human; YEHUDA1998Identification). These WD40 repeats form a beta-propeller structure, a common fold in proteins that participate in diverse cellular functions, including splicing and cell cycle regulation (Li2001Human; Jain2018Genome). The beta-propeller structure is composed of several blades, each formed by a four-stranded antiparallel beta sheet, which are arranged around a central axis (Li2001Human).

The human homologue of CDC40, hPRP17, shares significant similarity with the yeast protein, particularly in the C-terminal region where the WD repeats are located (YEHUDA1998Identification). This region is crucial for the protein's function, as demonstrated by the ability of a yeast-human chimera containing the C-terminal two-thirds of hPRP17 to complement the cell cycle and splicing defects in yeast prp17 mutants (YEHUDA1998Identification). The N-terminal region of hPRP17 is more divergent and does not complement the yeast protein, indicating species-specific interactions (YEHUDA1998Identification). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and interactions (Jain2018Genome). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of CDC40 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CDC40 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process in gene expression. In healthy human cells, CDC40 is a component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for removing introns from pre-mRNA. This protein is involved in the second step of splicing, where it stabilizes interactions between small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and the Nineteen Complex (NTC) within the spliceosome, ensuring efficient splicing (Hu2021Abstract).

CDC40 is characterized by WD40 repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, forming propeller-like structures that are essential for its function in the spliceosome (YEHUDA1998Identification). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, indicating its involvement in fundamental cellular processes (Hu2021Abstract).

In addition to its role in splicing, CDC40 indirectly supports cell cycle progression by splicing cell cycle-related genes. Although it may not directly control the cell cycle, its activity is crucial for maintaining proper cell cycle progression and transcript integrity (Hu2021Abstract). CDC40's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases where these processes are disrupted (Hu2021Abstract).

## Clinical Significance
The CDC40 gene has been implicated in various cancers, particularly lung cancer, due to its role in pre-mRNA splicing and cell cycle regulation. Alterations in CDC40 expression or function can lead to significant cellular consequences. In lung cancer, CDC40 is essential for cell survival, and its knockdown results in cell cycle defects, growth inhibition, and increased apoptosis (Hu2021Abstract). The gene's involvement in splicing is crucial, as its suppression leads to increased intron retention and splicing errors, which can disrupt normal cellular processes and contribute to tumorigenesis (Hu2021Abstract).

CDC40 is also implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In CRC, it is a target of the tumor-suppressive microRNA miR-378, while in HCC, it is targeted by the oncogenic miR-1269b. These interactions affect CDC40 expression levels, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and migration (Hu2021Abstract). The gene's role in splicing and cell cycle regulation makes it a potential therapeutic target, as its dysregulation is linked to cancer progression and survival (Hu2021Abstract).

## Interactions
The CDC40 protein, also known as PRP17, is a component of the spliceosome complex and is involved in various physical interactions essential for pre-mRNA splicing. CDC40 interacts with peptidylprolyl isomerase-like 1 (PPIL1) in the C complex, acting as a substrate for PPIL1. Its WD domain is crucial for the transesterification step during splicing. In the C* complex, CDC40's N-terminus interacts with proteins such as PPIL1, RBM22, SKIP, U5-40K, PRP8, and G10, while its C-terminal WD domain interacts with CDC5 and SYF3. After the second splicing step, CDC40's WD domain interacts with PRKRIP1 in the P complex (Hu2021Abstract).

CDC40 also interacts with components of the PRP19 complex, an essential subcomplex of the spliceosome. It interacts with the N-terminus of CDC40 in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio through its WD domain. CDC40 remains tightly bound to the spliceosome even after catalysis, supporting its role as a scaffolding component (Hu2021Abstract). In lung cancer cells, CDC40 interacts with spliceosome components such as CDC5, PRP19, CWC15, PPIL1, and PLRG1, indicating its potential role in splicing regulation (Hu2021Abstract).
