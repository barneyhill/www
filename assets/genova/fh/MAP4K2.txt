# MAP4K2

## Overview
MAP4K2, or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The protein product of MAP4K2 plays a pivotal role in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell growth, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. As a kinase, MAP4K2 is involved in phosphorylating key proteins such as LATS1/2, thereby influencing the localization and activity of transcriptional co-activators YAP/TAZ, which are critical for controlling gene expression related to cell proliferation and survival (Meng2015MAP4K). Additionally, MAP4K2 is implicated in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, contributing to immune responses and inflammation, and has been associated with cancer development in certain contexts (Tan2014Discovery). The protein also interacts with GABARAP family proteins, suggesting a role in autophagy, and is active in the cytoplasm, where it affects various signaling cascades, including the JNK and MAPK pathways (Seo2020MAP4K).

## Function
MAP4K2, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell growth, apoptosis, and maintaining tissue homeostasis. MAP4K2 acts as a physiological LATS1/2-activating kinase, functioning in parallel to MST1/2 kinases. It phosphorylates LATS1/2, leading to the phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of YAP/TAZ, thereby controlling gene expression related to cell proliferation and survival (Meng2015MAP4K).

MAP4K2 is also implicated in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is involved in immune responses and inflammation. It may contribute to cancer development in certain malignancies by influencing these pathways (Tan2014Discovery). Additionally, MAP4K2 interacts with GABARAP family proteins, suggesting a role in autophagy, a process essential for cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Seo2020MAP4K).

In the cellular context, MAP4K2 is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences various signaling cascades, including the JNK and MAPK pathways, impacting cellular stress responses and inflammation (Seo2020MAP4K).

## Clinical Significance
MAP4K2, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2, has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. Alterations in MAP4K2 expression or its signaling pathways can contribute to cancer development. The kinase is suggested to play a role in NF-κB signaling, which is associated with cancer progression in certain malignancies. Pharmacological inhibition of MAP4K2 has been shown to reduce the viability of colon cancer cells, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Tan2014Discovery).

Research has identified compounds that selectively inhibit MAP4K2, which could be useful for further elucidating its functions and therapeutic potential. These inhibitors have demonstrated the ability to inhibit phosphorylation of proteins downstream of MAP4K2, such as IKK, p38, and JNK, at low concentrations, suggesting a significant role in cancer-related signaling pathways (Tan2014Discovery).

While the clinical significance of MAP4K2 in autoimmune diseases is not directly addressed, its involvement in key signaling pathways suggests potential implications in immune response regulation. The development of MAP4K2-selective inhibitors highlights its importance as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer (Tan2014Discovery).

## Interactions
MAP4K2, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with GABARAP family proteins, suggesting a potential role in autophagy (Seo2020MAP4K). MAP4K2 also forms complexes with ribosomal proteins MRPL11 and RPL36, and nuclear proteins LIN28B and SNRPB2, indicating its involvement in ribosome biogenesis and other nuclear processes (Seo2020MAP4K).

MAP4K2 is a component of the STRIPAK complex, interacting specifically with STRN4, which acts as an adaptor influencing MAP4K activity and Hippo pathway regulation. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of YAP activity, a key factor in cell proliferation and cancer (Seo2020MAP4K). MAP4K2 also participates in the EGF/ERK signaling pathway, where it modulates ERK phosphorylation, highlighting its role in signal transduction (Vinayagam2011A).

In Arabidopsis, MAP4K2 interacts with SnRK2 proteins, particularly subclass III SnRK2s, and is involved in ABA-induced and Ca2+-mediated stomatal closure. It functions in a signaling module with SnRK2, affecting cytosolic calcium levels and ICa channel activity (Yamashita2024MAP4K1). These interactions underscore MAP4K2's diverse roles in cellular signaling and physiological processes.
