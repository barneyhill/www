# IMPA2

## Overview
The IMPA2 gene encodes the enzyme inositol monophosphatase 2, which is a critical component of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a hydrolase and is responsible for the dephosphorylation of inositol monophosphate, thereby facilitating the recycling of inositol phosphates. Inositol monophosphatase 2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in subcortical brain regions. The gene is located on chromosome 18p11.2, a locus associated with susceptibility to bipolar disorder, suggesting a potential role in mood regulation (Sjøholt2000A; Seelan2004Lithium). The enzyme's activity is inhibited by lithium, a common treatment for bipolar disorder, supporting the inositol-depletion hypothesis of mood stabilization (Ohnishi2007A). Additionally, IMPA2 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and increased mTORC1 activity (Kuei2020IMPA2).

## Structure
The human IMPA2 protein is an alpha-beta protein characterized by a five-layered sandwich structure composed of alternating alpha-helices and beta-sheets (Arai2007Crystal). The primary structure of IMPA2 consists of 288 amino acids (Fujita2011In). The protein forms a dimer in solution, with each monomer contributing to a predominantly hydrophobic dimer interface stabilized by several hydrophobic clusters and hydrogen bonds (Arai2007Crystal). Key residues involved in dimerization include Leu183, Leu187, Met190, Leu194, Val201, Val203, Phe113, Leu169, Ile204, and the aliphatic moieties of His111 and Arg202 (Arai2007Crystal).

The tertiary structure of IMPA2 is similar to that of IMPA1, with notable differences in the loop regions, which may affect substrate specificity (Fujita2011In). The active site of IMPA2 is more open compared to IMPA1, suggesting a potential for larger physiological substrates (Arai2007Crystal). The protein's active site includes key residues such as Glu81, Asp101, Ile103, Asp104, and Asp231, and is involved in metal ion coordination, essential for its enzymatic activity (Arai2007Crystal). The IMPA2 structure also features a disulfide bond between Cys90 and Cys229, although this may be artifactual (Arai2007Crystal).

## Function
The IMPA2 gene encodes the enzyme inositol monophosphatase 2, which plays a crucial role in the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the dephosphorylation of inositol monophosphate to free inositol, a key step in the recycling of inositol phosphates. This process is vital for maintaining cellular inositol levels, impacting cell signaling, membrane formation, and osmoregulation (Ablimit2022Inositol; Shamir2001Characterization).

IMPA2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in subcortical brain regions (Seelan2004Lithium). The enzyme is part of the IMPase family, which is involved in producing free myo-inositol, a substrate for cell membrane phospholipids (Ablimit2022Inositol). The gene is located on chromosome 18p11.2, a region associated with bipolar disorder susceptibility, suggesting its potential involvement in mood regulation (Sjøholt2000A).

The activity of IMPA2 is inhibited by lithium, a common treatment for bipolar disorder, indicating its role in mood stabilization through the inositol-depletion hypothesis (Ohnishi2007A). This hypothesis posits that lithium's therapeutic effects may be mediated through inositol depletion, affecting cellular signaling pathways (Ohnishi2007A).

## Clinical Significance
The IMPA2 gene has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Genetic studies have identified associations between IMPA2 polymorphisms and these conditions, suggesting that certain promoter haplotypes may enhance transcription and increase the risk for bipolar disorder (Ohnishi2007A). Specifically, alleles such as À461C and À207T have been overrepresented in bipolar patients, indicating a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Ohnishi2007A). Despite these associations, there is no genetic evidence linking the homologous IMPA1 gene to mental disorders (Ohnishi2007Spatial).

In the context of cancer, particularly metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), downregulation of IMPA2 is associated with increased mTORC1 activity and reduced autophagy initiation, which may promote cancer progression. Low IMPA2 expression correlates with poor prognosis in ccRCC patients, and its downregulation enhances metastatic potential by activating the Akt/mTORC1 pathway (Kuei2020IMPA2). These findings suggest that IMPA2 downregulation could serve as a biomarker for predicting the effectiveness of mTOR inhibitors in treating metastatic ccRCC (Kuei2020IMPA2). Additionally, miR-25 has been shown to negatively regulate IMPA2 expression, further implicating its role in cancer metastasis (Lin2019Dysregulation).

## Interactions
IMPA2, or inositol monophosphatase 2, is known to form homodimers but does not form heterodimers with its homolog IMPA1. This dimerization is significant for its enzymatic function, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays and gel filtration chromatography (Ohnishi2007Spatial). The dimer interface of IMPA2 is predominantly hydrophobic, involving several specific residues, which stabilize the dimer through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Arai2007Crystal).

IMPA2's interaction with metal ions is crucial for its catalytic activity. The enzyme requires magnesium ions for its activity, and the presence of three Mg2+ ions is essential for forming a stable enzyme-substrate complex, as shown in in silico docking studies (Fujita2011In). These metal ions help stabilize the transition state during the dephosphorylation reaction.

In the context of nuclear localization, IMPA2 interacts with the importin proteins IMPa2 and IMPb1, forming a heterodimer that is crucial for the nuclear translocation of the dystrophin-associated protein α-dystrobrevin (Aguilar2015Nuclear). This interaction highlights the role of IMPA2 in cellular processes beyond its enzymatic activity.
