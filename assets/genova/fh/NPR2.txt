# NPR2

## Overview
NPR2 is a gene that encodes the natriuretic peptide receptor 2, a transmembrane receptor with guanylyl cyclase activity. This receptor is primarily involved in the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a critical secondary messenger in various signaling pathways (Potter2005Natriuretic; Hannema2013An). The protein encoded by NPR2 is categorized as a receptor and plays a significant role in physiological processes such as endochondral ossification, which is essential for bone growth, and in maintaining normal brain function through natriuretic peptide signaling (Potter2005Natriuretic; Vasques2014Role). Mutations in NPR2 can lead to growth disorders, with loss-of-function mutations causing short stature and gain-of-function mutations resulting in skeletal overgrowth (Miura2013Overgrowth; Hannema2013An). The receptor's activity is modulated by various interactions and post-translational modifications, which are crucial for its function in different tissues, including bone, brain, heart, and vasculature (Thompson2012Expression; Shuhaibar2017Dephosphorylation).

## Structure
The NPR2 gene encodes the natriuretic peptide receptor 2, a transmembrane receptor with guanylyl cyclase activity. The primary structure of NPR2 includes several key domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain, an intracellular kinase homology domain (KHD), and a guanylyl cyclase domain (GCD) (Hannema2013An; Chen2023Novel). The KHD is crucial for ATP binding, which is necessary for the activation of NPR2 (Chen2023Novel).

The secondary structure of NPR2 features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the overall folding and stability of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to facilitate ligand binding and signal transduction. The quaternary structure of NPR2 may involve dimerization, as it exists as a homodimer or homotetramer in the absence of its ligand, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) (Hannema2013An).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in NPR2 and play a role in its regulation and function. These modifications can affect the receptor's activity and its ability to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (Hannema2013An).

## Function
The NPR2 gene encodes the natriuretic peptide receptor 2, which is a transmembrane guanylyl cyclase involved in the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (Potter2005Natriuretic; Hannema2013An). This receptor primarily binds C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), leading to the accumulation of cGMP, a secondary messenger that activates various intracellular targets, including cGMP-dependent protein kinases, cyclic nucleotide-regulated ion channels, and cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases (Potter2005Natriuretic; Vasques2014Role).

NPR2 is expressed in several tissues, including bone, brain, heart, and vasculature, and plays a crucial role in endochondral ossification, which is essential for long bone growth (Potter2005Natriuretic; Hannema2013An). The receptor's activity is vital for the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes, contributing to the synthesis of cartilage matrix and normal bone development (Vasques2014Role). In the brain, NPR2 is highly expressed and is involved in maintaining normal physiological processes through natriuretic peptide signaling (Potter2005Natriuretic).

Mutations in NPR2 can lead to various growth disorders, with loss-of-function mutations associated with short stature and gain-of-function mutations linked to tall stature and skeletal overgrowth (Hannema2013An; Vasques2014Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NPR2 gene are associated with several skeletal disorders, most notably acromesomelic dysplasia, type Maroteaux (AMDM), and idiopathic short stature (ISS). AMDM is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by disproportionate short stature and limb abnormalities. It results from biallelic loss-of-function mutations in NPR2, which impair the receptor's guanylyl cyclase activity, crucial for skeletal growth (Bartels2004Mutations; Irfanullah2018Molecular). 

Heterozygous mutations in NPR2 can lead to ISS, a condition marked by short stature without other systemic abnormalities. These mutations often result in reduced cGMP production, affecting bone growth. The prevalence of NPR2 mutations in ISS cases ranges from 2% to 6% (Chen2023Novel; Wang2015Heterozygous). 

Conversely, gain-of-function mutations in NPR2 have been linked to overgrowth syndromes, characterized by tall stature and skeletal abnormalities. These mutations enhance the receptor's activity, leading to excessive bone growth (Miura2013Overgrowth). 

Alterations in NPR2 expression have also been implicated in pituitary disorders, potentially affecting hormone regulation and contributing to conditions like growth hormone deficiency (Thompson2012Expression).

## Interactions
NPR2, or natriuretic peptide receptor 2, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various physiological processes. The transcriptional regulation of the NPR2 gene is influenced by Sp1 and Sp3 proteins, which bind to the promoter region of the gene. This interaction is crucial for the expression of the guanylyl cyclase-B (GC-B) receptor, as the NPR2 promoter contains numerous Sp1/Sp3 binding sites essential for basal promoter activity (Thompson2012Expression).

In the context of bone growth, NPR2 interacts with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. FGF18 reduces NPR2 activity in growth plate chondrocytes by promoting its dephosphorylation, which decreases cyclic GMP (cGMP) production. This interaction involves the activation of protein phosphatase PP2A, which can dephosphorylate NPR2 in vitro (Shuhaibar2017Dephosphorylation).

In cardiac physiology, NPR2 interacts with C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) to produce cGMP signals that affect cardiac contractility. These signals are not highly controlled by phosphodiesterases and can diffuse throughout the cell, allowing cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) to phosphorylate substrates such as phospholamban and troponin I (Subramanian2018Distinct).
