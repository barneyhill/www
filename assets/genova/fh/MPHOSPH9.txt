# MPHOSPH9

## Overview
MPHOSPH9 is a gene that encodes the protein M-phase phosphoprotein 9 (MPP9), which plays a pivotal role in cellular processes, particularly in ciliogenesis. MPP9 is categorized as a regulatory protein involved in the formation of primary cilia, a critical cellular structure for signaling and movement. The protein is recruited to the mother centriole, where it interacts with other proteins to regulate the assembly and disassembly of cilia. This regulation is crucial for proper cell division and signaling pathways. The gene has been implicated in various diseases, including multiple sclerosis, venous thromboembolism, schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes, and primary open-angle glaucoma, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Unknownauthors2010IL12A; Liu2020Integrated; Huang2018MPhase; Lindström2019Genomic; Gharahkhani2020A).

## Structure


## Function
M-phase phosphoprotein 9 (MPP9) plays a critical role in ciliogenesis, a process essential for the formation of primary cilia from the mother centriole. MPP9 is recruited by Kinesin Family Member 24 (KIF24) to the distal end of the mother centriole, where it forms a ring-like structure and recruits the CP110-CEP97 complex by directly binding to CEP97. This complex acts as a negative regulator of ciliogenesis. The phosphorylation of MPP9 by Tau Tubulin Kinase 2 (TTBK2) at the onset of ciliogenesis leads to its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the removal of CP110 and CEP97 from the distal end of the mother centriole, thereby promoting cilia formation (Huang2018MPhase).

MPP9 functions as a switch for ciliogenesis by modulating the localization of the CP110-CEP97 complex at the mother centrioles/basal bodies. Its degradation is a critical step in ciliogenesis, as it allows for the displacement and degradation of the CP110-CEP97 complex, which is necessary for proper cilia formation (Huang2018MPhase). MPP9's role in ciliogenesis highlights its importance in cell signaling and movement, contributing to the regulation of cellular structures critical for cell division and signaling (Huang2018MPhase).

## Clinical Significance
MPHOSPH9 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. It is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) as part of the MPHOSPH9/CDK2AP1 locus, where the rs1790100 G allele correlates with lower expression of the CDK2AP1 gene. This reduced expression may lead to decreased inhibition of DNA replication and increased proliferation of inflammatory cells, contributing to MS pathogenesis (Unknownauthors2010IL12A).

MPHOSPH9 is also linked to venous thromboembolism (VTE) through the intronic variant rs2851436, which is associated with higher plasma tissue plasminogen activator levels and altered platelet characteristics (Lindström2019Genomic). Additionally, MPHOSPH9 has been identified as a gene of interest in the comorbidity of schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes, suggesting a potential role in these conditions, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (Liu2020Integrated).

Furthermore, MPHOSPH9 has been noted in studies investigating primary open-angle glaucoma, where it may influence disease risk by modulating gene expression in retinal tissue (Gharahkhani2020A). These associations highlight the gene's potential involvement in diverse pathological processes.
