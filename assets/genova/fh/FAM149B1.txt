# FAM149B1

## Overview
FAM149B1 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 149 member B1, which plays a crucial role in ciliary biology. This protein is primarily associated with the primary cilium, a sensory organelle essential for various signaling pathways that regulate development and cellular homeostasis. FAM149B1 is involved in maintaining normal ciliary morphology and function, particularly through its influence on ciliary length and intraflagellar transport (IFT) mechanisms. Dysfunction of the FAM149B1 gene can lead to ciliopathy phenotypes, such as Joubert syndrome and oral-facial-digital syndrome, due to impaired ciliary function and dysregulated signaling pathways, including the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway (Siegert2021Expanding; Shaheen2019Bi-allelic).

## Function
The FAM149B1 gene encodes a protein that is implicated in ciliary biology, particularly in the regulation of ciliary length and function. In healthy cells, FAM149B1 is involved in maintaining normal ciliary morphology and function, which is crucial for proper cellular signaling and homeostasis. The protein is associated with the primary cilium, a sensory organelle that plays a key role in various signaling pathways during development and cellular homeostasis (Shaheen2019Bi-allelic).

FAM149B1 is believed to influence ciliary length control through mechanisms involving intraflagellar transport (IFT). In cells deficient in FAM149B1, there is a significant pooling of IFT proteins at the ciliary tip, suggesting impaired retrograde transport, which is essential for normal ciliary function (Shaheen2019Bi-allelic). The gene's dysfunction can lead to abnormal ciliary phenotypes, such as increased cilium length and dysregulated signaling pathways, including the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway (Shaheen2019Bi-allelic).

FAM149B1 has also been linked to various ciliopathy phenotypes, such as Joubert syndrome and oral-facial-digital syndrome, highlighting its role in ciliary homeostasis and its importance in preventing developmental anomalies and organ dysfunction (Siegert2021Expanding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM149B1 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathy phenotypes, including Joubert syndrome (JS) and orofaciodigital syndrome type VI (OFD VI). These conditions are characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and various neurological, ocular, and skeletal symptoms. In particular, bi-allelic truncating variants in FAM149B1 lead to cilia dysfunction, which has been observed in both pediatric and adult patients. A specific variant, c.354_357delinsCACTC (p.Gln118Hisfs*20), has been identified in several families, presenting with symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and the molar tooth sign on brain MRI (Siegert2021Expanding; Shaheen2019Bi-allelic).

Functional studies have shown that mutations in FAM149B1 result in longer cilia with greater variability in length, indicating impaired ciliary function. This is further supported by the abnormal pooling of IFT proteins at the ciliary tip, suggesting defects in retrograde transport. The FAM149B1 protein interacts with TBC1D32, a protein associated with ciliopathy phenotypes, reinforcing its role in ciliary function (Shaheen2019Bi-allelic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FAM149B1 mutations in contributing to ciliopathy-related conditions.

## Interactions
The FAM149B1 protein is implicated in interactions that are crucial for its role in ciliary function. Research has identified an interaction between FAM149B1 and TBC1D32 (BROMI), a protein associated with ciliopathy phenotypes. This interaction was discovered using high-throughput affinity-purification mass spectrometry, suggesting that FAM149B1 may be involved in ciliary processes through its association with TBC1D32 (Shaheen2019Bi-allelic). TBC1D32 is known to be involved in ciliopathy-related pathways, and knockout mice for this gene exhibit typical ciliopathy features, indicating the functional significance of this interaction in maintaining normal ciliary biology (Shaheen2019Bi-allelic).

The study of FAM149B1-related ciliopathies has also highlighted the potential involvement of FAM149B1 in intraflagellar transport (IFT) mechanisms. Mutant cells with FAM149B1 mutations show abnormal accumulation of IFT proteins at the ciliary tip, suggesting impaired retrograde transport. This indicates that FAM149B1 may interact with components of the IFT machinery, although specific protein interactions within this context have not been fully elucidated (Shaheen2019Bi-allelic). These interactions are critical for understanding the role of FAM149B1 in ciliary length control and its contribution to ciliopathy phenotypes.
