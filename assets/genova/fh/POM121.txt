# POM121

## Overview
POM121 is a gene that encodes the POM121 transmembrane nucleoporin, a critical component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane nucleoporin due to its role in spanning the nuclear envelope and facilitating nucleocytoplasmic transport. POM121 is integral to the structural integrity and function of the NPC, contributing to the assembly and maintenance of this complex. It features a transmembrane domain that anchors it to the nuclear envelope, with the majority of the protein extending into the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. The protein's FG-repeat domain is essential for interactions with nuclear transport carriers, playing a pivotal role in the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, which is vital for processes such as gene expression and cell cycle regulation (Funakoshi2011Localization). Additionally, POM121 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and immune responses, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (RodriguezBravo2018Nuclear; Wang2019POM121).

## Structure
POM121 is a transmembrane nucleoporin integral to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) structure. It features a single N-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors it to the nuclear envelope, with the majority of the protein extending into the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic sides of the nuclear envelope (Talamas2011POM121; Funakoshi2011Localization). The protein contains multiple nuclear localization signals (NLSs) within its N-terminal region, specifically between amino acids 266-702, which are crucial for its targeting to NPCs (Funakoshi2011Localization). 

POM121 also includes a repetitive pentapeptide motif, XFXFG, similar to those found in nucleoporins, suggesting its role in anchoring components of the NPC to the pore membrane (Hallberg1993An). The protein's FG-repeat domain facilitates nucleocytoplasmic transport and may interact with nuclear transport carriers (Funakoshi2011Localization). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. Human cells have multiple genetic loci for POM121, leading to potential splice variants that could alter its functional domains (Funakoshi2007Two). These structural features underscore POM121's essential role in NPC assembly and function.

## Function
POM121 is a transmembrane nucleoporin integral to the assembly and maintenance of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in human cells. It plays a critical role in anchoring the NPC to the nuclear envelope, facilitating the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, which is essential for gene expression and cell cycle regulation (Funakoshi2007Two; Bindra2021In). POM121 is recruited early during post-mitotic nuclear reassembly and exhibits a slow turnover at the interphase NPC, indicating its stability and structural role in the NPC (Daigle2001Nuclear).

The protein contains nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that are crucial for its targeting to the NPCs, interacting with importin α/β and the RanGTP system to ensure proper localization (Yavuz2010NLS‐mediated; Funakoshi2011Localization). POM121's interaction with the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and components like the lamin B receptor is vital for initiating NPC assembly during interphase (Funakoshi2011Localization). Additionally, a soluble form of POM121, sPom121, has been identified, which lacks the transmembrane domain and is involved in transcription regulation by interacting with nucleoplasmic Nup98 at gene promoters (Bindra2021In; Franks2016Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the POM121 gene have been implicated in several cancers, notably colorectal cancer (CRC) and prostate cancer. In CRC, POM121 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, including factors like lymph node metastasis and lower overall survival rates (Wang2019POM121). High POM121 expression in CRC is linked to cell invasion and metastasis, and it is significantly associated with shorter overall survival in patients (Wang2019POM121). POM121 is also involved in pathways related to the cell cycle and DNA replication, potentially promoting CRC oncogenesis (Wang2019POM121).

In prostate cancer, POM121 is significantly upregulated in aggressive cancer cells, enhancing the nuclear import of oncogenic transcription factors such as MYC, E2F1, and AR, which contributes to tumorigenesis and proliferation (RodriguezBravo2018Nuclear). The interaction between POM121 and importin β is crucial for this process, and targeting this axis has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy (RodriguezBravo2018Nuclear). POM121's role in promoting aggressive prostate cancer highlights its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and a target for therapeutic intervention (RodriguezBravo2018Nuclear).

POM121 also plays a role in immune responses, as its expression is reduced in LPS-stimulated macrophages, leading to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Ge2019POM121). This suggests that POM121 has a regulatory effect on inflammation, potentially impacting conditions like acute lung injury.

## Interactions
POM121 is a transmembrane nucleoporin that plays a crucial role in nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly and function. It interacts with several nucleoporins and other proteins, forming part of the structural framework of the NPC. POM121 is known to interact with the Nup107-160 and Nup93-205 complexes, which are essential components of the NPC's central scaffold. These interactions are critical for the recruitment of POM121 during nuclear pore assembly (Rasala2008Capture). 

POM121 also interacts with importin α/β, a key player in nuclear transport, in a manner dependent on nuclear localization signals (NLS). Mutations in the NLS sites of POM121 disrupt its binding to importin α/β and reduce its interactions with nucleoporins such as Nup160, Nup133, Nup155, Nup93, and Nup205 (Yavuz2010NLS‐mediated). 

In the context of cancer, POM121 has been identified as an interactor of PPARγ, influencing its subcellular localization and inhibiting its nuclear accumulation in the presence of active RAS signaling (Yu2024Nuclear). This interaction highlights POM121's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its potential role in the cancer immuno-microenvironment. 

POM121's interactions extend to its role in the nuclear import of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex (PIC), where it interacts with karyopherin-β1 (KPNB1), facilitating the nuclear import of the viral complex (Guo2018The).
