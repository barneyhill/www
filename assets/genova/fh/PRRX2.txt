# PRRX2

## Overview
PRRX2 (paired related homeobox 2) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development and tissue regeneration. The PRRX2 protein is categorized as a homeobox transcription factor, which plays a crucial role in cellular differentiation, particularly in mesodermal and neural crest cells. It is essential for processes such as limb formation and craniofacial development. The expression of PRRX2 is developmentally regulated, with higher levels observed in fetal tissues compared to adult tissues, and it is notably active in embryonic tissues like the heart, kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle (Norris2000Human). In addition to its developmental roles, PRRX2 is implicated in wound healing and tissue regeneration, where it is expressed in fetal skin and proliferating fibroblasts, suggesting its involvement in scarless healing and cellular proliferation (Stelnicki1998Modulation).

## Function
PRRX2 (paired related homeobox 2) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in embryonic development and tissue regeneration. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression during cellular differentiation, particularly in mesodermal and neural crest cells, influencing processes such as limb formation and craniofacial development (Norris2000Human). PRRX2 is highly expressed in embryonic tissues, including the heart, kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle, and its expression is developmentally regulated, with higher levels in fetal tissues compared to adult tissues (Norris2000Human).

In the context of wound healing, PRRX2 is more strongly expressed in fetal skin and proliferating fibroblasts, suggesting a role in tissue development and regeneration. It is involved in scarless fetal wound healing, where it is expressed in the dermis of fetal skin but not in adult skin, indicating its potential role in cellular proliferation and cutaneous regeneration (Stelnicki1998Modulation). PRRX2 is active in the nucleus, where it binds DNA to modulate the transcription of target genes, contributing to its function in cellular differentiation and tissue development (Norris2000Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the PRRX2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In glioblastoma, PRRX2 is overexpressed, particularly in higher-grade tumors, and is associated with poor patient survival. This overexpression promotes glioblastoma stem cell viability and proliferation by inhibiting ferroptosis, a form of cell death, suggesting that targeting PRRX2 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma (Jiang2022CircLRFN5).

In colon cancer, PRRX2 expression is elevated, especially in cases with liver metastasis. It is associated with clinical staging and lymph node metastasis. Silencing PRRX2 reduces the invasiveness and migration of colon cancer cells by inactivating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, indicating its role in promoting metastasis. This suggests that PRRX2 could be a target for therapeutic intervention in colon cancer liver metastasis (Chai2019Inhibition).

In cardiac fibrosis following myocardial infarction, PRRX2 is upregulated and contributes to increased fibrosis and impaired cardiac function. Knockdown of PRRX2 in mice models has been shown to reduce cardiac fibrosis and improve survival, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in ischemic heart diseases (Bai2019Up‐regulation).

## Interactions
PRRX2, a transcription factor, is involved in various interactions that influence gene expression and cellular processes. In glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), PRRX2 interacts with circLRFN5, a circular RNA, which binds to PRRX2 and promotes its degradation through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway. This interaction does not affect PRRX2 mRNA levels but significantly reduces its protein levels, indicating a post-translational regulatory mechanism (Jiang2022CircLRFN5). The degradation of PRRX2 by circLRFN5 can be reversed with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, confirming the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Jiang2022CircLRFN5).

PRRX2 also plays a role in regulating the expression of the GCH1 gene, which is involved in ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. PRRX2 upregulates GCH1 expression by binding to its promoter, enhancing its transcriptional activity. This interaction is crucial in glioblastoma, where PRRX2 overexpression is associated with increased cell viability and proliferation by inhibiting ferroptosis (Jiang2022CircLRFN5). The interaction between PRRX2 and GCH1 is demonstrated through various assays, including qPCR, western blotting, and luciferase reporter assays (Jiang2022CircLRFN5).
