# VRK2

## Overview
VRK2, or Vaccinia-related kinase 2, is a gene that encodes the VRK serine/threonine kinase 2, a member of the serine/threonine kinase family. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including apoptosis modulation, signaling pathway regulation, and lysosomal function. The VRK2 protein is involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways such as MAPK and JNK, influencing cellular responses to external stimuli and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It interacts with several proteins, including scaffold proteins and anti-apoptotic factors, to modulate these pathways. VRK2's involvement in lysosomal function and autophagy further underscores its importance in cellular maintenance and stress responses. Clinically, VRK2 has been implicated in psychiatric and neurological disorders, with genetic variants associated with conditions such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and genetic generalized epilepsy, highlighting its potential role in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions (Hirata2018Functional; Li2018<i>VRK2<i>; Blanco2008Modulation; Yin2023Reduced; Fernández2010VRK2).

## Structure


## Function
The VRK2 gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis modulation, signaling pathway regulation, and lysosomal function. In healthy human cells, VRK2, particularly its isoform VRK2A, plays a protective role against apoptosis by interacting with Bcl-xL and regulating BAX gene expression. This interaction forms a stable complex that reduces apoptosis, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing unnecessary cell death (Monsalve2013Human).

VRK2 also modulates signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and JNK pathways, by interacting with scaffold proteins like JIP1. This interaction affects the phosphorylation of key signaling molecules, thereby influencing cellular responses to stimuli like interleukin-1b (Blanco2008Modulation). VRK2A is known to inhibit the MAPK pathway by blocking ERK phosphorylation, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Fernández2010VRK2).

Additionally, VRK2 is involved in lysosomal function and autophagy regulation. It interacts with Akt to control lysosomal size, acidification, and enzyme activity, which are essential for cellular homeostasis and pathogen degradation (Hirata2018Functional). These roles highlight VRK2's importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and responses to stress.

## Clinical Significance
The VRK2 gene is implicated in several psychiatric and neurological disorders. Variants in VRK2, such as SNPs rs1518395 and rs2312147, have been associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in various populations, indicating a potential role in the shared genetic basis of these disorders (Li2018<i>VRK2<i>). VRK2 is also linked to genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), with some risk alleles for psychiatric disorders appearing to confer protective effects against GGE, suggesting complex underlying mechanisms (Li2018<i>VRK2<i>).

Alterations in VRK2 expression are associated with depression. The SNP rs2678907, located upstream of VRK2, affects enhancer activity, leading to decreased VRK2 mRNA expression and a higher risk of depression (Yin2023Reduced). Reduced VRK2 expression is linked to depressive-like behaviors in mice, with changes in synapse-associated proteins and dendritic spine morphology in the ventral hippocampus (Yin2023Reduced).

VRK2 is also involved in neurodevelopmental disorders, with genetic variants linked to congenital abnormalities such as microcephaly and intellectual disability (Li2018<i>VRK2<i>). The gene's role in intracellular signaling pathways and its interaction with proteins like dysbindin and Akt may influence susceptibility to psychiatric disorders (Li2018<i>VRK2<i>).

## Interactions
VRK2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in modulating various cellular pathways. It interacts with the scaffold protein KSR1, which is crucial for the MAPK signaling pathway. VRK2A colocalizes with KSR1 in the endoplasmic reticulum, forming a complex that inhibits the EGF response by blocking ERK phosphorylation (Fernández2010VRK2). VRK2 also interacts with the JIP1 scaffold protein, forming stable complexes that modulate the JNK signal transduction pathway. This interaction is independent of VRK2's kinase activity and involves the C-terminal domain of JIP1 (Blanco2008Modulation).

In the context of apoptosis, VRK2A interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, forming a ternary complex with Bax, although it does not directly interact with Bax. This interaction is crucial for modulating apoptosis by affecting mitochondrial membrane permeability and Bax gene expression (Monsalve2013Human). VRK2 also interacts with Akt1 and Akt2 within lysosomes, a process essential for autophagy regulation. This interaction is dependent on VRK2's kinase activity and affects lysosomal functions and cellular proliferation (Hirata2018Functional).
