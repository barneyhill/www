# ENPEP

## Overview
ENPEP, or the gene encoding glutamyl aminopeptidase, is a critical component of the human genome that encodes a zinc metallopeptidase enzyme. This enzyme is primarily involved in the renin-angiotensin system, a hormonal cascade essential for regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. As a type I integral membrane protein, glutamyl aminopeptidase is anchored to the cell membrane and functions by cleaving N-terminal glutamyl residues from peptide substrates, such as angiotensin II, thereby modulating its activity and contributing to vasodilation and sodium excretion. The enzyme is predominantly expressed in renal and intestinal tissues, as well as in various peripheral tissues, including vascular endothelium and brain nuclei. Beyond its physiological roles, ENPEP has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Yuhara2021Molecular; Wu2008Expression; Lecluze2023Association).

## Structure
ENPEP, also known as glutamyl aminopeptidase, is a membrane-bound enzyme that plays a role in the renin-angiotensin system. It is characterized as a 130-kDa homodimeric zinc metallopeptidase, indicating its quaternary structure as a dimer (Wu2008Expression). The enzyme specifically cleaves the N-terminal glutamate or aspartate residue of peptidic substrates, such as angiotensin II, which is crucial for its function in blood pressure regulation (Yuhara2021Molecular; Wu2008Expression).

ENPEP contains a zinc-binding motif, which is essential for its catalytic activity, and is part of the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases (Thompson2009Arginyl; Maynard2014Evolutionary). The protein is a type I integral membrane protein, suggesting the presence of a transmembrane domain that anchors it to the cell membrane (Thompson2009Arginyl). 

Post-translational modifications of ENPEP may include glycosylation, which can affect its stability and activity. The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing for functional diversity. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of ENPEP are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ENPEP, or glutamyl aminopeptidase, is a zinc metallopeptidase that plays a significant role in the renin-angiotensin system, which is crucial for regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. It catalyzes the cleavage of N-terminal glutamyl residues from peptide substrates, such as angiotensin II, converting it to the less active angiotensin III. This activity contributes to vasodilation and sodium excretion, thereby influencing blood pressure regulation (Yuhara2021Molecular; Wu2008Expression).

ENPEP is a membrane-bound enzyme predominantly active in renal and intestinal tissues, where it is involved in the catabolic pathway of the renin-angiotensin system (Yuhara2021Molecular). It is expressed in various peripheral tissues, including intestinal and renal epithelial cells, vascular endothelium, and brain nuclei that express Ang II type-1 receptors (Wu2008Expression). The enzyme's activity in these tissues underscores its importance in physiological processes, such as blood pressure regulation and possibly in the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (Wu2008Expression).

ENPEP has also been proposed as a candidate receptor for SARS-CoV-2, although its expression in certain tissues, like chicken breast muscle, suggests it may not be universally present across all species (Yuhara2021Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
ENPEP, or glutamyl aminopeptidase, has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In breast cancer, ENPEP is identified as a risk tumor microenvironment (TME) prognostic gene, with its expression negatively associated with patient prognosis. High expression levels of ENPEP are linked to decreased survival probability, and its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting a role in promoting cancerous processes (Xiao2023A).

In cardiovascular conditions, ENPEP is involved in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin system. Variants in the ENPEP gene have been associated with changes in blood pressure, with certain loss-of-function variants linked to increased blood pressure (Lecluze2023Association). Additionally, ENPEP is co-expressed with PITX2 in regions of the heart associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), suggesting that its deregulation may contribute to the development of AF (Aguirre2015Longrange).

ENPEP is also associated with obesity and hypertension. It is a differentially methylated gene in human adipose tissue linked to obesity traits, and its inhibition is a treatment strategy for hypertension (Sabir2020Unraveling).

## Interactions
ENPEP, or glutamyl aminopeptidase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in various biological processes. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ENPEP is associated with immune cell infiltration, interacting with proteins such as FN1, CALR, PDGFRB, CD68, CD63, NRP1, SDC1, and SERPINA1, which are implicated in GBM progression (Chen2022Comprehensive). These interactions suggest a role for ENPEP in cellular immunity and tumor progression.

ENPEP is also part of the renin-angiotensin system, where it cleaves the N-terminal aspartic acid of angiotensin II, converting it to angiotensin III. This interaction is crucial for regulating blood pressure and fluid balance (Huang2024Uncovering). In the context of trophoblast differentiation, ENPEP interacts with the HIF-1α pathway, and its deletion impairs differentiation, potentially due to the accumulation of angiotensin II, which affects E-cadherin-mediated attachment and invasion (Huang2024Uncovering).

In cardiac development, ENPEP is expressed in the sinoatrial node and regions prone to ectopic electrical activity, suggesting a role in cardiac function and a potential link to atrial fibrillation (Aguirre2015Longrange). These interactions highlight ENPEP's involvement in diverse physiological and pathological processes.
