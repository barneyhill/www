# GYS1

## Overview
The GYS1 gene encodes glycogen synthase 1, a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycogen, predominantly expressed in muscle tissues such as skeletal and cardiac muscle. Glycogen synthase 1 belongs to the glycosyltransferase family, specifically the GT3 superfamily, and plays a pivotal role in energy storage by catalyzing the addition of glucose residues to a growing glycogen chain. The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated through phosphorylation and allosteric modulation by glucose-6-phosphate, ensuring a balance between glycogen synthesis and cellular energy demands. Mutations in the GYS1 gene are linked to various glycogen storage diseases, including Glycogen Storage Disease Type 0, and have significant implications for muscle function and metabolic health (McCorvie2021Molecular; Tarnopolsky2018Myopathies).

## Structure
The human glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) protein is a key enzyme in muscle glycogen biosynthesis, belonging to the GT3 superfamily of glycosyltransferases. It catalyzes the addition of α-1,4-linked glucose residues to a growing polysaccharide chain using UDP-glucose as the sugar donor (McCorvie2021Molecular). The primary structure of GYS1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, which includes phosphorylation sites that regulate its activity. Phosphorylation occurs at multiple sites on the N and C termini, inhibiting the enzyme (McCorvie2021Molecular).

The secondary structure of GYS1 includes Rossmann fold domains, which are involved in nucleotide binding (Marr2022Mechanism). The tertiary structure is characterized by a tetrameric arrangement, with each monomer consisting of two Rossmann domains and a tetramerization domain (McCorvie2021Molecular). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a homotetramer, which interacts with glycogenin-1 (GYG1) through a helix-turn-helix motif, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (McCorvie2021Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating GYS1 activity. Phosphorylation at specific sites, such as Ser641, interacts with arginine clusters, stabilizing the enzyme in an inhibited state (Marr2022Mechanism). The enzyme's activity is modulated by glucose-6-phosphate, which acts as an allosteric activator, inducing conformational changes that transition GYS1 to an activated state (McCorvie2021Molecular).

## Function
Glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) is a key enzyme in glycogen biosynthesis, primarily active in muscle tissues such as skeletal and cardiac muscle. It catalyzes the addition of α-1,4-linked glucose residues to the nonreducing end of a growing glycogen chain, using UDP-glucose as the sugar donor (McCorvie2021Molecular; Cameron2009Identification). This process is crucial for energy storage, providing a reserve of glucose that can be mobilized during periods of increased metabolic demand (Cameron2009Identification).

GYS1 activity is regulated by phosphorylation and allosteric effectors, particularly glucose-6-phosphate (Glc6P), which acts as an activator. Phosphorylation inhibits GYS1 by reducing its flexibility and preventing active site closure, while Glc6P binding induces a conformational change that activates the enzyme (McCorvie2021Molecular). The regulation of GYS1 is essential for maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of glycogen synthesis, allowing the enzyme to respond to cellular energy needs and signals such as insulin (McCorvie2021Molecular).

In healthy human cells, GYS1 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm, where it plays a critical role in muscle energy metabolism by facilitating glycogen storage and mobilization (Cameron2009Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GYS1 gene, which encodes muscle-specific glycogen synthase, are associated with several glycogen storage diseases and other conditions. Glycogen Storage Disease Type 0 (GSD 0) is caused by mutations in GYS1 and is characterized by exercise intolerance, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Patients may also experience exercise-induced arrhythmia and possibly epilepsy (Tarnopolsky2018Myopathies).

A specific mutation in GYS1, a homozygous two base pair deletion in exon 2, has been linked to sudden cardiac death, particularly in children. This mutation results in a deficiency of muscle-specific glycogen synthase, leading to insufficient glycogen synthesis in heart and muscle tissues, which is critical during physical activity. The deficiency can cause sudden cardiac death due to the lack of energy reserves during increased physical demand (Cameron2009Identification).

In addition to GSD 0, mutations in GYS1 are implicated in exertional rhabdomyolysis and polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM) in racehorses, highlighting the gene's role in muscle function across species (Tarnopolsky2018Myopathies). Furthermore, GYS1 mutations are associated with the formation of polyglucosan bodies, contributing to conditions like Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease (APBD) and Lafora Disease (LD) (Gumusgoz2021Targeting; Donohue2023Gys1).

## Interactions
Glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) is a key enzyme in glycogen biosynthesis and participates in several important protein interactions. GYS1 forms a complex with glycogenin-1 (GYG1), which is essential for initiating glycogen synthesis. This interaction involves a helix-turn-helix motif, with GYG1 forming hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with specific helices of GYS1. A unique cysteine-rich pocket in GYS1, consisting of Cys137, Cys189, and Cys251, is stabilized by GYG1, potentially preventing aberrant disulfide bond formation (McCorvie2021Molecular).

GYS1 is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its interaction with glucose-6-phosphate (Glc6P) and its conformation. Phosphorylation at specific sites stabilizes GYS1 in an inhibited state by creating nonsymmetric interactions at the dimeric interfaces. Glc6P binding induces a transition to an activated state, characterized by significant structural changes (McCorvie2021Molecular).

GYS1 also interacts indirectly with the NF-κB pathway in clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) via the ribosomal protein S27a (RPS27A), which facilitates the nuclear import of p65, a component of the NF-κB pathway. This interaction is crucial for promoting tumor growth and drug resistance (Chen2020GYS1).
