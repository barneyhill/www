# DNAH17

## Overview
DNAH17 is a gene that encodes the dynein axonemal heavy chain 17, a protein that is a crucial component of the outer dynein arms in the axonemal structure of cilia and flagella. This protein belongs to the dynein family, which is known for its role in cellular motility processes. Dynein axonemal heavy chain 17 is primarily expressed in the testis, where it is essential for the structural integrity and function of sperm flagella, playing a vital role in sperm motility and male fertility (Sha2019DNAH17). Beyond its role in reproductive health, DNAH17 is also expressed in other tissues, such as the brain and lung, indicating its involvement in broader ciliary functions (Yu2022Identification). Mutations in DNAH17 have been linked to conditions such as asthenozoospermia and left-right asymmetry disorders, underscoring its importance in both reproductive and developmental health (Breuer2022Exome; Zhang2019A).

## Function
The DNAH17 gene encodes a dynein heavy chain that is a critical component of the outer dynein arms (ODAs) in the axonemal structure of cilia and flagella. This protein plays a significant role in the motility of these structures by converting ATP energy into mechanical force, which facilitates the sliding of microtubule doublets within the axoneme, leading to the characteristic beating motion of cilia and flagella (Yu2022Identification; Sha2019DNAH17). 

In healthy human cells, DNAH17 is primarily expressed in the testis and is essential for the structural integrity and function of sperm flagella. It is involved in maintaining the proper structure and function of the flagella, which is crucial for sperm motility and male fertility (Sha2019DNAH17). The protein is expressed along the full length of the sperm flagella, indicating its role in ensuring the correct assembly and function of these structures (Sha2019DNAH17). 

DNAH17's activity is not limited to sperm; it is also expressed in other tissues, including the brain and lung, suggesting a broader role in ciliary function across different cell types (Yu2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH17 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting sperm motility and ciliary function. One of the main conditions linked to DNAH17 mutations is asthenozoospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility, which is a common cause of male infertility. Studies have identified missense variants in DNAH17 that lead to flagella destabilization, specifically affecting microtubule doublets 4-7, resulting in impaired sperm motility (Zhang2019A). These mutations cause structural defects in the sperm flagella, leading to severe asthenozoospermia and multiple morphological abnormalities of sperm flagella (MMAF) (Sha2019DNAH17).

DNAH17 mutations have also been implicated in left-right asymmetry disorders, such as situs inversus totalis and congenital heart disease. These conditions arise from defective cilia structure or function during embryonic development, which disrupts the normal asymmetrical positioning of visceral organs (Yu2022Identification; Breuer2022Exome). The gene's role in ciliary and flagellar disorders highlights its significance in both reproductive and developmental health, with mutations leading to a spectrum of phenotypes related to ciliary dysfunction (Yu2022Identification).
