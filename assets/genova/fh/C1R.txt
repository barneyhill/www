# C1R

## Overview
The C1R gene encodes the complement C1r protein, a serine protease that plays a pivotal role in the classical pathway of the complement system, an integral component of the innate immune response. The C1r protein is part of the C1 complex, which also includes C1q and C1s, and is responsible for initiating the complement cascade upon recognition of antibodies bound to pathogens. Structurally, C1r is characterized by a serine protease domain and complement control protein modules, which facilitate its interaction with other components of the C1 complex. The protein is primarily synthesized in the liver but is also expressed in other cell types, such as monocytes and endothelial cells. C1r's activity is tightly regulated to prevent excessive complement activation, with the C1-inhibitor playing a crucial role in this regulation. Mutations in the C1R gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including periodontal Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting its significance in immune system function and disease (Gröbner2019C1R; Szymańska2023The; Wu2011Clinical).

## Structure
The C1R protein, a component of the complement system, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by several distinct domains. It includes a serine protease (SP) domain, which is part of the chymotrypsin-like family, and is responsible for its catalytic activity. This domain contains 242 amino acids and features a typical chymotrypsin-like fold with two six-stranded β-barrels and a C-terminal α-helix (Arlaud2002Structural; BudayovaSpano2002The). The catalytic triad within the SP domain consists of Ser637, His485, and Asp540, located at the junction between the β-barrels (Arlaud2002Structural).

C1R also contains two complement control protein (CCP) modules, CCP1 and CCP2, which are involved in forming a non-covalent homodimer crucial for the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer (Arlaud2002Structural). The CCP1-CCP2 module pair has an extended, linear conformation, stabilized by van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds (BudayovaSpano2002The). The protein's quaternary structure is a head-to-tail homodimer, with a large central opening and extensive shape complementarity at the monomer interfaces (BudayovaSpano2002The).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at Asn497 and Asn564, with complex-type biantennary oligosaccharides (Arlaud2002Structural). The C1R protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
The C1R gene encodes the C1r protein, a serine protease that is a critical component of the C1 complex in the classical pathway of the complement system, an essential part of the innate immune response. In healthy human cells, C1r forms a tetrameric structure with C1s, assembling with C1q to create the C1 complex. This complex is responsible for recognizing and binding to antibodies attached to pathogens, initiating the complement cascade (Gröbner2019C1R; Wu2011Clinical).

Upon activation, C1r undergoes autoactivation and subsequently activates C1s by cleavage. This activation leads to the cleavage of C4 and C2, forming the C3 convertase, which is crucial for the continuation of the complement activation cascade. This process results in opsonization, recruitment of inflammatory cells, and lysis of pathogen membranes, thereby facilitating the clearance of pathogens and apoptotic cells (Nakagawa2003The; Almitairi2018Structure).

C1r is primarily synthesized in hepatocytes but is also found in other cell types, including monocytes and endothelial cells. Its activity is tightly regulated to prevent excessive activation, with the C1-inhibitor playing a key role in this regulation (Gál2009Early; Szymańska2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C1R gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably periodontal Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (pEDS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In pEDS, heterozygous C1R variants lead to constitutive activation of the C1r and C1s serine proteases, resulting in increased complement 1 activation. This activation is significant in periodontal homeostasis and inflammation, contributing to the pathology of pEDS (Gröbner2019C1R). The presence of active C1r variants in fibroblasts can lead to C1q-independent activation of the classical complement pathway, which is implicated in excessive inflammation and periodontitis (Gröbner2019C1R).

In the context of SLE, a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in the C1R gene has been identified, leading to low complement levels and a strong type I interferon inflammatory signature. This mutation is associated with early-onset SLE and suggests that complement deficiencies play a role in SLE pathogenesis (Demirkaya2017Brief). Another study identified a specific C1R mutation in an African-American patient with SLE, highlighting the role of C1R deficiencies as a genetic risk factor for the disease (Wu2011Clinical). These findings underscore the importance of C1R in immune system regulation and its potential impact on inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
C1R, a serine protease, is a key component of the C1 complex in the classical complement pathway. It interacts with C1q and C1s to form the C1 complex, which is essential for complement activation. The interaction between C1r and C1s is mediated through their CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domains, forming a calcium-dependent heterodimer that is crucial for the stability and function of the C1 complex (Almitairi2018Structure). 

C1R also forms a tetramer with C1s, known as the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer, which is stabilized by interactions between the catalytic domains of C1r (Gál2009Early). This tetramer is necessary for binding to C1q, facilitating the assembly and activation of the C1 complex (Almitairi2018Structure).

C1R interacts with the C1 inhibitor (C1 Inh), forming an inactive complex that includes two molecules of C1 Inh and one monomer each of C1r and C1s. This interaction involves non-covalent interactions and is crucial for regulating the activity of the C1 complex (Chesne1982Fluidphase). 

Mutations in C1R can lead to constitutive activation of the complement system, as seen in periodontal Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, where C1r variants affect the processing and secretion of the protein, leading to abnormal interactions with C1s and C1q (Gröbner2019C1R).
