# WDFY3

## Overview
WDFY3 is a gene that encodes the protein WD repeat and FYVE domain containing 3, commonly referred to as ALFY. This protein is a scaffold protein involved in autophagy, a critical cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. ALFY is characterized by its multidomain structure, which includes a BEACH domain, WD40 repeats, and a FYVE domain, each contributing to its role in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking (Zhang2018WD40; Dragich2016Autophagy). The protein is particularly significant in selective macroautophagy processes such as mitophagy and glycophagy, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy balance (Napoli2021Wdfy3; Napoli2018Beyond). WDFY3 is highly expressed in the brain and spleen, where it plays a crucial role in neuronal development and function. Mutations in this gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and congenital microcephaly, highlighting its importance in brain development and function (Kadir2016ALFYControlled; Dragich2016Autophagy).

## Structure
The WDFY3 gene encodes a large multidomain protein known as ALFY, which plays a significant role in autophagy and cellular signaling. The protein contains several distinct domains, including a BEACH domain, five WD40 domains, and a FYVE domain at the carboxyl terminus. The BEACH domain is involved in membrane trafficking and signal transduction, while the WD40 domains facilitate protein-protein interactions through a beta-propeller structure (Zhang2018WD40). The FYVE domain binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, targeting the protein to endosomal membranes, which is crucial for its role in autophagic processes (Dragich2016Autophagy).

The PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain within WDFY3 is involved in phospholipid binding, although its binding pocket is partially obstructed, necessitating conformational changes for effective binding (Le2019Pathogenic). The protein's structure is complex, with specific regions contributing to its stability and function, although detailed information on its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures is not provided in the available context (Le2019Pathogenic). The protein is evolutionarily conserved, with its most studied homolog being Blue Cheese in Drosophila melanogaster (Dragich2016Autophagy).

## Function
The WDFY3 gene encodes a scaffold protein known as ALFY, which plays a crucial role in autophagy, a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components. In healthy human cells, WDFY3 is involved in selective macroautophagy, particularly mitophagy and glycophagy, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy balance (Napoli2021Wdfy3; Napoli2018Beyond). WDFY3 facilitates the formation of autophagosomes by recruiting the autophagy machinery to ubiquitinated cargo, which is then delivered to lysosomes for degradation (Dragich2016Autophagy).

In neurons, WDFY3 is critical for maintaining mitochondrial function and distribution, as it regulates the removal of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy. This process is vital for sustaining brain bioenergetics and synaptic plasticity, which are crucial for memory formation and recall (Napoli2021Wdfy3; Napoli2018Beyond). WDFY3 also plays a role in glycogen metabolism, influencing synaptic density and neurotransmission by routing glycogen to lysosomal degradation (Napoli2021Wdfy3).

WDFY3 is highly expressed in the brain and spleen, where it regulates neuronal progenitor cell divisions and ensures proper brain development. Mutations in WDFY3 can lead to congenital microcephaly and are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (Kadir2016ALFYControlled; Dragich2016Autophagy).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDFY3 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These mutations can lead to variations in brain size, such as macrocephaly and microcephaly, depending on the specific variant. For instance, loss-of-function variants are linked to macrocephaly, while missense variants in the PH domain can result in microcephaly (Le2019Pathogenic). WDFY3 is also involved in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for brain development. Alterations in this pathway due to WDFY3 mutations can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders and affect brain size (Le2019Pathogenic).

In addition to its role in neurodevelopment, WDFY3 is essential for cardiac development. Wdfy3-deficient mice exhibit congenital heart defects, such as ventricular dilation and disorganized trabeculation, due to disrupted Notch1 signaling and reduced cardiomyocyte differentiation (Zhang2018WD40). The gene's involvement in selective macroautophagy, particularly mitophagy and glycophagy, is significant for maintaining cellular health. Mutations in WDFY3 can lead to decreased synaptic density and altered synaptic plasticity, contributing to neurological disorders (Napoli2021Wdfy3).

## Interactions
WDFY3, also known as ALFY, is a protein that plays a significant role in autophagy and cellular homeostasis through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with GABARAP, a member of the LC3/GABARAP protein family, which is crucial for LC3 lipidation and the efficient degradation of engulfed cargo during macrophage efferocytosis. This interaction facilitates phagosome formation and subsequent lysosomal degradation, highlighting WDFY3's role in the phagosome-lysosome fusion process (Shi2022Aa; Shi2022A).

WDFY3 also interacts with p62, an autophagy receptor that recognizes ubiquitinated cargo, facilitating their degradation via the autophagy lysosomal pathway. This interaction is essential for the selective degradation of protein aggregates, a process known as aggrephagy (Fun2024Adaptor). The protein contains several functional domains, including the PH-BEACH domain that associates with p62, the FYVE domain that binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), and WD40 repeats necessary for interaction with Atg5, which are crucial for the formation of autophagosomes around targeted cargo (Napoli2018Beyond; Fun2024Adaptor). These interactions underscore WDFY3's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases.
