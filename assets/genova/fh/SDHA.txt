# SDHA

## Overview
The SDHA gene encodes the succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A, a critical component of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also known as Complex II, which is integral to the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This gene is located on chromosome 5 and is responsible for producing a flavoprotein that plays a pivotal role in cellular respiration by catalyzing the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. The SDHA protein is a flavoprotein subunit that contains a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, essential for its enzymatic activity. As part of the SDH complex, SDHA contributes to the transfer of electrons to ubiquinone, linking the TCA cycle to oxidative phosphorylation and thus facilitating ATP production (Brière2005Succinate; Renkema2014SDHA). Mutations in the SDHA gene have been associated with various mitochondrial disorders and hereditary tumors, highlighting its significance in both energy metabolism and disease pathogenesis (Renkema2014SDHA; Wagner2013Loss).

## Structure
The SDHA protein is a flavoprotein subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, which plays a crucial role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It contains a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, essential for its function in catalyzing the oxidation of succinate to fumarate (Moosavi2019The; Robinson1992Isolation). The primary structure of SDHA includes a sequence that facilitates the binding of FAD, with a conserved histidine residue involved in the covalent attachment of the cofactor (Wood1984Nucleotide; Robinson1992Isolation).

The SDHA subunit forms part of the larger succinate dehydrogenase complex, which includes other subunits such as SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD. Together, SDHA and SDHB constitute the membrane extrinsic domain of the enzyme, extending into the mitochondrial matrix (Moosavi2019The). The tertiary structure of SDHA is characterized by a Rossman fold, a common motif for nucleotide binding, which is involved in the interaction with the AMP moiety of FAD (Robinson1992Isolation).

Post-translational modifications of SDHA may include phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the complex. Additionally, there are known splice variant isoforms of SDHA that can affect its function (Sharma2019Maturation).

## Function
The SDHA gene encodes a major catalytic subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also known as Complex II, which is integral to both the Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. SDHA is responsible for catalyzing the oxidation of succinate to fumarate, a critical step in the Krebs cycle that contributes to the production of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell (Brière2005Succinate; Renkema2014SDHA). This process occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where SDHA, along with other subunits, facilitates electron transfer to ubiquinone, linking the Krebs cycle to the electron transport chain (Brière2005Succinate).

In healthy human cells, SDHA plays a crucial role in cellular respiration and energy metabolism. It is involved in maintaining the balance of metabolic processes by participating in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which are essential for efficient energy production (Dalla2020Regulation). The activity of SDHA is regulated through post-translational modifications such as succinylation and desuccinylation, which can influence its enzymatic function and interaction with other proteins within the SDH complex (Ma2019SIRT5mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SDHA gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily due to their impact on mitochondrial function and tumorigenesis. SDHA mutations can lead to mitochondrial disorders such as Leigh syndrome and leukodystrophy, characterized by neurodegenerative symptoms including ataxia, dystonia, myopathy, and optic atrophy (Renkema2014SDHA). These mutations result in isolated complex II deficiency, affecting mitochondrial energy production and leading to decreased ATP production (Renkema2014SDHA).

In addition to mitochondrial diseases, SDHA mutations are implicated in hereditary tumors, such as paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas, due to their role as tumor suppressor genes (Renkema2014SDHA). In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), SDHA mutations are a common cause of SDH-deficient tumors, often leading to the loss of SDHA and SDHB protein expression (Pantaleo2013Analysis; Wagner2013Loss). These mutations are frequently germline, suggesting a genetic predisposition to tumor development (Pantaleo2013Analysis).

The SDHA c.91C>T mutation, resulting in a truncated protein, is a recurrent mutation found in various cancers, including GIST, neuroblastoma, and colon cancer, indicating its potential role as a low-penetrance allele (Dubard2018Germline).

## Interactions
SDHA, a subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. SDHA interacts with other subunits such as SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD to form the SDH complex, also known as Complex II. This complex is crucial for both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (Renkema2014SDHA).

The interaction between SDHA and SDH5 is particularly important for the assembly and function of the SDH complex. Desuccinylation of SDHA at lysine 547, mediated by SIRT5, reduces its binding affinity to SDH5, which is necessary for proper SDH assembly and function. This modification affects SDHA's activity and has implications in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumorigenesis (Moosavi2019Genetic; Ma2019SIRT5mediated).

SDHA is also subject to various post-translational modifications that influence its interactions and activity. For instance, phosphorylation by kinases such as FGR and c-Src affects electron transfer and reactive oxygen species generation, while deacetylation by SIRT3 enhances SDH activity (Moosavi2019Genetic). These interactions and modifications are vital for maintaining mitochondrial energy metabolism and have potential therapeutic implications in cancer treatment.
