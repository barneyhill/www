# ING4

## Overview
The ING4 gene encodes the protein inhibitor of growth family member 4, which is a critical component of the cellular machinery involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. As a member of the inhibitor of growth (ING) family, the ING4 protein is characterized by its plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, a zinc-binding motif that facilitates interaction with chromatin, specifically binding to histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) (Munoz2008Molecular; Palacios2006Solution). This interaction is essential for its role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. ING4 functions as a tumor suppressor, modulating cellular responses to hypoxia and enhancing the activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, thereby contributing to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Taheri2022Molecular; Cui2015The). The protein's involvement in various cellular processes, including its interaction with histone acetyltransferases and the NF-κB pathway, underscores its significance in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis (Ozer2005The; Jacquet2021ING). Downregulation of ING4 is associated with several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Byron2012Negative; Cui2015The).

## Structure
The ING4 protein is a member of the inhibitor of growth (ING) family and is characterized by several conserved domains. It contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, a zinc-binding motif crucial for chromatin interaction, which binds to histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) (Munoz2008Molecular; Palacios2006Solution). The PHD finger of ING4 is structured with a C4HC3 sequence motif that coordinates two Zn2+ atoms, stabilizing its loops, an antiparallel beta-sheet, and a one-turn helix (Palacios2006Solution). This domain is involved in gene expression regulation and chromatin remodeling (Palacios2006Solution).

The ING4 protein also features a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a Leucin Zipper-like (LZL) motif at the N-terminus (Raho2007Detection). The NLS is essential for its nuclear localization and interaction with p53, a key tumor suppressor protein (Raho2007Detection). Alternative splicing of the ING4 gene results in several variants, some of which affect the protein's ability to inhibit NF-kB activity and interact with chromatin (Unoki2006Novel; Raho2007Detection). These splice variants can lead to the loss of critical domains, such as the PHD finger, impacting the protein's function and localization (Li2009Reduced).

## Function
The ING4 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation in healthy human cells. ING4 is a component of the HBO1 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, which is essential for the acetylation of histone H4, a process critical for transcription regulation, DNA repair, recombination, and replication (Doyon2006ING). ING4 interacts with histone H3K4me3, promoting acetylation of histone H3, which is necessary for cell death and inhibition of anchorage-independent growth (Cui2015The).

ING4 also functions as a tumor suppressor by modulating the cellular response to hypoxia through chromatin remodeling, thereby influencing gene expression and preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Ozer2005The). It interacts with the p53 tumor suppressor, enhancing its transcriptional activity and leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Taheri2022Molecular; Cui2015The). ING4 is involved in the differentiation of prostate epithelial cells, acting downstream of Myc and Pten, and its loss is associated with prostate tumorigenesis (Berger2014Transient). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression, apoptosis, and cell cycle control, contributing to genomic stability (Taheri2022Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The ING4 gene is frequently downregulated in various cancers, including breast cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. This downregulation is often associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior (Byron2012Negative; Cui2015The). In breast cancer, low levels of ING4 expression correlate with larger tumor size, higher grade, and lymph node positivity, indicating a role in cancer progression (Byron2012Negative). ING4 downregulation is particularly prevalent in HER2-positive breast cancer, suggesting its involvement in HER2-driven cancer formation (Tapia2011Deletion).

Mechanisms for ING4 downregulation include deletion of chromosome 12p12-13, allelic loss, point mutations, and altered nuclear/cytoplasmic expression ratios (Cui2015The). Mutations in ING4, such as deletions affecting the nuclear localization signal, can lead to mislocalization and impaired function of the protein, contributing to tumorigenesis (Kim2004A).

ING4 also interacts with key proteins like p53 and NF-kappaB, influencing cell proliferation and survival. Its suppression of NF-kappaB activity is crucial, as NF-kappaB is often constitutively active in many cancers, promoting aggressive tumor behaviors (Byron2012Negative). ING4's interaction with liprin A1 is important for regulating cell motility, which is vital in preventing invasion and metastasis (Shen2007Inhibitor).

## Interactions
ING4 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It interacts with HPH-2, a factor known to regulate HIF-α stability, through its residues 191-249, which encompass the PHD domain. This interaction was confirmed using yeast two-hybrid screens, GST pull-down assays, and coimmunoprecipitation assays. However, ING4 is not a substrate for HPH-2 and does not affect HPH-2 activity or HIF stability (Ozer2005The).

ING4 also interacts with the RelA subunit of NF-κB, suppressing the expression of angiogenesis-related genes such as IL-6, IL-8, and Cox-2 (Ozer2005The). It is involved in chromatin remodeling by associating with histone acetyltransferases like TIP60, HBO1, and MOZ/MORF, suggesting a role in regulating chromatin acetylation and gene expression (Jacquet2021ING).

ING4 enhances the function of p53, a key regulator of gene transcription, apoptosis, and DNA repair, by interacting with protein complexes containing histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase (Kim2004A). These interactions highlight ING4's role in transcriptional regulation and its potential as a tumor suppressor.
