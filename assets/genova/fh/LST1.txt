# LST1

## Overview
The LST1 gene encodes the leukocyte specific transcript 1 protein, a transmembrane adaptor protein predominantly expressed in myeloid lineage cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. This protein plays a crucial role in immune system regulation and cellular communication, particularly through its involvement in the formation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), which facilitate intercellular transport and communication. LST1 acts as a scaffold at the plasma membrane, recruiting proteins essential for actin polymerization and membrane reorganization, thereby promoting TNT formation. The gene is located within the MHCIII locus, underscoring its potential role in immune response regulation. LST1's interactions with various proteins, including the small GTPase RalA and components of the exocyst complex, highlight its significance in cytoskeletal remodeling and immune signaling pathways (Schiller2012LST1; Weidle2018LST1:).

## Structure
The LST1 protein is a transmembrane protein involved in the formation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). It is characterized by small asymmetric transmembrane polypeptides that lack a cleavable signal sequence, utilizing an internal reverse signal-anchor sequence for membrane insertion. The transmembrane region is rich in glycine and leucine, followed by basic amino acid residues, resembling fusion-associated small transmembrane proteins (Schiller2012LST1). LST1 is highly expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells and undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in either short soluble molecules or transmembrane proteins (Schiller2012LST1).

LST1 interacts with several proteins, including the small GTPase RalA, filamin, myoferlin, and myosin II heavy chains, which are crucial for its role in TNT formation (Schiller2012LST1). The protein acts as a scaffold at the plasma membrane, recruiting RalA and other proteins to facilitate actin polymerization and membrane reorganization (Schiller2012LST1). Post-translational modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation and palmitoylation may regulate LST1's function and localization at specific plasma membrane sites (Schiller2012LST1). The protein is highly conserved in mammals, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function (Schiller2012LST1).

## Function
The LST1 (leukocyte specific transcript 1) gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in immune system regulation and cell communication. LST1 is primarily expressed in myeloid lineage cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. It is located in the MHCIII locus, suggesting a function in immune response regulation (Schiller2012LST1; Fabisik2021Regulation).

LST1 is a small transmembrane adaptor protein that forms homo-dimers via cysteine bridges and is involved in the formation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), which are membrane extensions that facilitate intercellular transport of vesicles and organelles. LST1 promotes TNT formation by recruiting the small GTPase RalA and the actin cross-linking protein Filamin to the plasma membrane, which is essential for actin polymerization and membrane complementation (Schiller2012LST1; Weidle2018LST1:).

LST1 also interacts with several proteins, including components of the exocyst complex, to promote the assembly of molecular machinery responsible for TNT formation. This interaction enhances the localization and interaction of proteins necessary for TNT formation, contributing to cell-cell communication and potentially antigen cross-presentation (Schiller2012LST1; Weidle2018LST1:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LST1 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Elevated LST1 expression in AML is associated with aggressive clinical features, such as high white blood cell counts and poor cytogenetic risk, and independently predicts worse overall survival outcomes. This suggests that LST1 could serve as a prognostic marker in AML, with potential therapeutic implications (Xu2024LST1).

LST1 is also implicated in immune dysfunctions, as it is involved in the regulation of immune responses. In the context of G6PC3 deficiency-related congenital neutropenia with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), LST1 is described as playing a role in immune dysfunction. Its expression is not restricted to immune cell populations, indicating a broader impact on immune regulation (Dasouki2021Comprehensive).

Additionally, LST1 is involved in the formation of tunneling nanotubes, which are crucial for intercellular communication. Alterations in LST1 expression can impair nanotube formation, potentially affecting processes such as viral spreading and prion transfer, although the clinical significance of these alterations is not fully understood (Schiller2012LST1).

## Interactions
LST1 (leukocyte specific transcript 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in immune response regulation and cellular communication. LST1 interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2, suggesting a role in the negative regulation of leukocyte signaling (Fabisik2021Regulation; Stepanek2014Palmitoylated). It is also implicated in the formation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), which facilitate intercellular communication. LST1 acts as a membrane scaffold, recruiting the small GTPase RalA and its effector filamin to the plasma membrane, which is crucial for actin polymerization and TNT formation (Schiller2012LST1). 

LST1's interaction with RalA promotes the assembly of a molecular machinery that includes the exocyst complex, myosin, and myoferlin, facilitating membrane deformation and fusion necessary for TNT formation (Schiller2012LST1). These interactions highlight LST1's role in cytoskeletal remodeling and intercellular transport processes. The protein's involvement in these interactions underscores its significance in both immune signaling and cellular communication pathways.
