# PRPF31

## Overview
The PRPF31 gene encodes the pre-mRNA processing factor 31, a protein integral to the spliceosome complex, which is responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a spliceosomal protein and plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, a core component of the spliceosome. By facilitating the formation of this complex, PRPF31 ensures the accurate removal of introns and the ligation of exons, which is essential for the generation of mature mRNA and the subsequent expression of diverse proteins from a single gene (Schaffert2004RNAi; Rose2017Gene). Mutations in PRPF31 are linked to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative retinal disease, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Li2021Prpf31; Xi2022Gene).

## Structure


## Function
The PRPF31 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the pre-mRNA splicing process, which is essential for gene expression in eukaryotic cells. The PRPF31 protein is a component of the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for removing introns from pre-mRNA transcripts and ligating exons to form mature mRNA. This process allows for the expression of multiple unique proteins from a single gene (Rose2017Gene).

PRPF31 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, a core component of the spliceosome. It acts as a bridging protein between the U4/U6 di-snRNP and the U5 snRNP, facilitating the formation and stabilization of the tri-snRNP complex, which is necessary for spliceosome activation (Schaffert2004RNAi; Rose2017Gene). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it ensures accurate mRNA processing (Liu2007Binding).

Mutations in PRPF31 can lead to defective splicing, resulting in a decrease in the assembly of tri-snRNPs and less efficient splicing, which is linked to diseases such as autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) (Li2021Prpf31; Rose2017Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRPF31 gene are a significant cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a degenerative eye disease characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptor cells, leading to symptoms such as night blindness and tunnel vision (Xi2022Gene; Waseem2007Mutations). PRPF31 mutations account for 6-11.1% of adRP cases and include frameshift, splice site, missense, and nonsense mutations, most of which result in loss of function (Xi2022Gene; Wheway2020Mutation). The disease exhibits incomplete penetrance, meaning not all individuals with a mutation in PRPF31 will develop symptoms. This variability is influenced by the expression levels of the non-mutant allele and other genetic factors, such as the CNOT3 gene, which can modulate the expression of PRPF31 (Venturini2012CNOT3; Wheway2020Mutation).

The retina-specific manifestation of PRPF31 mutations, despite the gene's ubiquitous expression, is attributed to the high splicing demand in retinal cells (Utz2013Autosomal). Gene augmentation therapy using AAV-mediated delivery has shown promise in preventing retinal degeneration in experimental models, highlighting potential therapeutic avenues for PRPF31-related retinitis pigmentosa (Xi2022Gene).

## Interactions
PRPF31 is a component of the spliceosome complex, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with several other spliceosomal proteins, including PRPF6 and PRPF8, facilitating the assembly and function of the spliceosome. These interactions are crucial for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts (ValdésSánchez2019Retinal).

The p.A216P mutation in PRPF31 affects its interactions by promoting the formation of insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. This mutation recruits the wild-type PRPF31 protein into these aggregates, reducing its presence in the soluble fraction and altering its nuclear translocation. This aggregation is associated with an increased expression of HSP70, a chaperone protein, which colocalizes with the aggregates, suggesting a role in managing protein aggregation (ValdésSánchez2019Retinal).

PRPF31 also interacts with PRPH2, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies. This interaction suggests a potential role in retinitis pigmentosa, a disorder characterized by photoreceptor and RPE dystrophy (Xiao2022PRPF31).

Additionally, PRPF31 binds directly to the USH1G/SANS protein, a component of the tri-snRNP complex involved in pre-mRNA processing. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the spliceosome, and pathogenic variants in USH1G/SANS can disrupt this interaction (Fritze2023Pathogenic).
