# PPP4R3A

## Overview
The PPP4R3A gene encodes the protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 3A, a regulatory component of the protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, cell cycle regulation, and microtubule dynamics. As a regulatory subunit, it modulates the activity of the PP4 catalytic subunit, influencing dephosphorylation events that are critical for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division. The protein is involved in key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and has been implicated in metabolic regulation, particularly in glucose metabolism. PPP4R3A's interactions with other proteins, including those involved in transcription-coupled splicing and chromosome segregation, underscore its diverse functional roles within the cell (Hu2024Identification; Christopher2017A; RéthiNagy2023Protein).

## Structure


## Function
The PPP4R3A gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, cell cycle regulation, and microtubule dynamics. In healthy human cells, PPP4R3A is involved in DNA double-strand break repair and DNA damage regulation, acting as a tumor suppressor by maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Hu2024Identification). It achieves this by negatively regulating cell cycle-related proteins such as Cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6, while upregulating p53 and p21, which are key regulators of the cell cycle (Hu2024Identification).

PPP4R3A is also implicated in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, where it inhibits pathway activation to control cell growth and proliferation (Hu2024Identification). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it modulates PP4 activity, influencing dephosphorylation events critical for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (RéthiNagy2023Protein). Additionally, PPP4R3A has been associated with glucose metabolism, where its expression levels influence fasting blood glucose levels and insulin resistance, suggesting a role in metabolic regulation (Christopher2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPP4R3A gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (FNMTC). In the context of Alzheimer's disease, the rs2273647-T variant of PPP4R3A is associated with a protective effect against metabolic decline in the posterior cingulate cortex, a region affected early in AD. This variant is linked to a reduced risk of conversion to mild cognitive impairment or AD and slower cognitive decline. The protective effect is thought to be due to its influence on gene expression, which is altered in the presence of AD pathology (Christopher2017A).

In familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma, a novel germline missense mutation, Asp409Asn, in PPP4R3A has been identified. This mutation is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting a loss of tumor-suppressive function. The mutation activates the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration, and is not commonly found in sporadic thyroid cancer cases, indicating its potential role as a susceptibility gene for FNMTC (Hu2024Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPP4R3A mutations in both neurodegenerative and cancerous conditions.

## Interactions
PPP4R3A, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It forms a complex with the PP4 catalytic subunit (PP4C) and PP4 regulatory subunit 2 (PPP4R2), which is essential for its interaction with PP4 regulatory subunit 3 (PP4R3) (Gingras2005A). This complex, known as PP4cs, is specific to PP4C and does not interact with other related phosphatases like PP2AC or PP6C (Gingras2005A).

PPP4R3A also interacts with proteins containing the FxxP motif, which is recognized by its EVH1 domain. This interaction is crucial for substrate specificity and is involved in processes such as cohesin release, where PPP4R3A interacts with WAPL, a protein involved in chromosome segregation (Ueki2019A). The FxxP motif is a key determinant for binding, and its interaction with PPP4R3A is regulated by phosphorylation, as seen in proteins like CCDC6 (Ueki2019A).

Additionally, PPP4R3A is involved in interactions with splicing-associated proteins, such as PRPF19 and DHX38, indicating its role in transcription-coupled splicing (Youn2018High-Density). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of PPP4R3A in cellular processes.
