# C10orf62

## Overview
C10orf62, also known as FAM192A, is a gene located on chromosome 10 that encodes the protein chromosome 10 open reading frame 62. This protein is primarily involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability. The C10orf62 protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other nuclear proteins to ensure genomic integrity. While the precise molecular functions and pathways of C10orf62 are still under investigation, its involvement in these fundamental processes underscores its importance in normal cellular function and organismal health. The protein's nuclear activity suggests a protective role in maintaining the cell's genetic material, potentially preventing mutations that could lead to various diseases (KIM2012A). Understanding the mechanisms by which C10orf62 operates could provide valuable insights into its contributions to cellular homeostasis and its implications in disease states.

## Function
C10orf62, also known as FAM192A, is a gene located on chromosome 10 that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes. This protein plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability. In healthy human cells, the C10orf62 protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it may interact with other nuclear proteins to ensure the integrity of the genome. The precise molecular functions and pathways of C10orf62 are still under investigation, but its involvement in these fundamental processes suggests it is crucial for normal cellular function and organismal health. The protein's activity in the nucleus indicates its potential role in safeguarding the cell's genetic material, thereby preventing mutations that could lead to various diseases. Understanding the exact mechanisms by which C10orf62 operates could provide insights into its contributions to cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease states.

## Clinical Significance
C10orf62, also known as FAM192A, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In the context of male infertility, particularly nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA), C10orf62 is significantly underexpressed in men with NOA compared to those with some sperm presence. This underexpression suggests a potential role in spermatogenesis, specifically in spermatid development, and highlights its relevance in understanding the genetic basis of azoospermia (Cheung2024Genetic).

In cancer research, C10orf62 has been identified as KP-OVA-38, a cancer/testis antigen in ovarian cancer. Although its clinical significance in ovarian cancer is not detailed, it was noted for its seroreactivity in a small subset of ovarian cancer patients, indicating a potential role in cancer immunotherapy (KIM2012A). The gene's expression patterns and regulation by DNA methylation in cancer cells suggest it could be a target for therapeutic interventions, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its role in cancer pathogenesis (KIM2012A).
