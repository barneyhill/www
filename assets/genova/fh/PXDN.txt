# PXDN

## Overview
Peroxidasin (PXDN) is a gene that encodes the peroxidasin protein, a heme peroxidase enzyme involved in the formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The PXDN gene is crucial for encoding a protein that plays a significant role in the crosslinking of collagen IV, a key structural component of basement membranes, through the formation of sulfilimine bonds. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical strength of the ECM, which supports various cellular functions, including adhesion and migration (Dempsey2022Uric; Lázár2015Structure–function). Peroxidasin is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein and is abundantly expressed in several tissues, where it is vital for endothelial cell survival and growth signaling. The protein's interactions with other ECM components, such as laminin, further underscore its importance in ECM assembly and function (Sevcnikar2020The; Lee2020Peroxidasin). Mutations in the PXDN gene are linked to various developmental eye disorders and have implications in cancer progression and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Kim2019Biallelic; Zhou2022A).

## Structure
Peroxidasin (PXDN) is a heme peroxidase enzyme with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of PXDN features a signal peptide, leucine-rich repeats, immunoglobulin-like domains, and a peroxidase domain, which are typical of extracellular matrix components (Lázár2015Structure–function). The secondary structure of PXDN includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a functional conformation necessary for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other molecules.

PXDN functions as a trimer, with its quaternary structure stabilized by disulfide bonds between conserved cysteine residues, specifically C736 and C1315. This trimerization is crucial for its role in collagen IV crosslinking, as it facilitates the formation of sulfilimine bonds between collagen IV trimers (Lázár2015Structure–function). Mutations in these cysteine residues result in monomeric forms of PXDN, which are less effective in collagen IV crosslinking (Lázár2015Structure–function). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may also play a role in PXDN's function and stability, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
Peroxidasin (PXDN) is a heme-peroxidase enzyme that plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in human cells. It is primarily involved in the crosslinking of collagen IV in the basement membrane, a process essential for maintaining structural integrity and function. PXDN catalyzes the formation of sulfilimine bonds between the NC1 domains of adjacent collagen IV protomers, using hypobromous acid (HOBr) as a catalyst. This crosslinking is crucial for the stability and mechanical strength of the basement membrane, which supports various cellular functions, including cell adhesion and migration (Dempsey2022Uric; Lee2020Peroxidasin).

PXDN is abundantly expressed in several tissues and is particularly important for endothelial cell survival and growth signaling. It is involved in ECM assembly, influencing the deposition of components like fibronectin and laminin, and is essential for ECM-mediated signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and survival (Lee2020Peroxidasin). PXDN's activity is significant for proper endothelial function, and its disruption can lead to endothelial dysfunction, which is associated with various cardiovascular diseases (Dempsey2022Uric). PXDN also plays a role in angiogenesis and cell proliferation, extending its influence to physiological and pathological processes, including cardiovascular disorders and cancer progression (Dempsey2022Uric).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PXDN gene are associated with several eye disorders and other conditions. In humans, PXDN mutations can lead to anterior segment dysgenesis, microphthalmia, cataracts, glaucoma, and other severe eye malformations. These conditions are often linked to developmental defects in the eye, as seen in both human cases and animal models (Kim2019Biallelic; Choi2014Novel). For instance, biallelic deletion of PXDN in mice results in anophthalmia and disorganized eye structures, highlighting its critical role in eye development (Kim2019Biallelic).

PXDN is also implicated in cancer progression. Its expression varies across different tumor types, and it is associated with poor prognosis in prostate and bladder cancers. High PXDN expression is linked to increased drug resistance and unfavorable outcomes in immunotherapy (Zhou2022A). Additionally, PXDN is involved in the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) through its role in inflammation and oxidative stress pathways. Overexpression of PXDN exacerbates AAA by promoting vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic switch, while its inhibition by alpha-ketoglutarate shows protective effects (Liu2022Alphaketoglutarate).

## Interactions
Peroxidasin (PXDN) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the extracellular matrix (ECM). PXDN plays a crucial role in the cross-linking of collagen IV, a key component of basement membranes, by catalyzing the formation of sulfilimine bonds between collagen IV protomers (Kovács2021Characterization; Lázár2015Structure–function). This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the ECM.

PXDN also interacts with laminin, another major ECM protein. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of PXDN is significant for its binding to laminin, as demonstrated by various constructs of PXDN showing different affinities for laminin in binding assays (Sevcnikar2020The). This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly and function of basement membranes.

In the context of cancer, PXDN is upregulated in glioblastoma and melanoma, where it is associated with increased invasiveness and poor prognosis. In glioblastoma, PXDN is linked to several cancer pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways, and interacts with proteins such as COL4A1 and COL5A1 (Shi2022Peroxidase). In melanoma, PXDN expression correlates with the invasive potential of the cells, highlighting its role in ECM modification and cancer progression (PaumannPage2021Peroxidasin).
