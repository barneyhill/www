# ZNF559

## Overview
ZNF559 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 559, which is part of the KRAB zinc finger protein (KZFP) family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 559 is involved in gene regulation processes and has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Tourette Syndrome (TS), through its association with genetic mutations and de novo coding variants (Carias2019Clinical; Bensaid2019Multihit). Additionally, ZNF559 has been studied in the context of glioblastoma, where it is noted for its genetic alterations in tumor samples (Adeberg2022DNAmethylomeassisted).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF559 has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through studies involving consanguineous families. It is identified as one of the eight genes strongly associated with ASD in families linked to the FEZF2 allele. The gene is part of a cluster of KRAB zinc finger protein (KZFP) genes involved in gene regulation, and its mutations are considered part of the multi-hit hypothesis in ASD, where multiple genetic mutations are necessary to generate an ASD phenotype (Bensaid2019Multihit).

In a study analyzing genetic data from individuals with Tourette Syndrome (TS) and ASD, ZNF559 was identified among genes with de novo coding variants. Although the study did not provide specific details on the clinical significance of ZNF559 mutations, it suggested a potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders due to the gene's intolerance to likely gene-disrupting or missense mutations (Carias2019Clinical).

ZNF559 is also mentioned in the context of glioblastoma research, where it is noted as a paralog of ZNF177 on chromosome 19. The study observed a copy number loss in tumors associated with the subventricular zone, although the clinical implications of this finding were not detailed (Adeberg2022DNAmethylomeassisted).
