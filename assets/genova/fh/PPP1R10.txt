# PPP1R10

## Overview
The PPP1R10 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 10, also known as PNUTS or NIPP1, which is a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). This protein plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, pre-mRNA splicing, and DNA damage response. As a regulatory subunit, PNUTS modulates the activity of PP1 by forming a holoenzyme complex, which is essential for the controlled dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins. The protein is characterized by specific domains that facilitate its interactions with PP1 and other cellular components, such as the ForkHead-Associated (FHA) domain and PP1-anchoring and inhibitory domains (Winkler2018Overexpression). PNUTS is also involved in significant cellular interactions, including those with the MYC oncoprotein and the P-TEFb complex, highlighting its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling pathways (Wei2021The; Kapoor2015The). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target (Agnelli2009A; Liu2021A).

## Function
PPP1R10, also known as NIPP1, is a nuclear protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a key enzyme involved in various cellular processes. PPP1R10 forms a holoenzyme complex with PP1, which is essential for the regulated dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins. This regulation is mediated through its ForkHead-Associated (FHA) domain, which binds substrates, a central PP1-anchoring domain, and a C-terminal PP1-inhibitory domain. The effective dephosphorylation of substrates requires the removal of the inhibitory domain, allowing controlled dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins recruited via the FHA domain (Winkler2018Overexpression).

PPP1R10 is involved in transcriptional silencing, pre-mRNA splicing, and the regulation of protein kinase MELK. It also plays a significant role in DNA damage signaling and repair, as its overexpression can lead to replication stress and accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This is associated with reduced expression of DNA-damage signaling and repair proteins, indicating its role in setting the threshold for DNA repair (Winkler2018Overexpression).

In healthy cells, PPP1R10 is implicated in cell cycle regulation, particularly in delaying mitotic entry, and is associated with nuclear speckles and FHA ligands (Winkler2018Overexpression).

## Clinical Significance
The PPP1R10 gene, also known as PNUTS, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or mutations. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high levels of PPP1R10 are associated with a decreased risk of poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Liu2021A). In multiple myeloma, PPP1R10 is overexpressed in specific patient clusters, indicating its involvement in the disease's genomic alterations (Agnelli2009A). 

In the context of TFEB translocation renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), PPP1R10 has been identified as a potential fusion partner with TFEB, suggesting a role in the genomic rearrangements characteristic of these tumors (Xia2019Clinicopathologic). 

Additionally, PPP1R10 has been mentioned in the context of bone tumors, where a FOSB fusion gene is brought under the control of the PPP1R10 promoter, similar to alterations seen in certain vascular tumors (Baumhoer2018An). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPP1R10 in cancer and suggest its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention. However, specific diseases directly caused by mutations in PPP1R10 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Interactions
PPP1R10, also known as PNUTS, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. PNUTS interacts with PP1 through specific motifs, including a modified RVXF motif and a hydrophobic FF motif, which are crucial for its binding affinity (Casamayor2020Controlling). This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation, particularly at Thr 398, which decreases PNUTS's affinity for PP1 (Kim2003PNUTS). PNUTS also binds to RNA, with its C-terminal region containing RGG boxes and a histidine/glycine-rich domain responsible for high-affinity interactions with poly(A) and poly(G) sequences (Kim2003PNUTS).

PNUTS is involved in the regulation of HIV-1 replication by interacting with the P-TEFb complex, which includes cyclin T1 and CDK9. It inhibits HIV-1 transcription by interfering with the interaction between these components (Kapoor2015The). PNUTS also interacts with the MYC oncoprotein, recruiting it to the PNUTS:PP1 phosphatase complex via the MYC-MB0 region, which affects MYC phosphorylation, activity, and stability (Wei2021The). These interactions highlight PNUTS's role in modulating transcriptional processes and cellular signaling pathways.
