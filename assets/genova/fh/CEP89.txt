# CEP89

## Overview
CEP89 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 89, a critical component of the distal appendages of centrioles. This protein plays a pivotal role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, by facilitating the docking of centrioles to the cell membrane, which is essential for the initiation of cilia formation (Tanos2013Centriole). As a centrosomal protein, CEP89 is involved in the structural integrity and function of distal appendages, contributing to the anchoring of cilia to the plasma membrane and the regulation of protein trafficking within the ciliary compartment (Tischer2021Accessorizing). The protein's localization and function are regulated by mitotic kinases, indicating its involvement in cell cycle processes (Tischer2021Accessorizing). Mutations in the CEP89 gene have been linked to various diseases, including ciliopathies and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Skalická2018Genetic; Wiecek2021Genomic).

## Structure


## Function
CEP89, also known as centrosomal protein 89, is a crucial component of the distal appendages (DAPs) of centrioles, playing a significant role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation. It is recruited to centrioles by CEP83 and is essential for the centriole-to-membrane docking, a critical step for initiating cilia formation (Tanos2013Centriole). CEP89 is part of a sequence of proteins, including CEP83, SCLT1, CEP164, and ANKRD26, that contribute to the structural integrity and function of DAPs, which are necessary for anchoring cilia to the plasma membrane and facilitating the selective targeting and sorting of proteins to and from the ciliary compartment (Tischer2021Accessorizing).

CEP89 localizes to the inner-most region of the DAP structure and is involved in the hierarchical organization of DAPs and subdistal appendages (sDAPs) (Tischer2021Accessorizing). Its centrosomal localization is regulated during mitosis by the mitotic kinase NEK2A, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation (Tischer2021Accessorizing). The loss of CEP89 disrupts ciliogenesis, even when other pathways remain intact, underscoring its essential role in this process (Tanos2013Centriole).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CEP89 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), pathogenic variants in CEP89, which encodes a centrosomal protein essential for ciliogenesis, have been identified. These genetic changes may contribute to the loss of cilia in renal cyst epithelial cells, thereby playing a role in the progression of ADPKD (Skalická2018Genetic).

In cancer, CEP89 is recognized as a modulator of G0 cell cycle arrest. Its amplification is associated with fast cycling tumors and high genomic instability, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer. Increased CEP89 expression correlates with a worse prognosis, suggesting its role in modulating cell cycle arrest and tumor growth. Targeting the processes regulated by CEP89 could be a potential therapeutic strategy to control tumor proliferation (Wiecek2021Genomic).

CEP89 is also involved in primary cilium assembly and mitochondrial function, which may influence the balance between cell proliferation and arrest in cancer cells. These functions highlight its significance in both ciliopathies and cancer-related pathways (Wiecek2021Genomic).

## Interactions
CEP89 (centrosomal protein 89) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in ciliary function and centrosome integrity. One of its primary interactions is with Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS1), a stoichiometric interactor identified through tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of ciliary vesicles to the distal appendage of the mother centriole, a key step in primary cilium formation. The interaction between CEP89 and NCS1 requires the N-terminal region of CEP89, while the C-terminal portion is necessary for centrosomal localization (Kanie2023Myristoylated).

CEP89 also interacts with C3ORF14, acting as a bridge between NCS1 and C3ORF14, as demonstrated by in vitro binding assays. However, C3ORF14 does not directly bind to NCS1 (Kanie2023Myristoylated). The interaction between CEP89 and NCS1 has been confirmed through multiple experimental approaches, including co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays, indicating a direct physical interaction (Kanie2023Myristoylated).

CEP89 is also a substrate of tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2), which phosphorylates it along with other proteins involved in ciliogenesis. This phosphorylation occurs in intrinsically disordered regions and is significant for the assembly of distal appendages (Bernatik2020Phosphorylation).
