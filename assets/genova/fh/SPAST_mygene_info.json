cellular activities) protein family. Members of this protein family share an ATPase domain and have roles in diverse cellular processes including membrane trafficking, intracellular motility, organelle biogenesis, protein folding, and proteolysis. The use of alternative translational initiation sites in this gene results in a single transcript variant that can produce isoforms that differ in the length of their N-terminus and which thereby differ in the efficiency of their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In addition, alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode isoforms that differ in other protein regions as well. One isoform of this gene has been shown to be a microtubule-severing enzyme that regulates microtubule abundance, mobility, and plus-end distribution. Mutations in this gene cause the most frequent form of autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia 4.
