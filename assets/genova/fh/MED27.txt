# MED27

## Overview
MED27 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 27, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The Mediator complex serves as a bridge between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, facilitating the transcription of genes. MED27, specifically, is part of the head module of the Mediator complex, which is directly associated with RNA polymerase II, indicating its role in transcription initiation and regulation (Richter2022The). The protein is characterized by its structural features, including a globular C-terminal domain and an RWD domain with a zinc finger motif, which are conserved across eukaryotes, underscoring its essential role in the complex (Zhao2021Structure; Rengachari2021Structure). MED27 is implicated in various cellular processes, including alternative splicing and signal transduction pathways, and has been associated with cancer progression, particularly melanoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rienzo2014RNASeq; Tang2016MED27).

## Structure
The MED27 protein is a subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex, specifically part of the upper Tail module, which also includes MED28, MED29, and MED30. These subunits are similar in size and structure, each being 180-200 amino acids long. MED27 features a globular C-terminal domain of approximately 100 amino acids, which is distinct from the rest of the subunit (Zhao2021Structure). The N-terminal coiled coils of MED27 interact with the C-terminal portion of MED16 in the lower Tail and wrap around the backside of the MED14 C-terminus towards the Mediator core. The α-helices following the N-terminal coiled coil in MED27 interdigitate with the coiled coils of MED28-30 to form a 6-helix bundle (Zhao2021Structure).

In the human Mediator complex, MED27 forms an RWD domain with a C-terminal 'zinc finger' motif and is positioned between the fixed and movable jaws of the head module. It interacts with MED20, the extended C-terminal region of MED17, and a region in the MED14 beam (Rengachari2021Structure). The structure of MED27 is highly conserved across eukaryotes, indicating its essential role in the Mediator complex (Rengachari2021Structure).

## Function
MED27 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, a crucial component in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The Mediator complex acts as a bridge between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, facilitating the transcription of genes. MED27 is part of the head module of the Mediator complex, which is directly associated with RNA polymerase II, suggesting its role in transcription initiation and regulation (Richter2022The).

In endothelial progenitor cells, MED27 is involved in the generation of novel transcripts through alternative splicing, which may lead to the production of new protein isoforms. These isoforms could potentially affect gene regulation by altering miRNA binding sites, although no miRNA response elements were detected for the newly identified 3′ UTR of MED27 (Rienzo2014RNASeq).

The novel isoform of MED27 identified in endothelial progenitor cells is predicted to have a nuclear localization, indicating that its activity is likely centered in the nucleus (Rienzo2014RNASeq). The exact function of MED27 in healthy human cells remains unclear, but its involvement in transcription regulation and potential role in cellular processes such as differentiation and response to environmental signals are suggested by its participation in the Mediator complex (Rienzo2014RNASeq).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the MED27 gene have been implicated in the progression of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. MED27 is highly expressed in melanoma cells and tissues, and its overexpression is associated with enhanced melanoma growth and poor prognosis. It promotes melanoma cell proliferation and survival by modulating key signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, and NF-κB/iNOS pathways. Knockdown of MED27 in melanoma cells leads to decreased cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in melanoma treatment (Tang2016MED27).

In addition to its role in cancer, MED27 has been studied in the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A chromosomal translocation disrupting the MED27 gene was identified in a patient with ASD, although this disruption was not considered responsible for the ASD phenotype. The study noted that MED27 is not associated with any human Mendelian or complex diseases beyond some cancers, and its single copy loss of function is not expected to cause pathological consequences (Toraman2021Finding). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in cancer and its limited association with other diseases.

## Interactions
MED27, a component of the Mediator complex, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation. It interacts with Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) in breast cancer cells, where its expression influences Sp1 levels, affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis (wang2020med27). In melanoma cells, MED27 interacts with NF-κB and p300, a transcriptional co-activator. This interaction is significant as p300 acetylates MED27, enhancing its role in regulating gene expression, particularly iNOS expression, through cooperation with NF-κB (Tang2016MED27). MED27 also influences the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, promoting melanoma cell proliferation and survival (Tang2016MED27).

In the context of the Mediator complex, MED27 is phosphorylated by CDK11, which facilitates its association with the regulatory module of the complex. This interaction is essential for coupling transcription initiation and elongation, highlighting MED27's role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the Mediator complex (Malik2017Emerging). These interactions underscore MED27's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
