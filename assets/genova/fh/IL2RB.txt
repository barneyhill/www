# IL2RB

## Overview
The IL2RB gene encodes the interleukin 2 receptor subunit beta (IL-2Rβ), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by forming part of the interleukin-2 receptor complex. This receptor complex is crucial for the regulation of T cells, particularly in the context of immune tolerance and the prevention of autoimmune responses. IL-2Rβ, along with the alpha and gamma subunits, constitutes the high-affinity receptor for interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine that is essential for T cell proliferation and survival (Hatakeyama1989Interleukin2; Spolski2018Biology). The IL-2Rβ chain is involved in activating intracellular signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, which are vital for the immune response (Jones2020Dynamic). Mutations in IL2RB can lead to severe immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2018Human).

## Structure
The IL2RB gene encodes the interleukin-2 receptor beta (IL-2Rβ) chain, a critical component of the interleukin-2 receptor complex involved in immune regulation. The primary structure of IL-2Rβ consists of 551 amino acids, with the mature form comprising 525 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 58,358 daltons (Hatakeyama1989Interleukin2). The protein includes a signal sequence, an extracellular region, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region (Hatakeyama1989Interleukin2).

The secondary structure features a transmembrane region characterized by a hydrophobic stretch of 25 amino acids, likely forming the membrane-spanning region (Hatakeyama1989Interleukin2). The extracellular domain contains fibronectin type III domains, D1 and D2, which are characterized by a beta-sandwich sheet with seven antiparallel strands (Wang2005Structure).

In terms of tertiary structure, the D1 and D2 domains are connected by a helical linker and are bent at approximately 90 degrees (Wang2005Structure). The quaternary structure involves IL-2Rβ forming a complex with IL-2, IL-2Rα, and the common gamma chain (gc), with IL-2Rβ contributing to the intermediate-affinity receptor form (Hatakeyama1989Interleukin2; Wang2005Structure).

Post-translational modifications include potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which may account for the size difference between the calculated and observed molecular weights (Hatakeyama1989Interleukin2). The IL-2Rβ chain does not belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and does not show significant similarity to other known proteins (Hatakeyama1989Interleukin2).

## Function
The IL2RB gene encodes the interleukin-2 receptor beta chain, a critical component of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex, which also includes the alpha (IL2RA) and gamma (IL2RG) subunits. This receptor complex is essential for the regulation of T cells, including T regulatory cells (Tregs), which are vital for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune responses (Spolski2018Biology; Pol2019Effects). 

IL2RB is involved in several intracellular signaling pathways, primarily activating the JAK/STAT pathway. Upon IL-2 binding, IL2RB recruits and activates JAK1 and JAK3 kinases, leading to the phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT5, which translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression involved in immune responses (Jones2020Dynamic; Pol2019Effects). This signaling is crucial for T cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, influencing the development of various T cell subsets, including CD8+ T cells and Tregs (Spolski2018Biology; Chinen2016An).

IL2RB is constitutively expressed on T and NK(T) lymphocytes and plays a role in the positive feedback loop of IL-2 signaling, which is essential for the function of Tregs in maintaining immunological self-tolerance and down-regulating inflammatory responses (Pol2019Effects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL2RB gene, which encodes the interleukin 2 receptor subunit beta, are associated with severe immunodeficiency and autoimmunity. These mutations can lead to a condition characterized by immune dysregulation, including symptoms such as enteropathy, skin abnormalities, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and increased susceptibility to infections (Zhang2018Human). Specific mutations, such as L77P, S40L, and Q96*, disrupt IL-2Rb function through various mechanisms, resulting in impaired IL-2 signaling crucial for immune function (Zhang2018Human). 

Patients with IL2RB mutations often exhibit a failure to phosphorylate STAT5 in response to IL-2 or IL-15 stimulation, leading to a reduction in regulatory T cells, which are essential for maintaining immune tolerance (Zhang2018Human). The clinical presentation of IL2RB deficiency can resemble IPEX-like syndrome, with decreased regulatory T cell frequency and lymphocytic infiltration into multiple tissues (Fernandez2019A). 

Current treatment options include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, although this carries significant risks (Zhang2018Human). Research into potential therapeutic strategies, such as enhancing IL-2/IL-2R interactions, is ongoing (Zhang2018Human).

## Interactions
The IL2RB gene encodes the interleukin 2 receptor subunit beta, which is a critical component of the IL-2 receptor complex. This complex is a heterotrimeric structure that includes the IL-2Rα (CD25) and IL-2Rγ (CD132) subunits. IL2RB interacts with the common γ-chain (IL2RG) and is essential for the receptor's function in immune signaling (Campbell2019IL2RB). The IL-2 receptor complex is shared with other cytokine receptors, such as those for IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, indicating its role in a broad range of immune responses (Campbell2019IL2RB).

IL2RB is involved in activating downstream signaling pathways, including the phosphorylation of STAT5, which is crucial for T-cell proliferation and immune response regulation (Campbell2019IL2RB). The IL2RB protein also interacts with signaling components JAK3 and STAT5, which are vital for receptor activation and subsequent signaling (Campbell2019IL2RB). Mutations in IL2RB can lead to reduced expression or misfolding of the IL-2Rβ, affecting its interactions and signaling capacity, which can result in severe immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases (Campbell2019IL2RB).
