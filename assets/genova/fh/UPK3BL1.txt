# UPK3BL1

## Overview
The UPK3BL1 gene encodes the protein uroplakin 3B like 1, which is a member of the uroplakin family, known for their role in forming the asymmetric unit membrane of urothelial cells. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the urothelium. While the specific biological functions of UPK3BL1 are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular processes, including embryonic development and tumor differentiation. The gene's expression patterns have been linked to several diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, highlighting its potential significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Stroggilos2019Proteome‐based; Ziff2023Integrated; Sosa2023Disruption).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The UPK3BL1 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), UPK3BL1 was found to be differentially expressed in certain genetic subgroups, including C9orf72, TARDBP, and FUS, suggesting a potential role in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Ziff2023Integrated; Ziff2022Metaanalysis; Ziff2022Genome). However, the specific clinical significance of these expression changes in ALS remains unclear.

In nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), UPK3BL1 is associated with the NPS3 subtype, which is characterized by a luminal phenotype and considered to be of lower risk compared to other subtypes. This suggests that UPK3BL1 expression may be linked to tumor differentiation and risk stratification in bladder cancer (Stroggilos2019Proteome‐based).

In bovine preimplantation embryos, UPK3BL1 was significantly upregulated in knockout morula embryos lacking the csf2ra gene, indicating its involvement in early embryonic development and gene expression regulation, although the direct clinical implications for humans are not addressed (Sosa2023Disruption). Overall, while UPK3BL1 is associated with various conditions, its precise clinical significance requires further investigation.
