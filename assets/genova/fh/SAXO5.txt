# SAXO5

## Overview
SAXO5 is a gene that encodes the protein stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 5, which is a member of the microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) family. This protein is primarily involved in the stabilization of axonemal microtubules, which are key structural components of cilia and flagella. These organelles are essential for cell motility and sensory functions, playing a significant role in various physiological processes. SAXO5 is particularly noted for its presence in the cilia outer doublets of mammalian spermatozoa, indicating its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these microtubules. The protein is characterized by Mn repeat units, conserved motifs that facilitate its binding to microtubule structures, underscoring its evolutionary significance in cilia, especially within human airway epithelial cells and sperm flagella (Andersen2024Uncovering).

## Function
SAXO5, also known as stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 5, plays a crucial role in the stabilization of axonemal microtubules, which are integral components of cilia and flagella. These structures are essential for cell motility and sensory functions. SAXO5 is identified in the cilia outer doublets of mammalian spermatozoa, suggesting its involvement in cilia function, particularly in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these microtubules (Andersen2024Uncovering).

The protein is part of a broader family of microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) that are associated with cilia structure and function. These proteins are characterized by the presence of Mn repeat units, which are conserved motifs important for binding to microtubule structures. The evolutionary conservation of these motifs highlights their significance in cilia, especially in human airway epithelial cells and sperm flagella (Andersen2024Uncovering).

SAXO5's role in stabilizing axonemal microtubules impacts cellular processes such as signaling and movement, contributing to the proper functioning of cilia and flagella. This stabilization is vital for the structural and functional integrity of these organelles, which are critical for various physiological processes in humans.
