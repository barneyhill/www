# DNASE2B

## Overview
DNASE2B is a gene that encodes the protein deoxyribonuclease 2 beta, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of nuclear DNA. This enzyme plays a critical role in the differentiation of lens fiber cells by facilitating the breakdown of the nuclear membrane and subsequent DNA degradation, processes essential for maintaining lens transparency and preventing cataracts (Siddam2018The). While DNASE2B is expressed in various tissues, including the salivary glands and lungs, its function is most clearly defined in the context of lens development in mice (Mori2022Origin; Bai2023Pan‑cancer). In humans, DNASE2B is also expressed in salivary glands and alveolar macrophages, where it likely contributes to DNA degradation, although its specific roles in these tissues remain less well understood (Mori2022Origin).

## Function
DNASE2B is a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of nuclear DNA during lens fiber cell differentiation, a process crucial for maintaining lens transparency and preventing cataracts. In the lens, DNASE2B facilitates the breakdown of the nuclear membrane, allowing it to access and degrade nuclear DNA, which is essential for the proper differentiation of lens fiber cells (Siddam2018The). This enzyme is positively regulated by the RNA-binding protein Celf1, which ensures high levels of DNASE2B mRNA, necessary for effective nuclear degradation (Siddam2018The).

DNASE2B is expressed in various tissues, including the salivary glands and lungs, but its function is most clearly defined in the context of lens development in mice (Mori2022Origin; Bai2023Pan‑cancer). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the breakdown of DNA during cellular processes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and tissue remodeling. In humans, DNASE2B is expressed in salivary glands and alveolar macrophages, where it likely plays a role in DNA degradation, although its specific functions in these tissues are less well understood (Mori2022Origin).
