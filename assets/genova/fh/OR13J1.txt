# OR13J1

## Overview
The OR13J1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily J member 1, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways upon binding specific odorants. While OR13J1 is predominantly associated with olfactory functions, it is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the human retina, where its role is less understood and may involve non-olfactory signaling pathways (Jovancevic2017Deep). Additionally, OR13J1 has been implicated in colorectal cancer, with mutations identified in adenocarcinoma tissues, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Zhou2013Exome). Despite these associations, the full spectrum of OR13J1's physiological and pathological functions remains to be elucidated, warranting further investigation.

## Function
The human gene OR13J1 encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily known for its role in detecting odor molecules in the olfactory epithelium. These receptors initiate a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell by binding specific odorants and triggering neuronal responses. However, OR13J1 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the human retina, where its function is not directly related to olfaction (Jovancevic2017Deep).

In the retina and other neuronal tissues, OR13J1 and other odorant receptors may play roles in detecting changes in the chemical composition of cerebrospinal fluid, regulating brain homeostasis, or participating in developmental processes like axon guidance and target recognition (Jovancevic2017Deep). Despite these findings, the precise physiological function of OR13J1 in the nervous system remains largely unknown, and further research is needed to elucidate its roles (Jovancevic2017Deep).

In the context of cancer, OR13J1 has been identified as mutated in colorectal adenocarcinoma, although its specific function in healthy cells or its role in tumorigenesis has not been detailed (Zhou2013Exome).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR13J1 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, is not fully understood. However, studies have identified mutations in OR13J1 in the context of colorectal cancer. Zhou et al. found that OR13J1 was mutated in adenocarcinoma tissues, suggesting a potential role in cancer cell communication and metastasis (Zhou2013Exome). Specifically, a mutation at g.chr9:35860034C-.T resulting in a p.R122H amino acid change was identified in adenocarcinoma, indicating a possible involvement in colorectal tumorigenesis (Zhou2013Exome).

Additionally, a genome-wide association study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near OR13J1 as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) in colorectal tumor tissues. This suggests that genetic variations can influence the expression of OR13J1, potentially impacting the tumor immune microenvironment (Schmit2024Germline). Despite these findings, the specific clinical implications of OR13J1 mutations or expression alterations remain unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate their roles in disease processes.
