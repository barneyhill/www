# TRO

## Overview
The TRO gene encodes the protein trophinin, a transmembrane cell adhesion molecule that plays a pivotal role in the process of embryo implantation. Trophinin is primarily expressed in trophoblast cells and maternal epithelial cells at the implantation site, facilitating the adhesion between the blastocyst and the uterine endometrial epithelial cells. This interaction is crucial for successful implantation and the establishment of pregnancy. The protein's structure, characterized by tandem decapeptide repeats and multiple transmembrane domains, enables it to form complexes with other proteins such as tastin and bystin, enhancing its adhesive capabilities (Fukuda1995Trophinin; Suzuki1998A). Trophinin's function extends beyond implantation, as its role in cell proliferation and invasion provides insights into mechanisms relevant to cancer biology, drawing parallels with processes observed in cancer metastasis (Fukuda2008Trophinin:).

## Structure
Trophinin is a protein encoded by the TRO gene, characterized by a unique molecular structure that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion during embryo implantation. The primary structure of trophinin consists of 749 amino acids, with a significant portion composed of tandem decapeptide repeats, which are interspersed with three hydrophilic domains (Fukuda1995Trophinin; Suzuki1998A). These decapeptide repeats facilitate homophilic interactions, essential for its function as a cell adhesion molecule (Saburi2001The).

The protein is predicted to have eight transmembrane domains, with the N-terminal region localized in the cytoplasm, while the rest of the polypeptide spans the membrane (Fukuda1995Trophinin; Suzuki1998A). Trophinin's tertiary structure is suggested to involve the formation of multivalent patches on the plasma membrane, enhancing its adhesive capabilities (Fukuda1995Trophinin).

In terms of quaternary structure, trophinin forms a complex with tastin and bystin, which are necessary for its effective function in cell adhesion (Fukuda1995Trophinin; Suzuki1998A). The protein also contains potential phosphorylation sites for various kinases, indicating post-translational modifications that may regulate its activity (Fukuda1995Trophinin).

## Function
Trophinin, encoded by the TRO gene, is a cell adhesion and signaling protein crucial for embryo implantation in humans. It is expressed in both trophoblast cells and maternal epithelial cells at the implantation site in the placenta. Trophinin facilitates the adhesion between the trophectoderm cells of the blastocyst and the uterine endometrial epithelial cells, a critical step for successful implantation. This adhesion process is mediated by trophinin's interaction with cytoplasmic proteins such as tastin and bystin, the latter being involved in ribosomal biogenesis and cell growth (Fukuda2008Trophinin:).

The expression of trophinin is regulated by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secreted by the blastocyst and is dependent on the close proximity of the blastocyst to the maternal epithelia, facilitated by L-selectin and its ligand. Trophinin acts as a molecular switch for trophoblast activation, promoting the proliferation and invasion of trophoblastic cells, which are essential for the establishment of pregnancy (Fukuda2008Trophinin:).

Trophinin's role in cell adhesion and signaling is significant not only for embryo implantation but also provides insights into mechanisms that may be relevant in cancer biology, as its function in cell proliferation and invasion parallels processes observed in cancer metastasis (Fukuda2008Trophinin:).

## Interactions
Trophinin (TRO) is a cell adhesion molecule that plays a significant role in embryo implantation by mediating interactions between trophoblast and endometrial epithelial cells. It forms a complex with other proteins, including tastin and bystin, which are crucial for its function. Bystin directly binds to both trophinin and tastin, and this interaction is enhanced by the presence of cytokeratin 8 and 18, suggesting a role in cell adhesion processes (Suzuki1998A). Trophinin is involved in homophilic cell adhesion, where it mediates the aggregation and adhesion of cells expressing trophinin and tastin (Fukuda1995Trophinin).

In the context of human embryo implantation, trophinin acts as a molecular switch that, upon interaction with the GWRQ peptide, leads to the release of bystin and subsequent activation of ErbB4, a protein tyrosine kinase. This interaction enhances the proliferation and motility of trophoblastic cells, which is crucial for successful implantation (Sugihara2007Trophoblast). Trophinin and bystin also form a complex with ErbB4, and their interaction is critical for the phosphorylation and activation of ErbB4 in the presence of the GWRQ peptide (Sugihara2007Trophoblast). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of trophinin in cell adhesion and signaling pathways.
