# GFI1B

## Overview
GFI1B (Growth Factor Independent 1B) is a gene that encodes the GFI1B protein, a transcriptional repressor crucial for hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation. The GFI1B protein is characterized by its C-terminal domain, which includes six C2H2 zinc fingers, and an N-terminal SNAG domain, both essential for its function in gene regulation. As a transcriptional repressor, GFI1B plays a pivotal role in the differentiation and development of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages by modulating gene expression through DNA binding and recruitment of co-repressors. It is involved in key signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and interacts with various transcription factors and corepressors to maintain hematopoietic stem cell function and lineage commitment. Mutations in GFI1B are linked to hematological disorders, including thrombocytopenia and myeloid malignancies, underscoring its significance in both normal and pathological hematopoiesis (Anguita2017Transcription; Venhuizen2024GFI1B; Shooshtarizadeh2019Gfi1b).

## Structure
The GFI1B protein is a transcriptional repressor involved in hematopoiesis, characterized by its distinct molecular structure. It contains a C-terminal domain composed of six C2H2 zinc fingers and an N-terminal SNAG (SNAIL/GFI1) transcriptional repression domain. The zinc fingers are essential for protein interaction and DNA binding, with fingers 1, 2, and 6 required for protein interaction, and fingers 3-5 necessary for binding DNA at a specific motif (Anguita2017Transcription). The SNAG domain is crucial for recruiting the LSD1-CoREST repressor complex to target gene promoters (Laurent2012A).

GFI1B undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, including Gfi-1B p32 and Gfi-1B p37. The p32 isoform lacks the first two zinc finger domains but still efficiently recruits the LSD1-CoREST complex, playing a significant role in erythroid differentiation (Laurent2012A). The dimethylation of lysine 8 in the SNAG domain of the p32 isoform is necessary for this recruitment (Laurent2012A).

Mutations in the zinc finger domains can lead to loss of DNA binding and repressor activity, resulting in conditions like macrothrombocytopenia and gray platelet syndrome (Anguita2017Transcription). The GFI1B protein's structure and post-translational modifications are critical for its function in hematopoiesis.

## Function
GFI1B is a transcriptional repressor that plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis, particularly in the development and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. It is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to DNA and recruiting co-repressors, influencing cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. GFI1B is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates chromatin structure and gene transcription (Anguita2017Transcription).

In erythropoiesis, GFI1B is essential for the maturation of erythroid cells. It promotes the proliferation of erythroblasts, particularly at the proerythroblast stage, and is involved in the regulation of erythroid-specific gene expression (Osawa2002Erythroid). GFI1B also plays a role in maintaining the dormancy and peripheral blood mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by regulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules and integrins, which are important for retaining HSCs in their niche (Khandanpour2010Evidence).

GFI1B interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, influencing the recruitment of β-catenin to specific genomic loci, which is crucial for maintaining appropriate levels of Wnt signaling in HSCs and megakaryocytes (Shooshtarizadeh2019Gfi1b). This interaction helps control the cellularity and functional integrity of these cells, highlighting GFI1B's role in modulating key signaling pathways in hematopoiesis (Shooshtarizadeh2019Gfi1b).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GFI1B gene are associated with several hematological disorders. Truncating mutations in the C-terminal zinc finger of GFI1B can lead to thrombocytopenia and bleeding disorders, characterized by macrothrombocytopenia and α-granule deficiency, which result in impaired platelet function (Songdej2016Inherited; Anguita2017Transcription). The GFI1B Q287* variant is particularly noted for its failure to repress myeloid traits during megakaryocyte differentiation, leading to a decrease in the megakaryocyte/myeloid cell ratio and contributing to bleeding tendencies (Venhuizen2024GFI1B).

In the context of myeloid malignancies, GFI1B mutations can act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. For instance, the D262N mutation in GFI1B, found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), functions in a dominant-negative manner, inhibiting erythroid differentiation and promoting myeloid cell survival (van2019Targeting; Anguita2016A). This mutation is associated with the progression from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to AML, highlighting its role in leukemogenesis (Anguita2016A).

Alterations in GFI1B expression are also linked to poor outcomes in AML and MDS, with reduced expression correlating with increased leukemic stem cell proliferation and disease progression (Möröy2019Role). These findings underscore the critical role of GFI1B in maintaining normal hematopoietic differentiation and its implications in hematological diseases.

## Interactions
GFI1B is a transcriptional repressor that interacts with several proteins to regulate gene expression, particularly in hematopoietic differentiation. It forms a multiprotein complex with LSD1, CoREST, and HDACs 1 and 2, which is crucial for its function in transcriptional repression. These interactions are mediated by the SNAG domain of GFI1B, which is essential for recruiting these cofactors to target gene promoters (Saleque2007Epigenetic). The SNAG domain mutation disrupts GFI1B's ability to interact with LSD1 and CoREST, highlighting its importance in these interactions (Saleque2007Epigenetic).

GFI1B also interacts with other transcription factors and corepressors, including SCL, E2A, GATA1, RUNX1T1 (ETO), CBFA2T3 (ETO2), SUV39H1, KDM1A, RCOR1/2, and EHMT2, indicating its significant role in hematopoiesis (Anguita2017Transcription). It binds to DNA at specific motifs, facilitating the repression of target genes involved in cell differentiation and proliferation (Anguita2017Transcription). Additionally, GFI1B interacts with beta-catenin and components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, suggesting a role in activating transcription in certain contexts (Moroy2016Growth). These interactions underscore GFI1B's complex regulatory network in gene expression.
