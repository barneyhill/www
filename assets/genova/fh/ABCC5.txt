# ABCC5

## Overview
The ABCC5 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 5 (MRP5), a transmembrane protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This protein functions as an ATP-dependent export pump, primarily facilitating the efflux of cyclic nucleotides such as cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) across cellular membranes. MRP5 plays a critical role in regulating intracellular levels of these signaling molecules, which are involved in various physiological processes, including vascular tone and cardiac function (NIES2002Immunolocalization; Dazert2003Expression). The gene is located on chromosome 3q27 and consists of 30 exons, encoding a protein with 1437 amino acids organized into two nucleotide-binding domains and two membrane-spanning domains (2006 pages 283-285). MRP5's activity is significant in contexts such as ischemic preconditioning and drug resistance, making it a protein of interest in both cardiovascular and cancer research (Nambaru2010Drug; Dazert2003Expression).

## Structure
The ABCC5 protein, also known as MRP5, is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, characterized by its role in transporting various molecules across cellular membranes. The primary structure of ABCC5 includes 1437 amino acids, organized into two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) (2006 pages 283-285). The typical topology of ABCC5 is MSD1-NBD1-MSD2-NBD2, which is consistent with other members of the ABCC subfamily (2006 pages 283-285).

The secondary structure of ABCC5 likely involves alpha helices and beta sheets, common in transmembrane proteins, although specific details are not provided in the available context. The tertiary structure forms a functional transporter, facilitating the efflux of anionic dyes and cyclic nucleotides like cGMP and cAMP (2006 pages 295-297). The quaternary structure may involve dimerization, a feature observed in other ABC transporters, but specific details for ABCC5 are not mentioned.

Post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation are noted in other ABCC proteins, though specific sites for ABCC5 are not detailed (2006 pages 285-287). The protein is located on chromosome 3q27 and consists of 30 exons (2006 pages 283-285).

## Function
The ABCC5 gene encodes the multidrug resistance protein 5 (MRP5), which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. MRP5 functions as an ATP-dependent export pump for cyclic nucleotides, particularly cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and to a lesser extent cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (NIES2002Immunolocalization; Dazert2003Expression). This protein plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular levels of these cyclic nucleotides, which are important signaling molecules involved in various physiological processes, including smooth muscle relaxation and cardiac function (Ritter2005Cellular; Dazert2003Expression).

In the human heart, MRP5 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, and endothelial cells, where it modulates signal transduction by exporting cGMP, thus influencing vascular tone and cardiac contractility (Dazert2003Expression). This function is particularly significant in ischemic preconditioning, where MRP5 may help regulate cardiac glucose utilization and protect against ischemic damage (Dazert2003Expression). MRP5 is also involved in the NO/cGMP-mediated negative inotropic effect, which is important in inflammatory myocardial dysfunctions (Dazert2003Expression).

MRP5 is active primarily in the plasma membrane, contributing to cellular homeostasis by maintaining appropriate levels of cyclic nucleotides and potentially affecting drug metabolism and resistance (Ritter2005Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
The ABCC5 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in drug resistance and metabolic processes. Variants in ABCC5 are associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and insulin resistance, particularly in European and African American populations. A functional variant in intron 26 of ABCC5 is linked to increased expression in adipose tissue, which correlates with reduced insulin sensitivity, increased visceral fat, and a higher risk of T2D (Direk2014ABCC5).

In cancer, ABCC5 expression affects drug resistance, notably in pancreatic cancer where it influences sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Overexpression of ABCC5 leads to reduced sensitivity to 5-FU, while knockdown increases drug sensitivity, suggesting its role in chemoresistance (Nambaru2010Drug).

ABCC5 polymorphisms are also linked to irinotecan-induced gastrointestinal toxicity in colorectal cancer patients. The rs562 SNP in ABCC5 is associated with severe GI toxicity, indicating that genetic variations in ABCC5 can influence drug response and toxicity (Di2011Single). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ABCC5 in both metabolic disorders and cancer treatment.
