# DCAF11

## Overview
DCAF11, or DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 11, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a substrate receptor within the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for the targeted degradation of proteins, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and DNA replication. As a substrate receptor, the DCAF11 protein identifies and binds specific proteins, marking them for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability. DCAF11 is particularly involved in the degradation of proteins like the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) and NRF2, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and cellular stress responses (Djakbarova2016DDB1; Park2019TFEB).

## Function
DCAF11, also known as DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 11, is a crucial component of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a significant role in protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In healthy human cells, DCAF11 functions as a substrate receptor within this complex, targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This process is essential for regulating various cellular activities, including cell cycle progression and DNA replication (Djakbarova2016DDB1).

One of the key roles of DCAF11 is in the degradation of the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) at the end of the S phase in the cell cycle. SLBP is necessary for histone biosynthesis, and its timely degradation is critical for shutting down histone production, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and maintaining cell viability (Djakbarova2016DDB1). DCAF11 also mediates the degradation of other proteins, such as NRF2, by acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, thus regulating protein levels and cellular responses to stress (Park2019TFEB).

DCAF11 is active in the nucleus, where it helps control protein turnover and cellular responses to DNA damage, contributing to genomic stability and the regulation of cellular processes (Djakbarova2016DDB1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the DCAF11 gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. DCAF11 is involved in the degradation of key regulatory proteins, and its dysregulation can impact cell cycle progression and genomic stability. For instance, DCAF11 is crucial for the degradation of stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) at the end of the S phase, a process essential for proper cell cycle regulation. Alterations in DCAF11 expression can lead to increased SLBP levels, affecting cell cycle progression and potentially contributing to cancer development (Djakbarova2016DDB1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, DCAF11 plays a role in the regulation of Nrf2, a transcription factor involved in cellular stress responses. TFEB, a transcription factor, activates Nrf2 by repressing DCAF11, leading to increased Nrf2 stability. Alterations in DCAF11 expression or interaction can impact Nrf2 activity, which is significant in conditions related to oxidative stress (Park2019TFEB).

DCAF11 is also implicated in targeted protein degradation through electrophilic proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs). This process can be harnessed for therapeutic purposes, such as degrading proteins like FKBP12 and the androgen receptor, which are relevant in prostate cancer (Zhang2021DCAF11).

## Interactions
DCAF11, also known as DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 11, is a substrate receptor for the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in protein degradation and cell cycle regulation. DCAF11 is a component of the CRL4-DCAF11 E3 ligase complex, which includes Cul4A and DDB1, and is responsible for the degradation of stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) at the end of the S phase. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, as DCAF11 binds to phosphorylated SLBP, facilitating its recruitment to the CRL4 complex for degradation (Djakbarova2016DDB1).

In human osteosarcoma cells, DCAF11 forms part of the CRL4B E3 ligase complex, interacting with CUL4B, RBX1, and DDB1. This complex targets the CDK inhibitor p21 for ubiquitination and degradation, which is essential for cell cycle progression. DCAF11 specifically interacts with p21, leading to its ubiquitination at lysine residues K16, K154, K161, and K163 (Chen2017CRL4BDCAF11).

DCAF11 also mediates the degradation of FKBP12 through electrophilic proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), such as 21-SLF. This process involves the formation of a ternary complex with FKBP12, leading to its polyubiquitination and degradation (Zhang2021DCAF11).
