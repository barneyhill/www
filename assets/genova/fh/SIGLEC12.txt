# SIGLEC12

## Overview
SIGLEC12 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 12 (Siglec-XII), which is part of the CD33-related Siglecs family. Siglec-XII is categorized as a receptor protein, although it has lost the ability to bind sialic acids due to a mutation in a conserved arginine residue, distinguishing it from other Siglecs (Lim2021Siglecs; Läubli2019Sialic). In humans, SIGLEC12 is often considered a pseudogene, as many individuals carry mutations that prevent the production of a functional protein (Yu2023Recent). Despite this, Siglec-XII is still expressed in certain epithelial and cancer cells, where it may play a role in oncogenic pathways, particularly in colorectal and prostate carcinomas (Mitra2011SIGLEC12; Cuello2024Humanspecific). The protein retains intracellular signaling domains, suggesting potential involvement in cellular signaling processes, although its precise biological functions and interactions remain to be fully elucidated (Läubli2019Sialic).

## Structure
SIGLEC12 is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin family, characterized by its extracellular domains. Unlike most Siglecs, SIGLEC12 has two V-set Ig domains, which are crucial for sialic acid recognition, although it has lost the highly conserved arginine residue necessary for binding sialic acids, rendering it a non-sialic acid binding Siglec (Varki2005Siglecs—the; Lim2021Siglecs). This mutation affects its binding capacity and signaling efficiency, as it also has inefficient ITIM signaling (Lim2021Siglecs).

SIGLEC12 is considered a pseudogene in humans, indicating that it may not produce a functional protein (Yu2023Recent). Despite this, SIGLEC12 can still recruit SHP2-related oncogenic pathways, which are implicated in cancer progression (Lim2021Siglecs). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common among Siglecs, although specific details for SIGLEC12 are not provided (Lin2021Functions). SIGLEC12 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, but the specific structural implications of these isoforms are not detailed in the available literature (Lin2021Functions).

## Function
The SIGLEC12 gene encodes the Siglec-XII protein, which is part of the CD33-related Siglecs family. In humans, Siglec-XII has undergone a mutation that prevents it from binding sialic acids, a function typical of other Siglecs. Despite this, Siglec-XII retains intracellular ITIM and ITIM-like domains that can be phosphorylated to recruit phosphatases such as Shp1 and Shp2, suggesting a potential role in signaling pathways (Cuello2024Humanspecific; Läubli2019Sialic).

Siglec-XII is expressed in certain epithelial cells and macrophages, although its expression is generally weaker compared to other species like chimpanzees (Mitra2011SIGLEC12). In healthy human tissues, it is found in epithelial cells of the kidney tubules, prostate epithelium, and macrophage-like cells in the tonsils (Mitra2011SIGLEC12). The protein's inability to bind sialic acids suggests it may not perform typical immune regulatory functions associated with other Siglecs, but it may still influence cellular signaling through its retained domains (Läubli2019Sialic).

The expression of Siglec-XII is enriched in certain carcinomas, indicating a potential role in cancer progression, although its function in healthy cells remains less clear (Mitra2011SIGLEC12; Cuello2024Humanspecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SIGLEC12 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly colorectal and prostate carcinomas. In humans, a missense mutation in SIGLEC12 results in a loss of sialic acid binding, a function retained in other primates. This mutation, along with a common frameshift mutation, leads to the pseudogenization of SIGLEC12 in many individuals, resulting in a truncated protein (Mitra2011SIGLEC12; Cuello2024Humanspecific). Despite these mutations, some humans still express Siglec-XII, particularly in epithelial cells, and this expression is enriched in carcinomas, including colorectal and prostate cancers (Mitra2011SIGLEC12; Cuello2024Humanspecific).

Siglec-XII expression in colorectal cancer is associated with increased tumor burden and inflammation-driven carcinogenesis. It is linked to advanced-stage colorectal cancer presentation, particularly in European Americans, who often have right-sided tumors with microsatellite instability (Cuello2024Humanspecific). In prostate cancer, Siglec-XII expression correlates with altered gene regulation associated with carcinoma progression and enhanced tumor growth (Mitra2011SIGLEC12). The presence of Siglec-XII in prostate cancer cells is associated with the down-regulation of genes involved in cellular movement and cancer, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Mitra2011SIGLEC12). These findings indicate that Siglec-XII expression may predispose individuals to cancer, particularly in those who can express the full-length protein.

## Interactions
Siglec-12, encoded by the SIGLEC12 gene, is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family. In humans, Siglec-12 has lost its ability to bind sialic acid ligands due to a mutation in a conserved arginine residue essential for this interaction (Rodrigues2020A; Läubli2019Sialic). Despite this loss, Siglec-12 is expressed on epithelial and cancer cells, including those in the prostate and kidney, and is implicated in cancer biology (Läubli2022Targeting; Läubli2019Sialic).

The specific protein interactions of Siglec-12 are not well-documented, largely due to its inability to bind sialic acids, which differentiates it from other Siglecs that typically engage in sialoglycan interactions (Lenza2020Current; Rodrigues2020A). The lack of sialic acid binding suggests that Siglec-12 may not participate in the typical Siglec-mediated immune modulation pathways. However, its expression in cancer cells suggests a potential role in tumor biology, possibly through interactions with other cellular components or pathways that are yet to be fully elucidated (Läubli2022Targeting). Further research is needed to clarify the specific interactions and functional roles of Siglec-12 in human biology.
