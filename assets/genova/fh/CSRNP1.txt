# CSRNP1

## Overview
CSRNP1, or cysteine and serine rich nuclear protein 1, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein belongs to the CSRNP family, characterized by its cysteine- and serine-rich regions, which are indicative of its potential role as a transcription factor. CSRNP1 is implicated in several cellular processes, including the Wnt signaling pathway, and is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing pathways related to apoptosis and inflammation (Gingras2007Characterization). The protein's involvement in transcriptional activation, particularly in response to cytokine stimulation, underscores its significance in inflammatory conditions and its selective regulatory functions (Macdonald2018Cytokineinduced). CSRNP1's expression and interaction patterns have been linked to various cancers and immune-related diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Pang2022Integrating; Zhang2021The).

## Function
CSRNP1, also known as AXUD1, is a gene encoding a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional regulation. It is part of a family of cysteine-serine-rich nuclear proteins (CSRNP) that are potential transcription factors due to their nuclear localization and ability to stimulate reporter activity (Gingras2007Characterization). CSRNP1 is implicated in the Wnt signaling pathway, as it is induced by factors such as AXIN1, suggesting a role in cellular processes like proliferation and differentiation (Gingras2007Characterization). The protein has a serine-rich amino-terminal region and a cysteine-rich region, which are conserved across the CSRNP family, indicating a potential role in DNA binding and transcription regulation (Gingras2007Characterization).

In human chondrocytes, CSRNP1 is involved in the transcriptional activation of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) in response to cytokine stimulation, highlighting its role in inflammatory conditions (Macdonald2018Cytokineinduced). CSRNP1 specifically binds to a motif within the MMP1 promoter, contributing to its expression, but does not affect MMP13, indicating a selective regulatory function (Macdonald2018Cytokineinduced). Despite its involvement in these processes, the precise function of CSRNP1 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CSRNP1 gene have been linked to various cancers. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), low expression levels of CSRNP1 are associated with worse overall survival, and the gene acts as a protective factor in both high- and low-mutant burden patients (Zhang2021The). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high levels of CSRNP1 expression are associated with poor prognosis and high-risk scores, suggesting that tumors may develop immune resistance by down-regulating CSRNP1 (Pang2022Integrating). In prostate cancer, CSRNP1 is significantly downregulated in high-risk groups, with its expression negatively correlated with the methylation status of its CpG sites (Kobelyatskaya2020Differentially).

CSRNP1 is also implicated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near the gene is associated with an increased risk of developing the disease (Berndt2016Metaanalysis). Additionally, in the context of HIV-related cognitive impairment, CSRNP1 shows altered methylation and expression patterns, suggesting a potential link to cognitive impairment (Corley2016Comparative). These findings highlight the gene's role in various pathological conditions, particularly in cancer and immune-related diseases.

## Interactions
CSRNP1, a transcription factor, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It has been identified as a binding partner of protein phosphatase 1 gamma (PP1γ) isoforms in the human brain, specifically binding to PP1γ1. This interaction was discovered using yeast two-hybrid screening, which identified CSRNP1 as one of the proteins that bind to PP1γ1, possessing the PP1-binding motifs RVAF and RVEF, as well as the SILK motif, which are known to mediate interactions with PP1 (Esteves2012Protein).

CSRNP1 also interacts with the MAPK signaling pathway, playing a role in apoptosis and inflammation. Inhibition of CSRNP1 in hepatocytes and mouse models of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) during liver transplantation showed reduced apoptosis and liver injury, linked to decreased phosphorylation of MAPK-related proteins, specifically SAPK and P38 MAPK. This suggests a direct interaction between CSRNP1 and the MAPK pathway, influencing cell survival and apoptosis (Wang2024Inhibition).

Additionally, CSRNP1 binds to a specific DNA sequence, AGAGTG, which is shared among the CSRNP family proteins, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Gingras2007Characterization).
