# GYPE

## Overview
The GYPE gene encodes glycophorin E, a minor transmembrane sialoglycoprotein that is part of the MNS blood group system, located on the surface of human erythrocytes. Glycophorin E is involved in the glycosylation of red blood cells, contributing to the formation of a negatively charged glycan coat that aids in preventing cell adhesion and maintaining proper blood circulation (Hollox2022Genetic). The gene is subject to structural variations due to non-allelic homologous recombination, which can result in different blood group antigens and influence susceptibility to infectious diseases such as malaria (Hollox2022Genetic). These variations, including duplications and deletions, have clinical significance, particularly in relation to blood group compatibility and disease susceptibility (Louzada2020Structural).

## Function
Glycophorin E (GYPE) is a minor sialoglycoprotein located on the surface of human erythrocytes, contributing to the MNS blood group system. The exact function of GYPE in healthy human cells is not fully understood, but it is believed to play a role in the glycosylation of red blood cells (RBCs). This process involves providing a negatively charged glycan coat that prevents the adherence of RBCs to other cells or blood vessel walls, thereby maintaining proper circulation and preventing clotting (Hollox2022Genetic).

GYPE is involved in structural variations due to non-allelic homologous recombination, which can lead to different blood group antigens. These variations are significant in the context of infectious diseases, as certain alleles, such as the DUP4 allele involving GYPE, encode the Dantu NE blood type, which offers protection against malaria by increasing red blood cell surface tension (Hollox2022Genetic). While the specific molecular activities of GYPE are not fully detailed, its involvement in the modulation of immune responses and potential influence on susceptibility to pathogens suggest a role in cell-cell recognition and adhesion, contributing to the structural integrity and stability of the red blood cell membrane.

## Clinical Significance
The GYPE gene, part of the glycophorin region, is associated with structural variations that can have clinical significance, particularly in relation to malaria susceptibility. Variants such as DUP29 and DEL15, which involve duplications and deletions affecting GYPE, have been identified and may influence malaria susceptibility due to their impact on gene copy number and expression (Louzada2020Structural). The DEL15 variant is associated with the rare U-blood group phenotype, resulting in a lack of glycophorin B expression in homozygotes, which can affect blood group compatibility (Louzada2020Structural).

The DUP5 variant, which includes additional copies of GYPE, is found in specific populations and suggests a complex pattern of genomic rearrangement, potentially affecting gene function and expression (Louzada2020Structural). Structural variations in the GYPE region, such as deletions, could be linked to clinical conditions, although specific diseases are not detailed (Louzada2020Structural). The study of these structural variants is crucial for understanding their potential clinical implications, especially in relation to disease susceptibility and blood group phenotypes (Louzada2020Structural).
