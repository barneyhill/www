# NLE1

## Overview
NLE1 (Notchless homolog 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in essential cellular processes, particularly ribosome biogenesis. The NLE1 protein, characterized by its WD40-like repeats, is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it plays a critical role in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, a process vital for protein synthesis and cellular proliferation (BeckCormier2014Notchless). This protein is highly conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary importance (Lossie2012ENU). Beyond its fundamental role in ribosome assembly, NLE1 is implicated in various signaling pathways, including the Notch and Wnt pathways, influencing cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Lossie2012ENU). Its interactions with these pathways suggest a broader regulatory role in cellular growth and development. Additionally, alterations in NLE1 expression have been linked to the progression of certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ren2021Knockdown).

## Structure
The NLE1 protein in mice is encoded by the Nle1 gene, which consists of 13 exons spanning 7628 base pairs of genomic DNA. The RefSeq cDNA for Nle1 predicts a protein composed of 485 amino acids. This protein includes an NLE1 domain at the N-terminus and features eight WD40-like repeats, which are common motifs involved in protein-protein interactions (Lossie2012ENU). The WD40-repeat protein family, to which NLE1 belongs, is involved in various cellular functions such as cytoskeleton assembly, cell division, transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and signal transduction (BeckCormier2014Notchless).

NLE1 is highly conserved across multiple species, with over 91% identity among mouse, rat, human, and cow, indicating its evolutionary importance (Lossie2012ENU). In yeast, the NLE1 ortholog Rsa4 is essential for ribosome biogenesis, interacting with the AAA-ATPase Rea1 through its conserved amino-terminal region, a function that is conserved in mice (BeckCormier2014Notchless). The protein's structure and function suggest it may play a role in ribosome biogenesis and possibly in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, although specific details on its tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
NLE1 (Notchless homolog 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, a critical process for protein synthesis in cells. The NLE1 protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it plays a significant role in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, essential for maintaining cellular growth and proliferation (BeckCormier2014Notchless). This function is crucial for the survival and proliferation of cells, as demonstrated in studies involving murine models where NLE1 is necessary for the survival and proliferation of epiblast cells during early embryonic development (BeckCormier2014Notchless).

In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis, NLE1 has been implicated in various signaling pathways. It interacts with the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, although its exact role in these pathways can vary across species. In murine pre-implantation development, NLE1 mutations lead to increased expression of Cdkn1a, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and downregulation of several Wnt pathway members, suggesting a complex interaction with these pathways (Lossie2012ENU). These interactions highlight NLE1's involvement in regulating key molecular pathways that influence cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Lossie2012ENU).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NLE1 gene have been implicated in the progression of certain cancers, including malignant melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In malignant melanoma, NLE1 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and its expression is positively correlated with lymphatic metastasis and tumor stage. Knockdown of NLE1 in melanoma cell lines results in inhibited cell proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and reduced tumor growth in vivo, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ren2021Knockdown).

In NSCLC, high NLE1 expression is observed in a significant portion of tumor specimens and is associated with advanced pathological stages and shorter overall survival. Silencing NLE1 in NSCLC cell lines leads to reduced cell proliferation and migration, increased apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase. The knockdown of NLE1 affects the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and the expression of several apoptosis-related proteins, indicating its role in promoting tumor growth and malignancy (Xu2023Identification).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of NLE1 in cancer development and progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in these malignancies.

## Interactions
NLE1 (Notchless homolog 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NLE1 interacts with E2F1 to regulate the transcription of CDK1, a known cancer-promoting factor. This interaction enhances the transcriptional regulation of CDK1 by E2F1, as demonstrated by a ChIP-qPCR assay (Xu2023Identification). NLE1 also influences the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is associated with promoting NSCLC cell proliferation and migration (Xu2023Identification).

In murine pre-implantation development, NLE1 is suggested to interact with components of the Wnt signaling pathway. Nle1 mutant embryos show downregulation of several Wnt pathway members, indicating a potential interaction between NLE1 and this pathway (Lossie2012ENU). Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, these interactions suggest that NLE1 may play a role in regulating both the Notch and Wnt pathways during early embryonic development (Lossie2012ENU).

These interactions highlight NLE1's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its potential role in regulating gene expression and cellular proliferation.
