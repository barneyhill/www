# AMMECR1

## Overview
The AMMECR1 gene encodes the AMMECR nuclear protein 1, a protein primarily localized in the nucleus with a suggested regulatory role in cellular processes. Although the precise function of the AMMECR1 protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and RNA base modification. The protein is characterized by its glycine-rich N-terminus and contains several putative phosphorylation and myristoylation sites, indicating potential post-translational modifications that may influence its function and stability. AMMECR1 is highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular biology. Mutations in the AMMECR1 gene are associated with the AMME complex syndrome and other developmental abnormalities, highlighting its clinical significance (BaselVanagaite2017Xlinked; MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation; Vitelli1999Identification).

## Structure
The AMMECR1 gene encodes a protein with a nuclear localization and an unknown function, though it is suggested to play a regulatory role. The protein is highly conserved across species, from archeobacteria to C. elegans, indicating a fundamental cellular function (BaselVanagaite2017Xlinked; Vitelli2000Identification). The human AMMECR1 protein is composed of 333 amino acids, while the mouse ortholog is slightly longer at 344 amino acids due to differences in the serine and glycine-rich amino-terminal domain (Vitelli2000Identification).

The AMMECR1 protein contains several putative domains, including six protein kinase C sites, three casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and 23 potential N-myristoylation sites, suggesting possible post-translational modifications that could affect its function and stability (Vitelli2000Identification). A six-amino acid domain (LRGCIG) is identically conserved across all described orthologs, highlighting its potential importance (Vitelli2000Identification).

A model of the AMMECR1 protein was generated based on a 25% identification to the 1vajA protein model from the Protein Data Bank. The mutation R45X is located in a critical position linking two beta sheets that interact with an alpha helix in the core of a subdomain, suggesting a role in the protein's tertiary structure (BaselVanagaite2017Xlinked). The absence of R45, due to exon 2 skipping, is expected to destabilize the protein structure, leading to a missing protein, similar to the effect of a stop-gain mutation (BaselVanagaite2017Xlinked).

## Function
The AMMECR1 gene encodes a protein that is primarily localized in the nucleus and is involved in several cellular processes, including potential roles in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. The protein is characterized by a glycine-rich N-terminus and is considered unstable, with an instability index of 51.21, suggesting it may be subject to strict regulation through phosphorylation (Vitelli1999Identification). AMMECR1 is highly conserved across species, indicating its importance in fundamental cellular functions (Vitelli1999Identification).

The protein may participate in RNA base modification, potentially involving the transfer of a modifying group onto an RNA base via a conserved cysteine (BaselVanagaite2017Xlinked). It is also suggested to interact with nucleic acids due to the presence of RAGNYA folds, which are known to bind nucleic acids (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation). The AMMECR1 protein is involved in the nuclear sublocalization and may form dimers, as indicated by its presence in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation).

In zebrafish models, knockdown of the ammecr1 ortholog results in phenotypes similar to human conditions associated with AMMECR1 loss, such as growth and bone alterations, indicating its role in these processes (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deletions in the AMMECR1 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, most notably the AMME complex syndrome, which includes Alport syndrome, intellectual disability, midface hypoplasia, and elliptocytosis. This syndrome is linked to microdeletions in the Xq22.3 region, where AMMECR1 is located (Poreau2019Xq22.3q23; Vitelli1999Identification). The AMMECR1 gene is highly conserved, suggesting its importance in cellular processes, and its mutations can lead to developmental abnormalities such as short stature, hearing loss, and facial dysmorphism (BaselVanagaite2017Xlinked; MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation).

In some cases, AMMECR1 mutations result in X-linked elliptocytosis with impaired growth, characterized by features like cleft palate, club feet, and pulmonary hypertension (BaselVanagaite2017Xlinked). The gene's inactivation has been linked to growth, bone, and heart alterations, with studies showing that its loss-of-function mutations can lead to phenotypes such as motor and speech delays, hypotonia, and congenital heart disease (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation). The AMMECR1 gene's role in these conditions is supported by its involvement in cell cycle regulation and its intolerance to loss-of-function variants (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation).

## Interactions
The AMMECR1 protein is involved in interactions with nucleic acids and potentially forms multiprotein complexes. It contains two RAGNYA folds, which are known to interact with nucleic acids, suggesting a role in nucleic acid binding (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation). Transfection assays in HeLa and HEK293 cells have shown that AMMECR1 localizes to the nucleus, supporting its involvement in nuclear processes (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation). The protein is present in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, indicating that it may form dimers (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation).

In the yeast protein-protein interaction network, AMMECR1 is associated with complexes that include RNA transport and processing proteins, suggesting its involvement in RNA-related functions (BaselVanagaite2017Xlinked). The protein's surface shows a highly positive electrostatic potential, which implies a functional role in binding RNA, DNA, or ATP (BaselVanagaite2017Xlinked). The GIANT database predicts that AMMECR1 interacts with 77 genes, with enrichment in the Gene Ontology Biological Process term 'mitotic cell cycle' and Cellular Component term 'nucleoplasm', indicating a role in cell cycle regulation (MoysésOliveira2017Inactivation). These interactions highlight AMMECR1's potential regulatory functions in cellular processes.
