# C4orf36

## Overview
C4orf36 is a gene located on chromosome 4 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 4 open reading frame 36. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, as its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes remain largely undefined. Despite the limited understanding of its precise function, studies suggest that C4orf36 may be involved in various cellular pathways and could have implications in certain physiological or pathological conditions. Further research is necessary to elucidate the exact mechanisms and interactions of the C4orf36 protein within the human body.
