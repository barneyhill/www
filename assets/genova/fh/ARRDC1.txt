# ARRDC1

## Overview
ARRDC1 (arrestin domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling and trafficking processes. The protein, also named ARRDC1, is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its role in mediating interactions between various cellular components. It is characterized by an N-terminal arrestin domain, which is essential for its localization to the plasma membrane and its involvement in signal transduction and receptor internalization (Nabhan2012Formation; Kuo2012ARRDC1). ARRDC1 is notably involved in the formation and release of ARRDC1-mediated microvesicles (ARMMs), a process that requires interaction with the TSG101 protein and the ESCRT machinery (Nabhan2012Formation). Additionally, ARRDC1 plays a significant role in the regulation of Notch signaling by facilitating the ubiquitylation and degradation of the Notch receptor, thus acting as a negative regulator of this pathway (Puca2013αarrestin). The gene's involvement in these critical cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and intercellular communication.

## Structure
ARRDC1 (arrestin domain containing 1) is characterized by an N-terminal arrestin domain, which is crucial for its localization to the plasma membrane and its role in signal transduction and receptor internalization (Nabhan2012Formation; Kuo2012ARRDC1). The protein structure includes a highly conserved PSAP motif in the C-terminal region, essential for interaction with the TSG101 protein, facilitating the recruitment of TSG101 to the plasma membrane (Nabhan2012Formation). This interaction is critical for the formation and release of ARRDC1-mediated microvesicles (ARMMs) (Nabhan2012Formation).

ARRDC1 also contains PPXY motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with E3 ubiquitin ligases like WWP2, enhancing its ubiquitination and promoting ARMMs release (Nabhan2012Formation). The protein's core structure can be modeled as a two-module beta-strand sandwich, similar to other arrestin domain-containing proteins, although specific details about the interface between the N- and C-domains are not well-defined (Aubry2013True).

ARRDC1 does not share consensus SUMOylation motifs and lacks a C-terminal cysteine predicted to be S-nitrosylated, unlike ARRDC2 (Aubry2013True). The protein's involvement in ubiquitination and interaction with the ESCRT machinery suggests a role in cellular processes beyond traditional arrestin functions (Aubry2013True).

## Function
ARRDC1 (arrestin domain containing 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in the formation and release of microvesicles at the plasma membrane in human cells. It interacts with the TSG101 protein, a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, through a specific PSAP motif. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of TSG101 to the plasma membrane, facilitating the budding of ARRDC1-mediated microvesicles (ARMMs), which are distinct from exosomes. The VPS4 ATPase is necessary for the final 'pinch-off' of these microvesicles, similar to its role in multivesicular body formation and viral budding (Nabhan2012Formation).

ARRDC1 is also involved in the regulation of Notch signaling in mammalian cells. It acts as a scaffold protein, forming complexes with β-arrestins and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, which are essential for the ubiquitylation and lysosomal degradation of the Notch receptor. This process serves as a negative regulatory mechanism for Notch signaling, ensuring proper degradation of the receptor and maintaining cellular signaling pathways (Puca2013αarrestin). ARRDC1's role in these processes highlights its importance in cellular homeostasis and intercellular communication.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ARRDC1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of microvesicle formation, mutations in the arrestin domain of ARRDC1, such as the F88L mutation, can disrupt its localization to the plasma membrane, thereby blocking the release of ARRDC1-mediated microvesicles (ARMMs). This disruption can significantly impact intercellular communication and may have clinical implications in diseases where vesicle formation is altered (Nabhan2012Formation).

ARRDC1 also plays a role in the degradation of the Notch receptor, a critical process in regulating Notch signaling. Mutations in the PPxY motifs of ARRDC1 can impair its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, leading to reduced ubiquitylation and degradation of Notch. This can result in dysregulated Notch signaling, which is associated with various developmental disorders and cancers (Puca2013αarrestin).

Additionally, the long non-coding RNA ARRDC1-AS1, which is regulated by the transcription factor PAX5, is upregulated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This upregulation is linked to enhanced autophagy and cancer progression, suggesting a potential role for ARRDC1-AS1 in the malignancy of DLBCL (Xu2021PAX5activated).

## Interactions
ARRDC1 interacts with several proteins involved in cellular trafficking and ubiquitination processes. It binds to HECT ubiquitin ligases, including WWP1, WWP2, Nedd4, and Itch, through its PPXY motifs, which are crucial for these interactions (Rauch2011Multiple; Puca2013αarrestin). ARRDC1 also interacts with components of the ESCRT machinery, such as Tsg101 and ALIX. The interaction with Tsg101 is mediated by the PSAP motif of ARRDC1, which is essential for recruiting Tsg101 to the plasma membrane and facilitating the release of ARRDC1-mediated microvesicles (ARMMs) (Nabhan2012Formation).

ARRDC1 forms complexes with β-arrestins, which do not directly interact with Itch but can form heterodimers with ARRDC1. This interaction is important for the recruitment of Itch to the Notch receptor, promoting its ubiquitylation and degradation (Puca2013αarrestin). ARRDC1's role in Notch signaling involves acting as a negative regulator by facilitating the degradation of the Notch receptor through these interactions (Puca2013αarrestin). These interactions highlight ARRDC1's role as an adaptor protein linking ubiquitin ligases and the ESCRT machinery, influencing protein trafficking and degradation pathways.
