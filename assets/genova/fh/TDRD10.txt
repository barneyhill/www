# TDRD10

## Overview
TDRD10 is a gene that encodes the protein tudor domain containing 10, which is part of the tudor domain protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of tudor domains, which are known for their role in recognizing and binding methylated arginine and lysine residues on histones and other proteins. The TDRD10 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and RNA processing. It plays a crucial role in the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes and is implicated in the maintenance of genomic stability. The specific functions and interactions of TDRD10 are still under investigation, but its involvement in these fundamental cellular processes suggests it may have significant implications for understanding certain diseases and developmental pathways.
