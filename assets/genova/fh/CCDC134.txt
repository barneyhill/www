# CCDC134

## Overview
CCDC134 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 134 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the immune system and transcriptional regulation. The CCDC134 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and it plays a crucial role in T cell activation by modulating early T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It achieves this by interacting with the TCR-CD3 complex, specifically binding to the CD3ϵ subunit, thereby promoting its ubiquitination and ensuring the stability and turnover of TCR-CD3 complexes (Zhang2023CCDC134). Additionally, CCDC134 interacts with the human transcriptional adaptor hADA2a, enhancing its acetyltransferase activity, which is vital for transcriptional regulation and cellular stress responses (Huang2012CCDC134). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune function. Furthermore, mutations in the CCDC134 gene have been linked to severe osteogenesis imperfecta and its expression levels have implications in breast cancer prognosis, highlighting its clinical relevance (Huang2022CCDC134; Dubail2020Homozygous).

## Function
The CCDC134 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in T cell activation and immune responses. It is involved in the regulation of early T cell receptor (TCR) signaling by interacting with the TCR-CD3 complex, specifically binding to the CD3ϵ subunit. This interaction promotes the ubiquitination of CD3ϵ, which is crucial for TCR signaling and helps maintain the stability and turnover of TCR-CD3 complexes (Zhang2023CCDC134). CCDC134 deficiency in T cells leads to reduced ubiquitination of CD3ϵ, resulting in impaired T cell activation and a decrease in peripheral mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Zhang2023CCDC134).

In addition to its role in T cell activation, CCDC134 interacts with hADA2a, a component of the PCAF complex, enhancing its acetyltransferase activity. This interaction is important for transcriptional regulation, DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest (Huang2012CCDC134). CCDC134 is primarily localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in both secretory and nuclear functions (Huang2012CCDC134). The protein's activity in these cellular processes highlights its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC134 gene are associated with a severe form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), specifically type XXII. This condition is characterized by severe skeletal fragility, including short stature, multiple fractures, and low bone density. The mutation c.2T>C in CCDC134 affects the initiation codon, leading to a loss of function of the protein, which is involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. This results in increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, reduced expression of osteopontin and COL1A1, and impaired mineralization in osteoblasts, contributing to the bone fragility observed in affected individuals (Dubail2020Homozygous; Jovanovic2024Update).

In breast cancer, CCDC134 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and hormone receptor status, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. High levels of CCDC134 expression are associated with poorer survival outcomes, and it may influence ERK and JNK signaling pathways, indicating a role in cancer progression and immune response (Huang2022CCDC134).

Additionally, CCDC134 has been identified as one of the circulating proteins associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer, suggesting a protective effect (Chen2024Associations).

## Interactions
CCDC134 is known to interact with the human transcriptional adaptor hADA2a, a component of the GCN5 family histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex. This interaction was initially identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and subsequently confirmed in mammalian cells using co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Huang2012CCDC134). CCDC134 stabilizes hADA2a by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation, thereby modulating hADA2a levels within cells (Huang2012CCDC134). 

CCDC134 is associated with the PCAF complex via hADA2a, influencing the acetylation of histone proteins, specifically lysine 14 of H3 and lysine 8 of H4. Overexpression of hADA2a enhances histone acetylation, while suppression of CCDC134 reduces hADA2a-mediated acetylation, suggesting that CCDC134 enhances the HAT activity of hADA2a (Huang2012CCDC134). 

CCDC134 also affects the acetylation of non-histone proteins, such as p53, by increasing PCAF-dependent K320 acetylation of p53, which stabilizes the p53 protein when hADA2a is overexpressed (Huang2012CCDC134). This interaction plays a role in cellular stress responses, including DNA damage-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Huang2012CCDC134).
