# SOX3

## Overview
The SOX3 gene encodes the SRY-box transcription factor 3, a member of the SOX family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a conserved high-mobility group (HMG) DNA binding domain. This transcription factor plays a pivotal role in neural development and cell fate determination, acting as a pioneer factor that influences the epigenetic landscape to regulate gene expression. SOX3 is crucial for maintaining the undifferentiated state of neural progenitor cells and is involved in the regulation of self-renewal and pluripotency in human embryonal stem cells. It is expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells during embryonic development and continues to be active in neurogenic regions in adults. The protein interacts with various signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and can function as both a repressor and activator in different cellular contexts. Clinically, mutations and duplications in the SOX3 gene are associated with conditions such as hypopituitarism, disorders of sex development, and neural tube defects, underscoring its significance in both development and disease (Topalovic2017Epigenetic; Du2022Xq26.3q27.1; Alatzoglou2008The).

## Function
The SOX3 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in neural development and cell fate determination. It is part of the SOXB1 subgroup of transcription factors, which also includes SOX1 and SOX2, and is characterized by a high-mobility group (HMG) DNA binding domain (Alatzoglou2008The). SOX3 is one of the earliest neural markers in vertebrates and is involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state of neural progenitor cells by counteracting proneural proteins (Topalovic2017Epigenetic). It is expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells during embryonic development and continues to be expressed in progenitor cells of neurogenic regions in adult mice (Wang2006Sox3).

SOX3 functions as a pioneer factor, binding to target enhancers and establishing local epigenetic changes, which are crucial for the regulation of self-renewal and pluripotency of human embryonal stem cells (hESCs) (Topalovic2017Epigenetic). It can replace SOX2 during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse embryonic fibroblasts, highlighting its role in the selection and execution of developmental programs (Topalovic2017Epigenetic). The regulation of SOX3 during neural differentiation involves epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, with the SOX3 promoter being hypomethylated in both undifferentiated and differentiated states (Topalovic2017Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SOX3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the pituitary gland and sex development. Variants in SOX3 can lead to hypopituitarism, manifesting as isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD), combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD), and panhypopituitarism. These conditions may present with or without intellectual disabilities and can be detected in the neonatal period or later in life (Stagi2014A; Du2022Xq26.3q27.1). SOX3 gene duplications have been linked to congenital dysfunction of the hypophysis, small penis or cryptorchidism, and abnormalities in pituitary structure or other midline craniocerebral structures (Du2022Xq26.3q27.1).

SOX3 is also implicated in disorders of sex development, such as 46,XX male sex reversal. This condition can occur due to SOX3 duplications, which may lead to ectopic expression affecting sex development by upregulating SOX9, a gene involved in testicular differentiation (Zhuang2021The; Moalem2012XX). Additionally, SOX3 duplications have been associated with neural tube defects (NTDs), including myelomeningocele, highlighting its role in neural development (Hureaux2019SOX3). The phenotypic variability in SOX3 gene alterations may be due to altered levels of SOX3 expression and incomplete inactivation of X chromosome variants (Du2022Xq26.3q27.1).

## Interactions
SOX3, a member of the SOX family of transcription factors, is involved in various protein interactions that modulate gene expression and developmental processes. SOX3 interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it can physically bind to β-catenin. This interaction allows SOX3 to influence the transcription of Wnt-target genes by modulating β-catenin/TCF activity. SOX3 can repress β-catenin's ability to stimulate transcription, as demonstrated in cell culture assays where SOX3 suppresses β-catenin-mediated transcription of a reporter construct (Kormish2009Interactions; Bernard2010Acquisition).

In the context of neural development, SOX3 interacts with other SOXB1 proteins, such as SOX1 and SOX2, which can partially compensate for its loss. However, SOX3 has unique roles that are not fully compensated by these proteins, as seen in the regulation of specific genes like Fezf2 and Dbx1. SOX3 directly binds to the Dbx1 locus, regulating its expression in the spinal cord, which highlights its role in neural progenitor cells (Rogers2014Dbx1).

These interactions underscore SOX3's dual role as both a repressor and activator in different cellular contexts, contributing to its function in development and disease (Rogers2014Dbx1).
