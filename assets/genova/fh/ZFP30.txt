# ZFP30

## Overview
ZFP30 is a gene that encodes the ZFP30 zinc finger protein, which is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in regulating gene expression. This protein is integral to the process of adipogenesis, where it functions as a pro-adipogenic transcription factor by enhancing the expression of key adipogenic genes such as Pparg2. ZFP30 achieves this by binding to specific DNA sequences, including retrotransposon-derived enhancers, and recruiting co-regulators like KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1) to facilitate transcriptional activation. The protein's DNA-binding specificity is conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary significance. Beyond adipogenesis, ZFP30 is expressed in various tissues and is involved in repressing genes related to inflammation and immune response, highlighting its broader biological roles (Chen2019ZFP30).

## Function
ZFP30 is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in adipogenesis, the process of cell differentiation into adipocytes, or fat cells. It functions as a pro-adipogenic transcription factor by enhancing the expression of Pparg2, a master regulator of adipogenesis. ZFP30 achieves this by binding to a retrotransposon-derived enhancer located upstream of the Pparg2 transcription start site, recruiting the co-regulator KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1) to act as a co-activator, thereby increasing Pparg2 expression (Chen2019ZFP30).

ZFP30 is not a pioneer factor and requires other transcription factors to open chromatin, indicating its role in a broader adipogenic gene regulatory network. It is involved in the regulation of multiple targets during adipogenesis, with significant upregulation of core adipogenic genes like Pparg, Plin4, Lipe, and Cd36 (Chen2019ZFP30). ZFP30's DNA-binding specificity is conserved between mice and humans, suggesting its evolutionary adaptation and conserved function across species (Chen2019ZFP30).

In addition to its role in adipogenesis, ZFP30 is expressed in various tissues, including the retina, skin, and muscle, and is linked to disease phenotypes. It also represses genes related to inflammation and immune response (Chen2019ZFP30).

## Interactions
ZFP30, a zinc finger protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in adipogenesis. It interacts with KAP1, a known co-repressor, to enhance the expression of Pparg2, a master regulator of adipogenesis. This interaction is mediated by the KRAB domain of ZFP30, which is essential for binding KAP1. The interaction between ZFP30 and KAP1 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T and 3T3-L1 cells (Chen2019ZFP30).

ZFP30 also binds to specific retrotransposon-derived enhancers, which are crucial for the activation of Pparg2 expression. This binding is enriched in specific subsets of LINE1 elements, suggesting a co-evolution with these elements (Chen2019ZFP30). The protein's DNA-binding specificity is conserved between mice and humans, and it binds to novel DNA motifs identified as M1 and M2, with M1 being directly bound by ZFP30's zinc finger domains (Chen2019ZFP30).

ZFP30's interaction with KAP1 is unique among KZFPs, as it recruits KAP1 as a co-activator at the Pparg2 enhancer, a function not previously observed in KZFP-KAP1 interactions (Chen2019ZFP30).
