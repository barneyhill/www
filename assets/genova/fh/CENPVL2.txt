# CENPVL2

## Overview
CENPVL2 is a gene located on the X chromosome, specifically within the Xp11.22 region, and is classified as a pseudogene of the centromere protein V (CENPV) gene. The protein encoded by CENPVL2, centromere protein V like 2, is thought to share similarities with centromere protein V, which plays a crucial role in chromosome alignment and cell division. However, the precise function of CENPVL2 remains largely uncharacterized. Research has highlighted its potential clinical significance, as deletions involving CENPVL2 and neighboring genes in the Xp11.22 region have been associated with syndromic X-linked intellectual disability and various developmental disorders (Grau2017Xp11.22). Despite these associations, the specific contribution of CENPVL2 to these phenotypes is not fully understood, warranting further investigation into its biological role and impact on human health.

## Clinical Significance
The CENPVL2 gene is implicated in syndromic X-linked intellectual disability due to deletions in the Xp11.22 region, which encompasses several genes, including CENPVL2. These deletions are associated with a range of clinical phenotypes such as intellectual disability, developmental delay, hypotonia, joint hypermobility, and abnormal growth patterns (Grau2017Xp11.22). The specific role of CENPVL2 in these conditions is not fully understood, as it is a pseudogene of the centromere protein V gene (CENPV), which is involved in chromosome alignment and cell division processes. The loss of CENPVL2, along with other genes in the deletion region, may contribute to the observed phenotypes, although it is unclear if CENPVL2 is required for normal development (Grau2017Xp11.22).

The study identified two males with hemizygous deletions in this region, inherited from their asymptomatic mothers, exhibiting clinical phenotypes such as global developmental delay, congenital muscular torticollis, and other developmental issues (Grau2017Xp11.22). While the functions of CENPVL2 are not well understood, its involvement in these deletions suggests a potential link to intellectual disability and developmental disorders.
