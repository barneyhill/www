# DEPDC1

## Overview
DEPDC1 (DEP domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by the presence of a DEP domain, a structural motif involved in mediating protein-protein interactions. The DEPDC1 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those related to cancer biology, where it functions as a regulatory protein influencing cell proliferation, migration, and survival. It interacts with several key proteins and signaling pathways, such as the Hippo signaling pathway, to modulate cellular dynamics and tumor progression. DEPDC1's role in cancer has been extensively studied, revealing its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a target for therapeutic intervention in multiple cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (Di2024DEPDC1; Shen2021DEPDC1; Liu2024Roles).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
DEPDC1 (DEP domain containing 1) is significantly implicated in the progression and prognosis of various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DEPDC1 is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues, and its high expression is associated with poorer patient outcomes and increased risk of death. It serves as a prognostic factor for overall survival and shows higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity than the traditional biomarker AFP (Qu2018DEP). In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), DEPDC1 is significantly upregulated and associated with advanced tumor stages and smoking status. It has high diagnostic accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96, and is linked to immune cell activity in the tumor microenvironment (Lv2024Comprehensive).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), DEPDC1 enhances glycolysis through the AKT/mTOR/HIF1α pathway, contributing to tumor progression and drug resistance. High DEPDC1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and advanced cancer stages (Di2024DEPDC1). DEPDC1 is also involved in other cancers, such as colorectal and breast cancer, where it influences proliferation, invasion, and resistance to chemotherapy (Liu2024Roles). These findings suggest DEPDC1 as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker and a target for therapeutic intervention across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
DEPDC1 (DEP domain containing 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cancer progression. In osteosarcoma, DEPDC1 forms a complex with EEF1A1, a protein involved in protein translation. This interaction is crucial for promoting the proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma cells. The DEPDC1-EEF1A1 complex downregulates FOXO3a, a transcription factor, by promoting its translocation from the nucleus and subsequent phosphorylation, which enhances cell migration and inhibits apoptosis (Shen2021DEPDC1).

DEPDC1 also interacts with KIF4A in osteosarcoma cells. This interaction is suggested to regulate the Hippo signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. The down-regulation of DEPDC1 increases the expression of phosphorylated LATS1 and YAP, while decreasing YAP expression, effects that are partially reversed by KIF4A upregulation (Yang2023DEPDC1).

In other cancers, DEPDC1 forms a complex with zinc finger protein 224 (ZNF224), which suppresses the transcription of A20, leading to the activation of NF-κB and subsequent proliferation of bladder cancer cells. A peptide mimic of DEPDC1 can inhibit the formation of the DEPDC1-ZNF224 complex, inducing apoptosis in bladder cancer cells (Liu2024Roles).
