# MYH14

## Overview
The MYH14 gene encodes the myosin heavy chain 14 protein, a member of the non-muscle myosin II family, specifically the NM IIC isoform. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell motility, intracellular transport, and maintaining cell shape. It is expressed in a wide range of tissues, with particularly high levels in the small intestine, colon, and skeletal muscle (Leal2003A). The myosin heavy chain 14 protein is involved in the formation of a complex hexameric structure that generates mechanical force and tension within cells, contributing to essential cellular functions such as the trafficking of sodium/potassium ATPase subunits (Dash2018Multiple; Otterpohl2017Nonmuscle). Mutations in MYH14 have been linked to various neuromuscular and auditory conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Iyadurai2017Variable; Almutawa2019The).

## Structure
The MYH14 gene encodes a myosin heavy chain protein consisting of 1995 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 228 kDa (Leal2003A). The protein structure includes several domains: an amino-terminal myosin domain (N-myosin) from amino acids 53 to 98, a myosin head from 107 to 788, two IQ domains located between 813-824 and 839-850, and a myosin tail from 1091 to 1948 (Leal2003A). The myosin head is noted as the most conserved domain (Leal2003A).

MYH14 is part of the non-muscle myosin heavy chain family, specifically NMHC II-C, and is highly expressed in skeletal muscle (Rinaldi2012Aberrant). The protein can undergo alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms. One such isoform, NMHC II-C1, includes an alternatively spliced exon 6 that encodes 8 amino acids near the ATP binding region, which affects enzymatic activity and motility (Rinaldi2012Aberrant). 

MYH14 interacts with sodium/potassium ATPase alpha 1 subunits, with the actin binding site being crucial for this interaction (Dash2018Multiple). The protein is part of a complex hexameric structure composed of two heavy chains and four light chains, forming a four-headed bipolar filament that generates mechanical force and tension within cells (Otterpohl2017Nonmuscle).

## Function
The MYH14 gene encodes a myosin heavy chain protein that is part of the non-muscle myosin II family, specifically the NM IIC isoform. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell motility, intracellular transport, and maintaining cell shape (Leal2003A; Pecci2018MYH9:). MYH14 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, with particularly high expression in the small intestine, colon, and skeletal muscle (Leal2003A). 

MYH14 interacts with sodium/potassium ATPase alpha 1 subunits (Na+/K+-ATPase α1), suggesting a role in the trafficking of these subunits to cell membranes, which is crucial for maintaining cellular functions such as resting potential and excitability in neurons and myocytes (Dash2018Multiple). The protein is also involved in the transport and trafficking of the sodium pump, which is essential for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across cell membranes (Dash2018Multiple).

In the kidney, MYH14 is expressed in the apical membranes of intercalated cells within the collecting ducts and connecting segments, indicating a potential role in intracellular transport and membrane dynamics in these specialized cells (Otterpohl2017Nonmuscle). Despite its widespread expression, the specific function of MYH14 in healthy human cells remains unclear (Leal2003A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYH14 gene are associated with a range of neuromuscular and auditory conditions. One notable mutation, the R941L variant, is linked to peripheral neuropathy and hearing loss. This mutation disrupts mitochondrial fission, a critical process for maintaining mitochondrial function and distribution, particularly affecting the peripheral nerves. The R941L mutation acts in a dominant-negative manner, impairing the function of the non-muscle myosin IIC (NMIIC) protein, which is encoded by MYH14, leading to hyperfused mitochondrial networks and contributing to the peripheral neuropathy phenotype (Almutawa2019The).

MYH14 mutations have also been associated with distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) and sensorineural hearing loss. In a large North American family, a G-to-T mutation at position 2822 in the MYH14 gene, resulting in an Arg941Leu amino acid change, was found to be 100% concordant with these phenotypes. Affected individuals exhibited progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, primarily in the limbs, with variable onset ages (Iyadurai2017Variable).

Additionally, MYH14 mutations have been linked to a complex phenotype involving peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, hoarseness, and hearing loss in a Korean family, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of MYH14-related disorders (Choi2011A).

## Interactions
MYH14, a member of the myosin family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of endometrial cancer (EC), MYH14 interacts with MYH9, a protein that plays a role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is significant as MYH9 attenuates the GSK3β-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin, thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance. MYH14 knockdown results in the upregulation of GSK3β and downregulation of β-catenin, effects that can be reversed by MYH9 overexpression, indicating a regulatory role of MYH14 in this signaling pathway (Lin2024Sesamolin).

In the context of peripheral neuropathy, the R941L mutation in the MYH14 gene affects the non-muscle myosin IIC (NMIIC) protein, disrupting its ability to participate in mitochondrial fission. This mutation leads to impaired protein interactions necessary for dimer formation, potentially causing a dominant-negative effect that alters the functional activity of NMIIC. This disruption in mitochondrial fission is particularly evident at the cell periphery and is associated with the peripheral neuropathy phenotype observed in patients (Almutawa2019The).
