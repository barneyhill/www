# LITAF

## Overview
LITAF, or lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF factor, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular membrane trafficking and the regulation of inflammatory responses. The LITAF protein is a monotopic membrane protein characterized by a proline-rich N-terminal region and a C-terminal LITAF domain, which includes a zinc-binding structure crucial for its function. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity of peripheral nerve myelin and modulating immune responses by interacting with various cellular components, such as phosphatidylethanolamine head groups and the STAT6(B) protein. Mutations in the LITAF gene are linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C, a demyelinating neuropathy, and its altered expression is associated with gastric cancer, highlighting its importance in both neurodegenerative and oncological contexts (Tang2005LPS; CHEN2020Involvement; Ho2016The).

## Structure
The LITAF protein is characterized by a proline-rich N-terminal region and a C-terminal LITAF domain. The proline-rich region is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with E3 ubiquitin ligases and ESCRT components, and contains motifs such as PPXY and PS/TAP, which mediate associations with partner proteins (ZOU2015Lipopolysaccharide-induced; ho2019characterisation). The C-terminal LITAF domain is highly conserved and includes a zinc-binding structure stabilized by conserved cysteine residues, forming a zinc β-ribbon motif (Ho2016The). This domain is composed of five β-strands, with a β-hairpin at the C-terminus, and interacts with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) head groups on membrane surfaces (Ho2016The).

The LITAF protein is a monotopic membrane protein, integrating into intracellular membranes through a hydrophobic, in-plane, helical anchor within the LITAF domain (Ho2016The). It does not traverse membranes but resides on the cytosolic surface, acting as a membrane anchor (Ho2016The). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in membrane dynamics and intracellular trafficking, with mutations in the LITAF domain linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C (Ho2016The).

## Function
The LITAF gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular membrane trafficking and the regulation of inflammatory responses. In healthy human cells, LITAF is involved in membrane dynamics, particularly in endocytic vesicles, where it colocalizes with early and late endosome markers. This protein is essential for maintaining the integrity of peripheral nerve myelin by ensuring proper trafficking of membrane receptors, such as growth factor receptors and cell adhesion molecules, which are vital for the stability of the myelin sheath (Ho2016The).

LITAF functions as a monotopic membrane protein, anchoring to membranes through its C-terminal domain. It interacts specifically with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) head groups, which is crucial for its role in membrane dynamics, including invagination and tubulation, processes important for endosomal sorting and recycling (Ho2016The). The protein's structure is stabilized by zinc coordination, which is essential for its correct folding and stability (Ho2016The).

In addition to its role in membrane trafficking, LITAF is involved in the regulation of cytokines, such as TNF-α, through its interaction with the STAT6(B) protein, highlighting its significance in immune response modulation (Tang2005LPS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the LITAF gene are associated with several diseases, most notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C (CMT1C) and gastric cancer. In CMT1C, mutations in LITAF, such as W116G and V144M, affect the protein's stability and intracellular targeting, leading to its rapid degradation and contributing to disease pathology (Ho2016The; ho2019characterisation). These mutations result in the enlargement and vacuolation of late endosomal/lysosomal compartments, indicating a loss of function through a dominant-negative mechanism (Edgar2020A). The disease is characterized by demyelinating neuropathy, with symptoms including reduced nerve conduction velocities and other neuropathological features (ho2019characterisation).

In gastric cancer, high expression levels of LITAF are linked to advanced pathological stages and poor prognosis. The gene's overexpression is associated with increased cancer cell growth and invasion, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (CHEN2020Involvement). These findings highlight the dual role of LITAF in both neurodegenerative and oncological conditions, emphasizing its clinical significance in disease development and progression.

## Interactions
LITAF interacts with several proteins and plays a role in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with STAT6(B), a variant of the STAT6 gene, which is crucial for the regulation of cytokines. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, where the LITAF-STAT6(B) complex translocates to the nucleus to enhance the transcription of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-10, and RANTES (Tang2005LPS).

LITAF also interacts with the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 through its proline-rich region. This interaction is mediated by the PPXY motif in LITAF, which binds to the WW domains of NEDD4, influencing LITAF's intracellular targeting and membrane association (Ho2016The).

In the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C, LITAF's interaction with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) head groups is altered by the V144M mutation, leading to misfolding and rapid degradation of the protein. This interaction is critical for maintaining proper membrane association and function (Ho2016The).
