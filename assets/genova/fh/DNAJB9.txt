# DNAJB9

## Overview
DNAJB9 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B9, also known as ERdj4. This protein is a co-chaperone primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis. As a member of the Hsp40 family, DNAJB9 is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, assisting in the proper folding and degradation of misfolded proteins, thereby preventing their aggregation and ensuring cellular stress resilience (Minchenko2023Expression; Huang2019Targeting). The protein is characterized by its J domain, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins, such as p53, and for regulating the ATPase activity of Hsp70 proteins (Lee2014Genotoxic; Shamekhi2022Effect). DNAJB9's interactions and regulatory functions are significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, cystic fibrosis, and kidney diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kim2022MultiFaceted; Huang2019Targeting).

## Structure
DNAJB9 is a protein consisting of 223 amino acids and is part of the Type II DNAJ (Hsp40) homology subfamily B. It features an N-terminal J domain, a glycine/phenylalanine-rich domain, and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (Kim2022MultiFaceted; Huang2019Targeting). The J domain, spanning amino acids 24 to 93, is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as p53, and is involved in regulating the ATPase activity of Hsp70 proteins (Lee2014Genotoxic; Shamekhi2022Effect). The protein also contains a hydrophobic sequence at the N-terminus, from amino acids 7 to 23 (Lee2014Genotoxic).

DNAJB9 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and acts as a co-chaperone, assisting in protein folding and stabilization under stress conditions (Kim2022MultiFaceted; Huang2019Targeting). It is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it helps mediate the degradation of misfolded proteins (Huang2019Targeting). DNAJB9 is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are important for its function and regulation (Kim2022MultiFaceted). The protein may have splice variant isoforms, although specific details on these are not provided in the context.

## Function
DNAJB9, also known as ERdj4, is a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) and functions as a co-chaperone primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis by assisting in the proper folding, unfolding, translocation, and degradation of substrate proteins. DNAJB9 is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which targets misfolded proteins for degradation, thereby preventing their aggregation and ensuring cellular stress resilience (Minchenko2023Expression; Huang2019Targeting).

DNAJB9 interacts with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, influencing its degradation and surface expression. This interaction is significant in the context of cystic fibrosis, where DNAJB9's regulation of CFTR degradation can impact disease progression (Huang2019Targeting). Additionally, DNAJB9 is an inducible gene of the tumor suppressor p53 and can inhibit its pro-apoptotic function, acting as a negative feedback regulator to protect cells from stress-induced apoptosis (Lee2014Genotoxic).

In healthy human cells, DNAJB9's activity is crucial for managing ER stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological processes and disease contexts (Minchenko2023Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DNAJB9 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of cancer, DNAJB9 is involved in the regulation of TP53-mediated apoptosis and senescence. It can suppress the TP53-mediated Ras/Raf/Erk pathway, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis by promoting cellular transformation and potentially contributing to cancer progression (Kim2022MultiFaceted). DNAJB9 has also been identified as a metastasis suppressor in breast cancer, where its lower expression is associated with worse outcomes. Overexpression of DNAJB9 in metastatic breast cancer cells reduces mesenchymal marker expression and metastatic abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for preventing cancer metastasis (Kim2022MultiFaceted).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DNAJB9 is a target gene of miR-32, with its expression inversely correlated with miR-32 and positively correlated with SNHG5. This interaction suggests a role in chemotherapy resistance, highlighting the gene's involvement in AML (Kim2022MultiFaceted).

DNAJB9 is also significant in cystic fibrosis, particularly in relation to the ΔF508-CFTR mutation. It is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, and its downregulation can rescue the function of ΔF508-CFTR, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for cystic fibrosis (Huang2019Targeting).

In kidney diseases, DNAJB9 serves as a biomarker for fibrillary glomerulonephritis, where its presence in kidney biopsy specimens is associated with disease progression and outcomes (Shamekhi2022Effect).

## Interactions
DNAJB9, also known as ERdj4, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It acts as a co-chaperone for the GRP78-binding immunoglobulin protein, an ER member of the Hsp70 family, and is regulated by ER stresses such as heat and ethanol (Kim2022MultiFaceted). DNAJB9 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, inhibiting its pro-apoptotic function under genotoxic stress. This interaction occurs through DNAJB9's J domain, which is crucial for binding to p53, as demonstrated in immunoprecipitation assays (Lee2014Genotoxic). 

In breast cancer, DNAJB9 interacts with FBXO45, a ubiquitin ligase, to promote the degradation of ZEB1, thereby suppressing metastasis by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Kim2021DNAJB9). DNAJB9 also interacts with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), particularly the ΔF508-CFTR variant, playing a role in its ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This interaction is significant for understanding CFTR biogenesis and degradation, as DNAJB9 influences the stability and function of CFTR proteins (Huang2019Targeting).
