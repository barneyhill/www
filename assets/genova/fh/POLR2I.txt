# POLR2I

## Overview
POLR2I is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase II subunit I, a critical component of the RNA polymerase II complex, which is responsible for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells. This subunit is integral to the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase II core complex, playing a vital role in transcriptional fidelity and genome integrity (Muste2023Deregulations). The protein encoded by POLR2I is involved in transcription-coupled repair pathways and interacts with other proteins in the nucleolus to regulate ribosomal RNA biogenesis, underscoring its importance in cellular growth and function (Khosraviani2023Nucleolar). POLR2I's expression and interactions are significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and hypertensive nephropathy, where its deregulation can impact transcription processes and disease progression (Muste2023Deregulations; You2021Comprehensive).

## Structure


## Function
POLR2I encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells. This subunit is part of the core complex of RNA polymerase II, contributing to its assembly and stability, which is essential for the transcriptional machinery's function (Muste2023Deregulations). POLR2I is involved in maintaining transcriptional fidelity and genome integrity, playing a role in transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathways. Its absence can lead to reduced transcriptional accuracy and defects in replication fork progression, highlighting its importance in DNA repair and transcription-related processes (You2021Comprehensive).

In the nucleolus, POLR2I interacts with other proteins such as TBPL1 and PAF1, which are key regulators of RNA polymerase II and I activities at the intergenic spacer (IGS) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). This interaction is crucial for rRNA biogenesis, as it regulates the production of ribosomal RNA by controlling the synthesis of non-coding RNAs at the IGS (Khosraviani2023Nucleolar). POLR2I's activity in the nucleolus underscores its role in ensuring proper nucleolar organization and function, which is vital for ribosome biogenesis and cellular growth (Khosraviani2023Nucleolar).

## Clinical Significance
POLR2I has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels. In cancer, POLR2I is often upregulated in ovarian and head and neck cancers, potentially contributing to resistance against DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and the PARP inhibitor olaparib, as well as radiation therapy. Conversely, it is downregulated in less aggressive colorectal cancer cell lines and hepatocellular carcinomas, where its reduced expression correlates with mutations in the mRNA of other genes, suggesting a role in impaired transcription fidelity and the production of aberrant transcripts (Muste2023Deregulations).

In hypertensive nephropathy (HN), POLR2I is overexpressed and positively correlated with renal function, indicating its involvement in the disease's progression. The gene's role in transcription and DNA repair processes suggests that its deregulation can lead to serious pathologies, including HN. The absence of POLR2I may reduce transcriptional accuracy and lead to defects in the DNA damage response, highlighting its critical role in maintaining transcriptional fidelity and genome integrity. POLR2I's involvement in oxidative stress-related processes in HN is also suggested, although this requires further investigation (You2021Comprehensive).

## Interactions
POLR2I, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, is involved in various interactions crucial for its function in transcription. It is part of the RNA polymerase II complex, which consists of 12 subunits encoded by the genes POLR2A-K (Muste2023Deregulations). While specific interactions of POLR2I with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, it is implied to be associated with ARMC5, a protein involved in the degradation of multiple Pol II subunits, including POLR2I (Luo2024ARMC5). This interaction suggests a role in the regulation of Pol II subunit levels, potentially affecting transcription processes.

In the context of cancer, POLR2I is noted for its deregulation, being upregulated in ovarian and head and neck cancers, and downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. These changes in expression levels may influence its interactions within the Pol II complex and with other regulatory proteins, impacting transcription fidelity and resistance to therapies (Muste2023Deregulations).

POLR2I's interactions are part of the broader dynamics of the Pol II complex, which engages with transcription factors and other regulatory proteins to facilitate mRNA synthesis and processing (Muste2023Deregulations).
