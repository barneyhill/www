# RET

## Overview
The RET proto-oncogene is a critical component of cellular signaling, encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the development and function of the nervous system and kidneys. The RET protein, characterized as a transmembrane receptor, comprises an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. This structure facilitates its function in mediating signaling pathways essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. RET is activated by the binding of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands, which, in conjunction with GFRα co-receptors, leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation. These processes initiate downstream signaling cascades, including the Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and JNK pathways, which are vital for various cellular processes. Mutations and alterations in the RET gene are associated with several diseases, including multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and Hirschsprung's disease, underscoring its clinical significance in both oncogenesis and developmental disorders (Edery1997Ret; Desilets2023RETAltered; Airaksinen1999GDNF).

## Structure
The RET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of the RET protein includes a signal peptide, an extracellular domain with four cadherin-like domains (CLDs), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (Ibanez2013Structure; Alberti2003RET). The extracellular region also contains a cysteine-rich domain crucial for ligand interaction and protein integrity (Ibanez2013Structure). The intracellular portion features a tyrosine kinase domain interrupted by a 27-amino-acid insert, and the C-terminal tail varies due to alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms RET9, RET43, and RET51 (Santoro2013Central; Alberti2003RET).

The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with the cadherin-like domains forming a compact clam-shell arrangement (Ibanez2013Structure). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, facilitated by specific amino acids in the transmembrane segment (Santoro2013Central).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation and phosphorylation, with several autophosphorylation sites such as Y1062 and Y1096 playing critical roles in signaling pathways (Ibanez2013Structure; Santoro2013Central). These structural features are essential for RET's function in cellular signaling and its role in various diseases.

## Function
The RET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in cell signaling pathways, particularly in the development and function of the nervous system and kidneys. In healthy human cells, RET is activated by the binding of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands, which triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling events. This activation involves the interaction with GFRα co-receptors, leading to RET dimerization and autophosphorylation of its intracellular tyrosine residues (Airaksinen1999GDNF).

The phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites for adaptor proteins, initiating downstream signaling pathways such as Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and JNK. These pathways are essential for cellular processes like proliferation, survival, and differentiation, particularly in neurons (Unknownauthors2020RolesoftheRETProtooncogeneinCancerandDevelopment; Airaksinen1999GDNF). RET signaling is vital for the development of the enteric nervous system, kidneys, and various types of neurons, including peripheral autonomic, sensory, and central motor neurons (Unknownauthors2020RolesoftheRETProtooncogeneinCancerandDevelopment; Airaksinen1999GDNF).

In the cellular context, RET is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (Edery1997Ret). This structure allows RET to mediate critical signaling processes that influence cell migration, proliferation, and survival, contributing to normal development and function (Edery1997Ret).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RET proto-oncogene are implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell signaling. Gain-of-function mutations in RET are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), which includes subtypes MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). These conditions are characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and, in some cases, parathyroid hyperplasia or mucosal neuromas (Desilets2023RETAltered; Edery1997Ret; Alberti2003RET). MEN2B is particularly aggressive, often necessitating early intervention (Mahato2020RET).

In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in RET lead to Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disorder resulting in intestinal obstruction due to the absence of enteric ganglion cells (Desilets2023RETAltered; Edery1997Ret). RET rearrangements, such as those involving the CCDC6 gene, are common in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and are more prevalent in radiation-induced cases (TAKAHASHI2022RET). RET fusions are also found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers, often leading to constitutive activation of the RET kinase (Zhou2022An; Desilets2023RETAltered). These genetic alterations highlight the clinical significance of RET in oncogenesis and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
The RET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its signaling functions. RET activation is initiated by the binding of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to the GDNF family receptor α1 (GFRα1), forming a complex that facilitates RET dimerization and activation (Kawai2020Intracellular; Arighi2005RET). This activation leads to the autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues on RET, which serve as docking sites for various adaptor proteins.

Key phosphorylated tyrosines include Y1062, which interacts with adaptor proteins such as SHC, FRS2, and DOK family proteins, activating the RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways (Kawai2020Intracellular; Mulligan2014RET). Y1096, present in the RET51 isoform, binds GRB2, further facilitating the activation of these pathways (Kawai2020Intracellular; Mulligan2014RET). Y1015 serves as a docking site for phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), which regulates calcium release (Kawai2020Intracellular). Y981 interacts with Src kinase and RAP1GAP, influencing neuronal survival and differentiation (Kawai2020Intracellular).

These interactions are essential for RET's role in cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation, highlighting its significance in developmental processes and oncogenesis (Regua2022RET; Mulligan2014RET).
