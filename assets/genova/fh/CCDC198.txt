# CCDC198

## Overview
The CCDC198 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 198 protein, which is a membrane-bound protein involved in various cellular processes, including metabolism, energy balance, and kidney physiology. This protein is predominantly expressed in the kidneys, pancreas, liver, and fallopian tubes, with a significant presence in kidney epithelial cells. CCDC198 is implicated in the regulation of water and nutrient exchange, iron homeostasis, and protein excretion. It interacts with several proteins, such as Ferritin Heavy Chain 1, and is involved in mitochondrial and microtubule functions, suggesting a role in intracellular transport and cellular energy management. The protein's interactions and functions highlight its importance in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating protein-protein interactions, impacting both cellular function and organismal health (Petersen2023A).

## Function
The CCDC198 gene encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly related to metabolism, energy balance, and kidney physiology. In healthy human cells, CCDC198 is a membrane-bound protein that localizes to the plasma membrane and small cytoplasmic vesicles. Its localization is influenced by N-myristoylation, a post-translational modification that affects its cellular distribution (Petersen2023A).

CCDC198 is highly expressed in the kidneys, pancreas, liver, and fallopian tubes, with significant expression in kidney epithelial cells, such as those in the loop of Henle and collecting duct cells (Petersen2023A). The protein is involved in controlling water and nutrient exchange, and it plays a role in iron homeostasis and protein excretion, as evidenced by knockout studies in mice that show altered body weight, decreased energy expenditure, and changes in iron metabolism (Petersen2023A).

CCDC198 interacts with proteins involved in iron metabolism, such as Ferritin Heavy Chain 1 (FTH1), and is implicated in mitochondrial and microtubule functions, suggesting its involvement in intracellular transport and cellular energy management (Petersen2023A). These interactions highlight its role in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating protein-protein interactions, impacting cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCDC198 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In humans, specific mutations in CCDC198 have been studied for their phenotypic effects, particularly in relation to metabolic syndromes, kidney-related disorders, and macular degeneration. One notable mutation, rs147526762, has been associated with high-density lipoprotein levels and hypertensive chronic kidney disease, although these associations did not pass correction for multiple comparisons (Petersen2023A).

CCDC198 is also implicated in cancer, where its expression is maintained across various tumor types. Overexpression of the gene in certain cell lines decreases proliferation, while knockout increases it, suggesting a role in tumor cell metabolism. The gene is localized in membranous protrusions of tumor cells and is internalized in malignant tissues, indicating its involvement in altered metabolic states and potentially in cancer progression through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Petersen2023A).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CCDC198 has been identified as one of the top 10 significant prognostic differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with overall survival in patients with the IDH2 R140Q mutation (Huang2019Genomescale). These findings suggest that CCDC198 may serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
CCDC198, also known as FAME, is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes related to metabolism and energy. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified several molecular binding partners of CCDC198, including Ferritin Heavy Chain 1 (FTH1), Formin Binding Protein 1 Like (FNBP1L), and Tousled Like Kinase 1 (TLK1). FTH1 is associated with iron storage, FNBP1L with membrane tubulation and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, and TLK1 with cell cycle regulation (Petersen2023A). The interaction with FTH1 was confirmed in HEK293T cells using mCherry-labelled FTH1 and GFP-tagged CCDC198 (Petersen2023A).

CCDC198 also interacts with transcription factors and proteins with histone acetyltransferase activity, such as CREBZF and MYST2, which are involved in cell cycle progression and replication (Petersen2023A). Proximity-dependent biotin identification (Bio-ID) and immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry have revealed CCDC198's association with intracellular protein transport, mitochondrial inner membrane, respiratory electron transport, and protein export, indicating its involvement in cellular and membrane transport processes (Petersen2023A). These interactions highlight the potential role of CCDC198 in iron metabolism and cell cycle association, as well as its broader involvement in metabolic and mitochondrial processes (Petersen2023A).
