# DHX9

## Overview
DHX9 is a gene that encodes the DExH-box helicase 9, a multifunctional enzyme belonging to the DExH/D-box family of helicases. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including the unwinding of RNA and DNA duplexes, which is essential for DNA replication, transcription, RNA transport, and translation. As an RNA helicase, DHX9 is involved in the processing of microRNA and circular RNA, contributing to the maintenance of genome stability and regulation of gene expression (Bonaventure2022DExH/D-box; Wang2023A). The protein's activity is crucial for both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions, influencing immune responses and cellular growth. Dysregulation of DHX9 has been linked to several diseases, notably cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Wang2023A; Yang2024DHX9).

## Structure
DHX9, also known as DExH-box helicase 9, is a multifunctional protein characterized by a conserved helicase core domain. This core includes motifs essential for ATP binding, hydrolysis, and RNA binding, facilitating its role in unwinding RNA and DNA duplexes (Bonaventure2022DExH/D-box; Shen2020General). The molecular structure of DHX9 comprises several distinct domains: a minimal transactivation domain, a helicase domain (HelC), two double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) at the N-terminus, and a C-terminal single-stranded RNA or DNA-binding domain containing arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) repeats (Hong2018Bidirectional).

The protein's helicase activity is crucial for its function in various cellular processes, including RNA editing, where it interacts with ADAR1 and ADAR2 proteins in the nucleus (Hong2018Bidirectional). DHX9 also binds to RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) within the 5′-UTRs of mRNAs, influencing translation efficiency and ribosome distribution (Murat2018RNA). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate DHX9's activity, and multiple splice variants contribute to its functional diversity (Shen2020General). These structural features enable DHX9 to participate in a wide range of cellular functions, including transcription, splicing, and ribosome biogenesis.

## Function
DHX9, also known as DExH-box helicase 9 or RNA helicase A (RHA), is a multifunctional enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the unwinding of nucleic acids, which is essential for DNA replication, transcription, RNA transport, and translation. DHX9 is also implicated in the processing of microRNA and circular RNA, as well as in maintaining genome stability (Wang2023A).

The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it facilitates the processing and transport of RNA molecules. By unwinding RNA structures, DHX9 aids in the regulation of gene expression and ensures the proper functioning of cellular processes. Its activity is vital for maintaining genomic stability, which is crucial for preventing abnormal cell growth and tumorigenesis (Wang2023A).

In addition to its role in RNA metabolism, DHX9 is involved in the regulation of immune responses. It has been found to correlate with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, indicating its potential role in modulating immune functions (Wang2023A). The enzyme's deregulation can lead to altered cellular growth, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Wang2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the DHX9 gene, which encodes an RNA helicase, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. Overexpression of DHX9 is observed in multiple cancer types, including liver, lung, breast, and prostate cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Chellini2022The; Wang2023A). In prostate cancer, DHX9 acts as a coactivator of the androgen receptor, promoting tumor growth and progression (Chellini2022The). Conversely, low expression of DHX9 is linked to poor prognosis in kidney cancers (Wang2023A).

DHX9 is also involved in the regulation of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, a process that can be dysregulated in cancers such as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hong2018Bidirectional). Dysregulation of DHX9 can lead to genomic instability by affecting R-loop resolution, contributing to DNA damage and cell death (Yang2024DHX9).

In addition to cancer, DHX9 dysregulation is associated with neurological disorders, as certain monoallelic variations in the gene have been linked to these conditions (Yang2024DHX9). The gene's role in maintaining genome stability underscores its clinical significance in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
DHX9, also known as RNA helicase A, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in maintaining genome stability and regulating gene expression. DHX9 interacts with RNA polymerase II, particularly associating with its S5P phosphorylated form during early transcription stages. This interaction is dynamic and influenced by the presence of splicing factors such as SFPQ and SF3B3, which DHX9 helps assemble onto nascent RNA to prevent R-loop formation (Chakraborty2018DHX9).

DHX9 also interacts with the human nucleoporin Nup98, which regulates its ATPase activity and influences its role in mRNA metabolism, including transcription and splicing. This interaction is facilitated by RNA and affects the expression of shared gene loci (Capitanio2017Human). The SUMOylation of DHX9 at lysine 120 enhances its interactions with R-loop-associated proteins such as PARP1 and DDX21, which are crucial for managing R-loop dynamics and preventing genome instability (Yang2024DHX9).

In cervical cancer cells, DHX9 interacts with the long non-coding RNA lnc-CCDST and the protein MDM2, which promotes its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, affecting cell migration and growth (Ding2018A).
