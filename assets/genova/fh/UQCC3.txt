# UQCC3

## Overview
UQCC3 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor 3, which is crucial for the assembly and function of complex III in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial assembly factor and is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in the stabilization and incorporation of cytochrome b, a key component of complex III. UQCC3 operates downstream of the UQCC1-UQCC2 complex, and its stability is dependent on these proteins, indicating a coordinated interaction necessary for the proper assembly of complex III. Mutations in the UQCC3 gene can lead to mitochondrial complex III deficiency, a condition that disrupts cellular energy production and is associated with various clinical symptoms (Wanschers2014A).

## Function
The UQCC3 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein essential for the assembly and function of complex III in the electron transport chain. This protein is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, with its C-terminus extending into the inter-membrane space, where it plays a critical role in the stabilization and assembly of cytochrome b, a key component of complex III (Wanschers2014A). UQCC3 functions downstream of the UQCC1-UQCC2 complex, and its stability is dependent on these proteins, suggesting a functional interaction necessary for complex III assembly (Wanschers2014A).

In healthy human cells, UQCC3 is involved in the proper synthesis, stability, and incorporation of cytochrome b into complex III, ensuring efficient mitochondrial function and ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (FernándezVizarra2015Nuclear; Wanschers2014A). The absence or mutation of UQCC3 leads to a deficiency in complex III assembly, resulting in impaired electron transport and reduced cellular energy production (Wanschers2014A). This highlights the importance of UQCC3 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its potential role in complex III deficiency when mutated (Wanschers2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UQCC3 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex III deficiency, a condition that affects the mitochondrial respiratory chain and leads to a range of clinical symptoms. A specific homozygous c.59T>A mutation in UQCC3, resulting in a p.Val20Glu amino acid change, has been identified in patients with isolated complex III deficiency. This mutation is predicted to be damaging and leads to reduced levels of complex III, affecting the stability of cytochrome b and other subunits, although it does not alter the levels of UQCC1 and UQCC2 proteins (Wanschers2014A). Patients with this mutation may experience symptoms such as lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, muscular weakness, and delayed psychomotor development (Wanschers2014A).

The UQCC3 gene functions downstream of other assembly factors, UQCC1 and UQCC2, and its absence or mutation negatively impacts the stability of cytochrome b, leading to complex III deficiency (Wanschers2014A). This deficiency is a severe multisystem disorder characterized by symptoms including hypotonia, mitochondrial encephalopathy, and early death (Wanschers2014A). The role of UQCC3 in complex III assembly may involve cofactor insertion, similar to its yeast ortholog Cbp4 (Wanschers2014A).

## Interactions
UQCC3 is a mitochondrial protein involved in the assembly and stability of complex III in the electron transport chain. It is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, with its C-terminus extending into the inter-membrane space. UQCC3 interacts functionally with UQCC1 and UQCC2, which are necessary for its stability and the proper assembly of complex III. The depletion of UQCC1 and UQCC2 results in reduced levels of UQCC3, indicating a dependency on these proteins for its stability (Wanschers2014A).

Although direct physical interactions between UQCC3 and UQCC1/UQCC2 have not been demonstrated, UQCC3 is thought to function downstream of the UQCC1-UQCC2 complex in the assembly process. This suggests a sequential interaction where UQCC3 may stabilize cytochrome b after its initial assembly steps facilitated by UQCC1 and UQCC2 (Dennerlein2021Defining; Wanschers2014A).

UQCC3 does not appear to interact directly with other proteins involved in the early stages of cytochrome c reductase assembly, such as SMIM4 and C12ORF73, which predominantly interact with UQCC1 and UQCC2 (Dennerlein2021Defining). This indicates that UQCC3 may have distinct roles or interaction partners in the later stages of complex III assembly.
