# RSPO3

## Overview
RSPO3 is a gene that encodes the protein R-spondin 3, a secreted glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, stem cell maintenance, and tissue regeneration. R-spondin 3 is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including furin-like cysteine-rich domains and a thrombospondin type 1 repeat, which facilitate its interactions with key components of the Wnt signaling pathway, such as ZNRF3, RNF43, and LGR receptors (Tocci2020R‐spondin‐mediated; Jin2012The). The protein is involved in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling, influencing developmental processes like angiogenesis and vasculogenesis (ter2021The). RSPO3's clinical significance is underscored by its association with colorectal cancer and metabolic conditions, where alterations in its expression or structure can lead to disease progression (Hilkens2016RSPO3; Loh2020RSPO3).

## Structure
RSPO3, a member of the R-spondin family, is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes several conserved domains. The protein features a signal peptide at the N-terminus, which directs it through the canonical secretory pathway (Jin2012The). RSPO3 contains two furin-like cysteine-rich domains (FU1 and FU2), a thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) domain, and a basic amino acid-rich (BR) domain at the C-terminus (Tocci2020R‐spondin‐mediated; Jin2012The).

The FU1 domain is crucial for binding to the transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3 and RNF43, facilitating LGR-independent WNT signaling (Zebisch2013Structural; Lebensohn2018Rspondins). The FU2 domain interacts with leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors (LGR4-6) (Tocci2020R‐spondin‐mediated). The TSR domain is involved in binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), such as syndecans and glypicans, which aids in cell surface retention (Lebensohn2018Rspondins; Jin2012The).

RSPO3 is the largest among the R-spondins, with its BR domain being notably long and enriched with positively charged amino acids, contributing to its interaction with HSPGs (Tocci2020R‐spondin‐mediated). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, and alternative splicing can lead to isoforms with structural and functional diversity (Jin2012The).

## Function
RSPO3 (R-spondin 3) is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, stem cell maintenance, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration in healthy human cells (ter2021The). RSPO3 enhances Wnt signaling by interfering with the ZNRF3/RNF43-mediated negative feedback loop, thereby increasing the availability of Wnt receptors and promoting Wnt ligand-mediated activation (ter2021The). This protein is primarily expressed by stromal cells near the crypt stem cells in the intestines, where it supports the proliferation and self-renewal of intestinal stem cells (ter2021The).

RSPO3 can potentiate Wnt signaling independently of LGR receptors by interacting with ZNRF3/RNF43 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), providing an alternative mechanism for Wnt signaling (Lebensohn2018Rspondins). It also plays a role in non-canonical Wnt signaling, modulating pathways such as Wnt/PCP signaling by binding to syndecan-4 and LGR4,5 (ter2021The). RSPO3 is involved in various developmental processes, including angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, and is essential for maintaining cellular functions and developmental processes in healthy human cells (ter2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RSPO3 gene are implicated in several diseases, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). RSPO3 gene fusions, such as PTPRK-RSPO3, are found in a subset of CRC cases and lead to enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling, contributing to tumorigenesis. These fusions are mutually exclusive with other common Wnt pathway mutations but can co-occur with KRAS or BRAF mutations, serving as an alternative mechanism for cancer progression (ter2021The; Hilkens2016RSPO3). RSPO3 overexpression is also linked to the expansion of intestinal stem cells and niche compartments, promoting rapid tumorigenesis in the intestine (Hilkens2016RSPO3).

In addition to CRC, RSPO3 is associated with altered body fat distribution and related metabolic conditions. Genetic variants at the RSPO3 locus influence waist-hip ratio and are linked to increased RSPO3 expression in subcutaneous adipocytes, affecting fat distribution and contributing to insulin resistance (Loh2020RSPO3). RSPO3's role in modulating Wnt signaling in adipose tissue suggests its involvement in conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease due to its impact on adipose tissue biology (Loh2020RSPO3).

## Interactions
RSPO3 (R-spondin 3) is known for its interactions with several proteins that play crucial roles in Wnt signaling pathways. RSPO3 binds with high affinity to syndecan 4 (Sdc4), a transmembrane proteoglycan, which acts as a receptor or coreceptor in the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for processes such as gastrulation movements and head cartilage morphogenesis in Xenopus embryos (Ohkawara2011Rspo3). RSPO3 also interacts with the FU1 domain of ZNRF3 and RNF43, which are E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling. These interactions are crucial for the ubiquitylation and degradation of Wnt receptors, such as Frizzled (FZD), thereby modulating the sensitivity to Wnt ligands (Lebensohn2022Receptor).

In addition, RSPO3 can potentiate Wnt signaling through interactions with LGR4, LGR5, and LGR6 receptors. It enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling by clearing negative regulators from the membrane, increasing Wnt receptor availability (ter2021The). RSPO3 also engages in interactions with the LGR4-Gab1-Gαi1/3 complex, which is necessary for Erk activation and neuroprotection against ischemic injury (Liu2023Endothelial). These interactions highlight RSPO3's multifaceted role in modulating Wnt signaling and its potential implications in development and disease.
