# ASB5

## Overview
The ASB5 gene encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 5, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box (ASB) family. This protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains and a SOCS box domain, which are integral to its function in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. ASB5 is primarily expressed in skeletal tissues and is localized to the plasma membrane, suggesting its involvement in muscle development and differentiation. It plays a significant role in vascular development and arteriogenesis, particularly under ischemic conditions, by regulating the stability and turnover of specific target proteins. The protein's expression and interactions have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Anasa2018Multifaceted; Tee2010Anchoring; Xie2023A).

## Structure
The ASB5 protein is part of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box (ASB) family, characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains and a SOCS box domain. The ankyrin repeats are involved in specific protein-protein interactions and form helix-loop-helix motifs, contributing to the protein's secondary structure (Anasa2018Multifaceted; Tee2010Anchoring). ASB5 contains six ankyrin repeats, which are crucial for substrate recognition and interaction (Tee2010Anchoring). The SOCS box domain acts as an adaptor for protein degradation, facilitating the recruitment of proteins to the ubiquitination complex (Anasa2018Multifaceted; Kile2000Cloning).

ASB5 is expressed in skeletal tissues and is localized to the plasma membrane, suggesting a role in muscle development and differentiation (Tee2010Anchoring). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications such as SUMOylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, which may affect its expression levels and subcellular localization (Anasa2018Multifaceted). While specific details on the primary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of ASB5 are not provided, the protein's ability to form oligomers with other ASB family members suggests a potential quaternary structure (Anasa2018Multifaceted). Information on splice variant isoforms of ASB5 is not available in the provided context.

## Function
ASB5 (ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 5) is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in protein-protein interactions facilitated by its ankyrin repeat domains. It is part of the SOCS box protein family, which is implicated in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, a process crucial for protein degradation, cellular localization, and activity regulation (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB5 is expressed in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of collateral arteries, as well as in satellite cells of myocytes, but not in myocytes themselves in vivo (Anasa2018Multifaceted). This localization suggests a role in vascular development and arteriogenesis, particularly in response to ischemic conditions (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

The protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it may regulate the stability and turnover of specific target proteins, influencing muscle differentiation and vascular development (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB5's involvement in cardiovascular development is further supported by studies showing decreased protein levels in collateral arteries when treated with angiogenesis inhibitors, indicating its role in vascular development (Anasa2018Multifaceted). Despite these insights, the specific functions of ASB5 in healthy human cells remain not fully understood, necessitating further research to elucidate its complex interactions and potential implications in disease (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

## Clinical Significance
ASB5 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of cancer, ASB5 is associated with angiogenesis, a process crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. It is specifically linked to vascular development and has been observed to have decreased expression in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) tissues, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression (Anasa2018Multifaceted; Xie2023A). The hypermethylation of ASB5 is associated with a lower survival risk in esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Xie2023A).

In neurological conditions, ASB5 has been identified as part of a subnetwork associated with epilepsy. Novel copy number variations in ASB5 have been found in children with autism, suggesting a possible link between ASB5 and neurological disorders (Cui2017Exploring). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both cancer and neurological diseases, underscoring its clinical significance. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which ASB5 contributes to these conditions and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ASB5 is known to be expressed in skeletal tissues and is located at the plasma membrane, where it interacts with ASB1 (Anasa2018Multifaceted). While specific physical interactions of ASB5 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, it is part of the ASB protein family, which generally functions as E3 ubiquitin ligases. These proteins are involved in protein ubiquitination, a process marking proteins for degradation by the proteasome (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB proteins, including ASB5, contain ankyrin repeats and a SOCS box domain, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions and substrate recognition, respectively (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

ASB5 is implicated in regulating the size of skeletal muscle and brain components, although specific interactions in these processes are not detailed (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). It is also involved in the initiation of collateral artery growth via arteriogenesis, being localized in endothelial and smooth muscle cells of collateral arteries, as well as in satellite cells of myocytes (Anasa2018Multifaceted). Despite these roles, detailed interactions of ASB5 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
