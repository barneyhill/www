# ZNF20

## Overview
ZNF20 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 20, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its involvement in transcriptional regulation and genomic stability. The protein encoded by ZNF20 is known for its role in interacting with various cellular components, including factors involved in cell-cycle regulation and transcriptional repression, such as cyclins, associated kinases, and TRIM28 (Helleboid2019The; Chang2023AcetylationMimic). Additionally, ZNF20 is implicated in binding transposable elements, suggesting a role in maintaining genomic integrity (Helleboid2019The). The gene is located on chromosome 3p21, a region often associated with chromosomal rearrangements in cancer, highlighting its potential involvement in oncogenesis (Gonsky1997Identification). ZNF20's expression and regulation are influenced by microRNAs, such as miR-199, which further underscores its significance in posttranscriptional regulation and disease processes (SchnallLevin2011Unusually).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF20 has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In thyroid cancer, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma, ZNF20 is overexpressed and exhibits rapid mRNA turnover, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Gonsky1997Identification). The gene is located on chromosome 3p21, a region frequently rearranged in multiple malignancies, indicating its possible involvement in cancer development (Gonsky1997Identification).

ZNF20 is also a target of miR-199, a microRNA that can significantly repress its expression. This interaction highlights the gene's involvement in posttranscriptional regulation, which may contribute to its role in cancer (SchnallLevin2011Unusually). Additionally, ZNF20 has been identified as highly expressed in osteoarthritis samples, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for this condition (Li2018Identification).

The presence of AU-rich motifs in the 3′-UTR of ZNF20 mRNA, which are associated with rapid transcript degradation, further underscores its role in diseases characterized by dysregulated gene expression (Gonsky1997Identification). These findings suggest that ZNF20 may act as an oncogene in certain contexts, contributing to the progression of various cancers.

## Interactions
ZNF20, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes. The study by Helleboid et al. identified ZNF20 as interacting with factors involved in cell-cycle regulation, such as cyclins and associated kinases, indicating a potential role in cell-cycle processes (Helleboid2019The). Additionally, ZNF20 was found to be associated with wild-type TRIM28, a protein known for its role in gene expression regulation, particularly in the context of leukemic K562 cells (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). This interaction suggests that ZNF20 may participate in transcriptional regulation through its association with TRIM28.

The study also highlights ZNF20's interaction with transposable elements, specifically as a MER51A/E-binding KZFP, although the specific details of these interactions are not extensively detailed (Helleboid2019The). These interactions underscore ZNF20's involvement in genomic regulation and its potential role in maintaining genomic stability. The interactions of ZNF20 with various proteins and genomic elements suggest its multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in transcriptional regulation and cell-cycle control.
