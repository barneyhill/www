# HSFX1

## Overview
The HSFX1 gene encodes the heat shock transcription factor family, X-linked 1 protein, which is a member of the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the regulation of heat shock proteins, which play a crucial role in cellular protection against stress conditions. HSFX1 is located on the X chromosome and is known for its involvement in the cellular response to thermal and other stressors. The protein encoded by HSFX1 functions as a transcription factor, binding to specific DNA sequences to modulate the expression of target genes involved in stress response pathways. Its activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting cells from damage induced by environmental stressors (Qiu2020aarFDC).
