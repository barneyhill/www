# PPP1CB

## Overview
The PPP1CB gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit beta (PP1CB), a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. As a member of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) family, PP1CB is involved in the dephosphorylation of target proteins, thereby regulating their activity and influencing critical biological functions such as cell-cycle progression, muscle contraction, and glycogen metabolism (Ma2016De; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). The protein is characterized by its ability to form complexes with regulatory subunits, which modulate its activity and specificity, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). PP1CB's interactions with various proteins, including those involved in muscle function and signal transduction, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Kwon2022Structure–function). Mutations in the PPP1CB gene have been implicated in several congenital disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Velusamy2013Recurrent; Gripp2016A).

## Structure
The PPP1CB gene encodes the beta isoform of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine phosphatase. The primary structure of PPP1CB consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes highly conserved regions crucial for its function (Ma2016De). The secondary structure of PPP1CB includes nine alpha helices and 14 beta strands that form three beta sheets, contributing to the protein's catalytic core (Ma2016De). 

The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with regulatory subunits and other proteins. The quaternary structure of PPP1CB includes its assembly with regulatory subunits, such as the myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1), which modulates its activity and isoform specificity (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). 

PPP1CB undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and function (Nilsson2018Protein). The gene produces multiple mRNA isoforms due to alternative splicing, resulting in different splice variant isoforms that may affect its function and tissue-specific expression (Barker1994Three). These structural features and modifications are crucial for the diverse roles of PPP1CB in cellular processes.

## Function
The PPP1CB gene encodes the beta isoform of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. PPP1CB plays a crucial role in the dephosphorylation of proteins, thereby regulating their activity and influencing processes such as cell-cycle progression, muscle contraction, and glycogen metabolism (Ma2016De; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). 

In muscle tissues, PPP1CB is part of the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) complex, which is essential for controlling muscle contraction and the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). It is also involved in the regulation of calcium transients and cell shortening in cardiomyocytes, highlighting its role in cardiac function (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). 

PPP1CB is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell motility, cell cycle progression, and cellular homeostasis (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). It also plays a role in the MAPK pathway by forming a complex with SHOC2 and MRAS, which facilitates the dephosphorylation of RAF kinases, leading to the activation of this critical signaling pathway (Vaneynde2022The). These activities underscore the importance of PPP1CB in maintaining normal cellular signaling and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP1CB gene are associated with several congenital disorders, most notably a condition resembling Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS-LAH). This condition is characterized by developmental delays, distinctive facial features, macrocephaly, and hair anomalies such as slow-growing or sparse hair. Patients may also exhibit structural brain abnormalities, feeding difficulties, and cardiac defects (Gripp2016A). Specific mutations, such as c.146G>C (p.Pro49Arg) and c.166G>C (p.Ala56Pro), have been identified in individuals with these phenotypes (Gripp2016A).

PPP1CB mutations are also linked to intellectual disability and congenital heart disease. De novo missense variants in the gene have been found in individuals with overlapping phenotypes, including dysmorphic features, macrocephaly, and skeletal abnormalities (Ma2016De). These variants often occur in highly conserved regions of the gene, indicating their potential significance in disease pathogenesis (Ma2016De).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), alterations in PPP1CB expression, such as the YPEL5/PPP1CB fusion, result in a truncated protein with reduced phosphatase activity. This alteration is associated with increased cell proliferation and oncogenic behavior, suggesting a role in CLL pathogenesis (Velusamy2013Recurrent).

## Interactions
PPP1CB, or protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit beta, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and specificity. It interacts with the myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1/PPP1R12A), which modulates its activity and isoform specificity through weak interactions involving the RVxF motif, a common PPP1C-binding motif (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). PPP1CB is also associated with regulatory subunits involved in muscle function, such as PPP1R12A and PPP1R12B, which play roles in muscle contraction and glycogen metabolism (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

In the context of viral infections, PPP1CB interacts with the E2 glycoprotein of the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV). This interaction was confirmed using yeast two-hybrid systems and co-immunoprecipitation in infected cells. Despite this interaction, reducing PPP1CB levels did not significantly affect CSFV replication, suggesting a complex role in viral processes (Vuono2019Interaction).

PPP1CB is also part of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C holophosphatase complex, where it interacts with SHOC2 and MRAS. This complex is involved in dephosphorylating RAF, a process crucial for RAF's activation (Kwon2022Structure–function). These interactions highlight PPP1CB's role in diverse cellular processes, including muscle function, viral interactions, and signal transduction.
