# PARP1

## Overview
PARP1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional enzyme involved in various cellular processes, primarily DNA repair and transcription regulation. The protein encoded by PARP1 is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family and plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the repair of DNA strand breaks through pathways such as base excision repair (BER), nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), and homologous recombination (HR) (Ko2012Functional). Structurally, PARP1 comprises several domains, including a DNA-binding domain with zinc finger motifs, a catalytic domain responsible for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, and an automodification domain that mediates protein-protein interactions (Eustermann2011The; Langelier2008A). Beyond DNA repair, PARP1 influences chromatin structure and gene expression, acting as a transcriptional regulator by interacting with various transcription factors (Ko2012Functional). The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, which are crucial for its function in response to cellular stress and DNA damage (Luo2012On). Given its pivotal role in DNA repair and transcription, PARP1 is a significant target in cancer therapy, particularly in tumors with defects in homologous recombination repair pathways (Pettitt2018Genomewide).

## Structure
PARP1 is a multifunctional enzyme with a modular structure comprising several distinct domains. The protein includes a DNA-binding domain at the N-terminus, which contains two zinc finger motifs, ZnF1 and ZnF2, crucial for recognizing DNA strand breaks. These zinc fingers are characterized by a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and two helices, with specific zinc-binding residues coordinating the zinc ion (Eustermann2011The; Ali2012The). The ZnF1 and ZnF2 domains can form intermolecular complexes, allowing PARP1 to dimerize at DNA damage sites, which is essential for its activation (Ali2012The).

A third zinc-binding domain, spanning residues 216-366, is critical for DNA-dependent activation and mediates interdomain contacts necessary for enzyme activation. This domain features a zinc ribbon fold and forms a homodimer, providing a scaffold for assembling the activated state of PARP1 (Langelier2008A).

The catalytic domain at the C-terminus is responsible for the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity of PARP1, which is crucial for its role in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling (Langelier2008A). The automodification domain, containing a BRCT fold, facilitates protein-protein interactions and is involved in the enzyme's post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which modulate its activity (Langelier2008A).

## Function
PARP1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) is a key enzyme involved in DNA repair and transcription regulation in healthy human cells. It plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA strand breaks, particularly through the base excision repair (BER) pathway, by recognizing single-strand DNA breaks and facilitating their repair (Ko2012Functional). PARP1 is also involved in the repair of double-strand breaks through both nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways, where it helps recruit the MRN complex and interacts with the Ku heterodimer and DNA-PK (Ko2012Functional).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, PARP1 regulates transcription by modulating chromatin structure and gene expression. It modifies histones through ADP-ribosylation, enhancing the accessibility of protein complexes during DNA repair and transcription (Ko2012Functional). PARP1 acts as a transcriptional regulator by binding to specific DNA motifs and interacting with various transcription factors, influencing the expression of genes involved in immune response, viral response, and DNA repair (Ko2012Functional).

PARP1's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which modulate its function in response to cellular stress and DNA damage (Luo2012On). It is primarily active in the cell nucleus, where it maintains genomic stability and regulates transcriptional responses to stress (Luo2012On).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PARP1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. PARP1 mutations can lead to resistance against PARP inhibitors (PARPi), which are used in treating cancers with homologous recombination defects, such as those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Specific mutations in PARP1, such as p.119delKS and p.848delY/YK, confer resistance to PARPi like talazoparib by altering PARP1 function, including changes in PARylation activity and PARP1 trapping at DNA damage sites (Pettitt2018Genomewide). These mutations can affect the DNA-binding and catalytic domains of PARP1, leading to reduced cytotoxicity of PARPi (Pettitt2018Genomewide).

PARP1 alterations are also associated with immune response and cancer prognosis. High PARP1 expression correlates with increased tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for immunotherapy effectiveness (Zhang2021PanCancer). In colorectal cancer, PARP1 expression influences cancer stem cell phenotype, particularly in tumors with wild-type p53, indicating its role in tumor differentiation and survival (PuentesPardo2023PARP1). These findings underscore the importance of understanding PARP1 mutations and expression levels in developing personalized cancer therapies.

## Interactions
PARP1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) is involved in numerous protein interactions that play critical roles in cellular processes such as DNA repair, transcription regulation, and cell cycle control. PARP1 interacts with E2F-1, acting as a coactivator of E2F-1-mediated transcription during the re-entry of quiescent cells into the S phase. This interaction enhances E2F-1 promoter activity and the expression of E2F-1-responsive genes, such as cyclin A and c-Myc, and occurs independently of PARP1's DNA-binding and catalytic domains (SimbulanRosenthal2003PARP1).

PARP1 also forms complexes with nucleosomes, where it can be trapped by PARP1 inhibitors like olaparib, talazoparib, and veliparib. These inhibitors affect the dissociation of PARP1 from nucleosomes, influencing DNA repair processes (Maluchenko2022Interactions). Additionally, PARP1 interacts with various proteins involved in apoptosis, such as heat shock proteins GRP78, HSC70, HSP90AB1, and HSP70, which regulate apoptotic pathways (Isabelle2010Investigation).

PARP1's interactions extend to the APC/C complex, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation, and it is known to bind proteins through its poly(ADP-ribose) moiety, contributing to its involvement in DNA damage response and RNA metabolism (Isabelle2010Investigation).
