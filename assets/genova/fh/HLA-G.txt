# HLA-G

## Overview
HLA-G is a gene that encodes the major histocompatibility complex, class I, G protein, a non-classical MHC class I molecule with significant roles in immune modulation. The HLA-G protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is known for its involvement in immune tolerance, particularly at the maternal-fetal interface, where it helps protect the fetus from maternal immune responses. It achieves this by interacting with inhibitory receptors on immune cells, such as ILT2 and ILT4, to suppress their activity. The protein exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with its expression primarily restricted to specific tissues, including the placenta, thymus, and cornea, in healthy adults. HLA-G's unique structure, characterized by several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, allows it to form dimers and potentially multimers, enhancing its binding affinity to inhibitory receptors. This specialized function underscores its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing inappropriate immune responses (RouasFreiss1999The; Carosella2015HLAG).

## Structure
HLA-G is a non-classical HLA class I molecule with a complex structure characterized by several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. The primary structure of HLA-G includes a heavy chain with three globular domains (α1, α2, α3) and a shortened cytoplasmic domain due to a premature stop codon in exon 6, which affects endocytosis signals (HoWangYin2012Multimeric; Carosella2015HLAG). The secondary structure involves glycosylation at Asn86 in the α1 domain, common to all isoforms, and potential nitration of tyrosine residues at sites of inflammation (Carosella2015HLAG).

The tertiary structure of the HLA-G1 isoform resembles classical HLA class I molecules but features a unique peptide-binding groove similar to HLA-E and a more hydrophobic α3 domain, contributing to its higher affinity for ILT2 and ILT4 receptors (Carosella2015HLAG). The quaternary structure includes the ability to form dimers through disulfide bonds between Cys42 and Cys147, which are crucial for its functions (Carosella2015HLAG). HLA-G can exist as monomers, dimers, and possibly multimers, and is found in biological fluids and exosomes (Carosella2015HLAG). The isoforms HLA-G1 and HLA-G5 can form dimers more readily than others, enhancing their binding to inhibitory receptors (HoWangYin2012Multimeric).

## Function
HLA-G is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule that plays a pivotal role in immune tolerance, particularly at the maternal-fetal interface. It is expressed in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with its expression primarily found in placental tissues such as trophoblast cells, which are crucial for protecting the fetus from maternal immune responses (RouasFreiss1999The; Hunt2006The). HLA-G achieves immune tolerance by inhibiting the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. It interacts with inhibitory receptors on these immune cells, such as ILT2 and ILT4, to suppress their cytolytic functions and proliferation (Alegre2014Some; Carosella2015HLAG).

In addition to its role in pregnancy, HLA-G is involved in modulating cytokine production, influencing the release of interleukin-3 and interleukin-1, while reducing tumor necrosis factor levels, thereby contributing to an immunosuppressive environment (RouasFreiss1999The). The expression of HLA-G is tightly regulated and is limited to specific tissues, including the thymus and cornea, in healthy adults (Alegre2014Some; Carosella2015HLAG). This restricted expression pattern underscores its specialized function in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing inappropriate immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
The HLA-G gene plays a significant role in various diseases due to its immune modulatory properties. In cancer, increased expression of HLA-G is associated with advanced disease stages, shorter survival times, and immune evasion, contributing to tumor progression in several types, including breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer (Donadi2010Implications; Dias2015The). In viral infections, HLA-G is involved in immune evasion mechanisms, with elevated levels observed in HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, potentially aiding in immune escape and influencing disease outcomes (JasinskiBergner2022Role). 

In autoimmune disorders, HLA-G expression is linked to disease modulation. For instance, in systemic sclerosis, its expression correlates with fewer vascular lesions, while in multiple sclerosis, higher soluble HLA-G levels are inversely related to disease activity (Donadi2010Implications). Polymorphisms in the HLA-G gene, such as the 14-bp insertion/deletion, are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, influencing disease pathogenesis and clinical outcomes (Glas2007The). 

HLA-G also plays a role in transplantation, where its expression is linked to graft acceptance and survival, with specific polymorphisms affecting rejection rates (Donadi2010Implications). These findings highlight the complex role of HLA-G in disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
HLA-G interacts with several immune receptors, playing a crucial role in immune modulation. It binds to Ig-like transcript 2 (ILT2) and Ig-like transcript 4 (ILT4), which are expressed on various immune cells, including monocytes, dendritic cells, B cells, and subsets of natural killer (NK) and T cells. These receptors contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that inhibit cellular responses by recruiting phosphatases like SHP-1. ILT2 and ILT4 have a higher affinity for HLA-G dimers than monomers, with ILT2 recognizing dimers of β2-microglobulin (β2M)-associated HLA-G molecules and ILT4 recognizing dimers of β2M-free HLA-G1 and HLA-G5 (Attia2020The; Carosella2015HLAG).

HLA-G also interacts with the Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DL4 (KIR2DL4), which binds to unique α1-domain residues of HLA-G. KIR2DL4 is typically intracellular in unstimulated NK cells but can be upregulated on the surface of activated NK cells, allowing potential binding to membrane-bound HLA-G isoforms in monomeric form (Attia2020The).

Additionally, HLA-G can bind to CD8 without TCR interaction, leading to apoptosis of NK cells and activated CD8+ T cells. It also interacts with CD160, where it induces apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis (Alegre2014Some).
