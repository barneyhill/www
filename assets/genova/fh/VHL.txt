# VHL

## Overview
The VHL gene encodes the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), a crucial component of the cellular machinery that regulates protein degradation and cellular responses to oxygen levels. As part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, pVHL targets hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) for degradation, thereby modulating the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and cellular metabolism under normoxic conditions (Kaelin2002Molecular; Gossage2014VHL). The VHL protein is characterized by its structural domains, which facilitate interactions with various proteins, including ElonginC and ElonginB, forming a complex essential for its tumor suppressor function (Stebbins1999Structure). Mutations in the VHL gene are linked to von Hippel-Lindau disease, an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes individuals to a range of tumors and cysts, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Kaelin2002Molecular; Haddad2013Von).

## Structure
The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein is a tumor suppressor with a complex molecular structure that includes distinct domains crucial for its function. The VHL protein consists of two main domains: a beta (β) domain and an alpha (α) domain. The β domain is characterized by a seven-stranded β sandwich structure, which is important for binding hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) (Stebbins1999Structure; Min2002Structure). The α domain comprises three α helices, forming a structure similar to a four-helix cluster, with a helix from ElonginC completing the arrangement (Stebbins1999Structure).

The VHL protein forms a ternary complex with ElonginC and ElonginB, known as the VCB complex, which is essential for its tumor suppressor function. This complex is structurally similar to the SCF complex, indicating a role in protein degradation pathways (Stebbins1999Structure). The interaction with ElonginC is primarily hydrophobic, involving significant van der Waals contacts and a few hydrogen bonds (Stebbins1999Structure).

Post-translational modifications of VHL include neddylation at the K159 site, which is crucial for fibronectin binding and affects interactions with Cul2 (Leonardi2009Adding). The VHL protein is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for degradation via the 26S proteasome (Leonardi2009Adding; Forman2009Structural).

## Function
The VHL gene encodes the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), which plays a critical role in regulating hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in healthy human cells. Under normal oxygen conditions, pVHL targets the α-subunits of HIFs for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, preventing the activation of hypoxia-response genes that promote angiogenesis and other processes related to low oxygen levels (Kaelin2002Molecular; Gossage2014VHL). This regulation is achieved through the hydroxylation of specific proline residues within the HIF α-subunits, facilitating the binding of pVHL to these subunits (Kaelin2002Molecular).

pVHL is part of a complex with elongin C, elongin B, cullin 2, and RBX1, forming an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is crucial for the degradation of HIFs (Gossage2014VHL). Beyond its role in HIF regulation, pVHL is involved in the assembly and regulation of the extracellular matrix, microtubule stabilization, and modulation of apoptosis through interactions with proteins like p53 and NF-κB (Gossage2014VHL). It also plays a role in regulating erythropoiesis by controlling erythropoietin levels (Gossage2014VHL). The proper functioning of pVHL is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Kaelin2002Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VHL gene are responsible for von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of various tumors and cysts in multiple organ systems. These include hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and retina, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Kaelin2002Molecular; Haddad2013Von; Richards2001Molecular). VHL disease is classified into different types based on the presence of pheochromocytomas and the risk of renal cell carcinoma, with specific mutations correlating with different phenotypic expressions (Lin2020Clinical; Maher1996Phenotypic).

The VHL protein is part of a complex that targets hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) for degradation. Loss of VHL function leads to the stabilization of HIF and the overexpression of growth factors like VEGF, contributing to the hypervascular nature of VHL-associated tumors (Shuin2006Von; Richards2001Molecular). In addition to VHL disease, mutations in the VHL gene are implicated in sporadic cases of renal cell carcinoma and hemangioblastomas (NordstromO’Brien2010Genetic). The VHL gene's role in tumorigenesis is complex, involving both HIF-dependent and HIF-independent pathways (Haddad2013Von).

## Interactions
The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that are essential for its function in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. VHL forms a complex with ElonginC and ElonginB, which is crucial for its tumor suppressor activity. The VHL protein consists of two domains: the alpha (α) domain and the beta (β) domain. The α domain interacts with ElonginC through a hydrophobic interface, stabilized by hydrophobic side chains and hydrogen bonds. ElonginB, which has a ubiquitin-like structure, interacts with ElonginC through a less hydrophobic interface centered on parallel β strands (Stebbins1999Structure).

VHL also interacts with the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunit, targeting it for degradation under normoxic conditions. This interaction is mediated by the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which specifically targets HIF-1α for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Galdeano2014StructureGuided). Additionally, VHL interacts with deubiquitinating enzyme 2 (VDU2), which leads to the deubiquitination and stabilization of HIF-1α, thereby regulating its activity and the expression of target genes (Li2005VHL).

In the human testis, VHL interacts with a variety of proteins involved in metabolic pathways, microtubule stabilization, and cell cycle regulation. These interactions are part of a complex network that includes known partners such as Elongin-C and novel interactors identified through high-throughput screening (Falconieri2022Characterization).
