# XAGE2

## Overview
XAGE2 is a gene that encodes the protein X antigen family member 2, which is categorized as an atypical E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. This protein is involved in the ubiquitination process, a critical pathway for protein degradation and cellular protein homeostasis. XAGE2 functions by associating with the cullin-5-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the initial ubiquitin attachment to target proteins, which is essential for subsequent ubiquitin chain elongation and protein degradation. The gene is notably expressed in the testis and placenta, suggesting roles in myelopoiesis and trophoblast differentiation, respectively. These expression patterns and functional roles highlight its potential significance in reproductive biology and cellular regulation (Tsuchida2020Transcriptomic; Chen2020Exploring).

## Function
XAGE2, also known as X antigen family member 2, functions as an atypical E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. It operates in conjunction with the cullin-5-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, also known as the ECS complex or CRL5 complex. XAGE2 initiates the ubiquitination of ECS substrates by associating with the ECS complex and specifically mediating the addition of the first ubiquitin on ECS targets. This initial ubiquitin is then elongated, suggesting a role in protein degradation pathways crucial for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of XAGE2 is activated upon binding to the neddylated form of the ECS complex, indicating its involvement in the regulation of protein turnover (Chen2020Exploring).

XAGE2 is highly expressed in normal testis and may play a role in myelopoiesis, the process of forming myeloid cells, which are a type of blood cell. Its involvement in ubiquitination suggests activity in the cytoplasm, where protein degradation processes typically occur (Chen2020Exploring). Additionally, XAGE2 is expressed in the placenta, specifically in trophoblast layers, indicating a potential role in trophoblast differentiation or function throughout pregnancy (Tsuchida2020Transcriptomic).
