# STAP1

## Overview
STAP1, or signal transducing adaptor family member 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly within immune cells. The STAP1 protein functions as a docking protein, facilitating interactions between various signaling molecules through its pleckstrin homology (PH) and Src homology 2 (SH2)-like domains. It is primarily expressed in lymphocytes and plays a significant role in B-cell receptor signaling. Although initially considered a candidate gene for familial hypercholesterolemia, research has not supported a causal role for STAP1 in cholesterol metabolism, indicating its primary function is related to immune signaling rather than lipid regulation (Hegele2020Delisting; Sekine2014Adaptor; Loaiza2020Taking). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it influences cellular communication and response mechanisms (Sekine2014Adaptor).

## Structure


## Function
The STAP1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a docking protein involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly within immune cells. It is primarily expressed in lymphocytes and plays a role in B-cell receptor signaling, interacting with various signaling molecules through its pleckstrin homology (PH) and Src homology 2 (SH2)-like domains (Sekine2014Adaptor). Despite its involvement in immune response regulation, STAP1 does not appear to significantly influence lipid metabolism or cholesterol levels in humans. Studies have shown that STAP1 variants do not lead to significant differences in plasma lipid profiles, liver enzymes, or immune cell populations, suggesting a limited role in these processes (Hegele2020Delisting; Loaiza2020Taking).

In terms of cellular localization, STAP1 is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it facilitates interactions between signaling molecules, influencing cellular communication and response mechanisms (Sekine2014Adaptor). Although initially considered a candidate gene for familial hypercholesterolemia, further research has not supported a causal role for STAP1 in cholesterol metabolism, indicating its function in healthy human cells is primarily related to immune signaling rather than lipid regulation (Hegele2020Delisting; Loaiza2020Taking).

## Clinical Significance
The STAP1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In gliomas, a type of brain tumor, STAP1 is identified as a prognostic factor associated with malignancy. Higher mRNA levels of STAP1 are found in more aggressive gliomas, and its expression correlates with poorer patient outcomes. STAP1 promotes microglial M2-like polarization, which is linked to tumor progression and immune evasion (Yang2023Signaltransducing).

In the context of liver diseases, STAP1 methylation levels have been studied for their diagnostic and prognostic value in HBV-related conditions. While not highly specific for chronic hepatitis B, STAP1 methylation may predict decompensated liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, with higher methylation levels associated with poorer overall survival (Sun2023Diagnostic).

STAP1 has also been investigated in relation to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels. Initial studies suggested a link between STAP1 mutations and FH, but subsequent research has not consistently supported this association. Variants in STAP1 do not show a clear correlation with FH, and its role in lipid metabolism remains uncertain (Hegele2020Delisting; Danyel2019Evaluation; LamiquizMoneo2020Predicted).

## Interactions
STAP1 (signal transducing adaptor family member 1) is involved in several critical protein interactions, particularly in the context of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). STAP1 interacts with the BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein and STAT5a, playing a significant role in the maintenance and survival of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in CML. The SH2 domain of STAP1 binds to BCR-ABL, while the PH domain interacts with STAT5a, suggesting that STAP1 acts as a scaffold protein facilitating the formation of a complex between BCR-ABL and STAT5a (Toda2020Signaltransducing; Ishiura2021Positive). This interaction enhances STAT5 signaling, which is crucial for the proliferation and survival of CML cells (Toda2020Signaltransducing).

STAP1 also influences the phosphorylation status of STAT5, affecting the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as BCL-2 and BCL-xL, thereby suppressing apoptosis in CML LSCs (Toda2020Signaltransducing; Ishiura2021Positive). Additionally, STAP1 is implicated in the JAK/STAT and PPAR signaling pathways, further highlighting its role in regulating intracellular signaling cascades (Toda2020Signaltransducing). These interactions make STAP1 a potential therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in CML treatment (Toda2020Signaltransducing).
