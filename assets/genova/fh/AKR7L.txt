# AKR7L

## Overview
AKR7L is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, specifically categorized as an aldo-keto reductase family 7-like protein. This family of proteins is involved in the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols, playing a crucial role in detoxification processes and the metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous compounds. The AKR7L gene has been implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including its role as a prognostic marker in oral squamous cell carcinoma and its differential expression in type 2 diabetes, highlighting its potential significance in disease progression and metabolic regulation (Kuk2022Prognostic; Wigger2021Multiomics). Additionally, AKR7L is involved in gene fusion events, which may influence its function and contribute to its diverse biological roles (Conrad2009Origins).

## Clinical Significance
AKR7L has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Mutations in AKR7L are associated with a poorer prognosis, particularly in stages 2 and 3 of OSCC, where its mutation rate is notably high at 88.9%. Patients with the mutant-type AKR7L have a 4.48 times worse prognosis compared to those with the wild-type gene, indicating its clinical significance in OSCC progression (Kuk2022Prognostic).

In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), AKR7L is differentially expressed in pancreatic islets. It is upregulated in T2D islets compared to non-diabetic islets, although it shows a moderate negative correlation with the duration of T2D, suggesting its expression decreases as the disease progresses (Wigger2021Multiomics). Additionally, AKR7L is downregulated at the protein level in islets of both impaired glucose tolerance and T2D subjects, indicating a potential role in the metabolic alterations observed in T2D (Wigger2021Multiomics).

AKR7L is also involved in gene fusion events, such as the AKR7L-AKR7A3 fusion, which may impact gene function, although the specific clinical implications of this fusion are not fully detailed (Conrad2009Origins).
