# FAM72B

## Overview
FAM72B is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 72, specifically member B. This protein is involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the cell cycle and mitotic events. FAM72B is highly expressed in proliferating neural stem cells, underscoring its role in brain development and cognitive functions. The protein encoded by FAM72B is implicated in the formation of mitotic structures such as the spindle and kinetochore-centromere complexes, which are essential for accurate cell division. Additionally, FAM72B is regulated by cell cycle-related complexes, including DREAM and MMB-FOXM1, and interacts with transcription factors like E2F and the RB family, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular proliferation and genomic stability (Ho2021FAM72; Kisselev2024Evolutionary).

## Function
FAM72B is a gene that plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G2/M phase, where it is involved in promoting cell proliferation. This gene is highly expressed in proliferating neural stem cells (NSCs) and is crucial for their renewal and proliferation, indicating its importance in brain development and cognitive functions (Ho2021FAM72). FAM72B is also implicated in the regulation of mitotic processes, potentially participating in the formation of mitotic spindle or kinetochore-centromere complexes, which are essential for proper cell division (Ho2021FAM72).

The expression of FAM72B is regulated by complexes such as DREAM and MMB-FOXM1, which are involved in cell cycle progression and quiescence (Ho2021FAM72). These regulatory mechanisms suggest that FAM72B is tightly linked to cell cycle control, interacting with key transcription factors like E2F and the RB family (Ho2021FAM72). Although specific functions of FAM72B in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed, its involvement in cell cycle regulation and potential roles in mitotic processes highlight its importance in maintaining cellular proliferation and genomic stability (Kisselev2024Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
FAM72B is significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Its expression is linked to adverse pathological and TNM stages, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker for LUAD. High FAM72B expression is an independent prognostic factor for poor OS in LUAD patients, as confirmed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses (Li2022Identifying).

The gene's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration in the LUAD tumor microenvironment, affecting various immune cells such as B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. FAM72B expression is negatively associated with these immune cells but positively associated with tumor purity (Li2022Identifying).

Functional assays have demonstrated that FAM72B knockdown in LUAD cell lines leads to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer progression. These findings suggest that FAM72B may serve as a potential biomarker for LUAD diagnosis and a target for therapeutic intervention (Li2022Identifying).
