# KLHL8

## Overview
KLHL8 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 8, which is part of the Kelch-like family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their role as substrate adaptors in Cullin3-RING ligase (CRL3) complexes, which are essential for the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins, thereby maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Shi2019Kelchlike; Xiang2021Targeting). The KLHL8 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including cancer progression and cellular stress responses, through its potential interactions with pathways such as the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway (Shilovsky2023Regulation; Xiang2021Targeting). Additionally, KLHL8 is involved in clinical contexts, notably through its expression as a circular RNA, circKLHL8, which has been associated with favorable outcomes in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia and enhanced diabetic wound healing (Papaioannou2020Clinical; Shang2021CircKlhl8). Despite its emerging significance, the precise molecular mechanisms and interactions of KLHL8 remain an active area of research.

## Clinical Significance
KLHL8 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly through its expression as a circular RNA, circKLHL8. In cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML), high expression of circKLHL8 is associated with better clinical outcomes, including longer disease-free survival, overall survival, and event-free survival. This suggests a protective role in CN-AML, potentially due to its involvement in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and immune response pathways (Papaioannou2020Clinical).

In the context of diabetic wound healing, circKLHL8 has been shown to enhance the therapeutic effects of endothelial progenitor cells by modulating the miR-212-3p/SIRT5 axis. This interaction promotes autophagy and angiogenesis, which are crucial for wound healing, indicating a potential therapeutic role for circKLHL8 in diabetes-related complications (Shang2021CircKlhl8).

KLHL8 has also been identified as a gene disrupted by structural variations in BRCA1/2-mutated tumors, suggesting a possible role in the evolution of these cancers (Lal2019Comprehensive). However, specific diseases directly resulting from KLHL8 mutations or expression alterations remain under investigation.

## Interactions
KLHL8 is a member of the Kelch-like family of proteins, which are known to function as substrate adaptors in Cullin3-RING ligase (CRL3) complexes. These complexes are involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, a process crucial for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular functions (Shi2019Kelchlike; Xiang2021Targeting). While specific protein interactions involving KLHL8 are not extensively detailed, it is suggested that KLHL8, like other KLHL proteins, may participate in interactions with Cullin3 as part of the ubiquitin ligase complex (Cheng2018Functional).

KLHL8 has been implicated in cancer progression, with studies indicating its up-regulation in certain cancers such as colon and lung cancer. This suggests a potential role in promoting cancer cell proliferation, although the exact molecular interactions remain to be fully elucidated (Xiang2021Targeting). Additionally, KLHL8 may interact with the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, as suggested by the presence of KRR motifs, which could potentially compete with Keap1 for binding to Nrf2, although the evolutionary significance of these interactions is still under investigation (Shilovsky2023Regulation).
