# SKIC8

## Overview
The SKIC8 gene encodes the SKI8 subunit of the superkiller (SKI) complex, a critical component in RNA surveillance and degradation pathways. The SKI8 protein is integral to the cytoplasmic exosome's function, facilitating the 3'-to-5' degradation of mRNA, which is essential for maintaining RNA homeostasis and regulating gene expression. This process is analogous to the proteasome's role in protein degradation, underscoring the importance of SKI8 in cellular RNA balance. The SKIC8 gene's involvement in RNA degradation pathways has implications for immune response and cancer biology, particularly in conditions like triple-negative breast cancer, where its expression is altered (Lenárt2024Peripheral; Moreno2022Loss). Despite its recognized role in RNA processing, further research is necessary to fully understand the gene's broader clinical significance and potential involvement in other diseases (Moreno2022Loss).

## Function
SKIC8 is a component of the superkiller (SKI) complex, which plays a crucial role in RNA surveillance and degradation processes. This complex is involved in the exosome-mediated 3'-to-5' degradation of mRNA, ensuring proper RNA processing and turnover. SKIC8, along with other components of the SKI complex, contributes to maintaining cellular RNA homeostasis, impacting gene expression regulation and cellular function (Moreno2022Loss).

The SKI complex, including SKIC8, is active in the cytoplasm where it associates with the cytoplasmic exosome to degrade RNA molecules. This process is similar to the proteasome's role in protein degradation, highlighting the importance of SKIC8 in maintaining the balance of RNA within the cell (Moreno2022Loss). The RNA degradation pathway, in which SKIC8 is involved, is downregulated in various conditions, such as in CD8+ T lymphocytes from patients with breast cancer, indicating its role in immune response and possibly in cancer biology (Lenárt2024Peripheral).

Although the specific function of SKIC8 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in the SKI complex suggests a significant role in RNA degradation and cellular homeostasis (Moreno2022Loss).

## Clinical Significance
The SKIC8 gene, a component of the superkiller complex, plays a role in RNA degradation pathways. Alterations in SKIC8 expression or function have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SKIC8 is identified as a core enrichment protein contributing to the downregulated RNA degradation pathway. This suggests that SKIC8, along with other proteins, may influence the immune response in TNBC by affecting RNA stability and degradation processes (Lenárt2024Peripheral).

While the clinical significance of SKIC8 in cancer is highlighted, there is limited information on its role in other diseases. The SKI complex, which includes SKIC8, is involved in RNA degradation, similar to the proteasome's role in protein degradation. Disruptions in this complex can potentially lead to pathological conditions, although specific diseases directly linked to SKIC8 mutations or dysregulation are not extensively documented in the provided context (Moreno2022Loss).

Overall, the involvement of SKIC8 in RNA degradation pathways suggests its potential impact on cellular processes and disease development, particularly in cancer, but further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance.
