# MED8

## Overview
MED8 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 8, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The MED8 protein is categorized as part of the head module of the Mediator complex, where it plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex. It interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and forms a subcomplex with Med18 and Med20, which is essential for maintaining a stable scaffold at gene promoters, facilitating efficient transcription initiation (Adler2009Med8; Larivière2006Structure). MED8 is vital for cell viability and growth, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma, where it serves as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Wu2021High; Jin2022A).

## Structure
The MED8 protein is a component of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation. Structurally, MED8 is a multidomain protein with a well-conserved N-terminal helical domain, known as Med8N, which is essential for cell viability and binds the TATA-binding protein (TBP) (Larivière2006Structure). This domain is independently folded and can be purified in a soluble form (Larivière2006Structure). The C-terminal region of MED8, comprising residues 190-223, is sufficient for interaction with Med18, forming an α-helix that binds across the top of the Med18 β-barrel through extensive hydrophobic contacts (Larivière2006Structure).

The secondary structure of MED8 includes a significant amount of α-helix, estimated to be about 40%, with additional β-sheet content (Adler2009Med8). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to facilitate interactions within the Mediator complex. In terms of quaternary structure, MED8 forms part of the Med8/18/20 trimeric complex, where it interacts with Med18 and Med20, contributing to the stability and function of the Mediator head module (Larivière2006Structure). The Med8/18/20 complex is essential for stable transcription initiation complex formation (Larivière2006Structure).

## Function
MED8 is a critical component of the Mediator complex, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Within the Mediator complex, MED8 is part of the head module, which is essential for the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex. MED8 interacts specifically with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a key factor in transcription initiation, facilitating the assembly of the transcription machinery at gene promoters (Larivière2006Structure).

The MED8 protein, along with Med18 and Med20, forms a subcomplex that is crucial for maintaining a stable scaffold at the promoter, allowing for multiple rounds of transcription. This subcomplex is involved in the interaction with TBP, which is essential for the initiation-complex assembly (Larivière2006Structure). The N-terminal domain of MED8 is highly conserved and necessary for its function, as it binds TBP in vitro, underscoring its importance in transcription regulation (Napoli2012Unraveling).

MED8 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression by modulating transcriptional responses. Its role is vital for cell viability and growth, as it ensures efficient basal transcription and the proper functioning of the transcription machinery (Adler2009Med8; Larivière2006Structure).

## Clinical Significance
MED8 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its expression is significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues. High MED8 expression is associated with poor overall survival and advanced histological grades in HCC patients, making it a potential prognostic biomarker (Wu2021High; Jin2022A). The gene's overexpression correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics, such as advanced T stage, pathologic stage, and histologic grade, and is linked to the TP53 status, which is crucial in cancer development (Wu2021High).

Research suggests that MED8 influences immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, particularly affecting Th2 cells, which are associated with more aggressive HCC phenotypes (Wu2021High). This immune modulation may contribute to HCC metastasis and invasion. Additionally, MED8-related pathways are involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor progression, highlighting its role in cancer biology (Jin2022A).

The potential of MED8 as a therapeutic target is underscored by studies showing that knocking down MED8 in cell lines restricts cell proliferation and migration, suggesting that targeting MED8 could be beneficial in HCC treatment (Jin2022A).

## Interactions
MED8 is a component of the Mediator complex, specifically part of the head module, and plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. MED8 forms a subcomplex with MED18 and MED20, which is essential for the initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription. This subcomplex is divided into two submodules: the N-terminal domain of MED8, which binds the TATA-binding protein (TBP), and a second submodule consisting of the C-terminal region of MED8, MED18, and MED20 (Larivière2006Structure).

The N-terminal domain of MED8 (Med8N) is essential for cell viability and specifically interacts with TBP, forming a robust TBP-binding submodule. This interaction is crucial for transcription initiation, as demonstrated by pull-down assays using recombinant proteins (Larivière2006Structure). The C-terminal region of MED8 interacts with MED18, forming a stable trimeric complex with MED20, which is necessary for proper folding and complex formation (Adler2009Med8; Larivière2006Structure).

MED8, MED18, and MED20 are interdependent for folding and complex formation, requiring the presence of all three proteins during the folding process to form a stable trimer (Adler2009Med8). This interdependence suggests that MED8 is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the Mediator head module.
