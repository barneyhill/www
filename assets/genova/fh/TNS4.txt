# TNS4

## Overview
TNS4, or tensin 4, is a gene that encodes the protein tensin 4, also known as C-terminal tensin-like (CTEN). This protein is a member of the tensin family, which is involved in cell adhesion and migration processes. Tensin 4 is characterized by its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which facilitate its role in cell signaling pathways by interacting with phosphorylated proteins and integrins. Unlike other tensins, tensin 4 lacks an N-terminal actin-binding domain, which confers unique functional properties, particularly in the context of focal adhesions where it influences cell motility and tumorigenicity. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression, where tensin 4 has been implicated in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular dynamics (Monteiro2023Immunohistochemical; Alghamdi2018The; Park2022Tensin).

## Structure
Tensin 4 (TNS4), also known as C-terminal tensin-like (CTEN), is a protein characterized by its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. These domains are integral to its role in cell signaling pathways, with the SH2 domain binding phosphorylated proteins such as PI3K, FAK, and MET, while the PTB domain interacts with β-integrin at NPXY/F motifs, influencing cell adhesion and motility (Monteiro2023Immunohistochemical). TNS4 is a smaller protein within the tensin family, with a molecular weight of approximately 80 kDa (Monteiro2023Immunohistochemical).

The protein is involved in focal adhesions and interacts with actin filaments and β-integrins, which are crucial for mechanotransduction, although it lacks a direct actin-binding domain. It is thought to promote cell motility and tumorigenicity by displacing Tensin 3 from the β1 integrin cytoplasmic tail, leading to the disassembly of actin fibers (Boazak2021Smarce1). TNS4 is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its function. Additionally, splice variants of TNS4 can lead to different isoforms with distinct functions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
TNS4, also known as tensin 4 or CTEN, is a member of the tensin family of proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration. Unlike other tensins, TNS4 lacks an N-terminal actin-binding domain, which results in distinct functional roles. It is primarily localized to the cytoplasmic side of focal adhesions, where it interacts with integrins and other signaling molecules through its C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains (Monteiro2023Immunohistochemical; Alghamdi2018The).

In healthy human cells, TNS4 is involved in linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, facilitating signal transduction and cell motility. It plays a role in the assembly and disassembly of signaling complexes at focal adhesions, participating in pathways that regulate cell migration and adhesion (Alghamdi2018The). TNS4 also interacts with the MET receptor through its SH2 domain, influencing MET-dependent cell migration (Park2022Tensin).

TNS4's activity in the cytoplasm is crucial for processes such as wound healing, where it modulates cell motility by displacing other tensins from integrin tails, leading to actin fiber disassembly (Boazak2021Smarce1). This protein's unique structural features and interactions underscore its role in cellular dynamics and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TNS4 (tensin 4) gene have been implicated in various cancers, including gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and lung adenocarcinoma. In gastric cancer, high TNS4 expression is associated with poorer overall survival and is considered an independent prognostic factor. It is linked to increased tumor size and metastasis, potentially through its effects on cancer cell motility and interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Qi2020Tensin4; Unknownauthors2017ClinicalSignificanceofTensin4GeneExpressioninPatientswithGastricCancer).

In colorectal cancer, TNS4 is overexpressed and associated with advanced disease stages. It promotes aerobic glycolysis, migration, and invasion of cancer cells through the β-catenin/c-Myc signaling pathway (Wang2024Tensin). In HNSCC, TNS4 upregulation is linked to poor clinical outcomes and is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). It enhances tumorigenic processes by stabilizing the integrin α5β1 complex and activating the FAK/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways (Zhao2024Hypoxiadriven).

In lung adenocarcinoma, TNS4 acts as an oncogene, with its high expression correlating with poor prognosis. It stabilizes EGFR, enhancing oncogenic signaling and increasing cancer cell invasiveness (Misono2019Molecular). These findings suggest that TNS4 could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
Tensin 4 (TNS4), also known as C-terminal tensin-like (CTEN), is involved in various protein interactions that influence cell motility and signaling pathways. TNS4 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of β-integrin through its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, facilitating the linkage between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton (Alghamdi2018The). It also recruits tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules via its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which is crucial for signal transduction (Alghamdi2018The).

TNS4 has a unique interaction with the MET receptor, directly regulating MET-dependent cell migration through its SH2 domain (Park2022Tensin). In colorectal cancer, TNS4 interacts with β-catenin, enhancing the β-catenin/c-Myc signaling pathway, which is associated with increased cell migration and invasion (Wang2024Tensin).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, TNS4 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and its knockdown reduces EGFR protein expression, affecting downstream signaling pathways such as EFNA1/EPHA2 and VEGFA (Shi2020The). These interactions highlight TNS4's role in modulating key signaling pathways involved in cancer progression.
