# IL12A

## Overview
The IL12A gene encodes the p35 subunit of interleukin-12 (IL-12), a cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 1 (Th1) cells, which are crucial for cell-mediated immunity. The IL-12 cytokine is a heterodimer composed of the p35 subunit, encoded by IL12A, and the p40 subunit, encoded by IL12B. This cytokine is primarily produced by antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and is instrumental in activating natural killer (NK) cells and enhancing the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a key cytokine in the immune response against intracellular pathogens (Cole2020Interleukin; Ma2015Regulation). The p35 subunit is characterized by a four-helix bundle topology typical of long-chain class 1 cytokines, and it interacts with the p40 subunit to form the active IL-12 heterodimer (Yoon2000Charged). The IL12A gene and its encoded protein are significant in both immune regulation and disease pathogenesis, with polymorphisms in IL12A being linked to various cancers and immune disorders (Shen2017Association; Shi2017Singlenucleotide).

## Structure
The IL12A gene encodes the p35 subunit of interleukin-12, a cytokine involved in immune responses. The p35 subunit is characterized by a four-helix bundle topology, which is typical of long-chain class 1 cytokines. This structure includes long loops connecting the helices, some of which are partially disordered. A notable feature of the p35 subunit is a disulfide bond loop that interacts with the p40 subunit, contributing to the formation of the IL-12 heterodimer (Yoon2000Charged).

The p35 subunit's primary structure consists of a specific amino acid sequence, with key residues such as R189 playing a critical role in binding interactions. This residue fits into a deep pocket in the p40 subunit, which is essential for the stability and formation of the IL-12 complex (Yoon2000Charged). The tertiary structure of p35 involves its 3D folding, which allows it to associate with the p40 subunit, forming the active IL-12 heterodimer. The quaternary structure of IL-12 is thus a heterodimer composed of the p35 and p40 subunits (Yoon2000Charged).

Common post-translational modifications of the p35 subunit may include glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function. However, specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context.

## Function
The IL12A gene encodes the p35 subunit of interleukin-12 (IL-12), a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the immune system by promoting the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 1 (Th1) cells, which are essential for cell-mediated immunity. IL-12 is primarily produced by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. It functions by activating natural killer (NK) cells and enhancing the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a key cytokine in the immune response against intracellular pathogens (Ma2015Regulation).

In tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs), IL-12p35 is necessary for the production of IL-35, a cytokine with immunoregulatory properties. IL-35 is composed of IL-12p35 and Ebi3 subunits and is involved in suppressing T-cell proliferation, contributing to the tolerogenic potential of these cells (Dixon2015Human). The presence of IL-12p35 in tolDCs is crucial for their ability to inhibit T-cell activation and maintain immune tolerance, highlighting its role in balancing immune responses (Dixon2015Human).

IL-12p35 is also involved in the production of IL-17A and IL-17F by mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, in conjunction with IL-18, independently of IL-23 signaling, indicating its role in mucosal immunity (Cole2020Interleukin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL12A gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly in relation to cancer and immune system disorders. The IL-12A rs568408 polymorphism has been linked to an increased risk of several cancers, including cervical, esophageal, colorectal, liver, and osteosarcoma, especially in Asian populations (Shi2017Singlenucleotide; Chen2008Interactions). This polymorphism is also associated with chronic hepatitis B infection, where it may disrupt exonic splicing enhancers, potentially leading to unstable IL-12 mRNA and low IL-12 secretion (Ben2020Interaction).

In addition to cancer, the IL-12A rs568408 polymorphism is a genomic determinant for asthma risk, with the A allele linked to higher symptom severity in Taiwanese populations (Shen2017Association). The IL-12A rs568408 AA genotype is identified as a molecular risk biomarker for asthma susceptibility, suggesting its role in the initiation and progression of the disease (Shen2017Association).

While the IL-12A rs568408 polymorphism is associated with increased risk in several cancers, studies have shown no significant association with breast cancer risk, indicating that its impact may vary across different cancer types and populations (WANG2021Contribution).

## Interactions
IL12A encodes the p35 subunit of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which forms a heterodimer with the p40 subunit encoded by IL12B. This heterodimeric cytokine interacts with the IL-12 receptor complex, composed of IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2, on the surface of T and NK cells. The p35 subunit specifically interacts with IL-12Rβ2, and this interaction is crucial for the cytokine's function in promoting Th1 differentiation and IFN-γ production (Floss2020IL12; Esch2020Deciphering).

The interaction between IL-12A and IL-12Rβ2 involves specific amino acids, such as Tyr185 in murine IL-12A, which is a functional hotspot for binding. Mutations in these residues can disrupt the interaction, highlighting their importance in cytokine-receptor binding (Esch2020Deciphering; Bloch2023Structures). The IL-12A:IL-12Rβ2 interface is characterized by a less extensive interaction compared to IL-23, but it shares common structural features, such as an N-terminal hook-like structure in IL-12Rβ2 interacting with helix αD of IL-12A (Bloch2023Structures).

IL-12A does not directly interact with nucleic acids, focusing instead on protein-protein interactions within the cytokine-receptor complexes (Esch2020Deciphering).
