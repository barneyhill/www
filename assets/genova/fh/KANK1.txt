# KANK1

## Overview
KANK1 is a gene that encodes the protein KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 1, which is a member of the Kank family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its ankyrin-repeat domains and coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. KANK1 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell motility, adhesion, and differentiation by negatively regulating actin polymerization and influencing cytoskeleton dynamics. It also functions as a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, impacting β-catenin localization and transcriptional activity. KANK1's interactions with proteins involved in cellular adhesion and microtubule dynamics underscore its importance in maintaining cellular stability and migration. Clinically, KANK1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene and is associated with various cancers, neurodevelopmental disorders, and chronic inflammatory conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Mougeot2023Identification; Nguyen2022Kank1; Chen2018The).

## Structure
The KANK1 protein is part of the Kank family, which includes four paralogues: Kank1, Kank2, Kank3, and Kank4. It contains ankyrin-repeat domains at the C-terminus and coiled-coil motifs near the N-terminus, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Zhu2008Kank). The ankyrin-repeat domain is highly conserved across Kank proteins and consists of five repeats, with an additional non-canonical ankyrin repeat (Tadijan2021KANK). These repeats contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, facilitating interactions with other proteins.

The KANK1 protein also features a KN motif at the N-terminus, which includes leucine-rich and arginine-rich regions. This motif contains potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) motifs, suggesting a role in nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (Zhu2008Kank). KANK1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by Akt, which influences its interactions and functions, including the recruitment of 14-3-3 protein and inhibition of RhoA activation (Tadijan2021KANK).

Alternative splicing of the KANK1 gene results in two isoforms: Kank-L (long) and Kank-S (short), with Kank-L showing reduced expression in certain tumor tissues (Zhu2008Kank).

## Function
The KANK1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for various cellular functions such as cell motility, shape alterations, proliferation, and differentiation. KANK1 negatively regulates actin polymerization, leading to the disassembly of filamentous actin (F-actin) and controlling cytoskeleton formation (Nguyen2022Kank1). This regulation is important for cell adhesion dynamics and mechanotransduction processes. KANK1 is predominantly cytoplasmic but also functions as a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, influencing the localization of β-catenin to the nucleus and activating β-catenin-dependent transcription (Zhu2008Kank).

In the context of myogenic differentiation, KANK1 is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of muscle progenitor cells. Its expression is modulated during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, being upregulated during early differentiation and declining after myotube formation (Nguyen2022Kank1). KANK1 also plays a role in inhibiting cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle and promoting proapoptotic pathways (Nguyen2022Kank1). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KANK1 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. Initially identified as a tumor suppressor gene, KANK1 is implicated in several cancers, including gastric cancer, where its expression is notably downregulated. Upregulation of KANK1 in gastric cancer cells has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor suppression (Chen2017In). In neurodevelopmental disorders, small deletions involving KANK1 have been observed in individuals with conditions such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder. However, these deletions are considered likely benign copy number variants, as they appear with similar frequency in both affected and control populations, suggesting they do not significantly contribute to these disorders (Wallis2020Small).

KANK1 has also been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders through copy number variations in the DOCK8/KANK1 locus, indicating a potential shared genetic etiology across conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (Glessner2017Copy). Additionally, KANK1 is involved in chronic inflammatory conditions, such as coronary artery disease, and has been implicated in chronic graft-versus-host disease, where it may serve as a potential drug target (Mougeot2023Identification).

## Interactions
KANK1 interacts with several proteins involved in cellular adhesion and microtubule dynamics. It contains a talin-binding KN motif at the N-terminal, which allows it to interact with talin, destabilizing the talin-actomyosin linkage and reducing force across integrins. This interaction forms short-lived slip bonds between integrins and ligands, crucial for cellular adhesion dynamics (Chen2018The). KANK1 also recruits cortical microtubule stabilization complexes (CMSCs) to focal adhesions, which include proteins like liprin-α, liprin-β, ELKS, and PHLDB. These complexes capture microtubules via interactions with the microtubule plus end protein CLASP, and are further clustered to focal adhesions by MACF1 and KANK1, which tethers CMSCs to talin (Chen2018The).

KANK1 interacts with DLC1, a RhoA GAP, and can suppress RhoA activity by interacting with RhoGDI, potentially regulating RhoA signaling (Chen2018The). It also recruits the kinesin-4 family member Kif21A to CMSCs, inhibiting microtubule plus end outgrowth (Chen2018The). These interactions highlight KANK1's role in coordinating integrin-mediated force transmission and microtubule targeting, essential for cell migration and stability.
