# RBM44

## Overview
RBM44, or RNA binding motif protein 44, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA processing and regulation, particularly within the context of spermatogenesis. The protein, RNA binding motif protein 44, is characterized by the presence of an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, which facilitates its role in mRNA stability, splicing, and translation. It is notably localized to intercellular bridges in meiotic germ cells, where it is thought to participate in mRNA transport and act as a quality checkpoint during spermatogenesis (Greenbaum2011Germ). Although RBM44 is not essential for the stability of these intercellular bridges, its involvement in the regulation of spermatogonial stem cells and their transition to spermatocytes highlights its functional significance (Bai2022Role; Reza2018Roles). Beyond its role in normal physiological processes, RBM44 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cerebral cavernous malformations, synovial sarcomas, mucosal melanoma, and pancreatic cancer, suggesting its potential as a target for further clinical research (Konishi2021The; Du2021Identification; Eren2021A; Qi2015Identification).

## Function
RBM44 (RNA binding motif protein 44) is a component of the mammalian intercellular bridge, particularly in the testis, where it associates with TEX14. It is specifically localized to intercellular bridges in meiotic germ cells, suggesting a role in mRNA transport across these structures (Greenbaum2011Germ). RBM44 contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, which is indicative of its involvement in RNA processing and regulation, potentially influencing mRNA stability, splicing, and translation (Greenbaum2011Germ).

In the context of spermatogenesis, RBM44 is thought to act as a quality checkpoint by eliminating select meiotic germ cells, as its disruption leads to an increase in sperm number without affecting the stability of intercellular bridges (Greenbaum2011Germ). Despite its role in these processes, RBM44 is not essential for maintaining intercellular bridge stability, as evidenced by the lack of infertility in RBM44 null mice, suggesting redundancy with other RRM domain-containing proteins (Greenbaum2011Germ).

RBM44 is also involved in the regulation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and their transition to spermatocytes, with miRNAs such as miR-34b-5p targeting RBM44 to influence these processes (Bai2022Role; Reza2018Roles).

## Clinical Significance
RBM44 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression. In patients with sporadic cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), RBM44 was identified as one of the differentially expressed genes associated with symptoms such as epilepsy and hemorrhage, suggesting a role in the pathology of CCM (Eren2021A). In the context of biphasic synovial sarcomas (BSSs), RBM44 was found to have a missense mutation specific to the spindle cell component, indicating its potential involvement in the tumorigenesis of this aggressive cancer (Qi2015Identification). 

RBM44 has also been identified as a significantly mutated gene in mucosal melanoma among Chinese patients, although specific diseases or conditions associated with these mutations were not detailed (Du2021Identification). In myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in patients exposed to ionizing radiation, RBM44 was noted among potentially pathogenic sequence variants, highlighting its possible role in radiation-induced genetic alterations (Poluben2018Characteristics). Additionally, RBM44 is listed among RNA-binding proteins promoted in pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting a potential role in tumor promotion (Konishi2021The). These findings underscore the gene's involvement in various pathological conditions, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.
