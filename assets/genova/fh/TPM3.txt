# TPM3

## Overview
The TPM3 gene encodes the protein tropomyosin 3, which is a member of the tropomyosin family of actin-binding proteins. Tropomyosin 3 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics, contributing to both muscle contraction and the maintenance of cytoskeletal integrity in non-muscle cells. As a coiled-coil protein, tropomyosin 3 interacts with actin filaments, influencing their stability and function. In muscle cells, it is integral to the regulation of contraction, particularly in slow-twitch muscle fibers, by modulating the interaction between actin and myosin. In non-muscle cells, tropomyosin 3 is involved in stabilizing actin filaments, thereby affecting cell adhesion, motility, and structural integrity. Mutations in the TPM3 gene are linked to various congenital myopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in muscle function and development (Marttila2014Mutation; Lambert2023Tropomyosin; Hardeman2020Impact).

## Structure
Tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) is a protein that plays a crucial role in muscle contraction and cytoskeletal functions. The primary structure of TPM3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a coiled-coil dimer, characterized by a heptapeptide repeat structure. In this structure, small hydrophobic residues at positions 'a' and 'd' form a hydrophobic core, while charged residues at 'e' and 'g' stabilize the structure through electrostatic interactions (Borovikov2018The). 

The secondary structure of TPM3 includes alpha-helices, which are integral to its coiled-coil configuration. The tertiary structure involves the coiling of these helices, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The quaternary structure of TPM3 forms a polymer along actin filaments, which is essential for its role in muscle contraction (Marchenko2021Comparative).

TPM3 has multiple splice variant isoforms, such as Tpm3.1, Tpm3.2, Tpm3.4, Tpm3.5, and Tpm3.7, which differ due to alternatively spliced internal exon 6 and C-terminal exon 9. These variations significantly affect the protein's properties, such as thermal stability and actin affinity (Marchenko2021Comparative). The protein's structure and function can be further influenced by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation (Marchenko2021Comparative).

## Function
The TPM3 gene encodes tropomyosin 3, a protein that plays a critical role in the structural organization and function of actin filaments in both muscle and non-muscle cells. In skeletal muscle, TPM3 isoforms, such as Tpm3.12, are integral to the regulation of muscle contraction, particularly in slow muscle fibers. These isoforms form heterodimers with other tropomyosin isoforms, facilitating the interaction with actin filaments and influencing the contractile properties of muscle fibers by regulating thin filament length and maintaining protein stoichiometry (Lambert2023Tropomyosin).

In non-muscle cells, TPM3 isoforms like Tpm3.1 are involved in stabilizing actin filaments and maintaining cytoskeletal integrity. Tpm3.1 plays a significant role in cell adhesion, influencing the stability of focal adhesions and cell-cell junctions, which affects cell motility and structural integrity (Hardeman2020Impact). Additionally, Tpm3.1 provides protection against actin filament disassembly, contributing to the maintenance of filament length and stability, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance and intracellular transport (Jansen2019Tropomyosin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TPM3 gene are associated with several congenital myopathies, including nemaline myopathy, cap myopathy, and congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD). These conditions are characterized by muscle weakness and structural abnormalities in muscle fibers (Marttila2014Mutation). TPM3-related myopathy, a subtype of congenital myopathy, presents a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild to severe symptoms, including hypotonia, delayed motor milestones, and muscle weakness affecting various muscle groups (Lambert2023Tropomyosin). 

The pathogenic mutations in TPM3 often involve missense mutations, which can disrupt the interaction between tropomyosin, actin, and troponin, leading to impaired muscle contraction (Lambert2023Tropomyosin). These mutations are predominantly autosomal dominant, with some arising de novo (Lambert2023Tropomyosin). Muscle weakness in TPM3-myopathy is attributed to reduced calcium sensitivity and impaired acto-myosin cross-bridge cycling in slow muscle fibers (Yuen2015Muscle).

In nemaline myopathy, TPM3 mutations can lead to the presence of nemaline bodies in muscle fibers, particularly affecting type 1 fibers, which express TPM3 (Tan1999Homozygosity). The clinical significance of TPM3 mutations is underscored by their impact on muscle contractility and the potential for severe motor impairment (Kiiski2015A).

## Interactions
TPM3, or tropomyosin 3, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins that influence muscle function and cellular processes. It forms coiled-coil structures along actin filaments, essential for muscle contraction, and interacts with actin, troponin complex subunits, tropomodulin, myosin, leiomodin, and nebulin (Lambert2023Tropomyosin). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of actin filament dynamics and muscle contraction.

In vascular smooth muscle cells, TPM3 interacts with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), influencing vascular smooth muscle contraction and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). This interaction is significant in the context of hypertension, as it contributes to increased contractility and blood pressure in response to high-salt intake (Xu2021Physical).

TPM3 also regulates the access of actin-binding proteins to actin filaments. For instance, the Tpm3.1 isoform inhibits the Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly and competes with cofilin for binding on actin filaments, affecting actin disassembly. It promotes the recruitment of non-muscle myosin IIA while restricting Myo1c binding, which is important for processes like glucose uptake in skeletal muscle (Lambert2023Tropomyosin).
