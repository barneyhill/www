# SLC25A26

## Overview
SLC25A26 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial S-adenosylmethionine carrier (SAMC), a member of the solute carrier family 25. This protein is integral to the mitochondrial inner membrane and is responsible for the transport of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) into the mitochondria, a process essential for the methylation of mitochondrial DNA, RNA, and proteins. The SAMC protein is characterized by a unique structure comprising six transmembrane alpha-helices, which facilitate its function as a transporter. The activity of SLC25A26 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial metabolism and cellular energy homeostasis, impacting various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and energy production (Ji2021Identification; Palmieri2013The). Mutations in this gene can lead to significant mitochondrial dysfunction, with implications for various diseases, including metabolic disorders and cancer (Palmieri2020Diseases; Xu2024Fresh).

## Structure
The SLC25A26 gene encodes the mitochondrial S-adenosylmethionine carrier (SAMC), a protein that is part of the mitochondrial carrier family. This protein is characterized by a tripartite structure with a three-fold repeat motif and six transmembrane alpha-helices, which are arranged in a counter-clockwise order from 1 to 6, forming a funnel-shaped cavity that opens towards the cytosol (Ji2021Identification; Palmieri2013The). The atomic structure of the mitochondrial carrier includes a six-transmembrane alpha-helix bundle (H1-H6) and three short helices (h12, h34, h56) that are parallel to the membrane plane on the matrix side (Ji2021Identification).

The SLC25A26 protein is the only known mitochondrial SAM transporter, crucial for mitochondrial metabolism, particularly in the methylation of mitochondrial DNA, tRNA, and rRNA (Ji2021Identification). The protein's structure is distinct from other transporter families, with specific mutations affecting its transport activity. For instance, mutations such as p.Ala102Val and p.Pro199Leu, located inside the substrate translocation pore, result in almost depleted transport activity (Palmieri2020Diseases). These structural features are essential for its function in mitochondrial methylation processes.

## Function
SLC25A26 encodes the mitochondrial S-adenosylmethionine carrier (SAMC), a protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function by facilitating the transport of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) from the cytosol into the mitochondria. This transport is essential for the methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, and coenzyme Q within the mitochondria, processes that are vital for gene expression regulation, protein function, and energy production (Palmieri2020Diseases; Ji2021Identification). The protein operates in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it exchanges SAM for S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), maintaining the methylation capacity necessary for various cellular processes (Palmieri2013The).

In healthy human cells, SAMC is involved in the biosynthesis of lipoic acid and the methylation of mitochondrial DNA, tRNA, and rRNA, which are critical for mitochondrial protein synthesis and the proper function of the respiratory chain (Ji2021Identification). The activity of SLC25A26 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial metabolism and cellular energy homeostasis, impacting overall cell health and function (Xu2024Fresh). Any disruption in its function can lead to mitochondrial defects, affecting ATP production and cellular energy requirements (Ji2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC25A26 gene can lead to significant clinical consequences, primarily due to its role in mitochondrial function. Deficiency in SLC25A26 results in reduced intra-mitochondrial methylation of RNA and proteins, diminished levels of coenzyme Q and lipoic acid, and overall mitochondrial dysfunction. Clinically, this manifests as respiratory insufficiency, lactic acidosis, acute cardiopulmonary failure, and progressive muscle weakness. The severity of these symptoms correlates with the transport activity of the mutated S-adenosylmethionine carrier (SAMC) proteins. Notably, a homozygous splice site mutation leading to undetectable protein levels has been associated with early death due to respiratory and multiple organ failure (Palmieri2020Diseases).

Alterations in the expression of SLC25A26 are also implicated in various cancers. In cervical cancer, downregulation of SLC25A26 due to promoter hypermethylation is linked to increased invasiveness and poor prognosis. Conversely, in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, upregulation of SLC25A26 correlates with immune checkpoint gene expression and affects cancer cell survival and proliferation. The gene's expression levels influence mitochondrial SAM levels, impacting cancer cell behavior, including survival, proliferation, and senescence (Xu2024Fresh).
