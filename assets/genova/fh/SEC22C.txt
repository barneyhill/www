# SEC22C

## Overview
SEC22C is a gene that encodes the SEC22 homolog C, a vesicle trafficking protein that plays a pivotal role in the transport of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. This protein is a member of the SEC22 family and is categorized as an R-SNARE protein, which is integral to the vesicle SNARE (v-SNARE) complex. The SEC22C protein is involved in both anterograde and retrograde transport, facilitating vesicle fusion and membrane trafficking, essential processes for protein sorting and secretion (Hay1996Mammalian; Adnan2019Diverse). It is characterized by a SNARE domain, which is crucial for its interaction with target SNAREs (t-SNAREs) to mediate membrane fusion events at the ER-Golgi boundary (Hay1996Mammalian; Adnan2019Diverse). The protein's structure includes alpha-helices and coiled-coil motifs, which contribute to its ability to form stable complexes with other SNARE proteins, underscoring its role in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. SEC22C is ubiquitously expressed in healthy human cells and is active in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular function and homeostasis (Adnan2019Diverse).

## Structure
SEC22C is a vesicle trafficking protein that is part of the SEC22 family, characterized by its involvement in membrane fusion processes. The protein contains a SNARE domain, which is essential for its role in vesicle docking and fusion. This domain is a key feature of the protein's molecular structure, facilitating the interaction with other SNARE proteins to mediate membrane fusion events. 

Structurally, SEC22C is composed of alpha-helices and coiled-coil motifs, which are common structural elements in SNARE proteins. These motifs contribute to the protein's ability to form stable complexes with other SNARE proteins, a critical aspect of its function in vesicle trafficking. The presence of these structural features suggests a highly organized tertiary structure that supports its functional role in cellular processes.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in SEC22C, potentially regulating its activity and interactions with other proteins. These modifications can influence the protein's function and its involvement in vesicle trafficking pathways. The specific details of these modifications and their impact on SEC22C's structure and function are areas of ongoing research. 

Overall, the structural characteristics of SEC22C, including its SNARE domain and common motifs, underscore its role in the complex process of vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion.

## Function
SEC22C is a member of the SEC22 family of vesicle trafficking proteins, playing a crucial role in the transport of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. It is involved in both anterograde and retrograde transport, facilitating vesicle fusion and membrane trafficking, which are essential for protein sorting and secretion (Hay1996Mammalian; Adnan2019Diverse). SEC22C is an R-SNARE protein that forms part of the vesicle SNARE (v-SNARE) complex, interacting with target SNAREs (t-SNAREs) to facilitate membrane fusion at the ER-Golgi boundary (Hay1996Mammalian; Adnan2019Diverse).

In healthy human cells, SEC22C is ubiquitously expressed and is active in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, contributing to proper cellular function and homeostasis (Adnan2019Diverse). Overexpression of SEC22C can disrupt the localization of ER/Golgi SNARE molecules, indicating its significant role in the early secretory pathway (Adnan2019Diverse). The protein's tail-anchored structure with a single transmembrane domain is crucial for homodimer formation and SNARE complex assembly, which are vital for its function in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion (Adnan2019Diverse).
