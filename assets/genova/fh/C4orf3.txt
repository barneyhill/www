# C4orf3

## Overview
C4orf3, or chromosome 4 open reading frame 3, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. The protein encoded by C4orf3 is not yet fully characterized in terms of its specific functional category, such as kinase or receptor, but it has been implicated in several cancer-related pathways. Research has shown that C4orf3 is involved in alternative polyadenylation events and DNA methylation changes, which are significant in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Qian2020Integrative; Li2020Alternative). The gene's expression is modulated in response to hypoxic conditions, suggesting a role in the cellular response to low oxygen levels (Satoh2015Bioinformatics). C4orf3's involvement in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, and osteosarcoma, underscores its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in oncology (Glover2017Osteosarcoma; Liu2023Spatially).

## Clinical Significance
C4orf3 has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma, C4orf3 undergoes alternative polyadenylation (APA) modifications, forming a fusion transcript named KLHL2-C4orf3. This fusion is associated with tumorigenesis and may serve as a biomarker for identifying lung adenocarcinoma (Li2020Alternative). In metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), C4orf3 is one of 12 signature genes identified through DNA methylation analysis. These genes are associated with poor prognosis and are used in a prognostic model to predict survival rates in ccRCC patients (Qian2020Integrative).

C4orf3 is also involved in colorectal cancer (CRC), where it is upregulated along cancer invasion trajectories, indicating a role in local invasion (Liu2023Spatially). In osteosarcoma, C4orf3 expression is inversely associated with high circulating IGFBP2 concentrations, suggesting a potential role in sarcomagenesis (Glover2017Osteosarcoma). Additionally, C4orf3 is a target gene of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) under hypoxic conditions, linking it to hypoxia response pathways relevant to cancer (Satoh2015Bioinformatics). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various cancer types and its potential as a biomarker.
