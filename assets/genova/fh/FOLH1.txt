# FOLH1

## Overview
FOLH1, or folate hydrolase 1, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane glycoprotein known as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). This protein is categorized as a glutamate carboxypeptidase and plays a significant role in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, particularly in the brain. PSMA is involved in the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) to produce glutamate, a critical neurotransmitter, thereby influencing glutamate neurotransmission and cognitive functions (Zink2020Association). Although initially identified in the prostate, PSMA is expressed in various tissues, including the duodenum, renal tubular cells, and astrocytes, and is implicated in both physiological and pathological processes, such as cancer and neurological disorders (RamirezFort2024Gender). The gene's expression and the protein's enzymatic activity are of clinical interest due to their association with diseases like ischemic stroke and schizophrenia, highlighting the importance of FOLH1 in medical research and potential therapeutic applications (Saracini2010Earlyonset; Parisa2019Investigation).

## Structure
FOLH1, also known as folate hydrolase 1 or prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a glutamate carboxypeptidase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Sun2022Identification). The secondary structure of FOLH1 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of FOLH1 forms a homodimer, which is essential for its quaternary structure and functional activity as a dimeric enzyme (Sun2022Identification).

FOLH1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability, localization, and activity. These modifications are important for the protein's function in various physiological and pathological processes (Sun2022Identification). The gene also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in different splice variant isoforms that may influence its function and localization within the cell (Sun2022Identification).

The protein is highly expressed in the neovasculature of various carcinomas, including endometrial cancer, and its expression levels are associated with cancer prognosis (Sun2022Identification). The structural features of FOLH1 are integral to its role in both normal physiological processes and disease states.

## Function
The FOLH1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), which is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter levels in the brain. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the metabolism of N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG), a peptide neurotransmitter that acts as a selective agonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3). GCPII inactivates NAAG by cleaving it into N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate, thereby modulating glutamate neurotransmission (Zink2020Association).

In healthy human cells, FOLH1 is expressed in various tissues, including the prostate, duodenum, renal tubular cells, and a subpopulation of astrocytes. It is involved in cleaving terminal glutamate residues to form the neurotransmitter glutamate, particularly in astrocytes (RamirezFort2024Gender). The enzyme is also known as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), although this term can be misleading as its expression is not limited to the prostate (RamirezFort2024Gender).

The regulation of NAAG levels by FOLH1/GCPII is significant for cognitive functions, as higher NAAG levels are associated with better cognitive performance (Zink2020Association).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FOLH1 gene, also known as folate hydrolase 1, have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of cardiovascular health, the FOLH1 gene has been linked to early-onset ischemic stroke. The aa haplotype of FOLH1 is identified as a strong independent risk factor for stroke, associated with increased homocysteine levels, which are a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (Saracini2010Earlyonset). The rs202680 polymorphism in FOLH1, although a samesense polymorphism, shows a significant association with stroke, suggesting that FOLH1 may play a role in common atherosclerotic mechanisms (Saracini2010Earlyonset).

In neurological disorders, FOLH1 expression is implicated in conditions such as schizophrenia. The CT genotype of the FOLH1 gene at the rs61886494 locus has been associated with schizophrenia in an Iranian population, indicating a potential role in the pathophysiology of this psychiatric disorder (Parisa2019Investigation). Additionally, FOLH1's role in glutamate neurotransmission links it to neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, where its dysregulation may contribute to disease progression (Parisa2019Investigation). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FOLH1 in various health conditions, emphasizing the importance of genetic variations in its function.

## Interactions
The FOLH1 gene encodes the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which participates in several important protein interactions. PSMA interacts with filamin A (FLNa), an actin-binding protein, which is crucial for its localization to the recycling endosomal compartment (REC). This interaction stabilizes PSMA at the cell surface by tethering it to the actin cytoskeleton, potentially preventing the binding of the AP-2 adaptor protein complex, thereby reducing the rate of PSMA internalization (Rajasekaran2005Is; Ghosh2003Tumor).

PSMA is internalized from the plasma membrane through clathrin-coated pits, a process involving the first five NH2-terminal amino acids of its cytoplasmic tail. The AP-2 adaptor protein complex interacts with a specific MWNLL motif in the cytoplasmic tail of PSMA, facilitating its internalization. Mutations in this motif significantly reduce internalization, highlighting its importance in the endocytic pathway (Rajasekaran2003A).

PSMA also forms a noncovalent homodimer, which is essential for its enzymatic activities, such as folate hydrolase and NAALADase. The dimeric form of PSMA is more effective in eliciting antibodies that recognize PSMA-expressing tumor cells, suggesting its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy (Schülke2003The).
