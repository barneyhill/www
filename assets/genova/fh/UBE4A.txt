# UBE4A

## Overview
UBE4A is a gene that encodes the ubiquitination factor E4A, a protein that plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and cellular regulation. The UBE4A protein is categorized as a U-box-type ubiquitin ligase, functioning as both an E3 and E4 enzyme to facilitate the attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins, marking them for degradation by the proteasome (Contino2004Expression; Melo2021Biallelic). This process is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and ensuring protein quality control. UBE4A is expressed in various human tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney, and is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Contino2004Expression). The gene's activity is essential for normal development and neurological function, with mutations and alterations in UBE4A being implicated in several diseases, including intellectual disability, developmental delays, and certain cancers (Carén2006The; Melo2021Biallelic).

## Structure
The UBE4A protein is characterized by the presence of a U-box domain, a modified RING finger domain that spans 64 amino acids and is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Contino2004Expression). This domain includes a conserved proline residue at position 1137, which is essential for its function (Contino2004Expression). The full-length UBE4A protein consists of 1073 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 125 kDa (Contino2004Expression). 

UBE4A is part of the U-box protein family, which can function as both E3 and E4 ubiquitin ligases, facilitating the formation of ubiquitin chains on substrates (Contino2004Expression). The protein is expressed in various human tissues and is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Contino2004Expression). 

The UBE4A protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. Splice variant isoforms of UBE4A may exist, contributing to structural and functional diversity, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context. The protein's role in ubiquitination is crucial for protein degradation and cell cycle regulation (Contino2004Expression).

## Function
UBE4A, a U-box-type ubiquitin ligase, plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and cellular regulation. It functions as both an E3 and E4 enzyme, facilitating the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins, thereby marking them for degradation by the proteasome (Contino2004Expression; Melo2021Biallelic). This process is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and ensuring protein quality control (Melo2021Biallelic).

UBE4A is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in the heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. It is predominantly localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cortical neurons and liver cells, as well as in the nucleus of kidney tubular cells (Contino2004Expression). This subcellular localization suggests that UBE4A is involved in specific cellular processes, such as cell cycle control and stress response (Contino2004Expression).

The gene's activity is crucial for normal development and neurological function, as evidenced by the association of biallelic loss-of-function variants in UBE4A with intellectual disability and developmental delays (Melo2021Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UBE4A gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In neuroblastoma, a common childhood cancer, UBE4A is located in a region frequently deleted in advanced-stage tumors, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene. A specific missense mutation (1028T > C, leading to I343T) in UBE4A was identified in a neuroblastoma tumor, which may contribute to tumor progression due to its deleterious nature (Carén2006The).

Biallelic loss-of-function variants in UBE4A are associated with intellectual disability and global developmental delay. These variants lead to reduced RNA expression and protein levels, causing significant neurodevelopmental impairments, including speech limitations and behavioral abnormalities (Melo2021Biallelic).

In Crohn's disease, autoantibodies against UBE4A are linked to disease severity. Higher levels of these antibodies correlate with more severe forms of the disease, such as stricturing or penetrating disease, suggesting UBE4A's involvement in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (Sakiyama2008Autoantibodies).

UBE4A is also implicated in thyroid carcinoma, where it acts as an E3 ligase targeting PCBP1 for degradation. Its overexpression is associated with poorer outcomes in thyroid cancer patients (Zhang2017Poly).

## Interactions
UBE4A, a ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate various cellular processes. It interacts with the Viperin protein, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is dependent on the acetylation of Viperin at Lys197 by the acetyltransferase HAT1, which enhances UBE4A binding and subsequent K6-linked polyubiquitination at Lys206, leading to Viperin's degradation (Yuan2020Targeting). UBE4A also interacts with the interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI) in prostate cancer cells, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which suppresses epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastatic progression (Sun2016The).

In the context of diabetic nephropathy, UBE4A targets Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7 (BMP7) for degradation, as evidenced by its interaction with BMP7 under high glucose conditions, leading to reduced BMP7 protein levels (Feng2019Bone). In thyroid carcinoma, UBE4A interacts with and ubiquitinates PCBP1, resulting in its degradation and lower protein levels in cancer cells (Zhang2017Poly). Additionally, UBE4A is involved in colorectal cancer cell proliferation by interacting with MDM2 and P53, affecting P53 stability through a proteasome-dependent pathway (Xie2022PTBP3). These interactions highlight UBE4A's role in modulating protein stability and cellular functions across different biological contexts.
