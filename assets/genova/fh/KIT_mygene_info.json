gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase. This gene was initially identified as a homolog of the feline sarcoma viral oncogene v-kit and is often referred to as proto-oncogene c-Kit. The canonical form of this glycosylated transmembrane protein has an N-terminal extracellular region with five immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain at the C-terminus. Upon activation by its cytokine ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), this protein phosphorylates multiple intracellular proteins that play a role in in the proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis of many cell types and thereby plays an important role in hematopoiesis, stem cell maintenance, gametogenesis, melanogenesis, and in mast cell development, migration and function. This protein can be a membrane-bound or soluble protein. Mutations in this gene are associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors, mast cell disease, acute myelogenous leukemia, and piebaldism. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
