# TTLL1

## Overview
The TTLL1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family, specifically functioning as a tubulin polyglutamylase. This enzyme is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin through polyglutamylation, a process critical for the regulation of microtubule dynamics and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and motor proteins (Ping2023Tubulin; Wu2022TTLL1). The protein encoded by TTLL1, known as TTL family tubulin polyglutamylase complex subunit L1, plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for respiratory health and male fertility (Vogel2010Tubulin). Additionally, TTLL1 is implicated in neuronal health, where it helps regulate tubulin polyglutamylation levels to prevent neurodegeneration (Rogowski2010A; Wu2022TTLL1). Mutations or deficiencies in TTLL1 have been associated with clinical conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring its significance in human health (Wu2022TTLL1; Vogel2010Tubulin).

## Function
The TTLL1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family, which is involved in the post-translational modification process known as polyglutamylation. This process involves the addition of glutamate residues to tubulin, a key component of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular functions, including intracellular transport and cell division (Wu2022TTLL1). In healthy human cells, TTLL1 specifically catalyzes the formation of α-carboxyl chain-elongating linkages in α-tubulin, contributing to the regulation of polyglutamylation and ensuring proper cellular function (Wu2022TTLL1).

TTLL1 plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and motility of cilia and flagella, which are important for respiratory function and male fertility (Vogel2010Tubulin). The enzyme is essential for the normal motility of respiratory cilia and the biogenesis and function of sperm flagella, highlighting its importance in ciliary and flagellar function (Vogel2010Tubulin). In neurons, TTLL1 is involved in maintaining proper cellular transport and structural integrity, particularly in preventing neurodegeneration by regulating tubulin polyglutamylation levels (Rogowski2010A; Wu2022TTLL1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or deficiencies in the TTLL1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, primarily affecting ciliary and flagellar function. In mice, TTLL1 deficiency results in chronic rhinosinusitis and male infertility due to abnormal development of spermatid flagella, which are consistent with symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (Vogel2010Tubulin). These mice exhibit impaired mucociliary clearance, leading to chronic respiratory infections and otitis media, although they do not display some common PCD symptoms like situs inversus or hydrocephalus (Vogel2010Tubulin).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TTLL1 plays a role in modulating tubulin polyglutamylation, which is crucial for neuronal health. In pcd (Purkinje cell degeneration) mice, loss of TTLL1 reduces tubulin hyperglutamylation and can rescue Purkinje cell degeneration, suggesting its involvement in neurodegenerative processes (Wu2022TTLL1). TTLL1 deficiency also attenuates photoreceptor degeneration and corrects rhodopsin mislocalization, indicating its potential protective role against certain neurodegenerative phenotypes (Wu2022TTLL1). These findings highlight the importance of TTLL1 in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in human diseases.

## Interactions
TTLL1 (Tubulin Tyrosine Ligase-Like 1) is involved in the polyglutamylation of tubulin, a post-translational modification that affects microtubule stability and interactions. TTLL1 primarily acts on α-tubulin, and its activity is crucial for the regulation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and motor proteins, such as CLIP170, MAP1A, dynein, and KIF1A. These interactions are modulated by the polyglutamylation state of tubulin, which TTLL1 influences (Ping2023Tubulin).

TTLL1 is part of a larger complex of tubulin polyglutamylases and interacts with other members of the TTLL family, such as TTLL4 and TTLL5. These interactions are essential for the enzymatic activity and stability of the complex. TTLL1 requires additional subunits for its activity, including PGs1, which is crucial for its function but does not localize to microtubules like other regulatory proteins such as CSAP (Bompard2018CSAP). The interaction with these proteins suggests that TTLL1 forms a complex with multiple proteins, enhancing its role in microtubule modification and regulation (Bompard2018CSAP).
