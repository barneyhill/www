# PSMA2

## Overview
PSMA2 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 2, a critical component of the proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. The proteasome 20S subunit alpha 2 is part of the 20S core particle, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the primary mechanism for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a proteasome subunit and is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by regulating protein turnover and degradation. The PSMA2 gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary importance in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. Alterations in PSMA2 expression have been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker (Elenich1999The; Li2021Integrated; Mao2021Increased).

## Structure
The PSMA2 protein, also known as proteasome 20S subunit alpha 2, is a component of the 20S core particle of the proteasome complex, which is involved in protein degradation. The primary structure of PSMA2 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, with notable conservation of certain motifs and residues across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Elenich1999The). The secondary structure of PSMA2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a core structure that is a sandwich of two five-stranded antiparallel beta sheets with a left-handed twist (Löwe1995Crystal).

In terms of tertiary structure, PSMA2 contributes to the overall 3D shape of the proteasome, forming part of the cylindrical structure composed of four stacked rings (Elenich1999The). The quaternary structure involves its assembly with other subunits in the proteasome, specifically forming part of the outer alpha rings that regulate access to the proteasome's enzymatic core (Voutsadakis2017Proteasome).

Post-translational modifications of PSMA2 include phosphorylation and acetylation, which can affect its isoelectric point and charge, influencing its function and interaction with other proteins (Vimer2020Comparative; Mittenberg2015Regulation). These modifications may also contribute to the existence of different isoforms of the protein (Elenich1999The).

## Function
PSMA2, a component of the 20S core particle of the proteasome complex, plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is the primary mechanism for protein degradation in cells. This system is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by balancing protein synthesis and degradation, thereby regulating the cell cycle and modulating various signaling pathways (Karami2020Networkbased; Mao2021Increased). PSMA2 is involved in the degradation of damaged or unneeded proteins, a process vital for cellular function and homeostasis (Mao2021Increased).

In healthy human cells, PSMA2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to protein quality control and turnover. It is part of the 20S core proteasome complex, which, along with two 19S regulatory particles, forms the 26S proteasome. This complex is involved in the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent degradation of peptides, playing a significant role in controlling cellular activities such as cell cycle progression (Qi2021Comprehensively; Karami2020Networkbased). The proteasome system, including PSMA2, is implicated in various biological processes, such as cardiac neural crest migration and neural crest cell differentiation, which are crucial for heart development (Karami2020Networkbased).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSMA2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), PSMA2 expression is significantly increased across all stages, promoting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. This upregulation is associated with tumor-associated macrophages and is a target of miR-132, a microRNA that can hinder CRC cell proliferation. The interaction between PSMA2 and miR-132 suggests that PSMA2 could be a potential therapeutic target in CRC (Qi2021Comprehensively).

In cervical cancer, particularly in the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), PSMA2 expression is elevated and positively correlated with the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). High glucose conditions, common in T2D, further increase PSMA2 expression, enhancing cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. The GLP-1R agonist Exendin-4 has been shown to reduce PSMA2 expression and tumor growth, indicating a potential therapeutic role in modulating PSMA2 activity in cervical cancer (Mao2021Increased).

Elevated expression of PSMA2 is also linked to poor survival outcomes in several other cancers, including adrenocortical carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Li2021Integrated).

## Interactions
PSMA2, or proteasome 20S subunit alpha 2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in protein degradation. It is a component of the 20S proteasome complex, which plays a role in both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent pathways of protein degradation. PSMA2 directly interacts with IκBα through its arm-repeats, facilitating the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of IκBα. This interaction highlights PSMA2's role in mediating specific protein degradation pathways (SánchezLanzas2014Proteins).

PSMA2 also interacts with calcineurin, which promotes the degradation of IκBα via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, indicating its involvement in multiple degradation mechanisms (SánchezLanzas2014Proteins). In the context of viral infections, PSMA2 acts as a restriction factor for Zika virus (ZIKV) growth in astrocytic cells. Knockdown of PSMA2 in these cells leads to increased ZIKV titers, suggesting that PSMA2 interacts with viral components to limit replication (Sher2022HLA-A).

In cancer models, PSMA2 expression is associated with the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R), particularly in cervical cancer with type 2 diabetes. This co-expression suggests a potential interaction that may influence cancer progression and response to treatments like Exendin-4 (Mao2021Increased).
