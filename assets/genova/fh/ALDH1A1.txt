# ALDH1A1

## Overview
ALDH1A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1, a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids, a critical process for detoxification and alcohol metabolism in human cells (Chen2012Focus; Ma2010The). ALDH1A1 plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid, a molecule essential for regulating gene expression, cell differentiation, and proliferation (Ma2010The). The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues and cellular compartments, including the cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (Ma2010The). It also serves as a marker for both normal and cancer stem cells, contributing to drug resistance and the maintenance of stem cell populations (Ma2010The). ALDH1A1's interactions with proteins such as PRMT3 and β-catenin highlight its involvement in diverse cellular processes and signaling pathways, including those related to cancer progression (Wang2020ALDH1A1; Verma2021PRMT3). The gene's expression and activity have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, where it is associated with therapy resistance and disease pathogenesis (Dancik2023The; Anderson2011Functional).

## Structure
The ALDH1A1 protein is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily and functions as a homotetramer, with each subunit having a molecular weight of approximately 55 kDa (Chen2012Focus). The primary structure of ALDH1A1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the overall stability and function of the protein (Chen2012Focus).

The tertiary structure of ALDH1A1 is characterized by three distinct domains: an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain, a catalytic domain, and a C-terminal small β-sheet oligomerization domain. These domains are essential for the enzyme's function, with the nucleotide-binding domain containing coiled-coil motifs that are predicted to be involved in oligomerization (Chen2012Focus). The active sites of the enzyme are located at the base of a hydrophobic tunnel, which is strategically positioned near the tetrameric interface to facilitate catalysis (Chen2012Focus).

In its quaternary structure, ALDH1A1 forms a tetramer, with dimerization occurring through interactions between monomer α-helices and β-sheet extensions (Chen2012Focus). The enzyme's structure is highly conserved, with critical residues for NAD+-binding and catalytic activity being strictly conserved across species (Morgan2015Characterization).

## Function
ALDH1A1 is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids, a process essential for detoxification and alcohol metabolism in human cells (Chen2012Focus; Ma2010The). It is involved in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid (RA) by converting retinaldehyde to RA, a key molecule in regulating gene expression, cell differentiation, and proliferation (Chen2012Focus; Ma2010The). This conversion is irreversible and tightly regulated due to the potent biological activity of RA (Ma2010The).

ALDH1A1 is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and is active in various cellular locations, including the cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (Ma2010The). In the eye, it functions as a crystallin in the cornea and lens, contributing to transparency and protection against UV-induced damage (Chen2012Focus). The enzyme also plays a protective role by metabolizing reactive aldehydes produced during oxidative stress, thus safeguarding cells from potential damage (Chen2012Focus).

In stem cells, ALDH1A1 is associated with self-protection, differentiation, and expansion, serving as a marker for both normal and cancer stem cells (Ma2010The). Its activity is linked to resistance against cytotoxic drugs, contributing to the survival and maintenance of stem cell populations (Ma2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ALDH1A1 gene are associated with various cancers and other diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ALDH1A1 is overexpressed in patients with poor prognosis, contributing to therapy resistance by protecting cells from oxidative stress and facilitating DNA repair (Dancik2023The). Inhibiting ALDH1A1 can eradicate AML stem cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy (Dancik2023The). In breast cancer, high ALDH1A1 expression is linked to poor prognosis, early relapse, and therapy resistance, with its knockdown reducing metastatic behavior (Croker2017Differential). In colorectal cancer, mutant P53 activates ALDH1A1, contributing to chemotherapy resistance (Dancik2023The).

ALDH1A1 is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease, reduced ALDH1A1 expression in the substantia nigra may contribute to neurotoxicity due to the accumulation of toxic aldehydes, potentially affecting the long-term survival of dopaminergic neurons (Anderson2011Functional). This suggests a possible link between ALDH1A1 deficiency and increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration. Overall, ALDH1A1's role in detoxification and cellular protection is crucial in the context of disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
ALDH1A1 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It is known to interact with PRMT3, a protein arginine methyltransferase, which inhibits ALDH1A1's enzymatic activity. This interaction negatively regulates retinoic acid (RA) signaling, affecting gene expression related to development and differentiation. The interaction between ALDH1A1 and PRMT3 is independent of PRMT3's methyltransferase activity and involves the C-terminal region of ALDH1A1 and the catalytic domain of PRMT3 (Verma2021PRMT3).

ALDH1A1 also interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction is part of a mechanism that maintains cancer stem-like cell properties in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by activating the AKT signaling pathway (Wang2020ALDH1A1). The interaction with β-catenin suggests a role for ALDH1A1 in modulating signaling pathways that are crucial for cancer progression.

In thyroid cancer, ALDH1A1 interacts with transcription factors such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein b (CEBPB) and membrane-bound proteins like ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6 (ABCC6) and mucin 1 (MUC1), indicating its involvement in multiple signaling pathways and metabolic processes (Cui2022Transcriptional).
