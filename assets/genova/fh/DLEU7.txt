# DLEU7

## Overview
DLEU7, or Deleted in Lymphocytic Leukemia 7, is a gene located on chromosome 13q14, a region frequently associated with deletions in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The gene encodes a protein that is implicated in key cellular processes, including signal transduction and apoptosis, suggesting its role as a potential tumor suppressor. The DLEU7 protein is involved in the transmission of molecular signals and the regulation of programmed cell death, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation. Its expression across various tissues indicates a broad functional impact, potentially influencing tissue development and immune responses. The gene's involvement in CLL pathogenesis is underscored by its frequent deletion in CLL cases and its ability to modulate signaling pathways such as TNF, NF-kB, and NFAT, which are critical in the disease's progression (Pekarsky2014Role; Rahmatpanah2009Large-Scale). The methylation status of DLEU7 further highlights its potential as a biomarker for CLL prognosis (Rahmatpanah2009Large-Scale).

## Structure


## Function
DLEU7, or Deleted in Lymphocytic Leukemia 7, is a gene located on chromosome 13q14, a region frequently deleted in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The protein encoded by DLEU7 is involved in critical cellular processes such as signal transduction and apoptosis. It is expressed in various tissues, indicating its potential role in regulating cell growth and differentiation. The involvement of DLEU7 in signal transduction suggests that it may participate in the transmission of molecular signals from the cell surface to the interior, influencing cellular responses to external stimuli. Its role in apoptosis implies that DLEU7 may contribute to the programmed cell death process, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and eliminating damaged or unnecessary cells. The expression of DLEU7 in diverse tissues suggests that it may have a broad impact on cellular functions and organismal outcomes, potentially influencing processes such as tissue development and immune response. The precise molecular activities of the DLEU7 protein and its specific cellular locations remain areas of active research, with ongoing studies aimed at elucidating its full range of functions in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The DLEU7 gene, located on chromosome 13q14, is frequently deleted in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and is considered a candidate tumor-suppressor gene. Its expression is significantly reduced in CLL samples compared to normal cells, suggesting that deletions or inactivation of DLEU7 contribute to CLL development by activating TNF signaling pathways (Pekarsky2014Role). DLEU7 is shown to inhibit NF-kB and NFAT activation, pathways important in CLL pathogenesis, and its expression can reduce NF-kB activation by BCMA and TACI, leading to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (Pekarsky2014Role).

The methylation status of DLEU7 also plays a role in CLL. It is preferentially methylated in CLL samples with low CD38 expression, which is generally associated with a favorable prognosis, while less methylated in samples with high CD38 expression, linked to a poor prognosis (Rahmatpanah2009Large-Scale). This differential methylation suggests that DLEU7 could serve as a biomarker for CLL classification based on CD38 expression levels (Rahmatpanah2009Large-Scale).

Inherited copy number variations spanning DLEU7 have been identified in families with multiple affected CLL members, indicating a potential role in CLL pathogenesis (Malek2012The).
