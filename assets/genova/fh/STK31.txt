# STK31

## Overview
STK31 is a gene that encodes the protein serine/threonine kinase 31, which is a member of the Tudor-domain containing protein family. This protein is characterized by its multidomain structure, including a Tudor domain, a coiled-coil region, and a serine/threonine kinase domain, which suggests its involvement in phosphorylation processes (Bao2011STK31(TDRD8); Zhou2014STK31TDRD8 page 0 of 3). The STK31 protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including spermatogenesis and apoptosis, through its interactions with proteins such as MIWI and PDCD5 (Bao2011STK31(TDRD8) page 5 of 6; Kwak2018Serinethreonine page 0 of 3). Additionally, STK31 is implicated in several cancer types, where it influences cell cycle regulation and tumorigenicity, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Bae2021STK31; Kuo2014STK31).

## Structure
The STK31 protein, also known as TDRD8, is a conserved multidomain protein that belongs to the Tudor-domain containing protein family. It is composed of 1018 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 115 kD with an isoelectric point of 5.05 (Bao2011STK31(TDRD8) page 2 of 6). The primary structure of STK31 includes a typical N-terminal Tudor domain, a central coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain (Bao2011STK31(TDRD8) page 2 of 6; Zhou2014STK31TDRD8 page 0 of 3). The Tudor domain is involved in recognizing and binding methylated arginines or lysines, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and the assembly of macromolecular complexes (Zhou2014STK31TDRD8).

The serine/threonine kinase domain suggests a role in phosphorylation, a common post-translational modification that regulates protein function (Zhou2014STK31TDRD8). Despite the presence of these domains, studies have shown that both the Tudor and kinase domains are dispensable for reproduction in mice, indicating potential functional redundancy with other TDRD proteins (Zhou2014STK31TDRD8). The STK31 protein interacts with MIWI, a member of the Piwi protein family, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis (Bao2011STK31(TDRD8) page 5 of 6).

## Clinical Significance
The STK31 gene is implicated in several cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenicity. In colorectal cancer, STK31 is overexpressed, enhancing cell migration and invasiveness, and its knockdown leads to defects in microtubule assembly and apoptosis, suggesting its critical role in cancer cell behavior (Kuo2014STK31). In cervical cancer, STK31 expression is associated with HPV16/18 infection and is regulated by the methylation status of its promoter. Hypomethylation of STK31 is linked to increased expression and is considered a potential biomarker for cervical cancer progression and chemoresistance (Yin2016Serinethreonine).

In gastric cancer, STK31 upregulation is associated with chromatin remodeling and increased tumorigenicity. Its expression is regulated by promoter hypomethylation, which correlates with poor survival outcomes in patients (Bae2021STK31). In lung cancer, STK31 is linked to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, promoting cell proliferation and tumor progression. Downregulation of STK31 suppresses proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xiong2019STK31).

## Interactions
STK31, also known as serine/threonine kinase 31, participates in several significant protein interactions. In mouse spermatogenesis, STK31 interacts with MIWI, a PIWI protein, in the cytosol of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting a role in germ cell development (Bao2011STK31(TDRD8) page 5 of 6). STK31 also associates with DDX4, a germ cell-specific marker, and CUL3, an ubiquitin E3 ligase, indicating its involvement in protein degradation pathways (Bao2011STK31(TDRD8) page 5 of 6).

In human colon cancer cells, STK31 interacts with programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5), playing a crucial role in promoting apoptosis through the p53 signaling pathway. This interaction stabilizes PDCD5, enhancing p53-mediated apoptosis, particularly under genotoxic stress conditions (Kwak2018Serinethreonine). The interaction between STK31 and PDCD5 is essential for the activation of the p53 pathway, as demonstrated by the lack of p53 activation in PDCD5 knockdown cells (Kwak2018Serinethreonine).

In lung cancer, STK31 is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it regulates cell proliferation and the cell cycle. It forms a feedback loop with c-myc, a downstream target of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which directly binds to the STK31 promoter, influencing its expression (Xiong2019STK31).
