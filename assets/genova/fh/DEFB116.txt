# DEFB116

## Overview
DEFB116 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 116, which is part of the defensin family known for their antimicrobial properties. Defensin beta 116 is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide, playing a crucial role in the innate immune system by providing a first line of defense against pathogens. The gene is involved in the body's response to bacterial infections and has been studied for its potential as a biomarker in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections, particularly in respiratory conditions such as pneumonia (Zhou2018Evaluating). Additionally, DEFB116 has been implicated in immune response modulation in the context of viral infections, including COVID-19, where its expression levels may influence clinical outcomes (Bradic2022DNA). The gene's evolutionary significance is also noted in species such as cheetahs, where its pseudogenization may affect fertility and immune function (Peers2024Gene).

## Clinical Significance
DEFB116 has been implicated in various clinical contexts due to its role in the immune response. Alterations in the expression of DEFB116 have been associated with bacterial infections, particularly in the context of pneumonia. A study found that DEFB116 expression levels were positively correlated with the blood load of Acinetobacter baumannii, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in pneumonia patients (Zhou2018Evaluating). This correlation indicates that DEFB116 could be clinically significant in developing diagnostic tools for bacterial infections, especially in influenza-infected patients (Zhou2018Evaluating).

In the context of COVID-19, DEFB116 has been studied for its role in immune response modulation. Differential methylation of DEFB116 was observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients, with hypomethylation linked to increased expression in patients who did not survive. This suggests that DEFB116 may influence clinical outcomes in COVID-19 by affecting immune response pathways (Bradic2022DNA).

In cheetahs, DEFB116 has been identified as a gene with premature termination codons, potentially contributing to defects in male fertility and immunity. This pseudogenization may have implications for understanding genetic challenges in species with low effective population sizes (Peers2024Gene).
