# CCNB1IP1

## Overview
CCNB1IP1 is a human gene that encodes the protein cyclin B1 interacting protein 1, also known as HEI10. This protein is a member of the RING-finger family of ubiquitin ligases and plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G2/M transition. HEI10 facilitates the degradation of cyclin B, thereby ensuring proper cell cycle progression and genomic stability (Yoshida2015An; Singh2007HEI10). Beyond its role in cell cycle control, HEI10 is involved in homologous recombination and DNA repair, processes essential for maintaining genomic integrity during meiosis (Ward2007Mutation). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the tumor suppressor protein Merlin, further implicate it in regulating cell motility and invasion, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer progression (Islam2019Gquadruplex–forming; Singh2007HEI10).

## Structure


## Function
The CCNB1IP1 gene encodes a ubiquitin E3 ligase known as HEI10, which plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G2/M transition. It interacts with cyclin B, promoting its degradation and thereby regulating cell cycle progression (Yoshida2015An; Singh2007HEI10). HEI10 is involved in ensuring accurate chromosomal segregation during meiosis, contributing to genetic stability and fertility (Ward2007Mutation). 

In healthy human cells, CCNB1IP1 is active in the nucleus and is essential for proper chromosomal segregation and genetic stability. It coordinates cell cycle progression with cell migration and invasion by interacting with the tumor suppressor protein Merlin, encoded by the NF2 gene. This interaction negatively regulates cell motility and invasion by inhibiting cyclin B/Cdk1 and other promotility proteins (Singh2007HEI10). 

HEI10 also plays a role in homologous recombination and DNA repair processes, which are crucial for maintaining genomic integrity. Its activity is linked to the regulation of the meiotic cell cycle, particularly during prophase I, ensuring the proper congression of chromosomes and the maintenance of bivalents through chiasmata formation (Ward2007Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
CCNB1IP1, also known as HEI10, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and interaction with other proteins. In metastatic melanoma, CCNB1IP1 is specifically upregulated, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Singh2007HEI10). Conversely, it is underexpressed in breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, indicating that its reduced expression may contribute to tumor development (Yoshida2015An). In kidney and breast tumors, mutations in a functional mutation regulatory element (FMRE) associated with CCNB1IP1 lead to reduced expression, highlighting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Wadi2017Candidate).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), CCNB1IP1 expression is significantly higher in HPV-positive cases compared to HPV-negative ones, suggesting its involvement in HPV-related oncogenesis (Chintala2021High). The gene's expression is also linked to the prognosis and treatment response in these cancers (Chintala2021High). Additionally, CCNB1IP1 is deleted in collecting duct carcinoma, further supporting its role as a tumor suppressor (Zhang2022A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CCNB1IP1 in cancer, with its expression and mutations influencing tumor behavior and patient outcomes.

## Interactions
The human gene CCNB1IP1, also known as HEI10, encodes a RING-finger family ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation through its interactions with various proteins. One of its primary interactions is with cyclin B, where CCNB1IP1 promotes the degradation of cyclin B, thereby regulating the cell cycle progression at the G2/M transition (Yoshida2015An; Singh2007HEI10). This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper cell cycle dynamics and genomic stability.

CCNB1IP1 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein Merlin, encoded by the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene. This interaction suggests a role for CCNB1IP1 in cell migration and metastasis, as it negatively regulates cell motility and invasion by inhibiting cyclin B/Cdk1 and other pro-motility proteins (Islam2019Gquadruplex–forming; Singh2007HEI10).

In addition to protein interactions, CCNB1IP1 is involved in the regulation of its own enhancer through G-quadruplex (G4) structures. These structures, formed by GGA-rich regions, act as negative regulators of the CCNB1IP1 enhancer, influencing its transcriptional activity (Islam2019Gquadruplex–forming). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CCNB1IP1 in cellular processes.
