# DNAH10

## Overview
DNAH10 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein axonemal heavy chain 10, which is a critical component of the axonemal dynein complex. This protein functions as a motor protein within the inner arm dynein motor of motile cilia and flagella, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes that require ciliary and flagellar movement, such as respiratory tract clearance, sperm motility, and embryonic development (Maiti2000Identification; Wang2020Rare). The DNAH10 gene is expressed in ciliated tissues, underscoring its importance in maintaining proper fluid movement across epithelial surfaces (Maiti2000Identification). Mutations in DNAH10 have been linked to clinical conditions such as primary male infertility and heterotaxy syndrome, highlighting its significance in human health and development (Tu2021Biallelic; Liu2018Rare).

## Function
DNAH10 encodes a protein that is a component of the axonemal dynein complex, which plays a crucial role in the motility of cilia and flagella. This protein functions as a motor protein, converting chemical energy from ATP into mechanical work, facilitating the sliding of microtubules within cilia and flagella. This activity is essential for processes such as respiratory tract clearance, sperm motility, and embryonic development (Maiti2000Identification).

In healthy human cells, DNAH10 is involved in the function of motile cilia, which are essential for maintaining proper fluid movement across epithelial surfaces. The axonemal dyneins, including DNAH10, are responsible for the movement of cilia and flagella, which are critical for various cellular processes (Maiti2000Identification). DNAH10 is part of the inner arm dynein motor of motile cilia, contributing to the motility and stability of these structures (Wang2020Rare).

The gene is expressed in ciliated tissues, indicating its role in the function of cilia and flagella in cells (Maiti2000Identification). DNAH10's proper function is vital for maintaining cellular and organismal health, as it ensures the effective operation of ciliary and flagellar movement, which is crucial for various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH10 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting male fertility and organ positioning. Bi-allelic mutations in DNAH10 have been linked to primary male infertility characterized by asthenoteratozoospermia, a condition marked by reduced sperm motility and multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF). These mutations result in significant defects in sperm flagellar structure, including the absence of inner dynein arms, leading to immotile sperm and infertility (Tu2021Biallelic).

DNAH10 mutations have also been implicated in heterotaxy syndrome, a disorder involving abnormal left-right body patterning and congenital heart defects. Copy number variants (CNVs) in DNAH10 have been identified in patients with heterotaxy syndrome, suggesting a role in left-right patterning during development. Functional studies in zebrafish have shown that DNAH10 knockdown disrupts cardiac looping, further supporting its involvement in this condition (Liu2018Rare).

Additionally, DNAH10 variants have been studied in the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, although the evidence is less conclusive. A specific variant in DNAH10 was identified in a Norwegian family with intermediate CMT, but its pathogenic role remains uncertain (Braathen2015Variants).

## Interactions
DNAH10 is a component of the axonemal dynein complex, which plays a crucial role in the motility of cilia and flagella. It is involved in the assembly and function of the axoneme, the structural core of these organelles. DNAH10 interacts with other inner dynein arm (IDA) components, such as DNAH2 and DNAH6, as evidenced by reduced staining intensity of these proteins in spermatozoa from individuals with DNAH10 mutations (Tu2021Biallelic). STRING analysis suggests that DNAH10 is highly connected with multiple cytoplasmic dynein 1 components, including DYNLL1 and DYNC1LI2, as well as structural components of the axoneme like DNAH12, DNAI1, and CFAP46 (Tu2021Biallelic). These interactions are essential for intra-flagella and intra-machette protein transport, which are critical for sperm head shaping and protein transport into the tail (Tu2021Biallelic). Despite these findings, specific physical interactions of DNAH10 with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies, leaving some aspects of its interaction network unclear (Tu2021Biallelic).
