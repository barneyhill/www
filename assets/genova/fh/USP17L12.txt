# USP17L12

## Overview
USP17L12 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 12, which is part of the ubiquitin-specific peptidase family. This protein functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme, playing a critical role in the regulation of protein homeostasis by removing ubiquitin from target proteins. This activity is essential for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, signaling, and regulation, thereby influencing cell cycle regulation and immune response modulation. USP17L12 is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of healthy human cells, where it participates in key molecular pathways by modulating the availability and activity of proteins. The gene is notably one of the most strongly regulated among protein-coding genes in the ubiquitin-specific peptidase family, highlighting its significant role in processes such as chromatin assembly and protein targeting to the Golgi, which are crucial for cellular function and organismal development (Nikitin2018Profiling).

## Function
USP17L12, a member of the ubiquitin-specific peptidase family, plays a significant role in the regulation of protein homeostasis through its deubiquitination activity. This process involves the removal of ubiquitin from proteins, which is crucial for their degradation, signaling, and regulation. The deubiquitination activity of USP17L12 is essential for maintaining protein stability and function within the cell, impacting various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and immune response modulation (Nikitin2018Profiling).

In healthy human cells, USP17L12 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it influences molecular pathways by regulating the availability and activity of proteins involved in these pathways. The gene is one of the most strongly regulated protein-coding genes in the context of ubiquitin-specific peptidases, indicating its significant role in cellular processes such as chromatin assembly and protein targeting to the Golgi (Nikitin2018Profiling). The regulation of these processes is vital for proper cell function and organismal development, as they are linked to immunity, response to pathogens, and organ development. The activity of USP17L12 in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and physiological homeostasis.
