# RBX1

## Overview
RBX1 is a gene that encodes the protein ring-box 1, a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is involved in protein degradation. The protein is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, specifically functioning within the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complexes. Ring-box 1 contains a RING finger domain, which is essential for its role in facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to substrate proteins, thereby marking them for degradation. This process is vital for regulating various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcription. RBX1 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is involved in several cellular pathways, including those related to cancer progression and immune regulation. Its interactions with cullin proteins and other components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders (Kamura1999Rbx1; Zheng2002Structure; Xu2023RBX1).

## Structure
RBX1, also known as ring-box 1, is a protein that plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system as part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The protein contains a RING finger domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity. This domain is characterized by a variant RING motif that includes a 20-residue insertion forming an additional zinc-binding site, unique to RBX1 and its orthologues (Zheng2002Structure). The RING domain is stabilized by two zinc ions and is crucial for binding the E2 enzyme, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins (Zheng2002Structure).

RBX1's structure includes an N-terminal β-strand and a C-terminal core domain that coordinates three zinc ions. The β-strand of RBX1 inserts itself between the β-strands of the CUL1's globular domain, forming a stable intermolecular β-sheet (Rusnac2020Structural). The RING domain is hosted by the C-terminal region of CUL1 through a loose interface, allowing for flexibility, which is important for the ubiquitination process (Rusnac2020Structural).

RBX1 is involved in forming complexes with cullin proteins, such as CUL1 and CUL7, contributing to the quaternary structure of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) (Hopf2022Structure). The interaction with cullins is crucial for the recruitment of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and the structural integrity of these complexes is vital for their function (Zheng2002Structure). Neddylation, a post-translational modification involving the attachment of NEDD8, regulates the activity of CRLs by altering the conformation of the cullin scaffold, which affects the positioning of the RBX1 RING domain (Rusnac2020Structural).

## Function
RBX1, also known as ROC1, is a crucial component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a significant role in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins. This process is essential for regulating various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcription (Kamura1999Rbx1). RBX1 is involved in the ubiquitination of short-lived proteins such as cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, and signal transducers, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and preventing the accumulation of proteins that could impede cell growth and division (Jia2009RBX1ROC1SCF).

In healthy cells, RBX1 is ubiquitously expressed and is particularly abundant in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and placenta (Jia2009RBX1ROC1SCF). It functions by binding to the C-terminus of cullin proteins and an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrates recognized by F-box proteins (Jia2009RBX1ROC1SCF). This activity is crucial for the degradation of proteins like the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1, which is necessary for the G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle (Kamura1999Rbx1).

RBX1 is also a component of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor complex, linking it to transcriptional elongation and ubiquitination processes (Kamura1999Rbx1). Its role in these complexes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

## Clinical Significance
RBX1 (ring-box 1) is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels. In esophageal cancer, high RBX1 expression is associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor features, and lower overall survival rates. It is an independent predictor of overall survival and is linked to increased postoperative recurrence, particularly lymph node recurrence (Kunishige2020Ring). In gastric cancer, RBX1 overexpression correlates with worse postoperative outcomes, including lower 5-year overall survival and relapse-free survival rates. It is also associated with tumor progression markers such as distant metastasis and venous invasion (Migita2013Prognostic).

RBX1 is also overexpressed in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), where it promotes metastasis and aerobic glycolysis, contributing to poor prognosis. It facilitates these processes by degrading the SMAR1/HDAC6 complex, which is crucial for cancer cell metabolism and progression (Xu2023RBX1). In regulatory T cells, RBX1 is essential for maintaining immune regulation. Its deletion leads to severe autoimmune phenotypes, highlighting its role in preventing autoimmune diseases (Wu2022The). These findings suggest that RBX1 could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers and autoimmune disorders.

## Interactions
RBX1, also known as ring-box 1, is a key component of several E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, where it plays a crucial role in protein ubiquitination. It interacts with various cullin proteins, forming part of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) complex, which is essential for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. RBX1 interacts with Cullin1, facilitating the ubiquitination of substrates like the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1, which is critical for cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase (Kamura1999Rbx1).

RBX1 is also a component of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor complex, interacting with Cullin2 and the Elongin BC complex. This interaction is important for the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factors, such as HIF-2α, through the Cul2-RBX1 pathway (Kamura2004VHLbox). The protein's RING finger domain is crucial for its interaction with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins (Zheng2002Structure).

In the context of triple-negative breast cancer, RBX1 interacts with FBXO45, promoting its degradation and thereby modulating the expression of TWIST1, a key transcription factor involved in metastasis (Shao2022E3). This interaction highlights RBX1's role in cancer progression by regulating protein stability through the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
