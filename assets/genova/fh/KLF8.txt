# KLF8

## Overview
KLF8 is a gene that encodes the KLF transcription factor 8, a member of the Krüppel-like factor family, which is characterized by the presence of three C2H2 zinc finger domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. KLF8 functions primarily as a transcription factor, modulating the expression of genes involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and differentiation. The protein's activity is regulated through various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, sumoylation, and acetylation, which influence its stability and transcriptional activity. KLF8 is implicated in the progression of several cancers, where it promotes tumor growth and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Wei2006Sumoylation; Li2010Upregulation; Kumar2021The).

## Structure
KLF8 is a protein encoded by the KLF8 gene, consisting of 359 amino acid residues and characterized by a modular structure. The primary structure includes a proline-rich region and a Pro-Val-Asp-Leu-Ser/Thr (PVDLS) motif, which is crucial for interaction with the C-terminal Binding Protein (CtBP) repressor (Vliet2000Human; Kumar2021The). The secondary structure involves three C2H2 zinc finger domains located at the C-terminus, which are essential for DNA binding and recognizing CACCC elements (Vliet2000Human; Kumar2021The). These zinc fingers are highly conserved and share similarity with other members of the Krüppel-like factor family (Vliet2000Human).

The protein also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the zinc finger domain and a novel NLS in the N-terminal activation domain between amino acids 151-200, which are important for nuclear transport (Rodríguez2009The). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation by ERK2 at serine 48 and sumoylation at lysine 67 regulate KLF8's stability and transcriptional activity (Kumar2021The). Acetylation at lysine 67 can inhibit sumoylation, affecting its interaction with CtBP and cell cycle regulation (Kumar2021The). KLF8 has splice variant isoforms that may differ in function and localization, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
KLF8 (Kruppel-like factor 8) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, differentiation, and development. KLF8 functions by binding to CACCC elements in DNA, where it can act as either a transcriptional activator or repressor, depending on the context and target promoters (Wei2006Sumoylation; Vliet2000Human).

In the cell cycle, KLF8 is known to activate the cyclin D1 promoter, which is crucial for cell cycle progression at the G1 phase. This activation is consistent with its role in stimulating cell proliferation (Wei2006Sumoylation; Mehta2009A). KLF8's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as sumoylation, which decreases its transcriptional activity on targets like cyclin D1 and KLF4, thereby influencing cell cycle regulation (Wei2006Sumoylation).

KLF8 is active in the nucleus, where its localization is regulated by two nuclear localization signals (NLSs). These signals are essential for its nuclear import and subsequent transcriptional activity (Mehta2009A). The regulation of KLF8's nuclear localization and transcriptional activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oncogenic transformation (Mehta2009A).

## Clinical Significance
KLF8 is implicated in the progression and metastasis of several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer. In HCC, KLF8 overexpression is associated with increased tumor growth, metastasis, and poor prognosis. It promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer invasion and metastasis, by up-regulating mesenchymal markers and down-regulating E-cadherin (Li2010Upregulation). In gastric cancer, KLF8 is linked to poor survival outcomes and is involved in metabolic reprogramming by targeting GLUT4, enhancing glycolysis and promoting tumorigenesis (Mao2019KLF8).

In breast cancer, KLF8 promotes invasion and metastasis by activating MMP9, a matrix metalloproteinase involved in extracellular matrix degradation, which is essential for cancer cell migration (Wang2010KLF8). In lung cancer, KLF8 enhances tumor growth by regulating the expression of JMJD2A, a histone demethylase, and influencing cell cycle progression (Ma2019KLF8).

KLF8 also contributes to chemotherapy resistance, particularly in glioma, by activating the β-catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with increased drug resistance (Kumar2021The). These findings suggest that KLF8 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers due to its role in promoting tumor progression and resistance to treatment.

## Interactions
KLF8 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It is known to associate with the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), a co-repressor, through a Pro-Val-Asp-Leu-Ser motif, which is crucial for its transcriptional repression activity (Vliet2000Human). This interaction is essential for KLF8's ability to repress transcription by binding to CACCC-box elements in DNA (Vliet2000Human).

KLF8 is also sumoylated, primarily at lysine 67, a modification that negatively regulates its transcriptional activity. This sumoylation is mediated by interactions with SUMO E3 ligases such as PIAS1, PIASy, and PIASxα (Wei2006Sumoylation; Kumar2021The). Despite this modification, sumoylation does not affect KLF8's nuclear localization or its ability to bind DNA (Wei2006Sumoylation).

KLF8 also interacts with importin-β, a nuclear import receptor, which is necessary for its nuclear localization. This interaction requires the zinc finger motif of KLF8 (Mehta2009A). These interactions highlight KLF8's role in regulating gene expression and its involvement in cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and cancer metastasis.
