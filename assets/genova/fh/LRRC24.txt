# LRRC24

## Overview
LRRC24 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 24, which is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. These proteins are characterized by their involvement in protein-protein interactions, often playing critical roles in cellular communication and signaling pathways. The LRRC24 protein is particularly significant in the nervous system, where it interacts with other proteins such as the Robo2 receptor, suggesting a role in neural recognition and signaling processes (Söllner2009A). This interaction is part of a complex network of LRR and immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) proteins, which are essential for neurodevelopment and the mapping of neural intercellular recognition (Söllner2009A). Understanding the function and interactions of LRRC24 is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying brain development and function, as well as potential implications in neurological disorders (Söllner2009A).

## Interactions
LRRC24 is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly within the nervous system. In zebrafish, LRRC24 has been identified as a binding partner for the Robo2 receptor. This interaction suggests that LRRC24 may play a role in neural recognition processes by responding to local membrane-tethered signals, in addition to secreted ligands like Slit proteins (Söllner2009A). The study by Söllner and Wright highlights the importance of these interactions in understanding the complex network of neural leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors, which are crucial for brain development and function (Söllner2009A).

The interaction between LRRC24 and Robo2 is part of a broader network of LRR and immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) proteins, which includes both homophilic and heterophilic interactions. This network is essential for mapping neural intercellular recognition and understanding the roles of these proteins in neurodevelopment and neurological disorders (Söllner2009A). The identification of LRRC24 as a binding partner for Robo2 underscores its potential involvement in neural signaling pathways and its significance in the broader context of LRR receptor interactions.
