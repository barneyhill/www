# ATG5

## Overview
ATG5 is a gene that encodes the autophagy-related protein 5, a crucial component in the cellular process of autophagy. This protein is integral to the formation of autophagosomes, which are specialized structures that sequester and degrade cellular components, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and quality control. Autophagy-related protein 5 is categorized as a ubiquitin-like protein, and it forms a complex with ATG12 and ATG16L1, which is essential for the elongation of the autophagosome membrane (Pua2006A; Mai2012Autophagy). Beyond its role in autophagy, ATG5 is involved in various cellular processes, including mitophagy, immune cell survival, and proliferation, as well as interactions with other proteins that suggest additional regulatory functions (Kim2014Insights; GomezPuerto2016Autophagy). Mutations and alterations in the ATG5 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Kim2016Mutation; Xu2021Comprehensive).

## Structure
The ATG5 protein is characterized by its structural components, which include two ubiquitin-fold domains (UFD-1 and UFD-2) and a helix-rich (HR) domain situated between them. These domains are analogous to the ubiquitin-like domains A and B (UblA and UblB) found in yeast Atg5. The UFDs of human ATG5 exhibit structural similarity to ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like structures, with a total of 9 α-helices and 7 β-strands forming the ATG5 structure, measuring approximately 65 × 45 × 45 Å (Kim2014Insights). The HR domain contains 4 α-helices, and the UFDs are composed of 3 or 4 β-strands flanked by 2 α-helices (Kim2014Insights).

ATG5 forms a complex with ATG12 and ATG16L1, which is crucial for autophagosome formation. The ATG12~ATG5 conjugate exhibits E3 ligase-like activity, facilitating the lipidation of LC3 family members (Otomo2012Structure). The conjugation site for ATG12 is located at Lys130 on ATG5, which is essential for its function in autophagy (Otomo2012Structure). The ATG5-ATG16 complex forms a crystallographic homodimer, while the ATG5-TECAIR complex behaves as a monomer in solution (Kim2014Insights).

ATG5 is also involved in noncovalent interactions with other proteins, such as TECPR1, which suggests a regulatory role in lipid binding during autophagosome maturation (Kim2014Insights). The protein's quaternary structure is influenced by its interaction partners, with ATG16N69 promoting dimerization (Kim2014Insights).

## Function
The ATG5 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the autophagy process, a critical cellular mechanism for degrading and recycling cellular components. ATG5 is involved in the formation of autophagosomes, which are double-membrane vesicles that encapsulate cellular components for degradation. It forms a complex with ATG12 and ATG16L1, facilitating the elongation of the autophagosome membrane, a key step in autophagosome formation (Pua2006A; Mai2012Autophagy).

In healthy human cells, ATG5 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and quality control. It is involved in mitophagy, the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. This process helps in reducing oxidative stress and extending cellular lifespan by improving mitochondrial fitness and membrane potential (Mai2012Autophagy).

ATG5 is also critical for the survival and proliferation of T lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). In T cells, ATG5 is necessary for their survival and proliferation, as its deficiency leads to increased cell death and impaired proliferation (Pua2006A). In HSPCs, ATG5 supports cell proliferation and prevents apoptosis, likely by managing reactive oxygen species levels (GomezPuerto2016Autophagy).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATG5 gene are linked to various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance. In childhood ataxia, a homozygous missense mutation (E122D) in ATG5 impairs its conjugation with ATG12, leading to reduced autophagy and contributing to symptoms such as developmental delay and movement disorders (Kim2016Mutation). In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATG5, such as rs6937876 and rs548234, are associated with altered expression levels and defective apoptotic cell clearance, which are implicated in the disease's pathogenesis (Ye2018Exploring; Fraiberg2020Genetic).

ATG5 expression is also linked to cancer, where it is associated with tumor metabolism and immune escape. High ATG5 expression correlates with poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast cancer and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and is involved in regulating immune checkpoint genes and tumor microenvironment (Xu2021Comprehensive). In autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, elevated ATG5 expression is observed in T cells, suggesting a role in immune regulation and disease progression (Alirezaei2009Elevated). These findings underscore the importance of ATG5 in various pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ATG5 is a key protein involved in autophagy, primarily through its role in forming the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex, which is essential for autophagosome formation. This complex acts as an E3-like enzyme to catalyze the conjugation of LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine on the phagophore membrane, a critical step in autophagosome maturation (Kim2014Insights; Wible2019ATG5). ATG5 interacts with ATG16L1 through a binding pocket formed by its N- and C-termini, which is crucial for the conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5, stabilizing both proteins (Wible2019ATG5).

ATG5 also interacts with ATG16L2 and TECPR1, which can compete with ATG16L1 for binding to ATG5. These interactions can inhibit autophagy by preventing the formation of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex (Kim2014Insights; Wible2019ATG5). In Arabidopsis, ATG5 interacts with proteins involved in endomembrane trafficking, such as SAR1B, SAR1C, and SEC24C, and with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, suggesting roles beyond autophagy (Elander2023Interactome). Additionally, ATG5 has been shown to interact with nuclear pore complex components, indicating potential involvement in nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling (Elander2023Interactome).
