# TMEM109

## Overview
TMEM109 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 109, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cellular responses to DNA damage. TMEM109 has been studied for its role in cancer biology, where it is often overexpressed in certain types of tumors, such as pancreatic and breast cancers, suggesting its potential utility as a biomarker for these malignancies (da2013The; Takenami2019Novel; Gkountakos2023Extrahepatic). Additionally, TMEM109 has been implicated in genetic disorders like neurofibromatosis type 1, where it may act as a genetic modifier influencing disease severity (Pemov2014Genetic). The protein's involvement in protecting cells from ultraviolet C-induced damage further underscores its significance in cellular defense mechanisms (Cheng2021Computational).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMEM109 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression or interactions. In the context of cancer, TMEM109 is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic head cancer (PHC), suggesting its potential as a biomarker for distinguishing these cancers from distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA) (Takenami2019Novel; Gkountakos2023Extrahepatic). The gene is also overexpressed in breast tumors, where it interacts with TRAF family members involved in signal transduction pathways affecting cell survival and apoptosis (da2013The).

In neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), TMEM109 has been associated with the presence of Lisch nodules, a phenotypic feature of the disorder, indicating its role as a genetic modifier influencing disease severity (Pemov2014Genetic). Additionally, TMEM109 is involved in cellular responses to DNA damage, specifically protecting against ultraviolet C-induced cell death, which may have implications for its role in cancer and other conditions related to DNA damage response (Cheng2021Computational).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TMEM109 in various cancers and genetic disorders, although further research is needed to fully understand its role and potential as a therapeutic target.
