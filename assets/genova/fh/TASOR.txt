# TASOR

## Overview
TASOR is a gene that encodes the transcription activation suppressor protein, a key component of the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex, which is involved in epigenetic regulation and genomic stability. The protein is characterized by its modular domain architecture, including a catalytically inactive poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) domain, which plays a crucial role in the repression of transposable elements and certain genes despite its lack of enzymatic activity (Douse2020TASOR). TASOR functions as a pseudo-PARP and is essential for the deposition of the H3K9me3 histone mark, a modification associated with transcriptional repression (Douse2020TASOR). Through its interactions with other HUSH components, such as MPP8 and Periphilin, TASOR facilitates the maintenance of genomic integrity and regulates cellular differentiation processes (Douse2020TASOR). Its role in the HUSH complex is critical for the repression of both exogenous and endogenous genetic elements, including retrotransposons and specific genes, thereby contributing to the stability of the genome (Douse2020TASOR).

## Structure
TASOR is a 1670-amino acid nuclear protein that serves as a central component of the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex, involved in epigenetic repression. The protein is characterized by a modular domain architecture, including a catalytically inactive poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) domain, which is critical for its function in epigenetic regulation despite its lack of catalytic activity (Douse2020TASOR). This domain is structurally similar to other PARP domains but lacks the NAD+ binding site, rendering it inactive (Douse2020TASOR).

TASOR contains several domains, including DUF3715, SPOC, and DomI, which are essential for the repression activity of the HUSH complex (Douse2020TASOR). The SPOC domain is a beta-barrel structure located between residues 350-505, adjacent to DUF3715 (Douse2020TASOR). The DomI domain, spanning residues 525-633, is crucial for binding to MPP8, while the SPOC domain stabilizes this interaction (Douse2020TASOR). The C-terminal region, although highly conserved, is not required for transgene repression (Douse2020TASOR).

TASOR's pseudo-PARP domain binds to short ssRNA ligands with micromolar affinity, primarily through electrostatic interactions (Douse2020TASOR). The protein also undergoes phosphorylation at threonine 819, a modification that occurs during mitosis but is independent of its ability to repress viral expression (Vauthier2022HUSHmediated).

## Function
The TASOR gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the HUSH (Human Silencing Hub) complex, which plays a crucial role in epigenetic regulation and transposon control in human cells. TASOR is involved in the regulation of H3K9me3, a histone modification associated with transcriptional repression, over LINE-1 (L1) elements and repetitive exons (Douse2020TASOR). It acts as an assembly platform for other HUSH components, such as MPP8 and Periphilin, facilitating the deposition of the H3K9me3 mark, which is essential for transcriptional repression and maintaining genomic stability (Douse2020TASOR).

TASOR functions as a pseudo-PARP, a catalytically inactive poly-ADP ribose polymerase, which is necessary for the targeted deposition of H3K9me3 (Douse2020TASOR). Despite its lack of catalytic activity, TASOR is crucial for the repression of transposable elements and certain genes, contributing to the maintenance of genome integrity (Douse2020TASOR). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it helps maintain genomic stability and regulate cellular differentiation processes (Douse2020TASOR). TASOR's role in the HUSH complex is critical for the repression of both exogenous and endogenous genetic elements, including retrotransposons and specific genes (Douse2020TASOR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the TASOR gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of genomic stability and disease states. TASOR is a component of the HUSH complex, which is crucial for the repression of transposable elements and the maintenance of genomic integrity. Mutations in TASOR, such as the Y305A mutation, disrupt its function, leading to a loss of H3K9me3 deposition and transgene repression, which can result in genome instability (Douse2020TASOR). This instability is associated with increased DNA damage and replication stress, potentially contributing to developmental issues and diseases characterized by genomic instability (PinzonArteaga2024TASOR).

In embryonic stem cells, TASOR is essential for silencing LINE-1 retrotransposons and maintaining chromatin organization. Loss of TASOR leads to increased LINE-1 RNA stability and dysregulation, triggering innate immune responses and programmed cell death during critical developmental transitions (PinzonArteaga2024TASOR). This dysregulation can impede the transition from naïve pluripotency, resulting in apoptosis and a DNA damage response, which may contribute to developmental defects (PinzonArteaga2024TASOR).

TASOR also plays a role in HIV latency by repressing viral RNA transcription, suggesting its potential involvement in maintaining latent HIV reservoirs (Matkovic2022TASOR). Disruptions in TASOR function could therefore impact both developmental processes and immune responses, linking to conditions involving genomic instability or immune dysregulation.

## Interactions
TASOR, a central component of the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to perform its functions in gene regulation. Within the HUSH complex, TASOR serves as an assembly platform for other subunits, including MPP8 and Periphilin. The interaction between TASOR and MPP8 is mediated by the DomI domain, while the SPOC domain stabilizes this interaction. The minimal binding site for TASOR on MPP8 is located between residues 500-560, and the Periphilin binding site on TASOR is between residues 1000-1085 (Douse2020TASOR).

TASOR also interacts with the CCR4-NOT complex scaffold protein CNOT1, which is involved in RNA degradation pathways. This interaction is RNA-dependent and is facilitated by TASOR's PARP domain. TASOR and CNOT1 cooperate to repress HIV-1 expression by destabilizing LTR-driven transcripts, acting at post-transcriptional levels (Matkovic2022TASOR).

Additionally, TASOR interacts with several RNA degradation factors, including MTR4, EXOSC10, and YTHDF2, forming a platform that recruits these factors to RNA polymerase II during transcription elongation. These interactions are crucial for TASOR's role in RNA degradation and gene expression regulation (Matkovic2022TASOR).
