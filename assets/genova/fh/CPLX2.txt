# CPLX2

## Overview
CPLX2 is a gene that encodes the protein complexin 2, which is a crucial component in the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Complexin 2 is a cytosolic protein that interacts with the SNARE complex, playing a pivotal role in neurotransmitter release at synapses. It is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes an N-terminal domain, an accessory α helix, a central α helix, and a C-terminal domain, each contributing to its function in synaptic transmission (Meyer2024Characterization; Raevskaya2005Structural). The protein is predominantly expressed in the presynaptic terminals of neurons in brain regions associated with cognitive and emotional functions, such as the hippocampus and cortex (Glynn2010Clorgylinemediated). Alterations in CPLX2 expression and function have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal synaptic function and its potential as a therapeutic target (Glynn2010Clorgylinemediated; Hass2014Complexin2).

## Structure
The CPLX2 gene encodes the complexin 2 protein, which is involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. The protein consists of 134 amino acids and is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes an N-terminal domain, an accessory α helix, a central α helix, and a C-terminal domain (Meyer2024Characterization; Raevskaya2005Structural). The central α helix is crucial for binding to the SNARE complex, facilitating interactions through conserved amino acids that form salt bridges, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds with SNARE components (Meyer2024Characterization). The N-terminus is thought to activate vesicle fusion, while the accessory helix inhibits synaptic vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. The C-terminus inhibits spontaneous fusion and may play a role in vesicle priming (Meyer2024Characterization).

CPLX2 is expressed as two transcript variants with different 5' untranslated regions, which may affect mRNA stability and translational efficiency (Raevskaya2005Structural). These variants are governed by two alternative promoters, both lacking canonical TATA boxes, leading to multiple transcription start sites (Raevskaya2005Structural). The 3' UTRs of CPLX2 transcripts lack the canonical polyadenylation site but contain a hexanucleotide AAGAAA, which may play a role in polyadenylation (Raevskaya2005Structural).

## Function
Complexin 2 (CPLX2) is a protein that plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, a process essential for neurotransmitter release at synapses. CPLX2 functions by binding to the SNARE complex, stabilizing it in a 'super-primed' state, which facilitates rapid neurotransmitter release upon receiving a calcium signal (Brose2008For; Glynn2010Clorgylinemediated). This stabilization is crucial for normal synaptic transmission and plasticity, which are important for cognitive functions and emotional behaviors (Glynn2010Clorgylinemediated).

CPLX2 is predominantly active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, particularly in brain regions such as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdaloid nuclei, and cortex, which are involved in learning, memory, and emotional regulation (Glynn2010Clorgylinemediated). It is enriched in axospinal and axodendritic presynaptic terminals, which are mostly excitatory glutamatergic (Brose2008For).

In CPLX2 knockout models, there is a decrease in the immediately releasable pool of vesicles and an increase in asynchronous release, indicating that CPLX2 is crucial for maintaining vesicle proximity to voltage-gated calcium channels and synchronizing vesicle release (Lin2013Complexin). This protein is also involved in regulating the energy barrier for vesicle fusion, acting as both a facilitator and an inhibitor of vesicle fusion depending on the context (Trimbuch2016Should).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CPLX2 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CPLX2 gene are associated with cognitive impairments and altered neural activity in brain regions related to working memory, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus (Begemann2010Modification; Hass2014Complexin2). These genetic variants may influence cognitive performance by affecting synaptic signaling and plasticity, which are crucial for cognitive processes (Begemann2010Modification).

CPLX2 expression is also downregulated in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and bipolar disorder. This downregulation is linked to cognitive deficits and synaptic dysfunction (Glynn2010Clorgylinemediated). In CPLX2 knockout mice, the absence of this gene leads to cognitive and synaptic plasticity abnormalities, as well as depressive-like behaviors, which can be partially reversed by pharmacological treatment (Glynn2010Clorgylinemediated).

In glioma, a type of brain tumor, CPLX2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is decreased in glioma tissues, and lower levels are associated with higher tumor grades and poorer prognosis. Overexpression of CPLX2 in glioma cells inhibits tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Chen2024CPLX2).

## Interactions
Complexin 2 (CPLX2) is known for its interactions with the SNARE protein complex, which is crucial for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. CPLX2 binds tightly to the assembled neuronal SNARE complex, which includes proteins such as Syntaxin 1 (Stx1), SNAP25, and Synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP2) (Meyer2024Characterization). This binding is essential for regulating neurotransmitter release by modulating the assembly and disassembly of SNARE complexes. CPLX2's interaction with the SNARE complex prevents premature membrane fusion, and it is released upon calcium influx, allowing fusion to proceed (Tsuru2019Complexin).

In addition to its role in synaptic systems, CPLX2 is involved in other cellular processes. It has been implicated in the endosomal recycling pathway, influencing membrane fusion events related to transferrin uptake in HeLa cells (Meyer2024Characterization). CPLX2 interacts with various SNARE proteins, including Stx12, Stx6, Stx16, vti1a, and VAMP4, although the exact composition of these SNARE complexes remains undetermined (Meyer2024Characterization). These interactions suggest that CPLX2 may have broader roles beyond synaptic exocytosis, potentially affecting other membrane fusion processes.
