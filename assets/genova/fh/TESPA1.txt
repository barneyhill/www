# TESPA1

## Overview
TESPA1 is a gene that encodes the protein thymocyte expressed, positive selection associated 1, which functions as an adaptor protein primarily involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. The TESPA1 protein plays a critical role in the immune system by facilitating calcium signaling, which is essential for T cell development and function. It achieves this by interacting with key proteins such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1) and phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-γ1), thereby enhancing calcium flux and activating downstream signaling pathways necessary for T cell activation and cytokine expression. TESPA1 is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm, where it contributes to immune homeostasis. Its deficiency can lead to impaired thymocyte development and reduced numbers of mature T cells, underscoring its importance in immune function (Liang2017Tespa1).

## Function
TESPA1 is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for T cell receptor (TCR)-induced calcium signaling, which is essential for T cell development and function. The TESPA1 protein interacts with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1), facilitating its recruitment to the TCR complex. This interaction is vital for optimal calcium flux, which is necessary for the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as the MAPK and Ca2+-NFAT pathways, crucial for T cell activation and cytokine expression (Liang2017Tespa1).

TESPA1 acts as an adaptor protein, linking phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-γ1) to IP3R1, thereby enhancing the phosphorylation of IP3R1 and boosting calcium signaling at the TCR-proximal region. This process is critical for the positive selection and maturation of thymocytes into CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Liang2017Tespa1). TESPA1 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm, where it regulates calcium mobilization and contributes to immune system homeostasis (Liang2017Tespa1). Deficiency in TESPA1 leads to impaired thymocyte development and reduced numbers of mature T cells, highlighting its essential role in immune function (Liang2017Tespa1).

## Clinical Significance
TESPA1 is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in immune system regulation and cancer. In autoimmune diseases, TESPA1 is associated with rheumatoid arthritis, where its deficiency leads to reduced disease severity in models of collagen-induced arthritis. This suggests TESPA1's involvement in B cell activation and its potential as a therapeutic target for autoimmune conditions (Yao2018Tespa1).

In cancer, TESPA1 expression levels and genetic alterations have significant prognostic implications. High TESPA1 expression is linked to better survival outcomes in certain cancers, such as lung adenocarcinoma and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, while it correlates with poorer outcomes in others, like kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma and blood cancers (Liu2022PanCancer). TESPA1 mutations, such as the R184Q missense mutation, are prevalent in cancers like skin cutaneous melanoma and adrenocortical carcinoma, affecting patient prognosis (Liu2022PanCancer).

TESPA1 also plays a role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is essential for leukemic stem cell maintenance. Its interaction with CSN6 to inhibit c-Myc degradation is crucial for AML cell growth, making it a potential target for AML treatment (Lu2023Tespa1). These findings highlight TESPA1's clinical significance in both autoimmune diseases and cancer.

## Interactions
TESPA1 is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It interacts directly with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1) upon TCR stimulation, which is essential for TCR-induced calcium flux and thymocyte development. TESPA1 recruits IP3R1 to the TCR complex, where IP3R1 is phosphorylated by Fyn kinase, enhancing its affinity for IP3 and reducing its Ca2+-dependent inactivation (Liang2017Tespa1). This interaction is mediated by specific residues in TESPA1 and the amino-terminus of IP3R1, and mutations in TESPA1 that disrupt this interaction result in impaired thymocyte development (Liang2017Tespa1).

TESPA1 also interacts with phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC-γ1), a key component of the LAT signalosome, facilitating TCR-induced calcium signaling (Liang2017Tespa1). It binds to the X/Y catalytic domain of PLC-γ1, and this interaction is enhanced when certain domains of PLC-γ1 are deleted (Liang2017Tespa1). TESPA1 acts as an adaptor protein, linking PLC-γ1 and IP3R1, which is crucial for the phosphorylation of IP3R1 and the full activation of the calcium signal (Liang2017Tespa1). These interactions are vital for the activation of the TCR-induced calcium-NFAT signaling pathway and ERK activation (Liang2017Tespa1).
