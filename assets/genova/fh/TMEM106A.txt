# TMEM106A

## Overview
TMEM106A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 106A, a type II transmembrane protein involved in immune regulation and antiviral defense. This protein is predominantly expressed in macrophages and plays a critical role in modulating inflammatory responses through the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Zhang2020Inactivation). TMEM106A is also recognized as an interferon-stimulated gene, essential for optimal antiviral activity against viruses such as Enterovirus A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 by blocking their interaction with the SCARB2 receptor (Guo2022Type). Additionally, TMEM106A has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression is reduced in certain cancers, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Zhang2020Inactivation).

## Function
TMEM106A is a type II transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in regulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is highly expressed in macrophages and is involved in modulating inflammatory responses through the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, TMEM106A helps maintain immune homeostasis by inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses, which is crucial for preventing conditions like septic shock or autoimmune diseases (Zhang2020Inactivation).

TMEM106A is also identified as an interferon-stimulated gene, upregulated upon type I interferon treatment, and is necessary for optimal interferon-mediated antiviral activity. It specifically blocks SCARB2-mediated viral infections, such as those caused by Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), by creating steric hindrance that prevents virus binding to the SCARB2 receptor (Guo2022Type).

The protein is located on the cell membrane, where it regulates macrophage polarization towards the M1 phenotype, associated with pro-inflammatory responses. TMEM106A's extracellular region, when anchored to the plasma membrane, is sufficient to inhibit virus infection, highlighting its role in immune defense mechanisms (Guo2022Type).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMEM106A gene have been linked to various inflammatory and infectious diseases. In the context of inflammation, TMEM106A is highly expressed in macrophages and plays a regulatory role in inflammatory responses. Inactivation of TMEM106A leads to increased activation of the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, resulting in heightened production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, and IFN-β. This suggests that TMEM106A may have a protective role against excessive inflammation, and its dysregulation could contribute to conditions like sepsis, where its expression is notably increased in peripheral monocytes of patients (Zhang2020Inactivation).

In the realm of viral infections, TMEM106A is identified as an interferon-stimulated gene that plays a crucial role in blocking the attachment of enteroviruses like EV-A71 and CV-A16 by interacting with the SCARB2 receptor. This interaction prevents the virus from binding to host cells, highlighting TMEM106A's role in antiviral defense. Alterations in its expression could potentially affect the host's ability to combat these viral infections (Guo2022Type).

TMEM106A's expression is also decreased in certain cancers, such as gastric and renal cancers, where its restoration can inhibit tumor cell proliferation, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Zhang2020Inactivation).

## Interactions
TMEM106A interacts with the membrane protein SCARB2, a key receptor for Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). This interaction occurs on the cell membrane, where TMEM106A colocalizes with SCARB2, potentially causing steric hindrance that blocks viral binding to SCARB2. TMEM106A associates specifically with the SCARB2 lumenal loop, which includes critical sites for EV-A71 binding (Guo2022Type). The extracellular region of TMEM106A is implicated in this association and is sufficient to inhibit virus infection by interfering with the virus-binding site on SCARB2 (Guo2022Type).

TMEM106A is also involved in the immune response, where it regulates macrophage activity via the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. It acts as a host factor protecting cells from EV-A71 infection and has been found to inhibit the release of HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses. TMEM106A is incorporated into progeny virions, interacting with other TMEM106A proteins on the plasma membrane, which forces the virion to attach to the cell surface (Guo2022Type). These interactions highlight TMEM106A's role in antiviral defense and immune regulation.
