# GRIN3B

## Overview
The GRIN3B gene encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 3B, commonly referred to as GluN3B, which is a component of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex. This receptor is a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor that plays a critical role in synaptic transmission and plasticity within the central nervous system. The GluN3B subunit is known for its modulatory effects on the receptor's response to neurotransmitters, particularly by reducing calcium ion permeability, which is crucial for protecting motoneurons from excitotoxicity (Niemann2008Motoneuronspecific). Structurally, GluN3B forms heterotetrameric complexes with other NMDA receptor subunits, such as GluN1, and is involved in synaptic processes essential for learning and memory (Traynelis2010Glutamate). Mutations in the GRIN3B gene have been linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (HORNIG2017GRIN3B; Lori2021Transcriptomewide).

## Structure
The GRIN3B gene encodes the GluN3B subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is a glutamate-gated ionotropic cation channel. The GluN3B protein consists of 1043 amino acids in its longest splice variant (Traynelis2010Glutamate). The primary structure includes specific domains such as the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and transmembrane domain (TMD), which are crucial for its function (Liu2024Structural). The LBD is involved in glycine binding, which modulates the receptor's permeability (HORNIG2017GRIN3B).

The tertiary structure of GluN3B, as predicted by models using AlphaFold, exhibits a bouquet-like arrangement with three layers: the amino-terminal domain (ATD), LBD, and TMD (Liu2024Structural). The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterotetrameric complexes with other NMDA receptor subunits, such as GluN1, forming receptors that can be activated by glycine alone (Traynelis2010Glutamate).

The GluN3B subunit is known to undergo post-translational modifications, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and function can be affected by mutations, such as the missense mutation rs10666583, which alters the glycine binding site and is associated with schizophrenia (HORNIG2017GRIN3B).

## Function
The GRIN3B gene encodes the NR3B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which is a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor. In healthy human cells, NR3B is motoneuron-specific and plays a crucial role in modulating the receptor's response to neurotransmitters by reducing calcium ion (Ca2+) permeability and the overall current of the receptor response. This function is significant as it may protect motoneurons against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, a process that can lead to cell death (Niemann2008Motoneuronspecific).

The NMDA receptor, which includes the GluN3B subunit, is involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity, essential for learning, memory, and synaptogenesis. The GluN3B subunit acts as a dominant modulatory component, influencing the receptor's response to neurotransmitters and playing a role in the regulation of excitatory neurotransmission (HORNIG2017GRIN3B). The glycine binding sites on GluN3B modulate the permeability of the NMDA receptor to calcium ions, which is crucial for its function (HORNIG2017GRIN3B).

In the central nervous system, the proper functioning of the NMDA receptor, including the GluN3B subunit, is vital for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition in neuronal circuits, which is crucial for normal cognitive functions and preventing neurodegenerative processes (HORNIG2017GRIN3B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GRIN3B gene, which encodes the NR3B subunit of the NMDA receptor, have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. A naturally occurring null variant of the NR3B subunit, known as insCGTT, has been associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. This variant results in a truncated, non-functional protein and is significantly overrepresented in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls. Individuals carrying this variant also exhibit stronger schizotypal personality traits and impaired pre-pulse inhibition, both of which are often disturbed in schizophrenia (Matsuno2015A).

The GRIN3B gene has also been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Alterations in GRIN3B expression levels have been observed in individuals with chronic PTSD, with decreased mRNA levels compared to those who recovered or were resilient. Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GRIN3B, such as rs10401454, have been associated with changes in expression levels and PTSD symptom trajectories (Lori2021Transcriptomewide).

In addition, a missense mutation in the GRIN3B gene, identified through whole-exome sequencing, has been associated with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia. This mutation affects the glycine binding domain of the GluN3B subunit, impairing NMDA receptor function and contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders (HORNIG2017GRIN3B).

## Interactions
The GRIN3B gene encodes the GluN3B subunit of the NMDA receptor, which participates in various interactions with other proteins to form functional receptor complexes. GluN3B can form heterodimeric complexes with the GluN1 subunit, resulting in an excitatory glycine receptor, or heterotrimeric complexes with GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, leading to NMDA receptors with unique properties and reduced currents compared to typical NR1/NR2 NMDARs (Henson2010Influence). These interactions are crucial for modulating NMDA receptor activity and influencing neuronal signaling pathways.

GluN3B interacts with GluN1 and GluN3A subunits through hydrogen bonds, stabilizing the receptor structure. In the GluN1-N3B receptor, specific residues such as R374 and G399, R375 and T385, and D376 and T385 are involved in these interactions (Liu2024Structural). At the LBD level, the GluN1-N3B dimer is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between E751 in GluN1 and K809 in GluN3B (Liu2024Structural). These interactions are essential for the structural integrity and function of the NMDA receptor, influencing its role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal communication.
