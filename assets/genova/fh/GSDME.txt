# GSDME

## Overview
Gasdermin E (GSDME) is a gene located on human chromosome 7p15 that encodes the protein gasdermin E, a member of the gasdermin family known for its role in regulating programmed cell death, particularly pyroptosis. The protein is characterized by its two main domains: a cytotoxic N-terminal domain responsible for pore formation in cell membranes, and an autoinhibitory C-terminal domain that regulates this activity. Gasdermin E is activated through cleavage by caspase-3, which releases the N-terminal domain to oligomerize and form transmembrane pores, leading to cell lysis and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This process is crucial for immune responses and inflammation, as well as the transition from apoptosis to pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death. GSDME's expression and activity are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including hereditary hearing loss, cancer progression, and chemotherapy-induced cell death, making it a significant focus of research in cell death regulation and immune system activation (De2020GSDME; Lee2023Regulated; Privitera2023The).

## Structure
Gasdermin E (GSDME) is a protein encoded by the GSDME gene, located on human chromosome 7p15. The protein consists of 496 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 55 kDa (Liao2022Gasdermin; Wang2021Gasdermin). GSDME is structured into two main domains: a cytotoxic N-terminal domain and an autoinhibitory C-terminal domain (Liao2022Gasdermin; Xu2024The). The N-terminal domain is responsible for pore formation in the cell membrane, leading to cell lysis, while the C-terminal domain inhibits this activity by acting as a shield (Liao2022Gasdermin; Xu2024The).

The protein's structure includes a globular domain A (exon 2-exon 6), a hinge region (exon 6-exon 7), and a globular domain B (exon 7-exon 10) (Wang2021Gasdermin). The N-terminal domain is activated through cleavage by caspase-3, which removes the C-terminal domain, allowing the N-terminal domain to oligomerize and form transmembrane pores (Liao2022Gasdermin; Xu2024The). This cleavage occurs at a consensus motif, DMPD, in GSDME (Xu2024The). GSDME can also undergo alternative splicing, leading to different isoforms (Liao2022Gasdermin).

## Function
GSDME (gasdermin E) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of programmed cell death, particularly pyroptosis. In healthy human cells, GSDME is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is cleaved by caspase-3, an apoptotic protease. This cleavage releases the N-terminal domain of GSDME, which facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane, leading to cell lysis and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α and IL-1β (Lee2023Regulated; Privitera2023The). This process is crucial for immune responses, as it can trigger inflammation and recruit immune cells to sites of infection or damage (Privitera2023The).

GSDME also plays a role in the transition from apoptosis to pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death, by permeabilizing the plasma membrane, which can lead to secondary necrosis (De2020GSDME). This transition is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and defending against pathogens (Lee2023Regulated). The protein's activity is regulated by its C-terminal domain, which inhibits its pore-forming function until cleaved by caspase-3 (De2020GSDME). GSDME's involvement in these processes highlights its role in both cell death regulation and immune system activation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GSDME gene have significant clinical implications. GSDME was initially identified as a gene associated with hereditary hearing loss, known as Deafness Autosomal Dominant 5 (DFNA5), due to gain-of-function mutations that affect cellular processes in the inner ear (Zhu2024The; Ibrahim2019Methylation). In cancer, GSDME is frequently silenced through promoter methylation, particularly in colorectal cancer, where its reduced expression is linked to tumor progression and metastasis (Ibrahim2019Methylation; Privitera2023The). 

GSDME expression levels also influence cancer cell behavior. High expression of GSDME is associated with increased invasiveness and migratory abilities in colorectal cancer cells, suggesting a role in promoting metastasis (Mu2022A). Conversely, GSDME acts as a tumor suppressor in some contexts, where its expression can induce pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death, thereby reducing tumor burden and enhancing antitumor immune responses (AllaliBoumara2023Pyroptosis; Privitera2023The). 

Alterations in GSDME expression are linked to drug sensitivity, affecting the efficacy of various chemotherapeutic agents. High GSDME expression increases sensitivity to certain drugs, while it can also confer resistance to others, highlighting its complex role in cancer treatment (Mu2022A).

## Interactions
Gasdermin E (GSDME) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in pyroptosis and other cellular processes. GSDME is cleaved by caspase-3, a crucial interaction that leads to the release of its N-terminal fragment, which oligomerizes and forms pores in cell membranes, facilitating pyroptosis (Yu2019Cleavage; Hu2020Chemotherapy-induced). This interaction is central to its function in chemotherapy-induced pyroptosis and neurodegeneration (Neel2022GasderminE).

GSDME also interacts with ZDHHC family proteins, specifically ZDHHC-2, ZDHHC-7, ZDHHC-11, and ZDHHC-15, which catalyze its palmitoylation. This post-translational modification affects the dissociation of GSDME-C from GSDME-N, influencing its pro-pyroptotic functions (Hu2020Chemotherapy-induced). The palmitoylation of GSDME is crucial for its role in drug-induced pyroptosis, and inhibitors like 2-bromopalmitate can modulate this process (Hu2020Chemotherapy-induced).

In the context of diabetic retinopathy, GSDME interacts with TNFSF15, an angiogenesis inhibitor. This interaction is significant in blocking pyroptosis and slowing disease progression. The binding involves hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, forming a stable complex (Zhao2024TNFSF15). These interactions highlight GSDME's role in various cellular pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
