# NQO1

## Overview
NQO1, or NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1, is a gene that encodes a cytosolic enzyme involved in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. The enzyme, categorized as a flavoprotein, functions primarily by catalyzing the two-electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones, thereby preventing the formation of harmful semiquinone radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Siegel2004NAD(P)H:Quinone page 0 of 4; DinkovaKostova2010NAD(P)H:quinone page 0 of 5). This enzymatic activity is crucial for detoxifying quinone metabolites and protecting cells from oxidative damage. NQO1 is highly inducible by oxidative stress and is regulated by the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway, which modulates the expression of various cytoprotective genes (DinkovaKostova2010NAD(P)H:quinone page 1 of 5). Beyond its enzymatic functions, NQO1 also interacts with several proteins, influencing processes such as microtubule dynamics and redox balance (Siegel2021A). The gene's polymorphisms and expression levels have significant clinical implications, being associated with susceptibility to certain cancers and neurodegenerative diseases (Phillips2004Biological; Beaver2019NQO1:).

## Structure
The NQO1 protein is a cytosolic enzyme that functions as a homodimer, with each subunit consisting of 274 amino acids and a noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) molecule (Zhang2018NAD(P)H:Quinone page 1 of 10). The primary structure of NQO1 is encoded by the NQO1 gene, and its secondary structure includes a central parallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Zhang2018NAD(P)H:Quinone page 1 of 10). The tertiary structure forms a dimer, which is the quaternary structure, stabilized by FAD binding (Faig2000Structures).

NQO1 contains a major catalytic domain (residues 1-220) and a small C-terminal domain (residues 221-273). The catalytic domain features a flexible hydrophobic pocket with potential hydrogen-bonding residues, allowing for diverse binding modes (Zhang2018NAD(P)H:Quinone page 1 of 10). The C-terminal domain is involved in binding NADH, substrates, and competitive inhibitors (MedinaCarmona2017Sitetosite).

Post-translational modifications of NQO1 include phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, which can affect its catalytic function and stability. Phosphorylation at specific sites, such as S82, can significantly decrease FAD binding affinity and destabilize the protein structure (Pey2023Phenotypic). Ubiquitination occurs at solvent-exposed lysine residues, influencing proteasomal degradation (Pey2023Phenotypic). Acetylation at lysine sites can reduce catalytic function by 37% in vitro (Pey2023Phenotypic).

## Function
NQO1 (NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1) is a multifunctional enzyme that plays a critical role in cellular defense against oxidative stress. It catalyzes the two-electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones, preventing the formation of semiquinone radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Siegel2004NAD(P)H:Quinone page 0 of 4; DinkovaKostova2010NAD(P)H:quinone page 0 of 5). This enzymatic activity is crucial for detoxifying harmful quinone metabolites, including those derived from dopamine and estrogens, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage and genotoxicity (DinkovaKostova2010NAD(P; Ross2021The)H:quinone page 3 of 5).

NQO1 is highly inducible by oxidative stress and is regulated by the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway, which controls the expression of numerous cytoprotective genes (DinkovaKostova2010NAD(P)H:quinone page 1 of 5). It also stabilizes the tumor suppressor protein p53, protecting it from proteasomal degradation, and plays a role in redox control by interacting with microtubules and influencing their acetylation state (DinkovaKostova2010NAD(P)H:quinone page 0 of 5; Ross2021The page 4 of 7).

In addition to its enzymatic functions, NQO1 acts as a superoxide scavenger, reducing superoxide radicals and thereby maintaining cellular redox balance (Siegel2004NAD(P)H:Quinone page 3 of 4). Its activity is particularly significant in tissues with high oxidative stress, such as cardiac cells, where it complements the activity of superoxide dismutase (Ross2018NQO1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NQO1 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. The NQO1*2 (609C>T) polymorphism results in a proline to serine substitution, leading to rapid degradation of the enzyme and a null phenotype. This variant is linked to increased susceptibility to benzene-induced hemotoxicity and a higher risk of cancers such as acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, bladder cancer in smokers, and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (Phillips2004Biological). The NQO1*3 (465C>T) variant affects splicing and expression, though it has a less significant impact on enzyme activity (Phillips2004Biological).

NQO1 is overexpressed in various solid tumors, which can be exploited to activate bioreductive anticancer drugs (Oh2015Implications). However, the clinical significance of NQO1 expression levels in human cancers is not fully understood (Oh2015Implications). In prostate cancer, low NQO1 expression is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor disease-free survival, suggesting a role in metastasis through enhanced TGFβ signaling (Thapa2020Attenuation).

In neurological diseases, increased NQO1 expression is observed in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, indicating a potential protective role against oxidative stress (DinkovaKostova2010NAD(P)H:quinone page 4 of 5). The C609T variant is not significantly associated with Parkinson's disease risk, but NQO1 plays a role in neuroprotection (Beaver2019NQO1:).

## Interactions
NQO1 (NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with microtubules, particularly in regions with high levels of acetylated α-tubulin K40, suggesting a role in microtubule dynamics and acetylation regulation. This interaction is confirmed through proximity ligation assays and is potentially redox-dependent, as NQO1 can change conformation based on intracellular reduced pyridine nucleotide concentrations (Siegel2021A).

NQO1 also interacts with SIRT2, a deacetylase, and both proteins localize in perinuclear regions, indicating a collaborative role in regulating microtubule acetylation. NQO1's ability to generate NAD+ for SIRT2-dependent deacetylase activity is hypothesized, although it may modulate acetylation by altering its conformation in response to pyridine nucleotide levels (Siegel2021A).

Additionally, NQO1 binds to SIRT1, enhancing its deacetylase activity, which is crucial for regulating gene expression related to mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose metabolism. This interaction is significant under mitochondrial stress, where NQO1 supports SIRT1's protective functions (Tsvetkov2021NQO1).

NQO1 also interacts with DNA polymerase β (Polβ), protecting it from degradation by the 20S proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner. This interaction is NADH-dependent and is disrupted under oxidative stress conditions (Fang2019Stability).
