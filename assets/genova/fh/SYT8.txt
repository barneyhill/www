# SYT8

## Overview
The SYT8 gene encodes synaptotagmin 8, a member of the synaptotagmin family of proteins, which are primarily involved in membrane trafficking and exocytosis. Unlike other synaptotagmins, synaptotagmin 8 does not act as a calcium sensor in exocytotic membrane fusion, distinguishing it from its family counterparts (Wolfes2020The). Instead, it is expressed as a non-calcium-binding cytosolic protein, particularly in the soma of cultured hippocampal neurons, although its precise role in the brain remains to be fully elucidated. Synaptotagmin 8 exists in two molecular forms, 40 kDa and 50 kDa, with distinct cellular localizations (Suo2022Potential). Beyond its physiological roles, SYT8 has been implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as pancreatic and gastric cancers, where it may function as an oncogene (Suo2022Potential). Additionally, genetic variations in SYT8 have been associated with conditions like irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea and depressive disorder, suggesting a broader impact on human health (Zhu2020Shared).

## Function
Synaptotagmin 8 (SYT8) is a member of the synaptotagmin family, which are proteins involved in membrane trafficking and exocytosis. Unlike other synaptotagmins, SYT8 does not function as a calcium sensor in exocytotic membrane fusion in endocrine cells. It is expressed as a non-calcium-binding cytosolic protein in the soma of cultured hippocampal neurons, although its precise function in the brain remains unknown (Wolfes2020The). SYT8 is found in two forms, 40 and 50 kDa, with the 40 kDa form located in the cytosol of the brain and certain cells, while the 50 kDa form is localized in clusters (Suo2022Potential).

In the context of cancer, SYT8 has been implicated in tumor progression, particularly in pancreatic and gastric cancers. In pancreatic cancer, SYT8 is overexpressed and promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and migration through the TNNI2/ERRα/SIRT1 signaling axis. In gastric cancer, high expression of SYT8 correlates with higher tumor stages and metastasis, and its downregulation inhibits invasion, migration, and drug resistance (Suo2022Potential). These findings suggest that SYT8 may function as an oncogene in these cancers, although its role in healthy human cells remains less clear.

## Clinical Significance
The SYT8 gene has been implicated in the progression of pancreatic cancer. Studies have shown that SYT8 is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its overexpression is associated with enhanced cell proliferation, tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Knockdown of SYT8 results in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, while overexpression promotes these cancerous behaviors. The mechanism involves the regulation of the SIRT1 protein deacetylase, which is influenced by the orphan nuclear receptor ERRα and troponin-1 (TNNI2). This signaling pathway contributes to the aggressive characteristics of pancreatic cancer, suggesting that SYT8 could serve as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Fu2021SYT8).

In addition to its role in cancer, SYT8 has been associated with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and depressive disorder (DD) in Chinese patients. A specific single nucleotide variation (SNV) in the SYT8 gene, rs3741231, is linked to increased risks for both conditions. This genetic variation suggests a role for SYT8 in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, which is crucial for neurotransmission and hormone secretion, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of these disorders (Zhu2020Shared).

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 8 (SYT8) is involved in several interactions that play a significant role in pancreatic cancer progression. SYT8 interacts with SIRT1, a NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, promoting the proliferation and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. This interaction is mediated through the orphan nuclear receptor ERRα, which acts as a coactivator of SIRT1's transcriptional activity. ERRα also transcriptionally activates SIRT1, suggesting a feedback loop that enhances SYT8's role in cancer progression (Fu2021SYT8).

SYT8 is also associated with TNNI2, a neighboring gene regulated by the same insulin promoter. TNNI2 acts as a co-activator and direct interactor of ERRα, and its expression is necessary for the activation of the ERRα/SIRT1 pathway by SYT8. Overexpression of TNNI2 increases ERRα and SIRT1 expression, while its knockdown decreases these levels, affecting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Fu2021SYT8).

These interactions suggest that SYT8, through its association with SIRT1, ERRα, and TNNI2, forms a signaling pathway that significantly contributes to pancreatic cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Fu2021SYT8).
