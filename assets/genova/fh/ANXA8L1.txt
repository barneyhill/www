# ANXA8L1

## Overview
ANXA8L1 is a gene that encodes the protein annexin A8 like 1, which is a member of the annexin family of proteins. Annexins are characterized by their ability to bind to phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner, and they are involved in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal organization (Gerke2016Annexins). Annexin A8 like 1, specifically, has been implicated in the regulation of actin dynamics and membrane organization, as well as in the maturation of Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells (Gerke2016Annexins; Goebeler2006Annexin). Clinically, ANXA8L1 has been associated with renal cell carcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2023Potential).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ANXA8L1, a member of the annexin family, has been implicated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) due to its altered expression levels. Studies have shown that ANXA8L1 is significantly upregulated in RCC tissues compared to normal kidney tissues. This upregulation is associated with more advanced grades of the disease and worse overall survival outcomes for patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Wang2023Potential). The correlation between high ANXA8L1 expression and poor clinical outcomes indicates that it may play a pathogenic role in RCC, similar to its paralog ANXA8, which has been more extensively studied (Wang2023Potential).

While the primary focus of research has been on ANXA8, the findings regarding ANXA8L1 suggest that it could serve as a valuable biomarker for assessing RCC prognosis. The study highlights the need for further investigation into the specific mechanisms by which ANXA8L1 contributes to RCC progression and its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2023Potential). The role of ANXA8L1 in other diseases or conditions has not been detailed in the available context, indicating a gap in the current understanding of its broader clinical significance.

## Interactions
Annexin A8, encoded by the ANXA8L1 gene, is known for its interactions with phospholipids and F-actin in a calcium-dependent manner. It specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and is recruited to PtdIns(4,5)P2-rich sites of dynamic actin rearrangement, suggesting a role in organizing actin-associated membrane domains (Goebeler2006Annexin). This interaction is particularly noted in HeLa cells infected with non-invading enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, where annexin A8 is involved in cellular processes related to membrane and cytoskeletal dynamics (Goebeler2006Annexin).

Annexin A8 also plays a role in the maturation of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB) in endothelial cells, where it is involved in the transport of CD63 from endosomes to maturing WPBs. This process is crucial for the functional presentation of P-selectin on the cell surface, affecting leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells (Gerke2016Annexins). Although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, annexin A8's role in these processes suggests it may interact with components of the endosomal transport machinery (Gerke2016Annexins).
