# FCHSD2

## Overview
FCHSD2 is a gene that encodes the protein FCH and double SH3 domains 2, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to actin dynamics and membrane trafficking. The protein is characterized by its F-BAR domain, which facilitates binding to the plasma membrane and the induction of cell protrusions, and two SH3 domains that mediate interactions with other proteins involved in actin polymerization and endocytosis (Zhai2022FCHSD2; Frisby2024Endosomal). FCHSD2 plays a critical role in endosomal processes, including receptor recycling and endosome fission, by activating the ARP2/3 complex to promote branched actin polymerization (Frisby2024Endosomal). Clinically, FCHSD2 has been implicated in diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia and non-small cell lung cancer, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Xiao2020FCHSD2; Han2012FCHSD2). Additionally, FCHSD2 may have a role in insulin secretion, with potential implications for type 2 diabetes (Hu2020Chromatin).

## Structure
FCHSD2 is a protein characterized by its domain structure, which includes an N-terminal F-BAR domain, two SH3 domains, and a C-terminal proline-rich region. The F-BAR domain is crucial for dimerization and binding to the plasma membrane, playing a significant role in inducing cell protrusions and membrane curvature (Zhai2022FCHSD2; Frisby2024Endosomal). This domain interacts with membrane lipids through six positively charged residues, and mutations in these residues can impair membrane binding and protrusion formation (Zhai2022FCHSD2).

The SH3 domains of FCHSD2 mediate interactions with proteins such as intersectin 1 (ITSN1), WASP, and N-WASP, which are involved in actin polymerization and endocytic processes (Xiao2018Role; Zhai2022FCHSD2). The SH3 A domain is particularly important for interactions with MICAL-L1, facilitating the recruitment of FCHSD2 to endosomes (Frisby2024Endosomal).

FCHSD2 is suggested to exist in an autoinhibited conformation, with the SH3 domains potentially interacting with the F-BAR domain to regulate its activity (Frisby2024Endosomal). The protein can form homo- and hetero-oligomers, indicating a quaternary structure that may be important for its function in actin assembly (Cao2013FCHSD1). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of FCHSD2 is not provided in the available literature.

## Function
The FCHSD2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in actin dynamics and membrane trafficking. FCHSD2 contains an F-BAR domain, which is crucial for its ability to bind to the plasma membrane and induce cell protrusions, and two SH3 domains that mediate interactions with proteins such as intersectin 1 (ITSN1), WASP, and N-WASP (Zhai2022FCHSD2). This protein is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization, which is essential for the formation of cell protrusions and the maintenance of cell shape and movement (Zhai2022FCHSD2).

In endosomal processes, FCHSD2 is recruited to endosomes by MICAL-L1, where it plays a critical role in receptor recycling and endosome fission. It activates the ARP2/3 complex to promote branched actin polymerization, facilitating endosomal fission and the recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane (Frisby2024Endosomal). FCHSD2's involvement in these processes is crucial for maintaining endosomal dynamics and cellular homeostasis (Frisby2024Endosomal). The protein's function in healthy cells is linked to its role in actin dynamics and cell morphology, particularly in the context of cell protrusions and stereocilia structure (Zhai2022FCHSD2).

## Clinical Significance
The FCHSD2 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular processes. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression of FCHSD2 is associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis. Knockdown of FCHSD2 in leukemia cells increases sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs like daunorubicin and Ara-C, suggesting that FCHSD2 expression levels could serve as a prognostic marker in AML (Han2012FCHSD2; El2013High).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma, FCHSD2 appears to function as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is inversely correlated with cancer aggressiveness, and higher levels of FCHSD2 are associated with better patient survival rates. FCHSD2 negatively regulates Rab7 activity, affecting oncogenic signaling pathways such as ERK1/2, and its depletion leads to increased expression of oncogenes like MET and EGFR (Xiao2020FCHSD2).

FCHSD2 is also involved in insulin secretion, with potential implications for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Alterations in FCHSD2 expression, influenced by chromatin structure at the STARD10 locus, may affect insulin exocytosis and contribute to T2D risk (Hu2020Chromatin).

## Interactions
FCHSD2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as actin polymerization and endocytosis. It binds to N-WASP through its first SH3 domain (SH3a), stimulating ARP2/3-dependent actin polymerization, which is crucial for cell protrusion formation (Zhai2022FCHSD2). FCHSD2 also forms a complex with CDC42 and N-WASP, confirmed by GST pull-down assays, to promote cell protrusion formation (Zhai2022FCHSD2).

In endosomal processes, FCHSD2 is recruited to endosomes by MICAL-L1, interacting through its SH3 domain. This interaction is essential for endosomal actin branching, fission, and receptor recycling (Frisby2024Endosomal). FCHSD2 also interacts with intersectin 1 (ITSN1) and dynamin, contributing to clathrin-mediated endocytosis by enhancing N-WASP/ARP2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization (Xiao2018Role).

FCHSD2's interaction with WASP and N-WASP is significant in regulating actin polymerization in vitro, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Cao2013FCHSD1). These interactions highlight FCHSD2's role in modulating actin dynamics and its involvement in various cellular processes.
