# B3GNT2

## Overview
B3GNT2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2, a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of polylactosamine chains on N-glycans and glycolipids. This enzyme is categorized as a glycosyltransferase due to its role in transferring N-acetylglucosamine to galactose, a critical step in forming poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. These chains are essential for various cellular processes, including cell-cell communication, protein stability, and signal transduction. The B3GNT2 protein is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences the glycosylation of proteins such as LRP6, thereby impacting pathways like Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which are crucial for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis (Togayachi2010β3GnT2; Xu2023NGlycosylation). Additionally, B3GNT2 plays a significant role in modulating immune responses by glycosylating co-stimulatory molecules, with implications for immune cell activation and cancer resistance to immunotherapy (Togayachi2010β3GnT2; Joung2022CRISPR).

## Structure
The B3GNT2 protein is a glycosyltransferase enzyme characterized by a GT-A fold, a common structural motif among glycosyltransferases. This fold includes a DxD motif crucial for coordinating a divalent cation, such as Mg2+, which is essential for the enzyme's activity (Kadirvelraj2021Comparison). The protein's structure features a Rossmann-like fold with eight twisted β-strands and twelve α-helical segments, forming a stable dimeric arrangement confirmed by size exclusion-multiangle light scattering and sedimentation velocity analysis (Kadirvelraj2021Comparison).

The B3GNT2 protein has a unique acceptor binding site formed by loop insertions into the GT-A fold core, specifically involving Loopb7-b8 and Loopa10-b11, which contribute to binding the tetrasaccharide acceptor analog, lacto-N-neotetraose (Kadirvelraj2021Comparison). The structure also includes a 'Glycine-rich' loop and an 'xED' motif, which are typical of GT-A fold enzymes (Kadirvelraj2021Comparison).

B3GNT2 has five predicted N-glycosylation sites, with confirmed glycosylation at Asn219, which is important for protein folding or stability (Kadirvelraj2021Comparison). The protein does not have reported splice variant isoforms (Kadirvelraj2021Comparison).

## Function
The B3GNT2 gene encodes the enzyme β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2, which plays a crucial role in the synthesis of polylactosamine chains on N-glycans and glycolipids. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to galactose, forming poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains that are essential for various cellular functions, including cell-cell communication, protein stability, and signal transduction (Togayachi2010β3GnT2; Venkitachalam2016Biochemical). 

B3GNT2 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the elongation of polylactosamine chains, impacting the glycosylation of proteins such as LRP6, a co-receptor in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This modification is significant for the proper localization and function of LRP6, enhancing Wnt signaling, which is vital for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis (Xu2023NGlycosylation).

In the immune system, B3GNT2 is involved in modulating immune responses by glycosylating co-stimulatory molecules like CD28 and CD19, which are crucial for T and B cell receptor signaling. The absence of B3GNT2 leads to hyperactivation of lymphocytes, indicating its role in maintaining normal immune function (Togayachi2010β3GnT2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the B3GNT2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and immune system function. Overexpression of B3GNT2 has been linked to cancer resistance to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This resistance is achieved by modifying proteins with poly-LacNAc, which disrupts ligand-receptor interactions between tumor and T cells, thereby reducing T cell activation and contributing to immune evasion (Joung2022CRISPR). In melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, higher B3GNT2 expression correlates with poorer clinical outcomes, suggesting its role in promoting tumor progression and resistance to immunotherapy (Joung2022CRISPR).

Mutations in B3GNT2 can lead to loss of enzymatic function or mislocalization, affecting glycosylation pathways and potentially altering the function of multiple proteins. These changes can disrupt normal cellular processes and contribute to tumor progression (Venkitachalam2016Altered). In B3gnt2-deficient mice, the absence of polylactosamine chains results in hyperactivation of immune cells, indicating that B3GNT2 plays a role in regulating immune responses (Togayachi2010β3GnT2). These findings highlight the potential of B3GNT2 as a target for understanding and overcoming cancer resistance to immunotherapy (Joung2022CRISPR).

## Interactions
B3GNT2, a glycosyltransferase, is involved in the modification of various proteins through glycosylation, impacting their interactions and functions. In the context of cancer, B3GNT2 overexpression leads to increased poly-LacNAc on several ligands and receptors, such as CD276, CD70, CD58, NECTIN2, HLA-A, TNFRSF1A, IFNGR2, FAS, IFNAR1, and MICB. This modification affects the interaction between tumor cells and T cells, reducing T cell activation and cytotoxicity (Joung2022CRISPR). The study also notes that the binding of T cell proteins like CD2, 4-1BB, TREML2 (TLT2), and NKG2D to B3GNT2-overexpressing cells is reduced, indicating that B3GNT2-mediated glycosylation alters these interactions (Joung2022CRISPR).

In the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, B3GNT2 specifically modifies the LRP6 protein by extending polylactosamine chains on its N-glycans. This modification enhances LRP6's localization on the cell surface and its ability to transduce signals, thereby promoting Wnt signaling (Xu2023NGlycosylation). The interaction between B3GNT2 and LRP6 is specific, as B3GNT2 does not affect other components of the Wnt pathway, such as FZD5, FZD8, or Wnt3a (Xu2023NGlycosylation).
