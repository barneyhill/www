# PRRG4

## Overview
PRRG4 is a gene that encodes the proline-rich and Gla domain 4 protein, a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neural development and disease pathology. The protein is characterized by a proline-rich region and a Gla domain, which undergoes vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation, essential for calcium ion coordination and membrane binding (Justice2017The; Yazicioglu2013Cellular). PRRG4 is localized to the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in protein trafficking and axon guidance (Justice2017The; Yazicioglu2013Cellular). It interacts with WW domain-containing proteins, such as NEDD4, through its proline-rich motifs, implicating it in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways (Justice2017The; Yazicioglu2013Cellular). PRRG4 is expressed in various tissues, including the cerebellum and spinal cord, and is associated with conditions such as WAGR syndrome and cancer, where it influences cell migration and invasion (Zhang2020PRRG4; Justice2017The).

## Structure
The PRRG4 protein is a short transmembrane protein characterized by a proline-rich region and a Gla domain, which is involved in calcium binding (Justice2017The; Yazicioglu2013Cellular). The Gla domain contains glutamic acid residues that undergo γ-carboxylation, a vitamin K-dependent post-translational modification, to form γ-carboxyglutamate residues, which are crucial for calcium ion coordination and membrane phospholipid binding (Justice2017The; Yazicioglu2013Cellular). 

The primary structure of PRRG4 includes specific motifs such as PPxY and LPxY, which are known to interact with WW domain-containing proteins like Nedd4, YAP, and TAZ (Justice2017The; Yazicioglu2013Cellular). These motifs facilitate protein-protein interactions, playing a role in endocytosis and synaptic regulation (Justice2017The). 

PRRG4 is localized to the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus, indicating its involvement in cell surface protein localization (Justice2017The; Yazicioglu2013Cellular). The protein's cytoplasmic domain contains SH3 binding motifs, which further suggest its role in protein trafficking and axon guidance (Justice2017The). 

The protein's structure and modifications suggest its involvement in neural development and disease pathology, such as WAGR syndrome and Parkinson's disease susceptibility (Yazicioglu2013Cellular).

## Function
PRRG4 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, particularly in axon guidance and neural development. The PRRG4 protein contains a Gla domain, which undergoes vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation, a modification essential for its function in calcium ion coordination and membrane binding (Yazicioglu2013Cellular). This protein is localized to the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in regulating the localization of cell surface proteins (Justice2017The; Yazicioglu2013Cellular).

PRRG4 interacts with WW domain-containing proteins, such as NEDD4 and MAGI, through its proline-rich motifs, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways (Justice2017The; Yazicioglu2013Cellular). It is implicated in the regulation of Robo guidance receptors, which are crucial for proper neural connectivity and synapse formation (Justice2017The). The protein's interaction with the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase indicates a potential role in endocytosis and the removal of Robo receptors from the cell surface, a process important for axon guidance (Justice2017The).

PRRG4 is expressed in various tissues, including the cerebellum and spinal cord, highlighting its significance in neural development and function (Justice2017The; Yazicioglu2013Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
The PRRG4 gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In WAGR syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, PRRG4 is part of a chromosomal deletion that includes other genes like PAX6 and WT1. This deletion is associated with developmental delays and autistic behaviors, suggesting that PRRG4 may contribute to these symptoms by affecting axon guidance and synapse formation (Yamamoto2013Narrowing; Justice2017The).

In cancer, PRRG4 is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and promotes metastasis by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, leading to the degradation of Robo1. This process activates Src and FAK kinases, which are crucial for cancer cell migration and invasion (Zhang2020PRRG4). PRRG4 also plays a role in papillary thyroid carcinoma, where it is upregulated by circSEMA6A, enhancing cell migration and invasion (Liu2024CircSEMA6A).

In endometriosis, PRRG4 expression is regulated by LncRNA HOTAIR through the miR-519b-3p pathway, influencing cell invasion and migration (Bao2022LncRNA). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PRRG4 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PRRG4 is involved in several protein-protein interactions, primarily through its proline-rich motifs that bind to WW domain-containing proteins. It interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of Robo1, a process crucial for breast cancer cell migration and invasion (Zhang2020PRRG4; Justice2017The). This interaction is mediated by the LPSY and PPPY motifs in PRRG4, which bind to the WW domains in NEDD4 (Zhang2020PRRG4).

PRRG4 also interacts with YAP1, YAP2, WWTR1, MAGI-1, MAGI-3, NEDD4L, and other proteins, confirmed through GST pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Yazicioglu2013Cellular). The LPSY motif is crucial for binding with YAP, TAZ, NEDD4, and NEDD4L, while the PPPY motif is important for interactions with MAGI-1 and MAGI-3 (Yazicioglu2013Cellular).

In breast cancer cells, PRRG4 activates protein tyrosine kinases Src and FAK, promoting cancer cell migration and invasion. This activation is linked to the downregulation of Robo1, which releases Src and FAK from sequestration (Zhang2020PRRG4). PRRG4 also enhances STAT3 activation via Src, influencing mitochondrial function and cell migration (Wang2023PRRG4).
