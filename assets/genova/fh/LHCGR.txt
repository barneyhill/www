# LHCGR

## Overview
The LHCGR gene encodes the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor, a critical component of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a pivotal role in human reproductive physiology. This receptor is primarily responsible for mediating the biological effects of luteinizing hormone (LH) and chorionic gonadotropin (CG), hormones essential for reproductive processes such as steroidogenesis, gametogenesis, and ovulation. The LHCGR protein is predominantly expressed in the gonadal tissues, including ovarian and testicular cells, where it facilitates key signaling pathways upon hormone binding (Troppmann2013Structural; Narayan2015Genetic). Structurally, the receptor is characterized by a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain with seven helices, and various post-translational modifications that influence its function and regulation (Troppmann2013Structural; Ascoli2002The). Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LHCGR gene can lead to significant reproductive disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in both male and female reproductive health (Segaloff2009Chapter; Geng2022Downregulation).

## Structure
The luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a complex molecular structure. The mature human LHCGR consists of 699 amino acids and is heavily glycosylated, which increases its molecular mass beyond the predicted size (Troppmann2013Structural). The receptor's structure includes a large extracellular domain with nine leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) crucial for high-affinity hormone binding, and a hinge region that connects to the transmembrane domain (TMD) (Troppmann2013Structural; Shpakov2024Hormonal). The TMD is composed of seven hydrophobic transmembrane helices, typical of GPCRs, forming a tunnel that facilitates signal transduction (Shpakov2024Hormonal).

Post-translational modifications of LHCGR include glycosylation, phosphorylation, and palmitoylation. Glycosylation is not essential for receptor function but aids in proper folding and trafficking (Ascoli2002The). Phosphorylation occurs on serine residues and is enhanced by hormone stimulation, while palmitoylation affects the receptor's internalization rate (Ascoli2002The). The receptor can form dimers or higher-order complexes, which are important for its function and involve interactions between transmembrane helices (Troppmann2013Structural). The LHCGR gene also exhibits splice variants, which introduce structural differences and affect receptor function (Troppmann2013Structural).

## Function
The LHCGR gene encodes the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor crucial for reproductive processes. In healthy human cells, LHCGR is primarily involved in mediating the effects of luteinizing hormone (LH) and chorionic gonadotropin (CG), which are essential for normal reproductive function. The receptor is predominantly expressed in the gonads, including ovarian theca, granulosa, and luteal cells in females, and Leydig cells in the testes in males (Troppmann2013Structural; Narayan2015Genetic).

Upon binding of LH or CG, LHCGR undergoes structural changes that activate intracellular signaling pathways, primarily the Gαs/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway, which is crucial for steroidogenesis and gametogenesis (Narayan2015Genetic). In females, LHCGR activation leads to ovulation, follicular maturation, and progesterone production by the corpus luteum (Troppmann2013Structural). In males, it stimulates testosterone production necessary for pubertal development and spermatogenesis (Narayan2015Genetic).

The receptor's ability to bind low-molecular-weight ligands allosterically suggests the presence of multiple binding pockets, offering potential for selective drug action (Troppmann2013Structural). This functional plasticity is vital for the receptor's role in reproductive physiology, mediating the effects of LH and CG in healthy human cells (Troppmann2013Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LHCGR gene can lead to a variety of disorders affecting reproductive health. In males, inactivating mutations can cause Leydig cell hypoplasia (LCH), which is characterized by impaired male sexual development. There are two types of LCH: Type I, a severe form resulting in 46,XY male pseudohermaphroditism with female external genitalia, and Type II, a milder form with incomplete male sexual differentiation (Segaloff2009Chapter; Yan2019Novel). In females, these mutations can lead to infertility and menstrual irregularities, although normal pubertal development is typically observed (Segaloff2009Chapter).

Activating mutations in the LHCGR gene can result in familial male-limited precocious puberty (FMPP), a condition where boys experience early onset puberty due to increased testosterone production. These mutations are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant male-limited pattern (Narayan2015Genetic).

Alterations in LHCGR expression levels can also impact reproductive health. For instance, decreased expression of LHCGR in granulosa cells is associated with luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFs) in endometriosis, leading to impaired ovulation and infertility (Geng2022Downregulation). These findings underscore the critical role of LHCGR in maintaining normal reproductive function and its potential involvement in various reproductive disorders.

## Interactions
The luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, primarily through its role as a G protein-coupled receptor. LHCGR interacts with luteinizing hormone (LH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which bind to the receptor and induce conformational changes in its transmembrane domain. These changes facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP in the Gα subunit of the G protein, activating downstream signaling pathways (Shpakov2024Hormonal).

LHCGR also forms heterodimeric complexes with the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR). This interaction is significant in regulating steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis. The formation of LHCGR/FSHR heterocomplexes can lead to biased activation of intracellular pathways, with FSH binding to FSHR stimulating LHCGR activity through a trans-activation mechanism. This interaction is crucial during early stages of folliculogenesis when LHCGR and LH levels are low (Shpakov2024Hormonal).

Additionally, LHCGR interacts with β-arrestin 2, which is recruited to the receptor upon stimulation by LH and hCG. This interaction is important for both desensitization/internalization of the receptor and signaling, with β-arrestin 2 recruitment occurring in a dose-dependent manner (Riccetti2017Human).
