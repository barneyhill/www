# GNL3

## Overview
GNL3, also known as nucleostemin, is a gene that encodes the G protein nucleolar 3, a nucleolar protein involved in critical cellular processes such as cell proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, and cell cycle regulation. The protein is predominantly expressed in proliferating cells, including stem and cancer cells, and is down-regulated during cellular differentiation. As a GTP-binding protein, nucleostemin plays a pivotal role in maintaining nucleolar integrity and proper cell cycle progression. It interacts with several key proteins, including those involved in the p53 signaling pathway and telomere maintenance, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in oncogenesis and other diseases (Tsai2002A; Romanova2009Critical; Hu2017NucleosteminGNL3).

## Function
GNL3, also known as nucleostemin, is a nucleolar protein that plays a significant role in cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis. It is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it is involved in the assembly of ribosomal subunits and influences cell growth and differentiation. Nucleostemin is crucial for pre-rRNA processing, forming a complex with the pre-60S ribosomal subunit and interacting with proteins such as Pes1, DDX21, and EBP2. This interaction is essential for the retention of these proteins in the nucleolus and the efficient processing of 32S pre-rRNA into 28S rRNA, which is vital for protein synthesis (Romanova2009Critical).

Nucleostemin is expressed in proliferating cells, including stem and cancer cells, and is down-regulated during differentiation. It interacts with the p53 signaling pathway, inducing cell cycle arrest when depleted or overexpressed, although it also has p53-independent functions related to ribosome biogenesis (Romanova2009Critical). The protein's GTP-binding motifs are necessary for maintaining nucleolar integrity and proper cell cycle progression, as mutants lacking these domains show disrupted cell-cycle progression and increased apoptosis (Tsai2002A). Nucleostemin's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cell function and proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
The GNL3 gene, also known as nucleostemin, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In knee osteoarthritis (KOA), particularly among the Han Chinese population, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the GNL3 gene, such as rs11177, have been significantly associated with increased risk, suggesting GNL3 as a genetic modifier for KOA development (Liu2018Common).

In cancer, GNL3 is frequently upregulated and contributes to tumor progression and metastasis. In colon cancer, GNL3 overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Tang2017Upregulation). Similarly, in osteosarcoma, GNL3 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, enhancing cell viability, migration, and invasion (Li2019&lt; p&gt; The).

GNL3 also plays a role in prostate cancer, where its expression is linked to aggressive disease traits and poorer survival outcomes (Lee2015GNL3). In ovarian cancer, GNL3 contributes to radioresistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Megiorni2021OTX015). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GNL3 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
GNL3, also known as nucleostemin, is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This interaction occurs both in vivo and in vitro, with GNL3 co-localizing with p27 in the nucleus and nucleolus. The binding domains have been mapped, showing that p27 interacts with the 118-228 amino acid region of GNL3, while GNL3 interacts with the 94-198 amino acid region of p27. This interaction suggests a regulatory role of GNL3 in p27 function and expression in cancer progression (Hu2017NucleosteminGNL3).

GNL3 also interacts with TRF1, a telomere-associated protein, negatively regulating its stability by promoting degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction does not affect TRF1's ubiquitination level but accelerates its degradation, impacting telomere maintenance and cellular senescence (Zhu2006Nucleostemin). GNL3 binds to the undefined domain of TRF1, and this interaction is crucial for modulating TRF1's function in telomere dynamics (Meng2011Nucleostemin). These interactions highlight GNL3's role in regulating key proteins involved in cell cycle and telomere maintenance.
