# SEM1

## Overview
SEM1 is a gene that encodes the SEM1 26S proteasome subunit, a small, intrinsically disordered protein that plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of the 26S proteasome, a complex essential for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. The SEM1 protein, also known as DSS1 in mammals, is characterized by its ability to interact flexibly with multiple partners due to its lack of a defined secondary or tertiary structure. This flexibility allows SEM1 to act as a molecular tether, stabilizing interactions between proteasome subunits such as Rpn3 and Rpn7, which are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the proteasome (Reed2022Sem1DSS1; Tomko2014The). Beyond its role in the proteasome, SEM1 is involved in other cellular processes, including DNA repair and mRNA export, highlighting its multifunctionality and importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Reed2022Sem1DSS1). The gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where SEM1's role in DNA repair and proteasome function can influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Li2021Integrated).

## Structure
The SEM1 protein, also known as DSS1 in mammals, is a small, acidic protein with a primary structure consisting of 89 amino acid residues and a theoretical molecular mass of 10,386.15 Da (Sone2004Sem1p). Despite its small size, SEM1 plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of the 26S proteasome, particularly within the lid subcomplex of the regulatory particle (Sone2004Sem1p; Tomko2014The).

SEM1 is intrinsically disordered, lacking a defined secondary or tertiary structure, which allows it to interact flexibly with multiple partners (Tomko2014The). This intrinsic disorder is characterized by a hydrophilic sequence that enhances the solubility and stability of its binding partners, such as Rpn3 and Rpn7, within the proteasome lid (Tomko2014The). SEM1 acts as a molecular tether, facilitating the assembly of the proteasome lid by binding to Rpn3 and Rpn7 through distinct sites, which are crucial for the formation of the LP3 complex (Tomko2014The).

In terms of quaternary structure, SEM1 forms a stoichiometric complex with Rpn3 and Rpn7, stabilizing their interaction and contributing to the structural integrity of the proteasome (Bohn2013Localization; Tomko2014The). The protein's flexible linker region is essential for maintaining the necessary length for optimal binding, ensuring the ordered incorporation of these subunits into the proteasome lid (Tomko2014The).

## Function
The SEM1 gene encodes a subunit of the 26S proteasome, a critical complex for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. SEM1, also known as DSS1 in metazoans, is the smallest and only intrinsically disordered subunit of the proteasome. It plays a significant role in enhancing ATP-dependent substrate unfolding, a crucial step in protein degradation, by facilitating allosteric communication between the proteasome's lid and base. This function is achieved through its interaction with the lid subunit Rpn7, which in turn interacts with the ATPase ring, thereby modulating the Rpn7-Rpt6 contact to stimulate substrate unfolding (Reed2022Sem1DSS1).

SEM1 also acts as a molecular tether during the assembly of the proteasome lid, stabilizing the association of Rpn3 and Rpn7 subunits, which is essential for the structural integrity of the proteasome (Tomko2014The). Beyond its role in the proteasome, SEM1 is involved in other cellular processes, such as DNA repair and mRNA export, by participating in various multisubunit complexes like the BRCA2 DNA repair complex and the TREX-2 mRNA-export complex (Reed2022Sem1DSS1). SEM1's multifunctionality and its involvement in critical cellular processes underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SEM1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. SEM1 is involved in DNA repair mechanisms, and its depletion leads to hypersensitivity to DNA damage, similar to the effects observed with BRCA2 depletion in breast cancer. This suggests that SEM1 is crucial for BRCA2 stability, and mutations in SEM1 could impair DNA repair processes, affecting cancer cell survival (Li2021Integrated). 

In cancer, SEM1 expression levels are associated with patient survival outcomes. High SEM1 expression is linked to better survival in breast cancer (BRCA) patients. SEM1 is also differentially expressed across various pathological stages in multiple cancer types, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and prognosis (Li2021Integrated). 

SEM1's interactions with the proteasome are also clinically significant. Alterations in SEM1 can lead to proteasome dysfunction, which is implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and malignancies. The proteasome's role in protein degradation and cellular regulation makes SEM1 a potential target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in cancers where proteasome activity is altered (Li2021Integrated).

## Interactions
SEM1, also known as DSS1, is a component of the 26S proteasome and plays a crucial role in its assembly and function. SEM1 interacts with several proteasome subunits, including Rpn3 and Rpn7, acting as a molecular tether that stabilizes these interactions during the early stages of proteasome lid assembly. This tethering is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the LP3 complex, a precursor in proteasome lid assembly (Tomko2014The). SEM1's interaction with Rpn7 is particularly significant, as it facilitates efficient substrate degradation by modulating the contact between Rpn7 and the ATPase ring component Rpt6, enhancing ATP-dependent substrate unfolding (Reed2022Sem1DSS1).

SEM1 is also involved in stabilizing other proteins, such as Thp1 in yeast and BRCA2 in mammals, by enhancing their solubility and stability. This function is attributed to SEM1's intrinsically disordered nature, which allows it to interact flexibly with multiple binding partners (Reed2022Sem1DSS1; Tomko2014The). These interactions highlight SEM1's role in both proteasome assembly and broader cellular processes, including DNA repair through its association with the BRCA2 complex.
