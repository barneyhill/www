# ZNF17

## Overview
ZNF17 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 17, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 17 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by binding to DNA and influencing the expression of other genes. The specific functions and interactions of ZNF17 and its encoded protein are still under investigation, but they are believed to play roles in cellular differentiation and development. The protein's involvement in these processes suggests potential implications in various diseases, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance.
