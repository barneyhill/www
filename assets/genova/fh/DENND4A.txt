# DENND4A

## Overview
DENND4A is a gene that encodes the protein DENN domain containing 4A, which is a member of the DENN domain family of proteins. This protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specifically for Rab GTPases, with a particular affinity for Rab10. The DENND4A protein plays a critical role in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking, processes essential for cellular communication and homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of basolateral trafficking in polarized cells and the recycling of Glut4 in adipocytes, indicating its importance in cellular trafficking pathways (Marat2011DENN; Ishida2016Multiple). The DENND4A gene has been implicated in various diseases, including ciliopathy and neurodegenerative disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), underscoring its clinical significance (Versluys2022Expanding; Sakaguchi2022Pervasive).

## Function
DENND4A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. The protein contains a DENN domain, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases, specifically Rab10. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of basolateral trafficking in polarized cells and the recycling of Glut4 in adipocytes, suggesting a role in cellular trafficking processes (Marat2011DENN; Ishida2016Multiple).

The DENND4A protein is part of the DENND4A-4C family, which is characterized by GEF activity towards Rab10. This activity is essential for the activation of Rab GTPases, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, a process vital for Rab-mediated membrane trafficking pathways (Marat2011DENN). Although the specific function of DENND4A in healthy human cells remains undefined, its involvement in these molecular processes indicates a significant role in maintaining cellular communication and homeostasis (Marat2011DENN).

DENND4A contains a nuclear localization signal and has been shown to bind the interferon-stimulated response element in the promoter of human Myc, although its localization to the nucleus in mammals is not confirmed (Marat2011DENN).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DENND4A gene have been implicated in several diseases. A splice-site-creating mutation (SCM) in DENND4A, involving a T-to-A transversion, has been identified in a patient with ciliopathy. This mutation results in a 17-amino acid deletion within the DENN domain, potentially affecting its function. The variant is not registered in gnomAD, and its presence in a homozygous state in a ciliopathy patient suggests its possible involvement in ciliopathy pathogenesis (Sakaguchi2022Pervasive).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, the DENND4A gene is associated with motor neuron death in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The TDP-43 A315T mutant enhances the translation of Dennd4a, leading to increased expression levels of the DENND4A gene. This dysregulation is thought to contribute to motor neuron death, highlighting the gene's potential role in ALS pathogenesis (Versluys2022Expanding).

DENND4A has also been included in a gene expression signature used to distinguish Alzheimer's disease patients from non-demented controls, although specific mutations or alterations in DENND4A related to Alzheimer's disease are not detailed (FehlbaumBeurdeley2010Toward).
