# NECAP1

## Overview
NECAP1 is a gene that encodes the protein NECAP endocytosis associated 1, which plays a pivotal role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a fundamental cellular process for internalizing molecules and receptors from the cell surface. The NECAP1 protein is characterized by its involvement in the formation and regulation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) through interactions with adaptor protein complexes, particularly AP-2. It contains a conserved N-terminal PHear domain, which is part of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain superfamily, and a C-terminal WxxF motif, both of which are crucial for its function in endocytosis (Ritter2007The; Ritter2004Two). NECAP1 is highly expressed in the brain, where it is essential for synaptic vesicle recycling, impacting neurotransmitter content and synaptic transmission (Ritter2013NECAP). Mutations in the NECAP1 gene have been associated with severe neurological disorders, highlighting its critical role in brain development and function (Alazami2014NECAP1; Mizuguchi2019A).

## Structure
NECAP1 is a protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, characterized by its distinct molecular structure. The primary structure of NECAP1 includes a conserved N-terminal region comprising the PHear domain, which spans amino acids 1-133 (Ritter2007The). This domain is part of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain superfamily and is crucial for binding accessory proteins with FxDxF motifs (Ritter2007The). The PHear domain features a seven-stranded beta-barrel closed by a C-terminal alpha-helix, forming an antiparallel beta-sandwich (Ritter2007The).

The tertiary structure of NECAP1 is defined by the PHear domain's ability to mimic the binding properties of the AP-2 a-ear, providing a protein-binding interface that regulates the access of FxDxF motif-bearing proteins to the clathrin coat (Ritter2007The). NECAP1 also contains a C-terminal WxxF motif, which is essential for its interaction with the AP-2 complex, specifically binding to the a-ear domain (Ritter2004Two).

NECAP1's interactions are modulated by its structural domains, which include the PHear domain and the C-terminal WxxF motif, playing a significant role in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Ritter2013NECAP). The protein's structure allows it to interact with multiple subunits of the AP-2 complex, influencing vesicle size, number, and cargo content (Ritter2013NECAP).

## Function
NECAP1 is a gene that encodes a protein integral to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a cellular process essential for the internalization of molecules and receptors from the cell surface. The NECAP1 protein is involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) by interacting with adaptor protein complexes such as AP-2. This interaction is facilitated by the PHear domain of NECAP1, which binds to accessory proteins bearing FxDxF motifs, mimicking the binding properties of the AP-2 α-ear (Ritter2007The).

NECAP1 plays a crucial role in regulating the size, number, and cargo of vesicles during endocytosis. It modulates interactions with the AP-2 complex and stabilizes vesicle formation sites by linking the FCHo complex with AP-2, ensuring efficient recruitment of endocytic proteins (Ritter2013NECAP). NECAP1 is highly expressed in the brain, where it is critical for synaptic vesicle recycling, impacting neurotransmitter content and synaptic transmission (Ritter2013NECAP).

The protein's activity is primarily cytoplasmic, where it fine-tunes the endocytic machinery by balancing the recruitment of proteins with FxDxF motifs, thus enhancing the efficiency of endocytosis (Ritter2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NECAP1 gene have been linked to severe neurological disorders, particularly early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE). A study identified a novel homozygous truncating mutation in NECAP1 (c.142C>T; p.R48*) in a consanguineous family from southern Saudi Arabia, which led to intractable seizures, profound developmental delays, and generalized hypotonia in affected children. This mutation results in a premature truncation of the NECAP1 protein, likely causing nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA, and highlights the gene's critical role in brain development and function (Alazami2014NECAP1).

Another case of EIEE, specifically Ohtahara syndrome, was associated with a different NECAP1 mutation (c.301 + 1 G > A), which affects splicing and leads to early truncating mRNA. This mutation was identified in a Japanese boy who exhibited seizures and developmental delays, similar to the previously reported Saudi family, suggesting a common pathomechanism involving loss of NECAP1 function (Mizuguchi2019A).

These findings underscore the genetic heterogeneity of EIEE and the importance of NECAP1 in synaptic vesicle recycling, with its dysfunction contributing to epileptogenesis (Alazami2014NECAP1; Mizuguchi2019A).

## Interactions
NECAP1 is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and interacts with several proteins critical to this process. It binds directly to the α-adaptin ear domain of the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex through a unique WVQF motif, which is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Ritter2003Identification). NECAP1 also interacts with the β2-linker of AP-2, competing with clathrin for binding, which modulates the recruitment of accessory proteins and clathrin polymerization at vesicle formation sites (Ritter2013NECAP).

The PHear domain of NECAP1 interacts with amphiphysin I, a protein involved in membrane curvature sensing during vesicle formation. This interaction is mediated by the FxDxF motifs present in amphiphysin I (Ritter2007The). NECAP1 also bridges the AP-2 complex to the FCHo complex, stabilizing vesicle formation sites by interacting with proteins like Eps15 and intersectin (Ritter2013NECAP).

NECAP1's interactions with AP-2 and other endocytic proteins, such as CALM, are crucial for regulating vesicle size, number, and cargo content during endocytosis (Ritter2013NECAP). These interactions highlight NECAP1's role in the organizational control of the endocytic machinery.
