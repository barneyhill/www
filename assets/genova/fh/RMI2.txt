# RMI2

## Overview
RMI2 is a gene that encodes the RecQ mediated genome instability 2 protein, a crucial component of the Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) complex involved in maintaining genomic stability. The protein is characterized by an OB-fold domain, which facilitates its interactions with other proteins within the complex, such as RMI1 and Topoisomerase IIIα (Topo IIIα) (Velkova2021Caenorhabditis; Singh2008BLAP18RMI2). RMI2 plays a significant role in DNA repair processes, particularly in the suppression of sister chromatid exchange and the facilitation of homologous recombination, by enhancing the double Holliday junction dissolvase activity of the BLM complex (Xu2008RMI; Singh2008BLAP18RMI2). The protein's function is further regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation during mitosis, which may be important for its role in cell division (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2). Clinically, alterations in RMI2 expression are associated with various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and cervical squamous cell carcinoma, where it is implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis (Liu2019Identification; Li2021RMI2; Tsai2023A).

## Structure
RMI2 is a protein characterized by the presence of an OB-fold domain, a structural motif involved in nucleic acid binding and protein-protein interactions (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2). The OB-fold domain in RMI2 is composed of five β-sheets, forming a closed beta-barrel structure (Velkova2021Caenorhabditis). This domain is crucial for its function within the BTB complex, where it interacts with other proteins such as RMI1 and Topo IIIα (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2).

RMI2 is involved in the Bloom helicase–double Holliday junction dissolvasome, enhancing the dHJ dissolvase activity of the complex (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation during mitosis, which is confirmed by a mobility shift in gel electrophoresis (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2). This phosphorylation does not affect its interaction with the BLM complex (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2).

RMI2 is essential for the stability of the BTB complex, as its depletion leads to decreased levels of Topo IIIα and RMI1, indicating an interdependence among these proteins (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2). The protein's interaction with RMI1 occurs through the C-terminal region of RMI1, which is absent in yeast orthologs, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation in higher eukaryotes (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2).

## Function
The RMI2 gene encodes a protein that is an essential component of the Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) complex, which plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability. RMI2 is involved in DNA repair processes, particularly in suppressing sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and facilitating homologous recombination (HR). It interacts with BLM and other components of the complex, such as Topoisomerase IIIα (Topo IIIα) and RMI1, to form a stable complex that is crucial for the dissolution of double Holliday junctions (dHJ), a key step in DNA repair and replication (Xu2008RMI; Singh2008BLAP18RMI2).

RMI2 is necessary for the proper localization of the BLM complex to DNA damage sites, as it colocalizes with BLM and RMI1 in nuclear DNA repair foci. This localization is essential for the formation of BLM foci at sites of stalled replication forks, which are important for resolving DNA replication issues and preventing chromosome breaks (Xu2008RMI; Singh2008BLAP18RMI2). RMI2 also undergoes mitotic phosphorylation, which may be important for its function during cell division (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2). Through these interactions and processes, RMI2 contributes significantly to the maintenance of genomic integrity in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RMI2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and genomic instability disorders. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RMI2 is identified as a target of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, with its overexpression linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis. High RMI2 expression is associated with advanced tumor stages, increased cell proliferation, and reduced apoptosis, suggesting its role as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC (Li2021RMI2; Tsai2023A).

In cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), RMI2 is upregulated and considered an oncogene. Its expression is negatively correlated with DNA methylation, and hypomethylation of RMI2 is linked to poor prognosis, indicating its potential role in cancer pathogenesis (Liu2019Identification).

Loss of RMI2 function leads to a Bloom-like syndrome characterized by increased genome instability, prenatal and postnatal growth deficiencies, and increased sister chromatid exchange. This condition, known as a Bloomoid phenotype, highlights the critical role of RMI2 in maintaining genomic stability and proper chromosome segregation during mitosis (Hudson2016Loss).

## Interactions
RMI2 is a critical component of the BLM-Topo IIIα-RMI1-RMI2 (BTR) complex, which is essential for maintaining genome stability. It interacts directly with RMI1 through OB-fold domains, forming a stable complex that is crucial for the dissolution of double Holliday junctions (dHJ) by BLM and Topo IIIα (Xu2008RMI). RMI2 enhances the dHJ dissolvase activity of the BTB complex, suggesting its role is reliant on interactions with RMI1 and Topo IIIα (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2). The interaction between RMI1 and RMI2 is mediated by their respective OB domains, with RMI1-OB2 being necessary and sufficient for the interaction with RMI2 (Xu2008RMI).

RMI2 also plays a role in the stability of the BLM complex. Depletion of RMI2 leads to reduced levels of BLM, Topo IIIα, and RMI1, indicating its necessity for maintaining the complex's stability (Xu2008RMI). RMI2 is involved in targeting BLM to chromatin and forming BLM foci in response to DNA damage (Singh2008BLAP18RMI2). It is also implicated in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, interacting with proteins such as Dvl-2, pGSK3β, and β-catenin, which suggests a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (Tsai2023A).
