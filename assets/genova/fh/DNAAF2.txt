# DNAAF2

## Overview
The DNAAF2 gene encodes the protein dynein axonemal assembly factor 2, which is integral to the assembly and function of dynein arms in cilia. As a co-chaperone, DNAAF2 is involved in the pre-assembly of both outer and inner dynein arms within the cytoplasm, facilitating their proper formation and function. This protein is crucial for ciliary motility, which is essential for various physiological processes, including respiratory tract defense and reproductive functions. DNAAF2 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that stabilize and assemble dynein arms, highlighting its role in cellular biology. Mutations in the DNAAF2 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function and associated clinical manifestations (Dong2023Clinical; Fabczak2019Role).

## Function
The DNAAF2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of dynein arms, which are essential components of cilia. In healthy human cells, DNAAF2 is involved in the pre-assembly of outer dynein arms (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs) within the cytoplasm. These dynein arms are ATPase-based protein complexes that are vital for generating and regulating ciliary beating, which is necessary for ciliary motility (Dong2023Clinical).

The DNAAF2 protein facilitates the assembly of dynein arms into large multiprotein complexes, ensuring their proper interaction and function. This process is critical for the motility of cilia, which in turn supports various physiological processes such as clearing mucus from the airway, facilitating the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, and aiding in reproductive functions (Dong2023Clinical). The proper function and structure of cilia, supported by DNAAF2, are fundamental for maintaining mucociliary clearance, which is crucial for respiratory tract defense (Dong2023Clinical).

DNAAF2's activity in the cytoplasm is essential for the preassembly of dynein arm complexes before they are transported to cilia, highlighting its significant role in cellular and organismal biology (Dong2023Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAAF2 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function. This dysfunction leads to a range of clinical manifestations, including recurrent respiratory infections, bronchiectasis, sinusitis, otitis media, and reduced fertility. PCD patients may also exhibit laterality defects such as situs inversus or heterotaxy (Dong2023Clinical; Lucas2020Primary).

The DNAAF2 gene is crucial for the pre-assembly of dynein arms, which are essential for ciliary motility. Mutations in DNAAF2, such as the nonsense variant c.156 C>A (p.Y52*) and the novel frameshift variant c.177_178insA (p.E60fs*3), disrupt this process, leading to loss of cilia motility and the clinical features of PCD (Dong2023Clinical). Another novel variant, c.646G>T (p.E216*), has been identified in patients with similar symptoms, suggesting a potential founder mutation in certain populations (Demir2022Novel).

These genetic alterations in DNAAF2 result in defects in the outer and inner dynein arms, contributing to the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in PCD (Lucas2016European). The genetic and phenotypic variability of PCD underscores the importance of comprehensive genetic testing for accurate diagnosis (Chau2022Functional).

## Interactions
DNAAF2, also known as KTU, is involved in the preassembly of dynein arms, which are essential for ciliary function. It interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that facilitate this process. DNAAF2 interacts with DNAAF4, forming a co-chaperone complex with Hsp90, which is crucial for the stability and assembly of outer dynein arms (ODA) and inner dynein arms (IDA) heavy chains (Fabczak2019Role). This interaction is characterized by the formation of 17 hydrogen bonds and a few unfavorable bonds, with the specific residues involved differing between the wild-type and mutant forms of DNAAF2 (Li2023Identification).

DNAAF2 is also associated with the R2TP complex, which includes proteins like RPAP3 and PIH1D1, playing a role in the stabilization and assembly of dynein arms (Fabczak2019Role). It shows a strong association with DYX1C1-iso-a and a weak binding to RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, suggesting its involvement in an R2SD complex with SPAG1 and RUVBL1/2 (Maurizy2018The). These interactions highlight DNAAF2's role in forming multiprotein complexes essential for ciliary motility and function.
