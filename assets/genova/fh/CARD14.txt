# CARD14

## Overview
CARD14 is a gene that encodes the protein caspase recruitment domain family member 14, also known as CARMA2. This protein is a member of the CARD-CC family and functions as a molecular scaffold involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathways, which are critical for immune responses and inflammation. CARD14 is predominantly expressed in keratinocytes, the main cell type in the epidermis, where it plays a vital role in maintaining skin homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli. The protein contains several domains, including a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), a coiled-coil domain, and a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins such as BCL10 and MALT1 to form the CARD14-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex. This complex is essential for activating NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways. Mutations in the CARD14 gene have been linked to various inflammatory skin disorders, including psoriasis and pityriasis rubra pilaris, highlighting its clinical significance in dermatological conditions (Afonina2016The; Peled2019Lossoffunction; Mellett2020Regulation).

## Structure
CARD14, also known as CARMA2, is a protein composed of 1,004 amino acids and is characterized by several distinct domains. The protein includes a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) at the N-terminus, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with BCL10, forming part of the CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex that activates NF-κB signaling (Afonina2016The; Zotti2018CARD14CARMA2). Following the CARD domain is a coiled-coil domain that facilitates oligomerization (Afonina2016The).

CARD14 also contains a C-terminal membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) domain, which includes PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domains (Afonina2016The; Peled2019Lossoffunction). This domain is essential for the protein's function in NF-κB signaling and is involved in the structural integrity of the protein (Peled2019Lossoffunction).

Alternative splicing of CARD14 results in different isoforms, such as CARMA2sh and CARMA2cl. CARMA2sh retains the CARD, coiled-coil, and PDZ domains but lacks the SH3 and GUK domains, while CARMA2cl lacks the CARD domain and contains only a portion of the coiled-coil domain (Scudiero2011Alternative; Zotti2018CARD14CARMA2). These isoforms have distinct roles in NF-κB activation and cellular signaling (Scudiero2011Alternative).

## Function
CARD14, also known as caspase recruitment domain family member 14, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of NF-κB signaling, a key pathway in immune response and inflammation. In healthy human cells, CARD14 is primarily expressed in keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis, where it functions as a molecular scaffold. It interacts with BCL10 and MALT1 to form the CARD14-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, which is essential for activating NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways. These pathways are involved in immune responses and inflammation, contributing to the maintenance of normal skin homeostasis and response to environmental stimuli (Afonina2016The; Mellett2020Regulation).

CARD14 is also involved in the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and chemokines, such as hBD1, hBD2, and hCCL20, which are crucial for the skin's defense mechanisms against infections (Peled2019Lossoffunction). The protein's activity is tightly regulated to prevent excessive inflammation, with mechanisms such as ubiquitination and autophagy playing roles in modulating its function (Mellett2020Regulation). CARD14's role in healthy cells is vital for regulating immune responses and maintaining the integrity of skin and mucosal tissues (Mellett2020Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CARD14 gene are associated with several inflammatory skin disorders, including psoriasis and pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP). Specific gain-of-function mutations in CARD14, such as p.Gly117Ser and p.Glu138Ala, have been linked to psoriasis vulgaris and generalized pustular psoriasis, leading to enhanced NF-kB signaling, a pathway involved in inflammation (Jordan2012PSORS2; Sundberg2019Gain). These mutations can predispose individuals to psoriasis independently of other known risk factors (Jordan2012PSORS2).

CARD14 mutations are also implicated in PRP, particularly type V, which is characterized by features like salmon-colored erythroderma and palmoplantar keratoderma. Mutations such as p.Cys127Ser and p.Gln136Leu have been identified in patients with PRP type V, suggesting a strong genetic link (Takeichi2017Pityriasis). Additionally, CARD14-associated papulosquamous eruption (CAPE) presents with symptoms overlapping those of psoriasis and PRP, including erythema and facial plaques (Mellett2020Regulation).

Loss-of-function mutations in CARD14 have been associated with a severe variant of atopic dermatitis, characterized by decreased NF-kB signaling and impaired innate immune responses (Peled2019Lossoffunction). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of CARD14 mutations in skin diseases.

## Interactions
CARD14, also known as CARMA2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in signaling pathways. CARD14 physically interacts with the paracaspase MALT1, forming a complex that is essential for activating NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling pathways. This interaction is facilitated by BCL10, which acts as an adaptor between CARD14 and MALT1, forming a CARD14-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome similar to those found in T and B cells (Afonina2016The). The interaction between CARD14 and MALT1 is robust and does not depend on the complete MAGUK domain, as evidenced by the similar co-immunoprecipitation efficiency of MALT1 with both CARD14 and its splice variant CARD14sh (Afonina2016The).

CARD14 also interacts with TRAF2, which is necessary for NF-κB activation in a TRAF2-dependent manner (Afonina2016The). In prostate cancer cells, CARD14 forms an oligomeric complex with BCL10 and MALT1, which is crucial for cell survival and the expression of cancer-associated genes (Vanneste2022CARD14). CARD14 can form heterocomplexes with other CARD-CC family members, such as CARD10 and CARD11, but not with CARD9, indicating selective interactions within the CARD-CC family (Staal2020Defining).
