# CHD5

## Overview
CHD5 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The CHD5 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including tandem chromodomains, an SNF2-like ATPase domain, and PHD-finger domains, which facilitate its role in chromatin interactions and nucleosome mobilization. As a chromatin remodeler, CHD5 plays a critical role in regulating gene expression, particularly in neural tissues, where it is predominantly expressed. It is implicated in tumor suppression, with its inactivation linked to various cancers, including neuroblastoma, through mechanisms such as promoter methylation and gene silencing. Additionally, CHD5 mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in both cancer biology and neural development (Kolla2014Role; Bagchi2007CHD5; Oliver2012Multivalent).

## Structure
CHD5 is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family, characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in chromatin remodeling. The protein contains tandem chromodomains near the N-terminus and an SNF2-like ATPase domain centrally located, which are crucial for its role in chromatin interactions and nucleosome mobilization (Hall2007CHD; Oliver2012Multivalent). CHD5 also features two N-terminal PHD-finger domains, which are involved in recognizing unmodified histone H3 tails, enhancing binding affinity through a bivalent engagement mechanism (Oliver2012Multivalent).

The protein's structure includes a SANT domain, which is involved in DNA and chromatin association, and is linked to nucleosome recognition (Hall2007CHD). CHD5 can form a NuRD-type chromatin remodeling complex, associating with components like MTA1/2, HDAC1/2, and RBBP4/7, which suggests a quaternary structure involving complex formation (Kolla2015The). CHD5 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues and is implicated in tumor suppression, with mutations and downregulation linked to various cancers (Oliver2012Multivalent). The protein's role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation is crucial for its function in tumor suppression and development.

## Function
CHD5 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5) is a crucial component of the chromodomain superfamily, involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It is characterized by the presence of SWI/SNF-type helicase/ATPase and DNA binding domains, and it includes Zn binding plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers that interact with H3K4-trimethylated histones, a mark of transcriptionally active chromatin. This interaction suggests that CHD5 facilitates transcriptional activation (Bagchi2007CHD5).

In healthy human cells, CHD5 plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation, senescence, and apoptosis. It positively regulates the p53 pathway by influencing the expression of p19 Arf, an upstream inducer of p53, and is involved in the transcriptional activation of the Ink4/Arf locus, which includes p16 Ink4a and p19 Arf, both crucial for tumor-suppressive pathways (Bagchi2007CHD5). CHD5's chromatin-remodeling activity is essential for maintaining the transcriptional accessibility of these loci, thereby facilitating the expression of genes that suppress tumor formation (Bagchi2007CHD5).

CHD5 is preferentially expressed in the nervous system, particularly in the brain, fetal brain, and cerebellum, indicating its role in neural development. Its expression is low or undetectable in neuroblastoma cell lines, suggesting a potential role in preventing malignant transformation in neural tissues (Thompson2003CHD5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHD5 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. Pathogenic variants in CHD5 are linked to a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, speech delay, epilepsy, and behavioral problems. These variants include missense and truncating mutations, which often affect highly conserved amino acids and are predicted to be damaging. The clinical features observed in affected individuals include language deficits, behavioral symptoms, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and motor delay (Parenti2021Missense).

In cancer, CHD5 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Its inactivation is frequently observed in neuroblastomas, where it is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The gene is often silenced through promoter methylation, leading to decreased expression. This epigenetic silencing is linked to increased tumorigenesis in various cancers, including colorectal, breast, lung, ovarian, gastric, and gallbladder cancers. In these malignancies, low CHD5 expression correlates with worse clinical outcomes, such as higher tumor stages and shorter survival (Kolla2014Role; Fujita2008CHD5; Koyama2012Mechanisms).

Overall, CHD5 mutations and expression alterations contribute significantly to the pathogenesis and progression of both neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers.

## Interactions
CHD5 is known to form a NuRD-type chromatin remodeling complex, associating with all canonical components of the CHD4-NuRD complex. This includes interactions with proteins such as MTA1/2, HDAC1/2, GATAD2A/B, RBBP4/7, and MBD3. These interactions have been demonstrated through GST-FOG1 pull-down assays, immunoprecipitation experiments, and LC-MS/MS analysis, confirming the presence of these proteins in CHD5 immunoprecipitates (Kolla2015The).

CHD5 also interacts with the unmodified N-terminus of histone H3 through its tandem PHD-finger domains. These domains can bind two H3 N-termini simultaneously, enhancing binding affinity. The interaction is sensitive to post-translational modifications, with modifications such as methylation and acetylation disrupting high-affinity binding. This multivalent recognition is crucial for recruiting protein complexes to specific genomic loci (Oliver2012Multivalent).

Additionally, CHD5 has been noted for its potential interaction with bromodomain-containing protein BRD8, although this interaction is characterized as having low confidence based on structural predictions (Tabar2024Intrinsically).
