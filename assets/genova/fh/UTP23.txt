# UTP23

## Overview
UTP23 is a gene that encodes the UTP23 small subunit processome component, a protein integral to ribosome biogenesis in human cells. This protein is a part of the small subunit processome, a ribonucleoprotein complex that plays a crucial role in the early stages of ribosome assembly, specifically in the processing and maturation of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The UTP23 protein is characterized by the presence of a PIN domain and a Zinc finger motif, which are essential for its catalytic activity and nucleic acid binding, respectively. These structural features facilitate its interaction with U17 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and other components of the ribosome biogenesis machinery, underscoring its importance in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly. UTP23 has also been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target due to its role in ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation (Zang2024Genomic; Wells2017The; Li2022UTP23).

## Function
The UTP23 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the small subunit processome, a ribonucleoprotein complex involved in the early stages of ribosome biogenesis in human cells. UTP23 plays a pivotal role in the processing and maturation of 18S rRNA, a key component of the small ribosomal subunit. This protein is active in the nucleolus, where it participates in the assembly and modification of pre-ribosomal RNA, ensuring proper ribosome function and protein synthesis (Wells2017The).

The hUTP23 protein contains a PIN domain and a Zinc finger motif, both essential for its function. The PIN domain is involved in catalytic activity, while the Zinc finger motif is predicted to play a role in nucleic acid binding. These domains are crucial for the protein's interaction with U17 snoRNA, which is necessary for pre-rRNA cleavages at specific sites (Wells2017The). Mutations in these domains result in impaired pre-rRNA processing, highlighting their importance in ribosome biogenesis (Wells2017The).

hUTP23 also interacts with other proteins and RNA components within the small subunit processome, coordinating key interactions necessary for the maturation of 18S rRNA (Wells2017The).

## Clinical Significance
UTP23 has been identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in breast cancer, with its expression levels notably higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. High expression of UTP23 is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in early-stage breast cancer, and correlates with immune cell infiltration, affecting the tumor microenvironment (Li2022UTP23). Knockdown of UTP23 in breast cancer cell lines has been shown to significantly inhibit cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2022UTP23).

In ovarian cancer, UTP23 expression is linked to paclitaxel resistance. Down-regulation of UTP23 is associated with increased resistance to paclitaxel, poorer overall survival, and progression-free survival. This suggests that UTP23 could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in ovarian cancer, with its down-regulation promoting drug resistance through the upregulation of GDF15, a downstream target (Fu2019Downregulation).

UTP23 is also considered a potential therapeutic target in various cancers due to its frequent alterations and role in ribosome biogenesis, which is crucial for cancer growth and survival (Zang2024Genomic).

## Interactions
The human UTP23 protein, also known as hUTP23, is involved in ribosome biogenesis and interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids. It contains a PIN domain and a Zinc finger motif, both essential for its function in pre-rRNA processing. hUTP23 interacts with the U17 snoRNA, the human counterpart of the yeast snR30 snoRNA, which is crucial for pre-rRNA cleavage at specific sites (Wells2017The). The integrity of the Zinc finger is particularly important for binding to U17 snoRNA, as mutations in this motif impair the association (Wells2017The).

hUTP23 also interacts with several components of the ribosome biogenesis machinery, including the RNA helicase hROK1, the ribosome biogenesis factor hRRP7, and hUTP24. These interactions suggest that hUTP23 plays a pivotal role in remodeling the pre-rRNA region during ribosome assembly (Wells2017The). The protein-protein interactions are evolutionarily conserved, as similar interactions are observed in yeast, indicating a fundamental role in the small subunit processome (Wells2017The). These interactions are essential for the proper assembly and function of the pre-40S ribosomal particles, highlighting the critical role of hUTP23 in ribosome synthesis (Wells2017The).
