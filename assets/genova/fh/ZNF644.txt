# ZNF644

## Overview
ZNF644 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 644, a member of the Kruppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its multiple zinc finger motifs, which are essential for its role as a transcription factor involved in DNA binding and protein interactions. Zinc finger protein 644 is particularly significant in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with the G9a/GLP histone methyltransferase complex, facilitating histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, a modification associated with transcriptional repression (Bian2015The; Olsen2016G9a). The protein's function extends to neurogenesis, where it acts as a co-regulator in gene silencing, crucial for the differentiation of neural progenitor cells (Olsen2016G9a). Mutations in the ZNF644 gene have been linked to high myopia, highlighting its clinical significance in ocular development and disease (Szczerkowska2019Myopia; Shi2011Exome).

## Structure
ZNF644 is a zinc finger protein that contains multiple zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its function in DNA binding and protein interactions. The protein is part of the Kruppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family and includes seven C2H2-type zinc fingers, which are typically involved in binding to DNA and are characteristic of transcription factors (Shi2011Exome). ZNF644 also contains an atypical C2H2-like zinc finger motif necessary for its interaction with the G9a/GLP complex, which is involved in histone methylation and gene silencing (Olsen2016G9a).

The protein's structure includes eight zinc finger motifs, which likely function to recognize specific DNA sequences, facilitating the recruitment of the G9a/GLP complex to chromatin for transcriptional repression (Bian2015The). The N-terminus of ZNF644 interacts with the transcription activation domain of G9a, indicating a specific domain interaction crucial for its function (Bian2015The).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may affect ZNF644's function and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially altering its structure and function.

## Function
ZNF644 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in gene repression by interacting with the G9a/GLP complex, a histone methyltransferase responsible for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9). This methylation is associated with transcriptional repression. ZNF644, along with WIZ, acts as a core subunit of this complex, facilitating the targeting of G9a to specific genomic loci, which is essential for the methylation process and subsequent gene silencing (Bian2015The).

In healthy human cells, ZNF644 is involved in the regulation of gene transcription by mediating the recruitment of the G9a/GLP complex to chromatin. This interaction is crucial for the chromatin association of G9a and GLP, which in turn regulates gene expression by catalyzing H3K9me2 at promoter regions (Bian2015The). ZNF644 contains multiple zinc finger motifs that likely help in recognizing specific DNA sequences, thereby facilitating the recruitment of the G9a/GLP complex to genomic loci for transcriptional repression (Bian2015The).

ZNF644's role extends to neurogenesis, where it acts as a co-regulator of G9a/H3K9me2-mediated gene silencing, particularly in neural progenitor cells. This function is crucial for the suppression of progenitor gene expression, facilitating the transition of proliferating progenitor cells to differentiated states (Olsen2016G9a).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF644 gene have been associated with high myopia, a condition characterized by severe nearsightedness due to axial elongation of the eye globe. Studies have identified several mutations in ZNF644, including missense mutations such as S672G, I587V, R680G, and C699Y, as well as mutations in the 3' untranslated region (Shi2011Exome). These mutations are linked to high myopia in both familial and sporadic cases, although they appear to play a more significant role in monogenic forms of the disease (Shi2011Exome). The S672G mutation, in particular, has been noted for its potential damaging effects, although predictions about its impact vary (Jiang2014Detection).

In mouse models, the equivalent mutation S673G in the Zfp644 gene has been shown to cause significant changes in ocular parameters, mimicking the human condition of high myopia. These models demonstrate that mutations in Zfp644 can lead to myopia by altering the optical axis, with the S673G mutation showing a weak dominant negative effect (Szczerkowska2019Myopia). The interaction of ZNF644 with the histone methyltransferase G9a is crucial for gene silencing during neurogenesis, and disruptions in this interaction may contribute to the pathogenesis of high myopia (Olsen2016G9a).

## Interactions
ZNF644 is known to physically interact with the histone methyltransferases G9a and GLP, forming a complex that plays a crucial role in gene repression during neurogenesis. This interaction is mediated through the atypical C2H2-like zinc finger motif of ZNF644, which binds directly to the SET domain of G9a and GLP. This binding is essential for the regulation of H3K9me2, a histone modification associated with gene silencing, but does not affect other methylation marks like H3K9me3 (Olsen2016G9a).

ZNF644, along with WIZ, is a core subunit of the G9a/GLP complex, facilitating the complex's localization to specific genomic loci. This targeting is crucial for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), which leads to transcriptional repression. The chromatin association of G9a and GLP is dependent on ZNF644 and WIZ, as their knockdown impairs the complex's chromatin binding (Bian2015The).

In zebrafish models, ZNF644 orthologs znf644a and znf644b have been shown to interact with G9a, playing a role in retinal development by regulating progenitor gene expression and cell proliferation (Olsen2016G9a).
