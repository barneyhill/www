# CTCFL

## Overview
CTCFL, also known as Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS), is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in chromatin organization and gene regulation. The protein product of CTCFL, characterized by its 11 zinc finger domains, is structurally similar to the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) but exhibits distinct functional roles, particularly in male germ cell development. Unlike CTCF, CTCFL is primarily expressed in testicular germ cells and plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis by regulating testis-specific genes. It competes with CTCF for DNA binding sites, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. CTCFL's aberrant expression is associated with various cancers, including breast and ovarian cancer, and it has been implicated in vascular abnormalities, highlighting its clinical significance (Sleutels2012The; Jelinic2006The; Sati2021CTCFL; Voutsadakis2018Molecular).

## Structure
The CTCFL protein, also known as BORIS, is characterized by a central domain consisting of 11 zinc fingers, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. These zinc fingers are highly homologous to those found in its paralog, CTCF, with a 74% identity, suggesting similar DNA recognition capabilities (Jelinic2006The). The zinc finger region is the most conserved part of the protein, while the N- and C-terminal domains show no significant homology with CTCF, indicating distinct functional roles (Sleutels2012The).

CTCFL is expressed as multiple isoforms, with 23 alternatively spliced mRNAs resulting in 17 different protein products. These isoforms are grouped into six subfamilies based on their alternatively spliced C termini (Loukinov2018Targeting). The N-terminal region of CTCFL, approximately 255 amino acids long, interacts with protein methyltransferase PRMT7 and histones H1, H2A, and H3, suggesting a role in chromatin structure stabilization and histone methylation (Jelinic2006The).

The protein is involved in post-translational modifications, such as enhancing PRMT7's methylation of histones H2A and H4, which may facilitate the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases (Jelinic2006The). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CTCFL are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
CTCFL, also known as BORIS, is a transcription factor primarily expressed in testicular germ cells, where it plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis. It is involved in organizing chromatin and regulating gene expression by binding to DNA at CTCF-like consensus sites, with its binding influenced by nucleosome composition (Sleutels2012The). CTCFL is transiently present during spermatogenesis, particularly before meiosis, and co-localizes with CTCF in the nuclei, indicating its involvement in the early stages of germ cell development (Sleutels2012The).

CTCFL affects the expression of testis-specific genes such as Stra8 and Prss50, which are essential for meiosis and spermatogenesis (Nishana2020Defining; Sleutels2012The). It competes with CTCF for binding sites, influencing the regulation of these genes and potentially altering chromatin structure (Sleutels2012The). Despite its similarities to CTCF, CTCFL cannot fully replicate CTCF's function as an insulator, as it lacks the ability to bind cohesin, a protein complex crucial for maintaining chromatin organization (Nishana2020Defining). This functional distinction highlights CTCFL's unique role in male germ cell development and its contribution to genomic regulation.

## Clinical Significance
CTCFL, also known as BORIS, is implicated in various cancers due to its aberrant expression and genetic alterations. In breast cancer, CTCFL is often amplified, occurring in about 7-8% of cases, and its high mRNA levels are associated with a trend towards worse overall survival, particularly in HER2-positive cases (Voutsadakis2018Molecular). In ovarian cancer, CTCFL is highly expressed and considered an oncogene, with its involvement in the PI3K-Akt pathway suggesting potential as a target for personalized therapy (SalgadoAlbarrán2022CTCFL). High CTCFL expression in ovarian cancer is linked to worse survival outcomes in both early and advanced stages (Voutsadakis2018Molecular).

CTCFL is also associated with cerebral vascular abnormalities, such as cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Studies in transgenic mice have shown that inappropriate expression of CTCFL can lead to severe vascular abnormalities and localized hemorrhages, similar to CCM and AVM in humans (Sati2021CTCFL). The gene's expression in these conditions suggests a potential role in vascular development and abnormalities (Sati2021CTCFL). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CTCFL in both oncological and vascular contexts.

## Interactions
CTCFL, also known as BORIS, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in gene regulation. It interacts with the protein methyltransferase PRMT7, facilitating the methylation of histones H2A and H4. This interaction is crucial for the methylation of the H19 imprinting control region (ICR), where CTCFL acts as an accessory protein to enhance PRMT7's activity (Jelinic2006The). CTCFL also binds to histones H1, H2A, and H3, which may help PRMT7 associate with specific chromatin regions due to CTCFL's DNA binding specificity (Jelinic2006The).

CTCFL competes with CTCF for binding to specific DNA sites, such as those within the Stra8 and Prss50 promoters. This competitive binding affects the binding dynamics of CTCF across the genome, as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo experiments (Sleutels2012The). CTCFL's binding is influenced by nucleosome composition and is enriched at transcriptionally active promoters marked by H3K4me3 and PolII phosphorylation (Sleutels2012The). It also associates with actively translating ribosomes and binds to distinct sets of RNA transcripts, indicating its involvement in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation (Ogunkolade2013BORISCTCFL).
