# SLC16A9

## Overview
The SLC16A9 gene encodes the protein monocarboxylate transporter 9 (MCT9), a member of the solute carrier family 16, which is characterized by its role in transporting monocarboxylates across cellular membranes. MCT9 is a transmembrane protein with 12 transmembrane-spanning domains, facilitating the transport of substrates such as creatine, and is sensitive to extracellular pH and sodium (Na+) concentrations (Halestrap2013The; Meredith2008The; Futagi2020Molecular). This transporter is implicated in various physiological processes, including creatine transport and urate handling, and has been associated with clinical conditions such as gout and blood pressure regulation (Simino2013Genealcohol; Nakayama2013A). Variations in the SLC16A9 gene have also been linked to treatment outcomes in chronic hepatitis B, highlighting its potential significance in personalized medicine (Jansen2014HBsAg).

## Structure
The SLC16A9 gene encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 9 (MCT9), which is part of the solute carrier family 16. This family is characterized by proteins with a typical structure of 12 transmembrane-spanning domains (TMDs), forming a channel for substrate transport across cellular membranes (Halestrap2013The; Meredith2008The). The N- and C-termini of these proteins are located intracellularly, a common feature among members of this family (Halestrap2004The).

While specific details about the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of SLC16A9 are not provided, the protein is known to be sensitive to extracellular pH and sodium (Na+) concentrations, indicating a functional role in creatine transport (Futagi2020Molecular). The transporter exhibits two components of creatine uptake with different affinities, suggesting a complex interaction with its substrates (Futagi2020Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, are common in the SLC16 family, potentially affecting the function and localization of these transporters, although specific modifications for SLC16A9 are not detailed in the available literature. The protein's role in creatine transport and its sensitivity to pH and Na+ suggest a specialized function within the broader family of monocarboxylate transporters (Futagi2020Molecular).

## Function
The SLC16A9 gene encodes the human monocarboxylate transporter 9 (hMCT9), which is part of the solute carrier family 16. This transporter is involved in the movement of monocarboxylates across plasma membranes, with a specific role in creatine transport. hMCT9 functions as an extracellular pH- and sodium (Na+)-sensitive creatine transporter, indicating its activity is influenced by the surrounding pH and Na+ levels (Futagi2020Molecular). The transport activity of hMCT9 increases with higher pH levels and is significantly reduced in Na+-free conditions, suggesting a partial dependence on sodium ions (Futagi2020Molecular). 

hMCT9 is also sensitive to changes in hydrogen ion (H+) gradients, as demonstrated by the inhibition of its activity by a protonophore, supporting its potential role as an H+/creatine exchanger (Futagi2020Molecular). The transporter is expressed in urate-excreting organs such as the intestine and kidney, and it has been associated with serum uric acid levels and the risk of renal overload gout, indicating its involvement in urate handling and possibly contributing to cellular energy metabolism (Nakayama2013A; Futagi2020Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the SLC16A9 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. A study by Huang et al. identified a rare missense variant (c.277C>A, p.L93M) in SLC16A9 that cosegregates with early-onset gout in a family pedigree. This variant is located in a highly conserved functional domain, suggesting strong pathogenicity. The study provides evidence linking SLC16A9 to genetic predisposition to gout, particularly in early-onset cases (Huang2020WholeExome).

In the context of blood pressure regulation, the SLC16A9 gene has been implicated in gene-alcohol interactions affecting blood pressure. Simino et al. found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near SLC16A9, rs10826334, interacts with alcohol consumption to influence systolic blood pressure. This interaction suggests that genetic susceptibility to alcohol's effects on blood pressure varies among individuals, highlighting the role of SLC16A9 in modulating blood pressure in response to alcohol intake (Simino2013Genealcohol).

Additionally, variations in SLC16A9 have been associated with treatment outcomes in chronic hepatitis B. A study by Jansen et al. found that the SNP rs12356193 in SLC16A9 is linked to the loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a and adefovir, suggesting a potential role in influencing treatment response (Jansen2014HBsAg).
