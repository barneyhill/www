# PUM2

## Overview
PUM2 is a gene that encodes the pumilio RNA binding family member 2 protein, which is a crucial component of the Pumilio family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its conserved Pumilio homology domain (PUM-HD), which facilitates specific RNA-binding capabilities, particularly recognizing the UGUA motif. As a regulatory RNA-binding protein, PUM2 plays a significant role in post-transcriptional gene regulation by binding to the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of target mRNAs, thereby influencing their stability and translation. It is involved in various cellular processes, including stem cell proliferation, neuronal function, and mitochondrial dynamics. PUM2's interactions with other proteins, such as the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and DAZ family proteins, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis. Alterations in PUM2 expression or function have been linked to several clinical conditions, including neurological disorders, cancer, and age-related mitochondrial dysfunction (D’Amico2019The; Shigunov2012PUMILIO2; Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional).

## Structure
PUM2, a member of the Pumilio family of RNA-binding proteins, features a conserved Pumilio homology domain (PUM-HD) responsible for its RNA-binding capabilities. This domain typically consists of eight tandem Pum repeats that form a crescent-shaped structure, facilitating the specific recognition and binding of RNA sequences, particularly the UGUA motif (Nishanth2019Functions; Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional). The PUM-HD is characterized by α-helical Pum repeats, which use a tripartite recognition motif to interact with RNA bases through hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, and stacking interactions (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional).

The PUM2 protein can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Nishanth2019Functions). PUM2 exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can result in variations in the number of Pum repeats and potentially alter its RNA-binding properties (Nishanth2019Functions). The protein's structure and function are highly conserved across species, underscoring its critical role in post-transcriptional gene regulation (Fox2005Identification).

## Function
PUM2 (pumilio RNA binding family member 2) is a regulatory RNA-binding protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. It primarily functions by binding to specific sequences in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of target mRNAs, influencing their stability and translation. PUM2 is known to recruit the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, leading to mRNA deadenylation and degradation, thereby repressing mRNA translation and stability (Van2012Human).

In human adipose-derived stem cells, PUM2 plays a crucial role in promoting cellular proliferation. It is involved in maintaining mitotic division and self-renewal of stem cells, which is essential for the proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (Shigunov2012PUMILIO2). PUM2 also regulates neuronal morphology and synaptic function by repressing the translation of specific mRNAs, such as eIF4E, which is critical for maintaining normal neuronal structure and function (Vessey2010Mammalian).

PUM2 is expressed in various tissues, including embryonic stem cells and adult germline cells, and is associated with stress granules and P-body-like structures, indicating its involvement in post-transcriptional regulation (Shigunov2012PUMILIO2). It also plays a role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and function, impacting cellular homeostasis and potentially influencing aging processes (D’Amico2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PUM2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the nervous system, PUM2 plays a critical role in regulating neuronal functions. Its inactivation has been associated with increased seizure susceptibility, hyperactivity, and behavioral deficiencies, potentially contributing to neurological disorders such as epilepsy (Goldstrohm2018Posttranscriptional).

In cancer, PUM2 expression levels are notably altered. In glioma, PUM2 expression is significantly lower compared to normal brain tissues, and its reduced expression correlates with decreased patient survival. PUM2 interacts with UBE2I, and its SUMOylation leads to degradation, affecting glioma cell behaviors like migration and invasion (Wang2020SUMOylation). In breast cancer, PUM2 expression is decreased, and its overexpression inhibits malignant behaviors, suggesting a protective role against cancer progression (Tao2020Silencing).

PUM2 is also involved in aging processes. It is upregulated with age and negatively impacts mitochondrial dynamics by repressing the translation of mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), leading to impaired mitochondrial function. This suggests that PUM2 may contribute to age-related mitochondrial dysfunction (D’Amico2019The).

## Interactions
PUM2, a member of the Pumilio family of RNA-binding proteins, is involved in various interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids. It directly binds to the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, specifically interacting with multiple CNOT subunits, including CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT6, and CNOT7. This interaction is crucial for PUM2's role in mRNA stability and translation regulation (Enwerem2020Human).

PUM2 also forms a stable complex with DAZ (Deleted in Azoospermia) and DAZ-like proteins, which are important for germ cell development. This interaction has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments in yeast and primate cells, as well as in mouse testis extracts (Moore2003Human). The RNA-binding domain of PUM2, which includes eight Pumilio Fbf (PUF) repeats, is essential for its interaction with DAZ (Moore2003Human).

In terms of nucleic acid interactions, PUM2 binds to specific RNA sequences, particularly in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs. It recognizes the Nanos regulatory element (NRE) sequence, similar to its Drosophila counterpart, and can bind to the 3' UTR of the SDAD1 transcript, among others (Fox2005Identification). These interactions are critical for PUM2's function in post-transcriptional regulation.
