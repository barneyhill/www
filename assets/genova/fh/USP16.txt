# USP16

## Overview
Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 16 (USP16) is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage repair. The USP16 protein is characterized by its complex structure, featuring distinct domains such as the ZnF-UBP domain and a unique catalytic triad, which contribute to its enzymatic activity (Zheng2023The). As a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP16 is involved in the removal of ubiquitin from histone H2A, thereby influencing chromatin dynamics and gene expression (Zheng2023The). It interacts with several proteins and pathways, including the NF-κB signaling pathway and ribosome biogenesis, highlighting its diverse functional roles (Yu2021Substratespecific; Montellese2020USP16). Clinically, alterations in USP16 expression are associated with various diseases, such as Down syndrome, cancer, and autoimmune disorders, underscoring its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Ge2021USP16; Zhang2014The).

## Structure
The USP16 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains and features. It forms a tetramer in solution, although its large size and disordered regions make structural determination challenging using traditional methods like NMR or X-ray crystallography (Zheng2023The). The protein contains a ZnF-UBP domain, which has been experimentally determined to form a two-layer sandwich with four α-helices surrounding a five-stranded β-sheet, chelating three zinc ions (Zheng2023The). The catalytic domain (CD) of USP16 adopts a hand-like USP fold with palm, thumb, and fingers subdomains, featuring additional structural elements such as a β-hairpin and an extended helix-turn-helix motif in the thumb subdomain, and an extra short α-helix in the fingers subdomain (Zheng2023The).

USP16 has a unique catalytic triad composed of Cys205, His758, and Ser797, differing from the typical Cys-His-Asn/Asp triad found in other USPs (Zheng2023The). The protein also contains a disordered region involved in post-translational modifications and protein-peptide interactions, with a conserved CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES) and a non-canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Zheng2023The). The linker between the ZnF-UBP and USP domains is mainly disordered and interacts with the HECT-type E3 Ub ligase HERC2 (Zheng2023The). USP16 is phosphorylated at several sites, including Ser330, Ser415, and Ser552, which are linked to nuclear import and mitotic progression (Zheng2023The).

## Function
USP16, or ubiquitin-specific peptidase 16, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression by removing ubiquitin from histone H2A at Lys119, which is crucial for DNA damage repair and proper cell cycle progression (Zheng2023The). USP16 is phosphorylated during mitosis, facilitating chromosome segregation and the phosphorylation of histone H3 Ser10 (Zheng2023The). It acts as an antagonist to H2A ubiquitination by Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), thereby relieving repressive effects on development-related genes in stem cells (Zheng2023The).

USP16 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm during interphase and becomes phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which is crucial for cell proliferation and cell cycle progression through the G2/M phase (Zheng2023The). It also plays a role in ribosome biogenesis by deubiquitinating RPS27a, essential for the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Montellese2020USP16). In the hematopoietic system, USP16 is vital for the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into progenitor cells (Zheng2023The). Its functions extend to various physiological processes, including immune response, cancer progression, and cardiovascular health (Zheng2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the USP16 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In Down syndrome, the triplication of chromosome 21 leads to increased USP16 expression, contributing to defects in somatic stem cell lineages and reduced self-renewal capacity. This overexpression is linked to impaired cellular responses to DNA damage, which may exacerbate developmental issues associated with the condition (Zheng2023The; Zhang2014The).

In cancer, USP16 plays a dual role. It is often downregulated in certain cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, where its reduced expression is associated with increased tumor growth and stem-like features. Conversely, in castration-resistant prostate cancer, USP16 stabilizes the oncoprotein c-Myc, promoting cell proliferation and tumor progression. Elevated USP16 expression correlates with higher Gleason scores in prostate cancer, indicating its role in disease severity (Zheng2023The; Ge2021USP16).

USP16 is also implicated in autoimmune diseases. It is involved in T cell activation and proliferation, with increased expression observed in conditions like multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. USP16 deficiency in T cells leads to impaired immune responses, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in autoimmune disorders (Zhang2019USP16mediated).

## Interactions
USP16, a ubiquitin-specific peptidase, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with histone H2A, deubiquitinating it at Lys-119 and Lys-15, which is crucial for DNA damage repair and gene expression regulation (Zhang2014The). USP16 forms a complex with HERC2 and RNF8, with HERC2 serving as a platform to recruit USP16 during the DNA damage response (Zhang2014The). This interaction is enhanced by ionizing radiation, facilitating USP16's recruitment under DNA damage conditions (Zhang2014The).

USP16 also interacts with the NF-κB pathway by associating with IKKβ and p105, which is essential for NF-κB signaling. This interaction is dependent on the kinase domain of IKKβ and is crucial for the phosphorylation of p105 (Yu2021Substratespecific). In cancer, USP16 stabilizes IGF2BP3 in gallbladder cancer and JAK1 in lung adenocarcinoma, promoting tumorigenesis (Zheng2023The). It also interacts with the LDL receptor, protecting it from degradation, which may have implications for atherosclerosis treatment (Zheng2023The). These interactions highlight USP16's diverse roles in physiological and pathological processes.
