# RFTN2

## Overview
RFTN2, or raftlin family member 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including those related to bone mineral density and muscle mass. The protein encoded by RFTN2 is part of the raftlin family, which is known for its role in cellular signaling and structural organization within lipid rafts. These lipid rafts are specialized microdomains in the cell membrane that facilitate signal transduction and protein sorting. RFTN2 has been implicated in several physiological and pathological conditions, such as bone density-related disorders and rheumatoid arthritis, through its genetic variants and expression patterns. Additionally, RFTN2 expression is modulated in response to DNA damage in cancer cells, suggesting a potential role in the DNA damage response pathway (Zhou2017Identification; Wei2018Etoposideinduced; Tan2021Identification).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
RFTN2 (raftlin family member 2) has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in bone mineral density (BMD) and muscle mass. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11888760, located on chromosome 2q33.1, affects the expression of RFTN2 in skeletal muscle. The T allele of this SNP is associated with lower expression of RFTN2, which correlates with reduced femoral neck BMD and whole-body lean mass (Tan2021Identification). Increased expression of RFTN2 has been linked to decreased BMD, suggesting its potential involvement in bone density-related conditions (Tan2021Identification).

RFTN2 has also been identified as having novel genetic variants associated with both femoral neck BMD and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These findings, derived from a pleiotropic analysis, suggest that RFTN2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions, although the specific clinical significance remains to be fully understood (Zhou2017Identification).

In the context of cancer biology, RFTN2 is upregulated in breast cancer cells following etoposide treatment, indicating a potential role in the DNA damage response. However, the precise implications of RFTN2 expression changes in cancer are not yet clear (Wei2018Etoposideinduced).
