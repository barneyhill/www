# RSRC1

## Overview
The RSRC1 gene encodes the arginine and serine rich coiled-coil 1 protein, which is a member of the serine and arginine-rich-related protein family. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process in gene expression (Perez2018RSRC1). RSRC1 is involved in both constitutive and alternative splicing of mRNA, localizing to nuclear speckles where it interacts with other SR-family proteins and the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor (Perez2018RSRC1; Scala2020RSRC1). The protein's structure includes an RS domain and a coiled-coil domain, which are essential for its function in RNA processing and protein-protein interactions (Scala2020RSRC1). RSRC1 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, indicating its significant role in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and RNA processing (Perez2018RSRC1).

## Structure
The RSRC1 protein, encoded by the RSRC1 gene, is a serine and arginine-rich coiled-coil protein involved in RNA splicing. It consists of 334 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 53 kDa (Scala2020RSRC1). The protein includes an RS domain, which is rich in arginine (R) and serine (S) residues, crucial for mediating interactions with other splicing regulators (Scala2020RSRC1). This domain is involved in splicing regulation and is a characteristic feature of proteins that participate in RNA processing (Perez2018RSRC1).

RSRC1 also contains a coiled-coil domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, including interaction with the estrogen receptor beta (ERb) and enhancement of ERb SUMOylation (Scala2020RSRC1). Specific lysine residues, K196 and K230, are necessary for RSRC1 SUMOylation by SUMO1 and the E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS3, indicating post-translational modifications that influence its function (Scala2020RSRC1).

The protein is localized to nuclear speckles, where it interacts with other SR-family proteins and the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor, suggesting a role in both constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing (Perez2018RSRC1). The RSRC1 gene can produce splice variant isoforms, potentially altering its functional properties (Perez2018RSRC1).

## Function
The RSRC1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression. This protein is part of the serine and arginine-rich-related protein family and is involved in both constitutive and alternative splicing of mRNA. RSRC1 localizes to nuclear speckles and interacts with other SR-family proteins and the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor, playing a significant role in the second step of pre-mRNA splicing (Perez2018RSRC1; Scala2020RSRC1).

In healthy human cells, RSRC1 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes. It is particularly involved in transcription regulation by interacting with the transcription factor estrogen receptor beta (ERb), repressing its activity through PIAS1-mediated SUMOylation. This interaction suggests RSRC1's involvement in multiple systems, including the central nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune systems (Perez2018RSRC1).

RSRC1 also plays a role in post-transcriptional modifications and RNA processing, with poly(A) RNA binding being a notable molecular function. Its activity in the nucleus is crucial for maintaining normal cellular and physiological functions, highlighting its importance in splicing and transcriptional regulation (Perez2018RSRC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RSRC1 gene are associated with a range of neurological and developmental disorders. These mutations can lead to autosomal recessive intellectual disability, characterized by developmental delays, speech difficulties, and motor impairments. The condition is often associated with additional features such as hypotonia and facial dysformities. The loss of function in the RSRC1 gene, due to mutations, is a significant factor in these conditions, affecting the gene's ability to regulate essential processes in the body (Scala2020RS, 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 2020; 

## Interactions
The RSRC1 protein is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes such as transcription regulation and RNA processing. RSRC1 is part of the serine and arginine-rich-related protein family and interacts with other SR-family proteins and the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor, which are crucial for pre-mRNA splicing (Perez2018RSRC1). It is localized to nuclear speckles, where it participates in the regulation of alternative splicing and transcription. RSRC1 also interacts with the transcription factor estrogen receptor beta (ERb), repressing its activity through PIAS1-mediated SUMOylation (Scala2020RSRC1).

In the context of cancer, RSRC1 has been shown to regulate PTEN expression, a well-known tumor suppressor, although this regulation does not occur at the transcriptional level. This interaction is significant in gastric cancer, where RSRC1 suppresses cell proliferation and migration by influencing PTEN and FAK expression (Yu2019RSRC1). The protein's involvement in these interactions highlights its role in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as intellectual disability and cancer. These interactions suggest that RSRC1 is a critical component in the regulation of gene expression and cellular signaling pathways.
