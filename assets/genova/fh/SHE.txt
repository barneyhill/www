# SHE

## Overview
The SHE gene encodes the Src homology 2 domain containing E (SHE) protein, which is a member of the SH2 domain-containing family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind phosphotyrosine residues, playing a crucial role in signal transduction pathways. The SHE protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival, by mediating interactions between different signaling molecules. Its function is critical in the regulation of pathways that can influence oncogenic transformation and other pathophysiological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
