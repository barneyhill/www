# TMLHE

## Overview
The TMLHE gene encodes the enzyme e-N-trimethyllysine hydroxylase, epsilon, which is a non-heme Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase. This enzyme is integral to the carnitine biosynthesis pathway, catalyzing the initial step in the conversion of trimethyllysine to carnitine, a vital process for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-oxidation (Nava2012Analysis; Hulse1978Carnitine). The enzyme is primarily active in the mitochondria and is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis and efficient fatty acid metabolism (Hulse1978Carnitine). Mutations in the TMLHE gene have been linked to autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance (Nava2012Analysis).

## Function
The TMLHE gene encodes the enzyme e-N-trimethyllysine hydroxylase, which plays a crucial role in the carnitine biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the conversion of trimethyllysine to carnitine, a process essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-oxidation, a critical energy production process in cells (Nava2012Analysis; Hulse1978Carnitine). TMLHE is a non-heme Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase, and its activity is tightly coupled with the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinate (Wang2019Investigating).

The enzyme is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to maintaining energy homeostasis and efficient fatty acid metabolism (Hulse1978Carnitine). TMLHE's function is particularly important in tissues where endogenous carnitine synthesis occurs, such as the liver, kidney, and brain, although the majority of carnitine is obtained from dietary sources (Nava2012Analysis). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the hydroxylation of (2S)-N ε-trimethyllysine, facilitating its conversion to (2S,3S)-3-hydroxy-N ε-trimethyllysine, a precursor in the carnitine biosynthesis pathway (Wang2019Investigating).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMLHE gene have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). The gene encodes the enzyme e-N-trimethyllysine hydroxylase, which is crucial for the first step of carnitine biosynthesis. A nonsense mutation, p.Arg77X, and missense mutations, such as p.Asp244His and p.Glu369Asp, have been identified in individuals with ASD and ID, but not in those with Asperger syndrome. These mutations are thought to lead to a loss of function of the TMLHE protein, resulting in increased levels of trimethyllysine, a precursor in carnitine biosynthesis, in patients' plasma (Nava2012Analysis).

A deletion of exon 2 in the TMLHE gene has also been identified as a copy number variation (CNV) associated with ASD. This deletion results in the loss of TMLD activity, leading to metabolic abnormalities, including low carnitine levels, which are crucial for mitochondrial metabolism and the transport of long-chain fatty acids for β-oxidation (Liepinsh2023Knockout; CelestinoSoper2011Use). However, studies using Tmlhe knockout mouse models suggest that low carnitine levels alone may not be sufficient to cause ASD or related dysfunctions, indicating that other factors may influence the clinical manifestations of disorders associated with TMLHE mutations (Liepinsh2023Knockout).
