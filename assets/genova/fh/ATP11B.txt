# ATP11B

## Overview
ATP11B is a gene that encodes the ATPase phospholipid transporting 11B (putative), a protein belonging to the P4-ATPase family, which functions as a phospholipid flippase. This protein is integral to maintaining membrane asymmetry by translocating phosphatidylserine across cellular membranes, a process crucial for various cellular activities such as synaptic plasticity, vesicle formation, and trafficking (Wang2019ATP11B; Andersen2016P4ATPases). ATP11B is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and endosomal membranes, where it influences cell migration and signaling pathways (Halleck2002Reanalysis). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in health and disease, including roles in cancer metastasis and neurological disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Xu2022ATP11B; Quick2022Loss).

## Structure
The ATP11B protein is a member of the P4-ATPase family, which are phospholipid-transporting ATPases. It is composed of a large polypeptide with four main domains: the N-domain, which binds ATP; the P-domain, containing a conserved aspartic acid residue for phosphorylation; the A-domain, which facilitates dephosphorylation; and the M-domain, responsible for translocating lipid substrates across membranes (Andersen2016P4ATPases). The M-domain is predicted to have 10 transmembrane segments, with M1-M6 forming the principal transport unit (Andersen2016P4ATPases).

The ATP11B gene consists of 30 exons and 29 introns, and it may produce splice variant isoforms, as indicated by the presence of transcripts with and without exon 12, which contains the TM4 sequence (Halleck2002Reanalysis). The protein's structure includes a DGET motif located in the A-domain, which is crucial for its function (Xu2022ATP11B).

ATP11B interacts with CDC50 proteins, which are essential for its proper folding and function as a phospholipid flippase (Andersen2016P4ATPases). These interactions likely form heteromeric complexes, contributing to the protein's quaternary structure. The protein's localization is primarily within the Golgi/recycling endosomal system, although it can also be present on the plasma membrane (Andersen2016P4ATPases).

## Function
ATP11B is a member of the P4-ATPase family, functioning as a phospholipid flippase that plays a crucial role in maintaining membrane asymmetry by translocating phosphatidylserine (PS) across cellular membranes. This activity is essential for various cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity, vesicle formation, and trafficking (Wang2019ATP11B; Halleck2002Reanalysis). In healthy human cells, ATP11B is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus and endosomal membranes, where it influences cell migration and signaling pathways (Halleck2002Reanalysis).

In the nervous system, ATP11B is involved in regulating synaptic plasticity by affecting the distribution of PS, which is critical for synaptic structure and function. It enhances glutamate release, receptor expression, and intracellular calcium concentration in hippocampal neurons, processes mediated through the MAPK14 signaling pathway (Wang2019ATP11B). ATP11B also influences the expression of synapse-associated proteins, contributing to the maintenance of synaptic ultrastructure and function (Wang2019ATP11B).

Overall, ATP11B's role in maintaining membrane asymmetry and regulating intracellular signaling pathways is vital for normal cellular function and organismal health, particularly in neural systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ATP11B gene have been implicated in several diseases. In breast cancer, ATP11B acts as a metastasis suppressor, particularly in BRCA1-deficient tumors. Low expression of ATP11B, combined with high expression of PTDSS2, leads to the externalization of phosphatidylserine on the cell membrane, promoting an immunosuppressive environment that facilitates metastasis. This is especially significant in triple-negative breast cancers, which are often associated with BRCA1 mutations (Xu2022ATP11B).

In cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), the loss of ATP11B expression results in endothelial cell dysfunction, which is a key factor in the disease's pathology. This dysfunction occurs even in the absence of hypertension, suggesting that ATP11B plays a critical role in maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity and normal cerebral vasculature. The loss of ATP11B leads to changes in white matter and other brain structures, contributing to the development of SVD and associated conditions like vascular dementia and stroke (Quick2022Loss).

These findings highlight the potential of ATP11B as a therapeutic target in both cancer and neurological diseases, where its normal function is disrupted.

## Interactions
ATP11B, a P4-type ATPase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. In ovarian cancer cells, ATP11B interacts with SNARE proteins such as syntaxin-6 (STX6) and vesicular-associated membrane protein 4 (VAMP4). These interactions are particularly significant in the context of cisplatin resistance, as ATP11B, STX6, and VAMP4 are involved in the export of cisplatin from cells. The interaction with STX6 is crucial for cisplatin efflux, while VAMP4's role is more complex, as its silencing does not directly affect platinum export unless ATP11B is upregulated (MorenoSmith2013ATP11B).

In glioblastoma cells, ATP11B interacts with the long non-coding RNA LINC00606. This interaction is significant for the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which affects cell proliferation and apoptosis. LINC00606 binds to ATP11B, influencing its protein levels and modulating signaling pathways that are critical for glioma progression (Dong2024LINC00606).

In the context of synaptic plasticity, ATP11B affects the distribution of phosphatidylserine in neuronal membranes, influencing synaptic structure and function. Although direct protein interactions are not detailed, ATP11B's role in synaptic plasticity suggests interactions with synaptic machinery components (Wang2019ATP11B).
