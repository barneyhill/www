# TBC1D13

## Overview
TBC1D13 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 13, which is part of the TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain family known for its role in regulating GTPase activity. The protein is involved in membrane trafficking and signaling pathways, contributing to cellular processes such as vesicle transport and signal transduction (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16). TBC1D13 has been implicated in various cancers, including melanoma and breast cancer, where its expression levels are associated with disease prognosis and progression (Heng2016The; Georgescu2022Apprising). The gene's expression patterns and functional roles in cancer highlight its potential as a biomarker for clinical outcomes and as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TBC1D13 has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in melanoma. Studies have shown that TBC1D13, along with other TBC genes, exhibits increased mRNA and protein expression in melanoma tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with a worse prognosis and a higher risk of metastasis in melanoma patients. A risk score formula developed based on the expression levels of these genes indicates that higher expression of TBC1D13 correlates with poorer outcomes in terms of overall survival, progression-free interval, and disease-specific survival (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16; Georgescu2022Apprising).

In breast cancer, particularly the basal-like subtype, TBC1D13 is noted to be downregulated. This downregulation is associated with features such as inflammation, necrosis, nuclear pleomorphism, and high mitotic counts, which are characteristic of this highly proliferative cancer subtype. The gene's involvement in membrane signaling and GTPase activity suggests its role in the broader context of breast cancer pathology (Heng2016The).

These findings suggest that alterations in TBC1D13 expression may have clinical significance in cancer, serving as a potential biomarker for prognosis and survival prediction in melanoma and possibly influencing breast cancer pathology.
