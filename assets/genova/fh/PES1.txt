# PES1

## Overview
PES1, or pescadillo ribosomal biogenesis factor 1, is a gene that encodes a nucleolar protein crucial for ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. The protein, also referred to as PES1, is a component of the PeBoW complex, which is essential for the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. It contains several functional domains, including a pescadillo-like protein domain and a BRCT domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its localization within the nucleolus. PES1 is involved in pre-rRNA processing and cell cycle progression, linking ribosome synthesis with cellular proliferation. Its expression and function are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and have significant implications in various cancers, where alterations in PES1 expression can influence tumor progression and treatment outcomes (Lapik2004Physical; Holzel2007The; Zhang2009B23).

## Structure
PES1 (pescadillo ribosomal biogenesis factor 1) is a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. It is composed of 588 amino acids and contains several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region includes a pescadillo-like protein domain, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins, such as B23 (Zhang2009B23). The BRCT domain, located between amino acids 322-415, is crucial for nucleolar localization and rRNA processing. This domain is typically associated with proteins involved in DNA damage and repair pathways, although in PES1, it plays a unique role in rRNA processing (Holzel2007The).

The C-terminal region of PES1 contains two stretches of acidic domains, which are not essential for rRNA processing but may mediate protein-protein interactions (Holzel2007The). The BRCT domain is also important for the stability and incorporation of PES1 into the PeBoW complex, which is necessary for the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Rohrmoser2007Interdependence). Mutations within the BRCT domain can lead to diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution and affect protein stability, likely due to increased proteasomal degradation (Holzel2007The). The interaction of PES1 with other proteins, such as Bop1, is crucial for its function in ribosome biogenesis (Lapik2004Physical).

## Function
PES1, also known as pescadillo ribosomal biogenesis factor 1, is a nucleolar protein essential for ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. It is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, where it plays a critical role in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. PES1 forms a stable complex with Bop1 and WDR12, which is crucial for pre-rRNA processing and the maturation of the large ribosomal subunit (Lapik2004Physical; Zhang2009B23). The interaction between PES1 and Bop1 is essential for the efficient processing of internal transcribed spacers in pre-rRNA, and mutations that disrupt this interaction impair ribosome synthesis and cell proliferation (Lapik2004Physical).

PES1 is also involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication, linking cell size regulation with cell cycle progression (Maiorana2004Role). It interacts with the nucleolar protein B23, which is involved in its nucleolar localization, suggesting a role in ribosome biogenesis as part of a protein complex (Zhang2009B23). The protein's function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal development, as evidenced by its essential role in embryonic development and cell proliferation (LerchGaggl2002Pescadillo).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PES1 gene have been implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers. In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), PES1 is overexpressed, leading to an increased ERα/ERβ protein ratio, which promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. This alteration is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics such as larger tumor size and lymph node metastasis (Qiu2019PES1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PES1 is upregulated and correlates with poor clinical outcomes. It enhances tumorigenesis through the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/cyclin D1 signaling pathway, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Wang2019PES1).

PES1 also plays a significant role in pancreatic cancer, where its overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation and resistance to BET inhibitors. This resistance is mediated through the interaction of PES1 with BRD4, enhancing c-Myc expression (Jin2019PES1).

In breast cancer, PES1 modulates the balance between estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, promoting tumor growth. Its expression is associated with better outcomes in patients receiving tamoxifen therapy, suggesting its potential as a predictive marker for treatment response (Cheng2012PES1).

## Interactions
PES1 (pescadillo ribosomal biogenesis factor 1) is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. PES1 is a component of the PeBoW complex, which includes Bop1 and WDR12, and is crucial for the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. The interaction between PES1 and Bop1 is essential for PES1's recruitment and retention in the nucleolus, necessary for ribosome maturation (Lapik2004Physical; Rohrmoser2007Interdependence). PES1's interaction with Bop1 is mediated by specific domains, and mutations in these regions can disrupt their binding, leading to defects in ribosome synthesis (Lapik2004Physical).

PES1 also interacts with the nucleolar protein B23 (nucleophosmin or NPM1), which is involved in ribosome biogenesis and genomic stability. This interaction is crucial for the nucleolar localization of PES1, as B23 helps maintain PES1's presence in the nucleolus (Zhang2009B23). The N-terminal region of PES1 is essential for its interaction with B23, and this interaction persists even under cellular stress conditions (Zhang2009B23). These interactions highlight PES1's role in coordinating ribosome biogenesis and cellular proliferation.
