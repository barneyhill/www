# GCG

## Overview
The GCG gene encodes the precursor protein preproglucagon, which is subsequently processed into several biologically active peptides, including glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and GLP-2. Glucagon, a peptide hormone, plays a critical role in glucose metabolism by promoting glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, thereby increasing blood glucose levels during fasting states. It is primarily produced in the pancreatic alpha cells. In contrast, GLP-1 and GLP-2 are produced in the intestinal L cells and certain neurons, where they contribute to glucose homeostasis and energy balance through mechanisms such as enhancing insulin secretion and regulating appetite (Drucker2006The; Shiota2017Gcg). The GCG gene's products are integral to maintaining metabolic homeostasis, with their functions being highly tissue-specific and responsive to physiological demands (Panaro2020Intestineselective).

## Structure
The glucagon gene (GCG) encodes the precursor protein preproglucagon, which is processed into several peptides, including glucagon. The primary structure of glucagon consists of 29 amino acid residues, with specific amino acids such as tryptophan at position 25, phenylalanine at 22, and tyrosine at 10 and 13 contributing to its aggregation properties (Onoue2006Structural). 

In terms of secondary structure, glucagon undergoes a transition from an α-helix to a β-sheet structure during aggregation. This transition is confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and FT-IR spectroscopic analyses, which show a shift in the amide I band, indicating increased β-sheet conformation (Onoue2006Structural). 

The tertiary structure of glucagon is not detailed in the provided context, and there is no information on its quaternary structure. The glucagon fibrils exhibit polymorphism, with different morphologies such as straight and twisted protofilaments, which are influenced by concentration and environmental conditions (Andersen2010Glucagon). These fibrils have a stable double-pleated β-sheet core, with variations in the protofilament backbone structure (Andersen2010Glucagon). 

No specific domains, prominent folds, or post-translational modifications are detailed in the context provided.

## Function
The GCG gene encodes preproglucagon, which is processed into several hormones, including glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and GLP-2, each playing distinct roles in energy metabolism and glucose regulation. In pancreatic alpha cells, the GCG gene is responsible for producing glucagon, a hormone that increases blood glucose levels by promoting glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, thus maintaining glucose homeostasis during fasting (Shiota2017Gcg).

Outside the pancreas, the GCG gene is expressed in intestinal L cells and certain neurons in the brain stem, where it is processed to produce GLP-1 and GLP-2. GLP-1 acts as an incretin hormone, enhancing insulin secretion in response to nutrient intake, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. It also plays a role in regulating appetite and glucose homeostasis through its action on neurons in the brain stem (Drucker2006The; Shiota2017Gcg). GLP-1 receptors are found in various tissues, including the stomach and heart, where they influence gastric emptying, satiety, and cardiovascular functions (Drucker2006The).

The GCG gene's products are crucial for maintaining energy balance and glucose metabolism, with their activities being highly tissue-specific and regulated by nutrient intake and physiological demands (Panaro2020Intestineselective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GCG gene, which encodes glucagon, have been associated with various metabolic conditions. The rs4664447 variant in the GCG gene is linked to decreased fasting and stimulated levels of insulin, glucagon, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in homozygous carriers of the G allele. These individuals also exhibit lower fasting plasma glucose and increased insulin sensitivity, although this variant is not directly associated with type 2 diabetes or obesity (Torekov2011Homozygous). The Ile158Val variant of the GCG gene has been associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, with heterozygous carriers showing lower fasting serum insulin and insulinogenic index (Torekov2011Homozygous).

Despite these associations, the clinical relevance of GCG gene variants in the pathogenesis of monogenic diabetes or obesity appears limited, as no significant associations were found with type 2 diabetes or obesity in broader analyses (Torekov2011Homozygous). The study of these variants highlights the complexity of genetic influences on metabolic traits and the potential for low-frequency variants to impact metabolic regulation (Torekov2011Homozygous).

## Interactions
The GCG gene encodes the glucagon protein, which is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In the context of RNA interactions, GCG mRNA has been shown to form complexes with several RNA-binding proteins. These include SERBP1, zinc finger protein ZFP28, and cytoskeletal proteins such as Plectin, Plekha7, and Vimentin. These interactions suggest a role in the regulation of GCG mRNA translation or decay, potentially influencing lipid metabolism pathways (Ko2022Profiling).

The study by Ko et al. also identified interactions between GCG mRNA and various carboxylases, including Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, Methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase, and Pyruvate Carboxylase. These interactions may inhibit GCG mRNA translation or activate its decay, linking GCG mRNA to lipid metabolic processes (Ko2022Profiling).

In another context, the GCG gene has been associated with genetic variations that influence glucose metabolism and weight regulation. A specific SNP near the GCG gene, rs13429709, has been linked to antipsychotic-induced weight gain, suggesting a potential interaction with pathways involved in glucose homeostasis (Brandl2014Genetic).
