# LURAP1

## Overview
LURAP1, or leucine rich adaptor protein 1, is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to cell signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein encoded by LURAP1 is characterized by its ability to interact with other proteins, such as Dishevelled (Dvl) and components of the Myo18A-MRCK complex, playing a crucial role in the regulation of the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway and actomyosin assembly, respectively. These interactions are vital for maintaining cell polarity, motility, and proper cytoskeletal organization (Cheng2017Leucine). LURAP1's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in developmental processes and its potential implications in cancer progression, where its expression levels and methylation status have been linked to prognostic outcomes in various cancers (Chen2024Machine).

## Clinical Significance
LURAP1 (leucine rich adaptor protein 1) has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In uveal melanoma, higher expression levels of LURAP1 are associated with lower overall survival and metastasis-free survival, indicating its role in promoting tumor cell migration and poor prognosis (Chen2024Machine). The gene is part of a prognostic model for uveal melanoma, where alterations in LURAP1, along with SLC25A38 and EDNRB, are linked to increased metastasis risk (Chen2024Machine).

In bladder cancer, the methylation status of LURAP1 is significant, with hypermethylation of specific sites correlating with a better prognosis. This suggests that LURAP1's methylation could serve as a potential biomarker for predicting survival outcomes in bladder cancer patients (Wang2019A).

While the direct clinical implications of LURAP1 mutations are not extensively detailed, its expression and interaction with cellular pathways, such as the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway, highlight its potential role in developmental abnormalities and cancer progression. The gene's involvement in these pathways suggests that alterations in its expression or function could contribute to disease states (Cheng2017Leucine).

## Interactions
LURAP1 (leucine rich adaptor protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with Dishevelled (Dvl), a key component of the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway, through its PDZ-binding motif. This interaction is essential for regulating cell polarity and convergent extension movements during vertebrate gastrulation, particularly in zebrafish. LURAP1 limits Dvl's membrane localization and JNK activation, thereby modulating the Wnt/PCP pathway to prevent excessive signaling that could disrupt cell polarity (Cheng2017Leucine).

LURAP1 also forms part of a tripartite protein complex with Myo18A and MRCK, which is essential for cell motility. This complex promotes nonmuscle myosin 2-dependent actomyosin assembly and retrograde actomyosin flow, playing a significant role in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility (Horsthemke2024Are). Additionally, LURAP1 interacts with other proteins like MRCK and MYO18A, suggesting it may regulate cell polarity independently of Dvl, potentially through interactions with small GTPases like Rac and Rho (Cheng2017Leucine). These interactions highlight LURAP1's role in modulating cytoskeleton organization and cellular polarization.
