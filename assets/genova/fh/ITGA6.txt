# ITGA6

## Overview
The ITGA6 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 6, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the integrin family, which plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and signaling. Integrin subunit alpha 6 primarily forms heterodimers with beta subunits, such as beta 1 and beta 4, to function as receptors for laminins, key components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Krebsbach2017The; Ferreira2013ITGA6). These integrin complexes are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival, by mediating interactions between cells and the ECM (Krebsbach2017The; Ferreira2013ITGA6). The ITGA6 gene is expressed in a range of tissues and is particularly significant in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells and in the development of neural crest-derived cells (Ma2023Developmentally). Alterations in ITGA6 expression and function have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and genetic disorders affecting skin integrity (Boussaha2023Integrin; Zalesny2024Case).

## Structure
The ITGA6 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 6, which is a component of the integrin family involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The primary structure of ITGA6 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the β-propeller domain of the α6 subunit exhibiting a canonical 7-bladed propeller fold (Arimori2021Structural).

In its quaternary structure, ITGA6 pairs with beta subunits, commonly beta 1 or beta 4, to form heterodimers. These heterodimers are crucial for binding to extracellular matrix components like laminin. The α6β1 integrin, for instance, is a laminin-binding heterodimer that plays significant roles in cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and self-renewal (Arimori2021Structural).

The α6 integrin subunit contains specific domains such as the I-domain, which is essential for ligand binding. The X1 region of the α6 subunit is involved in laminin recognition, facilitating long-range electrostatic capture of ligands (Arimori2021Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, can influence the function and localization of ITGA6. Additionally, alternative splicing of the ITGA6 mRNA results in different isoforms, such as α6' and α6x1x2, which have distinct functional properties (Delwel1995An).

## Function
Integrin alpha 6 (ITGA6) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that forms heterodimers with integrin beta subunits, primarily beta 1 (CD29) and beta 4 (CD104), to function as a receptor for laminins, which are key components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Krebsbach2017The; Ferreira2013ITGA6). This interaction facilitates cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction, influencing various cellular processes such as differentiation, gene expression, motility, polarity, proliferation, and survival (Krebsbach2017The; Ferreira2013ITGA6).

In human thymic epithelial cells, ITGA6 is crucial for maintaining structural integrity and function by regulating adhesion and migration-related pathways. Silencing ITGA6 results in significant adhesion defects and alters the expression of other integrin-type ECM receptors (Ferreira2013ITGA6). In stem cells, ITGA6 is a conserved biomarker, playing a critical role in maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency. It is regulated by transcription factors such as Oct4 and Sox2, which support its transcription, while KLF9 represses it (Krebsbach2017The).

ITGA6 is also involved in the differentiation of neural crest-derived cells in the skin, distinguishing subpopulations based on its expression levels. It is most abundantly expressed in myelinating Schwann cells, indicating its role in neural crest development (Ma2023Developmentally).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITGA6 gene are associated with a variety of diseases and conditions. In humans, biallelic mutations in ITGA6 can lead to nail dysplasia and pyloric atresia, as seen in a case involving a 7-year-old girl. This case was notable for the absence of the typical skin fragility or epidermolysis bullosa usually linked to ITGA6 mutations, suggesting a broader spectrum of ITGA6-related disorders (Zalesny2024Case).

In Charolais cattle, a homozygous splice-site mutation in ITGA6 causes a new form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), characterized by skin erosion, ulceration, and oral mucosal blistering. This mutation disrupts the integrin α6β4 dimer assembly, crucial for cell adhesion, leading to severe skin fragility (Boussaha2023Integrin).

In cancer, ITGA6 expression levels have been linked to various outcomes. In ovarian cancer, higher ITGA6 expression correlates with longer progression-free survival and overall survival, suggesting a protective role (Wu2020Integrated). Conversely, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ITGA6 is overexpressed and associated with tumor progression, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Yang2022Comprehensive). In skin cutaneous melanoma, ITGA6 is considered a prognostic biomarker, with its expression linked to tumor progression and immune cell infiltration (Nurzat2021Identification).

## Interactions
ITGA6, or integrin subunit alpha 6, is known to form heterodimers with integrin beta 1 (ITGB1) or beta 4 (ITGB4), creating integrin complexes such as α6β1 and α6β4. These complexes are involved in cell adhesion and signaling processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ITGA6 primarily interacts with ITGB4, and this interaction is crucial for promoting tumor progression and influencing patient survival (Zheng2022Integrin).

In pancreatic cancer, ITGA6 interacts with ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), a non-integrin molecule, to promote cancer cell invasion and metastasis. This interaction affects the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, with ITGA6 influencing the PI3K pathway and RPSA affecting the MAPK pathway. The interaction between ITGA6 and RPSA has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and confocal immunofluorescence staining, showing colocalization on the cell membrane (Wu2019ITGA6).

ITGA6 also interacts with various proteins and receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), Src family kinases (SFKs), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), to mediate intracellular signaling. It forms complexes with growth factors and their receptors, such as EGFR, ERBB2, and c-Met, amplifying oncogenic signaling (Khademi2023Regulation).
