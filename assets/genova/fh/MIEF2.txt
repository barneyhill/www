# MIEF2

## Overview
MIEF2, or mitochondrial elongation factor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, specifically influencing the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion. The protein encoded by MIEF2 is categorized as an adaptor protein, which is anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology by interacting with key proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics, such as Drp1, Mff, Mfn1, and Mfn2. Through these interactions, MIEF2 facilitates the recruitment and assembly of Drp1, promoting mitochondrial fission, while also enhancing mitochondrial fusion by interacting with pro-fusion proteins and sequestering fusion inhibitors. This dual functionality underscores its importance in cellular energy production and apoptosis, as it helps maintain the balance between mitochondrial division and elongation (Yu2021MIEF12; Liu2013The; Yu2017MIEF12).

## Function
MIEF2, also known as mitochondrial elongation factor 2, plays a critical role in mitochondrial dynamics by regulating the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion. It is anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane and functions as an adaptor protein that recruits Drp1, a key protein involved in mitochondrial fission, to the mitochondrial surface. MIEF2 forms a trimeric complex with Drp1 and Mff, facilitating the recruitment and assembly of Drp1, which is essential for mitochondrial fission (Yu2017MIEF12).

In addition to its role in fission, MIEF2 also promotes mitochondrial fusion. It interacts with pro-fusion proteins Mfn1 and Mfn2, enhancing fusion in a manner independent of Drp1. MIEF2 can sequester hFis1, a protein that inhibits fusion, thereby promoting a fusion phenotype (Yu2021MIEF12). The ability of MIEF2 to promote fusion is linked to its self-association and mitochondrial localization, as mutants lacking these properties fail to enhance fusion (Yu2021MIEF12).

Overall, MIEF2 acts as a central regulator of mitochondrial morphology, influencing cellular energy production and apoptosis by maintaining the balance between mitochondrial division and elongation (Liu2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MIEF2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In ovarian cancer (OC), MIEF2 is overexpressed, which is associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival rates. High levels of MIEF2 promote tumor growth and metastasis by reprogramming glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. This metabolic shift supports cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation and survival (Zhao2020MIEF2). MIEF2 also influences lipid metabolism in OC by upregulating lipogenic enzymes through the activation of the SREBP1 and SREBP2 transcription factors, further contributing to tumor growth and metastasis (Zhao2021MIEF2).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), MIEF2 expression is inversely related to resistance to the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin. Lower expression levels of MIEF2 are linked to increased drug resistance, as MIEF2 is involved in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Its downregulation leads to decreased cytochrome C release and reduced apoptosis, thereby enhancing resistance to treatment (Xie2022CRISPRbased). These findings suggest that MIEF2 could serve as a potential therapeutic target in both OC and CRC.

## Interactions
MIEF2, also known as mitochondrial elongation factor 2, is involved in mitochondrial dynamics through its interactions with several key proteins. MIEF2 interacts with the fission-promoting factors hFis1 and Drp1 on the mitochondrial surface. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that MIEF2-V5 interacts with Myc-hFis1 and endogenous Drp1, leading to the accumulation of Drp1 as punctate structures on the mitochondrial outer membrane, which results in a mitochondrial fusion phenotype (Liu2013The).

MIEF2 also interacts with pro-fusion GTPases Mfn1 and Mfn2, as well as Mff, another mitochondrial recruitment receptor. These interactions are crucial for the recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria, impacting mitochondrial morphology. MIEF2's disordered regions are important for its interaction with Mfn1/2 and hFis1 (Yu2021MIEF12).

MIEF2 can form a trimeric protein complex with Drp1 and Mff, which is the most abundant form of co-localization on the mitochondrial surface. This trimeric complex plays a significant role in regulating the association of Drp1 with Mff, facilitating mitochondrial fission (Yu2017MIEF12). MIEF2's interactions with these proteins highlight its integral role in both mitochondrial fission and fusion processes.
