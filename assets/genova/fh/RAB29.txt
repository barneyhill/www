# RAB29

## Overview
RAB29, also known as Rab7L1, is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein belonging to the RAS oncogene family. The RAB29 protein is primarily involved in vesicular trafficking, playing a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the trans-Golgi network and facilitating the retrograde transport of mannose-6-phosphate receptors. It is also implicated in immune synapse assembly and ciliogenesis, highlighting its importance in cellular processes such as receptor recycling and structural maintenance. Additionally, RAB29 interacts with Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a kinase associated with Parkinson's disease, influencing its localization and activity at the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes. This interaction is significant in the context of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, as it affects cellular processes like lysosomal homeostasis and neurite outgrowth (Onnis2015The; Purlyte2017Rab29; Komori2023An).

## Function
RAB29, also known as Rab7L1, is a small GTPase involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in vesicular trafficking. It plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is essential for the retrograde trafficking of mannose-6-phosphate receptors (M6PRs) from the endosome back to the TGN. This function is crucial for the recycling of receptors and proper protein sorting within the cell (Wang2014A). RAB29 is also implicated in the regulation of immune synapse assembly in T cells, where it facilitates the recycling of T-cell receptors (TCRs) to the immune synapse, a process necessary for sustained T-cell activation and signaling (Onnis2015The).

In addition to its role in immune cells, RAB29 is involved in ciliogenesis, promoting the growth of primary cilia by assisting in the transport of endosomal cargo to the ciliary base. This function highlights its importance in cellular assembly processes and structural maintenance (Onnis2015The). RAB29's interaction with other proteins, such as Rab11 and IFT20, underscores its involvement in complex trafficking pathways that are essential for cellular homeostasis and function (Onnis2015The).

## Clinical Significance
RAB29, also known as Rab7L1, is implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) due to its role in regulating LRRK2, a kinase associated with the disease. Variants in the PARK16 locus, which includes RAB29, are linked to an increased risk of PD. RAB29 recruits LRRK2 to the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes, enhancing LRRK2 kinase activity, which is crucial for maintaining lysosomal homeostasis. This interaction affects the phosphorylation of other Rab proteins, such as Rab8a and Rab10, influencing cellular processes like centrosomal positioning and neurite outgrowth (Guadagno2019Rab; Kuwahara2020The).

Mutations in LRRK2 that affect its interaction with RAB29 can lead to disruptions in membrane trafficking, contributing to PD pathogenesis. RAB29's role in activating LRRK2 is significant, as it influences the localization and activation of LRRK2 on Golgi membranes, which is relevant to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PD (Purlyte2017Rab29).

Altered expression levels of RAB29 are also associated with PD risk. Higher expression levels of RAB29 have been linked to an increased risk of PD, suggesting that RAB29's regulation of LRRK2 activity is a critical factor in the disease's development (Guadagno2019Rab).

## Interactions
RAB29, also known as Rab7L1, is a small GTPase that interacts with Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a kinase associated with Parkinson's disease. RAB29 recruits LRRK2 to the trans-Golgi network, where it activates LRRK2 kinase activity, particularly enhancing the phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser1292 and endogenous Rab10 at Thr73 (Purlyte2017Rab29). This interaction is mediated through the ankyrin domain of LRRK2, with specific residues being crucial for RAB29-mediated activation (Purlyte2017Rab29).

RAB29's role as an upstream regulator of LRRK2 is significant, as it influences the localization and activity of LRRK2 at the Golgi apparatus. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutants, which enhance GTP binding, are more effectively recruited and activated by RAB29 compared to wild-type LRRK2 (Purlyte2017Rab29). RAB29 also plays a role in lysosomal function, reacting to lysosomal stress by localizing to lysosomes and co-recruiting and activating LRRK2, which is crucial for regulating lysosomal size (Komori2023An).

The interaction between RAB29 and LRRK2 is complex, involving autophagic pathways and potentially a negative feedback loop where LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of RAB29 might inhibit further activation of LRRK2 (Purlyte2017Rab29; Pfeffer2018LRRK2).
