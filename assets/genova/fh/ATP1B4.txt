# ATP1B4

## Overview
The ATP1B4 gene encodes the BetaM protein, a unique member of the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit family, which has evolved distinct functions in placental mammals. Unlike traditional β-subunits that associate with the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit to form an ion pump, BetaM does not participate in this complex, reflecting its divergent role. Instead, BetaM is primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues, where it localizes to the inner nuclear membrane and functions as a transcriptional co-regulator. It interacts with various proteins, including the transcriptional co-regulator SKIP, influencing gene expression and muscle development. This protein is involved in critical pathways such as TGF-β signaling, highlighting its importance in muscle physiology and development (Korneenko2016Evolutionary; Pestov2007Evolution; Ahmad2023EutherianSpecific).

## Structure
The ATP1B4 gene encodes the BetaM protein, a unique member of the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit family. The primary structure of the BetaM protein includes a sequence of 351 to 356 amino acids, depending on the splice variant, with a molecular mass ranging from 41.0 to 41.4 kDa (Pestov2001The; Zhao2004Accumulation). The protein is characterized by a type II membrane glycoprotein organization, featuring a single transmembrane α-helical segment and a large extracytoplasmic C-terminal domain (Zhao2004Accumulation). 

The BetaM protein contains a highly charged cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, which includes Glu-rich clusters and an Arg-rich nonapeptide, potentially serving as a nuclear localization signal (Korneenko2016Evolutionary). This domain forms a unique 'hairpin' structure with α-helices and a flexible loop (Pestov2001The). The protein also has six conserved cysteine residues that form three disulfide bridges and four consensus sites for N-glycosylation, contributing to its post-translational modifications (Pestov2001The; Zhao2004Accumulation).

In terms of quaternary structure, BetaM does not associate with the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit, indicating a loss of its original function as a β-subunit (Pestov2011Isolation). The protein is primarily located in the inner nuclear membrane, where it interacts with the transcriptional co-regulator SKIP, influencing gene expression (Korneenko2016Evolutionary).

## Function
The ATP1B4 gene encodes the BetaM protein, which has undergone significant evolutionary changes in placental mammals. In humans, BetaM is primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues, where it is located in the inner nuclear membrane. Unlike its ancestral role as a subunit of the Na,K-ATPase ion pump, BetaM in placental mammals does not associate with the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit, indicating a distinct functional role (Korneenko2016Evolutionary; Pestov2007Evolution).

BetaM functions as a transcriptional co-regulator, interacting with the transcriptional co-regulator SKIP. This interaction is involved in the regulation of muscle-specific genes, such as MyoD, by promoting epigenetic changes and recruiting chromatin remodeling factors like BRG1. These activities are crucial during late fetal and early postnatal development, suggesting that BetaM's role in muscle development provides evolutionary advantages to placental mammals (Ahmad2023EutherianSpecific).

BetaM also affects the TGF-β signaling pathway by interacting with SKIP, which influences the expression of Smad7, an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling. This regulatory function highlights BetaM's role in muscle development and gene expression during critical developmental periods (Pestov2007Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
The ATP1B4 gene, encoding the BetaM protein, is implicated in various muscle pathologies, particularly those affecting skeletal and cardiac muscles. Mutations or alterations in the expression of ATP1B4 can lead to significant clinical consequences. The BetaM protein interacts with β-sarcoglycan, a protein associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs). Mutations in β-sarcoglycan, such as those observed in LGMD2E, result in muscle weakness and dystrophy, highlighting the potential impact of altered BetaM interactions on muscle health (Korneenko2016Evolutionary).

The BetaM protein also influences TGFβ signaling through its interaction with SKIP, affecting muscle pathologies. Excessive TGFβ signaling is linked to sarcoglycanopathies, and its inhibition can protect against muscle injury and dystrophic diseases (Korneenko2016Evolutionary). Alterations in BetaM's interactome, including its interactions with components of the nuclear membrane and the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, are crucial for muscle function. Disruptions in these interactions, such as the retention of mutant sarcoglycans in the nucleus, can lead to muscle pathologies (Korneenko2016Evolutionary). The sensitivity of BetaM to proteolysis and its potential targeting to the signalosome through interactions with COPS5 may also contribute to its clinical significance (Korneenko2016Evolutionary).

## Interactions
The ATP1B4 gene encodes the BetaM protein, which has evolved to participate in various protein interactions in placental mammals. BetaM is located in the inner nuclear membrane of muscle cells and interacts with several proteins, including lamina-associated protein LAP-1, myocyte nuclear envelope protein Syne1, and β-sarcoglycan (SGCB), which is involved in muscle pathologies such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (Korneenko2016Evolutionary). 

A significant interaction of BetaM is with the transcriptional co-regulator SKIP (Ski-interacting protein). This interaction is crucial for regulating gene expression, particularly in the TGF-β signaling pathway, where BetaM influences the expression of Smad7, an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling (Pestov2007Evolution). The interaction with SKIP is facilitated by residues 72-98 in the nucleoplasmic domain of BetaM (Korneenko2016Evolutionary). 

BetaM also interacts with heme oxidases HMOX1 and HMOX2, transcription factor LZIP/CREB3, ERGIC3, PHF3, reticulocalbin-3, and is implicated in the signalosome through interactions with proteins linked to the COPS5 component (Korneenko2016Evolutionary). These interactions suggest that BetaM functions as a transcriptional co-regulator during perinatal development in placental mammals.
