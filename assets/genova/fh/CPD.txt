# CPD

## Overview
Carboxypeptidase D (CPD) is a gene that encodes a type I membrane protein known as carboxypeptidase D, which is a member of the metallocarboxypeptidase family. This protein is characterized by its three tandem carboxypeptidase homology domains, which contribute to its role in the processing of proteins within the secretory pathway. Carboxypeptidase D is primarily located in the trans-Golgi network and is involved in the removal of C-terminal basic residues from peptides and proteins, a process essential for their maturation and function (Fricker2013Carboxypeptidases; GarciaPardo2017Substrate). The protein's structure includes a signal peptide and a transmembrane anchor, which are crucial for its membrane-bound nature (TAN1997Sequence). CPD's enzymatic activity is significant in the processing of various proteins, including prohormones and cell-surface proteins, and it plays a role in intracellular trafficking through interactions with other proteins (Kalinina2002Analysis; Varlamov1999Localization). Additionally, CPD has been implicated in the progression of prostate cancer, where its expression is elevated, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Thomas2014CarboxypeptidaseD).

## Structure
Carboxypeptidase D (CPD) is a 180-kDa type I membrane protein characterized by three tandem carboxypeptidase homology domains. The primary structure of CPD includes a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a transmembrane anchor near the C-terminus, which are essential for its membrane-bound nature (TAN1997Sequence). The protein is composed of 1377 amino acids and is significantly larger than other members of the regulatory carboxypeptidase family due to these three domains (TAN1997Sequence).

The secondary structure of CPD includes α/β-hydrolase folds, particularly in the second domain, which is structurally similar to carboxypeptidase E (CPE) (Aloy2001The). The tertiary structure of CPD is defined by its three domains, with CPD-II having a unique C-terminal β-sandwich subdomain (Aloy2001The). CPD-III lacks enzymatic activity due to the absence of key catalytic residues, suggesting a potential non-catalytic function (Aloy2001The).

CPD undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, with 16 potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites identified, although not all are utilized (TAN1997Sequence). The protein's quaternary structure involves its assembly as a membrane-bound enzyme, requiring detergent for solubilization (TAN1997Sequence).

## Function
Carboxypeptidase D (CPD) is a metallocarboxypeptidase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the processing of proteins within the secretory pathway in healthy human cells. It is primarily located in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and cycles between the TGN and the cell surface (Fricker2013Carboxypeptidases; GarciaPardo2017Substrate). CPD is involved in the removal of C-terminal basic residues, such as lysine and arginine, from peptides and proteins, which is essential for their maturation and function (Fricker2013Carboxypeptidases; GarciaPardo2017Substrate).

The enzyme contains three carboxypeptidase-like domains, with the first two being enzymatically active. Domain I is more active at neutral pH and prefers C-terminal arginine, while domain II is more active at slightly acidic pH and can cleave both lysine and arginine efficiently (GarciaPardo2017Substrate). CPD's activity is crucial for the processing of secreted or cell-surface proteins, including the insulin receptor and various extracellular messengers like growth factors and neuroendocrine peptides (Fricker2013Carboxypeptidases).

CPD is also involved in the processing of prohormones and other proteins that transit the regulated or constitutive secretory pathways, often in conjunction with the TGN endoprotease furin (Varlamov1999Localization). Its broad tissue distribution and subcellular localization suggest a significant role in protein and peptide processing across various cellular locations (GarciaPardo2017Substrate).

## Clinical Significance
Carboxypeptidase D (CPD) has been implicated in the progression of prostate cancer. Studies have shown that CPD expression is significantly elevated in malignant prostate tissues compared to benign tissues, suggesting its role as a biomarker for prostate cancer progression (Thomas2014CarboxypeptidaseD). The increased expression of CPD in prostate cancer is associated with enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production, which promotes cancer cell survival. This effect is particularly pronounced when CPD is upregulated by hormones such as testosterone and prolactin, indicating that CPD's interaction with androgen and prolactin signaling pathways is crucial in prostate cancer (Thomas2014CarboxypeptidaseD).

The study also highlights that CPD's anti-apoptotic activity in prostate cancer cells can be abolished by targeting both androgen and prolactin receptors, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy (Thomas2014CarboxypeptidaseD). CPD is expressed in the endothelial cells of blood vessels in prostate cancer, indicating a role in tumor neovascularization and lymphangiogenesis, which are critical processes in cancer metastasis (Thomas2014CarboxypeptidaseD). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CPD in prostate cancer and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Carboxypeptidase D (CPD) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular trafficking. One significant interaction is with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which binds to a specific 20-residue region within the cytoplasmic tail of CPD. This interaction is essential for regulating CPD trafficking between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the cell surface. PP2A can dephosphorylate the CPD tail, although the binding does not affect the phosphatase's activity (Varlamov2001Protein).

The CPD tail also interacts with adaptor proteins AP-1 and AP-2, facilitated by a sequence known as FHRL. This sequence is crucial for binding these adaptor proteins, and its phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 (CK2) enhances this interaction. These interactions are important for CPD's localization and trafficking within the cell (Kalinina2002Analysis).

Additionally, CPD's third domain, although inactive towards standard substrates, is involved in binding the pre-S domain of the large envelope protein of duck hepatitis B virus, indicating a role in protein-protein interactions related to viral binding (Aloy2001The).
