# TSNAX

## Overview
The TSNAX gene encodes the protein translin-associated factor X, commonly referred to as Trax, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system. Trax is a component of a heteromeric RNA-binding complex with translin, playing a pivotal role in RNA processing and transport, especially within neurons. This complex is essential for the trafficking of specific mRNAs, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA, into dendrites and axons, thereby influencing neuronal development and synaptic plasticity (Li2008The). Additionally, Trax is involved in DNA repair mechanisms, interacting with key enzymes like ATM to facilitate the repair of double-strand breaks, thus maintaining genomic stability (Wang2015A; Chien2018GSK3β). The protein also contributes to synaptic plasticity by forming an RNase complex with translin, which degrades microRNAs to reverse translational silencing, a process crucial for long-term memory formation (Chern2019Trax:). Trax's multifaceted roles underscore its importance in both cellular maintenance and cognitive functions.

## Structure


## Function
The TSNAX gene encodes the protein Trax, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. Trax is involved in RNA processing and transport, forming a complex with Translin to mediate RNA trafficking, particularly in neurons. This complex facilitates the movement of specific mRNAs, such as BDNF mRNA, into dendrites and axons, which is crucial for neuronal development and synaptic plasticity (Li2008The).

Trax also plays a critical role in DNA repair processes. It interacts with ATM, a key enzyme in the DNA damage response, to promote the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) through the ATM/DNA-PK-dependent non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. This function is essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing excessive apoptosis (Wang2015A; Chien2018GSK3β).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, Trax is involved in synaptic plasticity by forming a heteromeric RNase complex with Translin, which degrades microRNAs. This degradation reverses microRNA-mediated translational silencing, triggering dendritic protein synthesis necessary for long-term memory and synaptic plasticity (Chern2019Trax:). Trax's activity is observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cognitive functions and memory (Li2008The).

## Clinical Significance
The TSNAX gene, also known as TRAX, is implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Located at 1q42.1, TSNAX is adjacent to the DISC1 gene, and intergenic splicing between these genes can result in fusion proteins that may contribute to disease pathogenesis (Millar2000Chromosomal; Weng2018The). Genetic studies have identified associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the TSNAX-DISC1 region and mental disorders. For instance, specific SNPs in TSNAX are linked to schizophrenia in Finnish patients, and the AATG haplotype affects reaction time and gray matter density (Weng2018The). SNP rs1655285 in TSNAX is associated with bipolar spectrum disorder, while rs766288 is linked to major depressive disorder in Japanese females (Weng2018The).

The TRAX/DISC1/GSK3β complex, which includes TSNAX, plays a role in DNA repair, and its dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of mental disorders. The disassembly of this complex, facilitated by A2A receptor activation, aids in DNA repair and may mitigate damage from unrepaired double-strand breaks, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for psychotic disorders (Weng2018The). These findings suggest that TSNAX is a risk gene for mental disorders, with its interactions and genetic variations contributing to the susceptibility and development of these conditions (Thomson2005Association; Schosser2009Association).

## Interactions
TSNAX, also known as translin-associated protein X, forms a heteromeric RNA binding complex with translin. This complex is involved in RNA trafficking in neurons, particularly in dendrites and axons, and is crucial for processes such as synaptic plasticity and nerve regeneration (Li2008The). TSNAX does not bind nucleic acids independently but contributes to the nucleic acid binding activity of the Translin/Trax complex, which shows selectivity for clusters of G residues in RNA (Li2008The).

TSNAX interacts with the adenosine A2A receptor, mediating its ability to suppress proliferation in PC12 cells. This interaction suggests that the Translin/Trax complex may be regulated by G protein-coupled receptors (Li2008The). The interaction between TSNAX and the A2A receptor is significant in rescuing neurite outgrowth impaired by p53 inhibition, indicating a role in neuronal differentiation (Sun2006Rescue).

In addition to its role in RNA trafficking, TSNAX is involved in DNA repair processes. It activates ATM, a key component in repairing double-stranded DNA breaks, highlighting its versatility in cellular signaling pathways (Chern2019Trax:). TSNAX also interacts with proteins such as GSK3β and DISC1, which are implicated in major mental disorders (Chern2019Trax:).
