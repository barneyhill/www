# RCHY1

## Overview
RCHY1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as ring finger and CHY zinc finger domain containing 1, also referred to as Pirh2. This protein is categorized as a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. Pirh2 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it regulates the stability of various proteins by tagging them for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Among its key targets is the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is essential for controlling cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis. By modulating the levels of p53 and other proteins such as p21 and c-myc, Pirh2 influences cellular responses to stress and damage, with significant implications for cancer development and treatment (Ouyang2022Comprehensive; Choi2020E3).

## Function
RCHY1, also known as Pirh2, is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in protein degradation within healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it regulates the stability of various proteins by targeting them for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. One of its key functions is the regulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. By ubiquitinating p53, RCHY1 controls its degradation, thereby influencing cell cycle progression and the cellular response to DNA damage (Choi2020E3).

RCHY1 is also involved in the regulation of other proteins such as p21 and c-myc, which are important for cell proliferation and apoptosis. The ubiquitination activity of RCHY1 is independent of Mdm2, another E3 ligase known to target p53, highlighting its unique role in cellular processes (Choi2020E3). The protein's activity in the ubiquitin-proteasome system is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress signals, which can have implications for cancer development and treatment (Ouyang2022Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RCHY1 gene, which encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pirh2, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In lung, ovarian, and breast cancers, lower expression levels of PIRH2 are associated with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Hakem2011Role). Conversely, high levels of Pirh2 expression correlate with poor prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, glioma, and breast cancer. In these cancers, Pirh2 overexpression is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness and reduced patient survival (Daks2022The).

Pirh2 also plays a role in the degradation of key proteins involved in cancer progression, such as p53, c-MYC, and p27. Alterations in Pirh2 expression can lead to dysregulation of these proteins, contributing to tumorigenesis (Daks2022The; Hakem2011Role). In multiple myeloma, Pirh2 expression is associated with resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, and its overexpression can restore drug sensitivity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Daks2022The). These findings underscore the importance of RCHY1 in cancer prognosis and therapy.

## Interactions
RCHY1, also known as Pirh2, is a RING-finger type E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, primarily involved in ubiquitination and degradation processes. It interacts with the homeodomain transcription factor HOXA2, which induces the proteasomal degradation of RCHY1. This interaction occurs in the nucleus and involves the homeodomain of HOXA2, although the homeodomain alone is not sufficient for RCHY1 degradation. The degradation process is proteasome-dependent, as evidenced by the stabilization of RCHY1 upon proteasome inhibition (Bridoux2015Molecular).

RCHY1 also interacts with the histone deacetylase HDAC2, promoting its degradation. This interaction is independent of the p53 status and does not require the involvement of Mdm2, another E3 ligase known to target HDAC2 (Choi2020E3).

In multiple myeloma, RCHY1 collaborates with RFWD2, another RING type E3 ubiquitin ligase, to mediate the ubiquitination of the protein P27. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, and the presence of both RCHY1 and RFWD2 is associated with poor survival outcomes in patients (Guo2021Targeting).
