# YTHDC1

## Overview
YTHDC1 is a gene that encodes the YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein C1, a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of RNA metabolism. This protein is characterized by its YTH domain, which is essential for recognizing and binding N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on RNA, a key process in mRNA processing and function (Shi2021Linking; Liao2022Insight). YTHDC1 plays a significant role in the nuclear export of m6A-methylated mRNAs, influencing alternative splicing and interacting with various splicing factors and nuclear export proteins (Roundtree2017YTHDC1). The protein's interactions and modifications are crucial for its function in RNA transcription and splicing, impacting cellular processes and potentially contributing to disease states, including various cancers (Yan2022Roles; Dattilo2023The). As such, YTHDC1 is a subject of interest for its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in oncology (Yan2022Roles).

## Structure
The YTHDC1 protein is characterized by the presence of a YTH domain, which is crucial for its function in recognizing and binding N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on RNA. This domain is highly conserved and typically consists of 100-150 amino acids, featuring a mixed α-helix-β-sheet fold that forms a central, globular β-barrel surrounded by α-helices (Shi2021Linking; Liao2022Insight). The YTH domain includes a conserved aromatic cage composed of tryptophan residues, such as Trp377, Trp411, Trp428, Trp465, and Trp470, which are essential for m6A recognition (Shi2021Linking; Liao2022Insight).

The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by a hydrophobic core with conserved aromatic residues, and its surface is positively charged, enriched with basic residues like lysines and arginines, facilitating RNA binding (Shi2021Linking). YTHDC1 can bind both single-stranded RNA and DNA, with a higher affinity for DNA, due to structural features that accommodate the methylated adenine in a hydrophobic pocket (Woodcock2020Biochemical).

YTHDC1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its functional roles in RNA processing (Liao2022Insight).

## Function
YTHDC1 is a nuclear protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA metabolism in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the nuclear export of N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-methylated mRNAs, facilitating their transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This process is essential for proper mRNA processing and function, as m6A modifications are key biochemical markers for selective mRNA metabolism (Roundtree2017YTHDC1).

YTHDC1 interacts with the splicing factor and nuclear export adaptor protein SRSF3, which aids in the binding of mRNA to the nuclear export factor NXF1. This interaction is necessary for the YTHDC1-dependent export of m6A-modified mRNAs (Roundtree2017YTHDC1). The protein also influences alternative splicing patterns by interacting with splicing factors such as SRSF3 and SRSF10, impacting the selection of splice sites and alternative polyadenylation (Liao2022Insight).

YTHDC1's role extends to the regulation of m6A-methylated circRNA and lncRNA, contributing to various cellular processes and potentially influencing disease states (Liao2022Insight). Its activity in the nucleus is crucial for maintaining RNA transcription and splicing, thereby ensuring proper gene expression and cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
YTHDC1 is implicated in various cancers and diseases through its role in m6A RNA methylation. In breast cancer, YTHDC1 is downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer tissues, suggesting a tumor suppressor role, but its overexpression in vitro indicates it may act as an oncogene by promoting cell viability and drug resistance (Yan2022Roles). In glioma, YTHDC1 affects mRNA splicing, contributing to the cancer phenotype (Yan2022Roles). In lung cancer, YTHDC1 is identified as a prognostic gene, with its downregulation associated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (Yan2022Roles). In rhabdomyosarcoma, YTHDC1, in conjunction with DDX5, promotes the production of circular RNAs, which are associated with tumor proliferation and progression (Dattilo2023The).

In renal cancer, YTHDC1 is downregulated, correlating with poor outcomes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (Yan2022Roles). In hepatocellular carcinoma, YTHDC1 is overexpressed and linked to poorer survival, facilitating tumorigenesis through m6A-modified circRNAs (Yan2022Roles). In endometrial cancer, lower YTHDC1 expression is linked to immune cell infiltration, indicating its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Yan2022Roles). These findings highlight YTHDC1's diverse roles in disease mechanisms, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
YTHDC1, a nuclear protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, primarily through its role in RNA splicing and mRNA export. It interacts with splicing enhancer-binding SR proteins, specifically SRSF3 and SRSF10. The N-terminal domain of YTHDC1 interacts with the C-terminal domains of these proteins, influencing their localization and RNA-binding abilities. YTHDC1's interaction with SRSF3 is crucial for its localization to nuclear speckles and RNA binding, while its depletion enhances SRSF10's RNA-binding ability and promotes its localization to nuclear speckles (Kretschmer2024Interactions).

YTHDC1 also interacts with SAF-B and Sam68, modulating alternative splice site selection. This process is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by src kinases, which affect YTHDC1's shuttling between the nucleus and cytosol (Shi2021Linking). The protein's m6A binding ability is essential for these interactions, as it recruits the YTHDC1-SRSF3 complex to mark exons for inclusion, while unmodified sites allow SRSF10 binding, promoting exon skipping (Hazra2019m6A).

YTHDC1 interacts with m6A-modified RNA through its YTH domain, which recognizes the 5'-Gm6A-3' motif. This interaction is facilitated by a conserved aromatic cage that binds m6A with higher affinity than unmethylated adenosine (Krepl2021Recognition).
