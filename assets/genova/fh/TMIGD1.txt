# TMIGD1

## Overview
TMIGD1 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein 1, a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and signaling. This protein is characterized by its extracellular domain, which contains two immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. TMIGD1 is predominantly expressed in kidney and intestinal epithelial cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and function. It interacts with various proteins, including ERM proteins and the polarity protein Scribble, to regulate cell polarity and microtubule dynamics. TMIGD1 is also implicated in protecting renal epithelial cells from oxidative stress and is involved in mitochondrial localization and microvilli organization. Its expression is downregulated in several cancers, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive function (Thüring2023Membrane; Rahimi2021The; Arafa2015TMIGD1).

## Structure
The TMIGD1 protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by the TMIGD1 gene, featuring a structure that includes an extracellular domain with two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The Ig-like domains are of the C2-type and form a typical Ig fold with two antiparallel beta-sheets, which are crucial for its function as a cell adhesion molecule (Hartmann2020The; Arafa2015TMIGD1). The cytoplasmic domain is enriched with positively charged amino acids, specifically lysine and arginine, and terminates in a canonical type I PDZ domain-binding motif, which facilitates interactions with other proteins (Hartmann2020The; Rahimi2021The).

TMIGD1 undergoes post-translational modification through N-glycosylation, which increases its molecular weight from a predicted 29 kDa to approximately 45 kDa. This modification is typical for cell surface proteins and is confirmed by treatment with N-glycosidase F, which reduces the molecular weight back to 29 kDa (Arafa2015TMIGD1). The protein's glycosylation is important for its localization at the cell surface, and it contains five potential N-linked glycosylation sites in its extracellular domain (Hartmann2020The). TMIGD1 is predominantly expressed in kidney and intestinal epithelial cells, where it plays a role in cell adhesion and signaling (Rahimi2021The).

## Function
TMIGD1 is a cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and function. It is predominantly expressed in kidney and intestinal epithelial cells, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and tissue organization. TMIGD1 interacts with ERM proteins, specifically moesin and ezrin, through an RRKK motif on its cytoplasmic domain, which is essential for the apical localization of these proteins in epithelial cells. This interaction regulates microtubule dynamics and cell migration by influencing tubulin acetylation, which is important for maintaining cell polarity and chromosomal stability (Rahimi2021The).

TMIGD1 also serves as a membrane anchor for the polarity protein Scribble, recruiting it to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells through a PDZ domain-mediated interaction. This localization is critical for maintaining apical-basal polarity, which is essential for proper cell function and organization (Ebnet2023The; Thüring2023Membrane). In addition, TMIGD1 is involved in protecting renal epithelial cells from oxidative stress and plays a role in mitochondrial localization and microvilli organization (Hartmann2020The). Its expression is downregulated in various cancers, suggesting a tumor-suppressive function (Rahimi2021The; Luo2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMIGD1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly Crohn's disease (CD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In Crohn's disease, TMIGD1 is significantly downregulated in the inflamed intestinal mucosa, which is associated with increased inflammation and impaired intestinal barrier integrity. This downregulation exacerbates colitis and contributes to the pathogenesis of CD by affecting the BANF1-NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to increased intestinal permeability and inflammation (Zhou2023Decreased). TMIGD1 expression levels have also been linked to the response to anti-TNF therapy in CD patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for treatment efficacy (Zhou2023Decreased).

In colorectal cancer, TMIGD1 acts as a putative tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation and tumor progression. Loss of TMIGD1 expression in mice leads to hyperplasia and the development of intestinal adenomas, indicating its significant role in colorectal cancer (De2021Transmembrane). TMIGD1 is also downregulated in colorectal precancerous lesions and advanced colorectal cancer, suggesting its involvement in the neoplastic process (cattaneo2010transcriptomic).

## Interactions
TMIGD1 interacts with the Scribble (Scrib) protein, a member of the LAP protein family, through a PDZ domain-mediated mechanism. This interaction involves the PDZ domains of Scrib and the PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) of TMIGD1. Specifically, TMIGD1 binds to the PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3 domains of Scrib, with PDZ3 showing a higher affinity than PDZ1. PDZ2 contributes to the interaction but does not bind independently, suggesting cooperative interactions among the domains (Ebnet2023The; Thüring2023Membrane).

TMIGD1 serves as a membrane anchor for Scrib, recruiting it to the basolateral membrane in epithelial cells. This recruitment is crucial for maintaining cell polarity and Scrib's tumor-suppressive activity. The interaction is significant for the localization of Scrib to cell-cell junctions, influencing apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells (Ebnet2023The; Thüring2023Membrane).

TMIGD1 also interacts with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein SYNJ2BP through a PDZ domain-dependent mechanism. SYNJ2BP can recruit TMIGD1 to mitochondria, highlighting a dynamic interaction that affects cellular localization and function (Hartmann2020The).
