# PGR

## Overview
The PGR gene encodes the progesterone receptor, a critical component of the nuclear receptor family that functions as a transcription factor. This receptor is pivotal in mediating the physiological effects of the hormone progesterone, particularly in reproductive tissues. The progesterone receptor exists in two main isoforms, PGR-A and PGR-B, each with distinct functional roles in gene regulation. PGR-A is primarily involved in transcriptional repression, whereas PGR-B is associated with transcriptional activation, facilitating the expression of target genes (Wetendorf2014Progesterone; MedinaLaver2021What). The receptor's activity is modulated by various post-translational modifications, which influence its ability to regulate gene expression and maintain hormonal balance. PGR is expressed in several tissues, including the uterus and ovary, where it plays a vital role in processes such as the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and uterine function (MedinaLaver2021What). Its interactions with other proteins and DNA elements underscore its importance in reproductive health and its potential implications in various pathologies, including cancer.

## Structure


## Function
The PGR gene encodes the progesterone receptor, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to the hormone progesterone. This receptor is involved in various molecular processes essential for reproductive health. It functions as a transcription factor, binding to progesterone response elements (PREs) in the DNA to regulate the transcription of target genes. The PGR protein exists in two main isoforms, PGR-A and PGR-B, which have distinct roles. PGR-A is associated with transcriptional repression, while PGR-B is transcriptionally active, promoting gene expression (Wetendorf2014Progesterone; MedinaLaver2021What).

In healthy human cells, PGR is involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and uterine function. It modulates the effects of progesterone, influencing processes such as decidualization, which is crucial for embryo implantation (Wetendorf2014Progesterone). PGR also plays a role in maintaining hormonal balance and is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus and ovary (MedinaLaver2021What). The receptor's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which affect its transcriptional activity and nuclear shuttling (Wetendorf2014Progesterone).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PGR gene, which encodes the progesterone receptor, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In breast cancer, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs1042638 (V660L) and haplotypes like ATGCCGA and GTGCCGA are associated with increased risk, while others like ATGGCGA may offer a protective effect (Ghali2018Progesterone; Pooley2006Association). The V660L polymorphism is linked to increased breast cancer risk due to its association with the PROGINS polymorphism, which enhances mRNA stability and transcriptional activity (Pooley2006Association).

In endometrial cancer, the +331G/A SNP in the PGR promoter region increases the transcription of the hPR-B isoform, potentially leading to increased cell growth and cancer development (De2002A). This SNP is associated with a higher risk of endometrial cancer, as demonstrated by a significant odds ratio in case-control studies (De2002A).

Loss of PGR expression, often due to promoter hypermethylation or loss of heterozygosity, is common in various cancers and may contribute to treatment resistance, particularly in breast cancer (Kunc2021Lost). These genetic and epigenetic changes in the PGR gene underscore its potential role as a tumor suppressor and its impact on cancer prognosis and therapy.

## Interactions
The progesterone receptor (PGR) engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. PGR interacts with RUNX transcription factors, particularly RUNX1 and RUNX2, in granulosa cells. These interactions are essential for ovulatory transcription and chromatin remodeling, as PGR and RUNX1 co-bind to chromatin, significantly overlapping at binding sites crucial for gene expression during ovulation (Dinh2023Progesterone). 

PGR also interacts with SH3 domains of cytoplasmic signaling molecules, including c-Src tyrosine kinases. This interaction is mediated by a specific polyproline motif in the amino-terminal domain of PGR, facilitating rapid activation of Src kinases independent of PGR's transcriptional activity (Boonyaratanakornkit2001Progesterone). 

In addition to these interactions, PGR forms complexes with coactivators and corepressors, such as SRC-1 and NCOR1, and interacts with heat shock proteins (HSPs) to modulate transcription. These interactions enable PGR to bind specific DNA sequences, influencing gene expression in a tissue-specific manner (Dinh2019Tissuespecific; Kowalik2013The). These multifaceted interactions highlight PGR's role in regulating reproductive physiology through both genomic and non-genomic pathways.
