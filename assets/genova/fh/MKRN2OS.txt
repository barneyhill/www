# MKRN2OS

## Overview
MKRN2OS is a gene that encodes the MKRN2 opposite strand protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. The MKRN2OS gene is located on the opposite strand of the MKRN2 gene, suggesting a potential regulatory relationship between the two. The MKRN2 opposite strand protein is categorized as a non-coding RNA, which plays a role in gene expression regulation and may be implicated in certain signaling pathways. Research has indicated that MKRN2OS may interact with other molecular components to influence cellular functions, although the precise mechanisms and pathways remain to be fully elucidated (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further studies are required to understand the clinical significance of MKRN2OS and its potential implications in human health and disease.
