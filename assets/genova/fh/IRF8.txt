# IRF8

## Overview
IRF8, or interferon regulatory factor 8, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the interferon regulatory factor family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system. The IRF8 protein is primarily involved in the regulation of immune cell differentiation and function, particularly within myeloid and lymphoid lineages. It acts as a transcriptional regulator, influencing the expression of genes critical for immune responses, such as those involved in cytokine production and antigen presentation. IRF8 is known for its ability to form both homodimers and heterodimers with other transcription factors, thereby modulating various signaling pathways, including TLR, NF-κB, and Jak/Stat. The protein's activity is further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. Mutations in the IRF8 gene have been linked to immunodeficiencies and inflammatory conditions, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Hambleton2011IRF8Mutations; Tamura2008The; Salem2020Role).

## Structure
The IRF8 protein is a transcription factor involved in immune response regulation. It contains a DNA-binding domain (DBD) characterized by a helix-turn-helix motif and a tryptophan pentad repeat, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Chen2012Molecular). The protein also includes an IRF association domain (IAD) and a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the DBD, which are essential for its function in antiviral responses (Chen2012Molecular).

IRF8 can form homodimers or heterodimers with other IRF family members, influencing its regulatory functions (White2016Interferon). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect its activity and stability, although specific phosphorylation sites in IRF8 are not detailed in the provided context (White2016Interferon). The protein is constitutively expressed in various organs, with higher expression levels in the spleen, kidney, and head kidney (Chen2012Molecular).

The IRF8 gene in turbot is 4363 base pairs long, consisting of nine exons and eight introns, encoding a protein of 420 amino acids (Chen2012Molecular). The predicted protein sequence of IRF8 shares 64.4-69.7% identity with other fish IRF8 proteins, indicating evolutionary conservation (Chen2012Molecular).

## Function
IRF8 (interferon regulatory factor 8) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and function of immune cells, particularly myeloid and lymphoid lineages. In healthy human cells, IRF8 is involved in the differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells into macrophages and dendritic cells, while inhibiting their differentiation into granulocytes (Tamura2008The; Tamura2005Identification). It acts as both an activator and repressor of transcription, depending on its interacting partners and target DNA elements (Tamura2008The).

IRF8 is essential for the expression of genes involved in immune responses, such as IL12B and NOS2, which are important for cytokine production and pathogen defense (Hambleton2011IRF8Mutations). It regulates the transcription of genes critical for antigen presentation and T cell activation, influencing pathways like TLR, NF-κB, and Jak/Stat (Salem2020Role). In macrophages, IRF8 induces genes related to endosomal/lysosomal enzymes, enhancing their antimicrobial functions (Tamura2008The).

IRF8 also plays a role in the maturation and function of natural killer (NK) cells, influencing their development and cytotoxicity (Mace2016Biallelic). It is active in the nucleus, where it forms complexes with other transcription factors, such as PU.1, IRF1, and STAT1, to modulate gene expression and maintain immune homeostasis (Salem2020Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IRF8 gene are associated with a range of immunological and inflammatory conditions. Biallelic mutations in IRF8 can lead to severe immunodeficiencies, characterized by a lack of circulating monocytes and dendritic cells, as well as impaired natural killer (NK) cell maturation and function. These mutations result in increased susceptibility to viral infections and mycobacterial diseases, such as those caused by the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine (Hambleton2011IRF8Mutations; Mace2016Biallelic). Specific mutations, such as K108E and T80A, have been identified as causing distinct immunodeficiencies, with the former leading to a severe autosomal recessive condition and the latter to a milder autosomal dominant form (Hambleton2011IRF8Mutations).

IRF8 polymorphisms are also implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc), where decreased IRF8 expression due to enhancer region deletions results in an overproduction of inflammatory monocytes. This alteration is linked to the development of M2 macrophages and affects the regulation of IFN-I signaling, contributing to SSc pathogenesis (Mennella2024The).

In dialysis patients, reduced IRF8 expression in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is associated with a higher rate of infections, suggesting that the uremic environment and dialysis treatment may modulate IRF8 expression, leading to an immunosuppressive state (FriebusKardash2023Expression).

## Interactions
IRF8, also known as interferon regulatory factor 8, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence immune cell differentiation and function. It physically interacts with the transcription factor C/EBPa, inhibiting its ability to bind to chromatin and suppressing its transcriptional activity. This interaction occurs through the DNA-binding domains of both proteins and is crucial for preventing the differentiation of mononuclear phagocyte progenitors into neutrophils (Kurotaki2014IRF8).

IRF8 also forms heterodimers with other transcription factors such as PU.1 and BATF. The IRF8-PU.1 heterodimer activates genes containing ETS-IRF composite elements, while the IRF8-BATF heterodimer binds to activating protein-1-IRF composite elements to promote gene activation during dendritic cell differentiation (Kurotaki2014IRF8).

In the context of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) signaling, IRF8 interacts with TEL, a member of the Ets family, leading to the recruitment of histone deacetylase HDAC3 to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). This interaction results in transcriptional repression, highlighting IRF8's dual role in gene regulation by associating with different Ets family proteins (Kuwata2002Gamma).
