# ENGASE

## Overview
The ENGASE gene encodes the enzyme endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, a crucial component in the cellular process of glycoprotein degradation. This enzyme is classified as a glycoside hydrolase and is primarily involved in the catabolism of free N-glycans within the cytosol. It plays a significant role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) system by cleaving N-acetylglucosamine residues, which is essential for the breakdown of misfolded glycoproteins (Maynard2020Cytosolic; Suzuki2002Endoβ). ENGASE, along with PNGase, is one of the two main cytosolic deglycosylating enzymes, facilitating the conversion of free oligosaccharides to a form that can be further degraded and transported into lysosomes (Suzuki2002Endoβ). The activity of endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase is integral to maintaining protein homeostasis and proper glycoprotein processing in mammalian cells (Chantret2010Identification).

## Function
The human gene ENGASE encodes the enzyme endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, which plays a crucial role in the processing of free oligosaccharides in the cytosol. This enzyme is involved in the catabolism of free N-glycans, cleaving the bond between N-acetylglucosamine residues, which is essential for the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins as part of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) system (Maynard2020Cytosolic; Suzuki2002Endoβ). ENGASE is one of two cytosolic deglycosylating enzymes, the other being PNGase, and is responsible for converting free oligosaccharides from di-N-acetylchitobiose to a single GlcNAc at their reducing termini. This conversion is necessary for further degradation by a cytosolic alpha-mannosidase and is crucial for the formation of a free oligosaccharide structure that is transported into lysosomes (Suzuki2002Endoβ).

In mammalian cells, ENGASE activity is linked to the processing of ERAD substrates, and its function is modulated by proteasome inhibition (Maynard2020Cytosolic). The enzyme is active in the cytosol, where it contributes to the maintenance of protein homeostasis by processing misfolded glycoproteins, and its activity is essential for proper glycoprotein processing and function in cells (Chantret2010Identification).
