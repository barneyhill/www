# CISD2

## Overview
CISD2 is a gene that encodes the CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 protein, which is a crucial component in cellular homeostasis and longevity. The protein is characterized by its CDGSH domain, which coordinates a [2Fe-2S] cluster, playing a significant role in redox reactions and iron-sulfur cluster binding. As a transmembrane protein, CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 is primarily localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria-associated membranes, where it is involved in regulating calcium and iron homeostasis. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as SERCA2 and BCL-2, are vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and preventing oxidative stress. Mutations in the CISD2 gene are associated with Wolfram syndrome type 2, a neurodegenerative disorder, and its expression levels have implications in cancer progression and aging (Shen2021CISD2; Liao2021CISD2; Tamir2015Structure–function).

## Structure
The CISD2 protein, encoded by the CISD2 gene, is characterized by its unique structural features, including a conserved CDGSH domain that coordinates a [2Fe-2S] cluster. This cluster is coordinated by a 3Cys:1His configuration, which is crucial for the protein's function in redox reactions and iron-sulfur cluster binding (Tamir2015Structure–function; Karmi2018The). The protein forms a homodimer, with each monomer containing a CDGSH motif that hosts one [2Fe-2S] cluster (Cheng2017Binding). The NEET fold, a distinctive feature of CISD2, consists of a beta-cap domain and a cluster-binding domain, contributing to the protein's structural stability and function (Tamir2015Structure–function; Karmi2018The).

CISD2 is localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the mitochondria-associated membrane, playing a critical role in cellular homeostasis, including iron and calcium regulation (Shen2021CISD2). The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in cellular processes (Karmi2018The). CISD2 is also associated with Wolfram syndrome 2, a disorder linked to mutations in this gene (Shen2021CISD2).

## Function
The CISD2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the regulation of cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) integrity, and mitochondrial function. CISD2 is localized on the ER, outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), where it helps maintain the structural integrity of these organelles and facilitates communication between the ER and mitochondria, essential for cellular functions and signaling pathways (Shen2021CISD2).

CISD2 interacts with several proteins, including SERCA2, to protect it from oxidative modifications, ensuring optimal Ca2+ pumping activity and preserving intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (Shen2021CISD2). It also interacts with BCL-2 to inhibit autophagy and regulate mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis, preventing mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Shen2021CISD2). CISD2's role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity is crucial for energy metabolism and cell survival, as its deficiency leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death with autophagic features (Wu2012A).

In addition to its cellular functions, CISD2 is recognized as a prolongevity gene, with its expression levels being a key determinant of lifespan and healthspan. High levels of CISD2 promote longevity by maintaining mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress (Shen2021CISD2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CISD2 gene are linked to Wolfram syndrome type 2 (WFS2), a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. WFS2 is characterized by diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and additional symptoms such as peptic ulcer bleeding and defective platelet aggregation (Mozzillo2014A; Cattaneo2017A). Specific mutations, such as the c.103 + 1G > A substitution, lead to the production of truncated, non-functional protein isoforms, resulting in decreased mitochondrial function and integrity (Cattaneo2017A). 

CISD2 deficiency is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to premature aging and neurodegeneration, as observed in Cisd2 knockout mice (Chen2009Cisd2). These mice exhibit clinical features similar to WFS2 patients, including early-onset nerve degeneration and impaired glucose tolerance (Chen2009Cisd2). 

Altered expression of CISD2 is also implicated in cancer progression. Overexpression of CISD2 is linked to increased tumor growth and poor prognosis in various cancers, including breast, cervical, and prostate cancers (Liao2021CISD2). In contrast, CISD2 acts as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma, where its deficiency leads to increased tumor susceptibility (Shen2021CISD2).

## Interactions
CISD2 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It interacts with SERCA2, a protein responsible for calcium uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), helping to maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, showing co-localization with the ER marker calnexin. CISD2 modulates the redox status of SERCA2, protecting it from oxidative modifications and preserving its calcium pumping activity (Shen2021CISD2).

CISD2 also interacts with BCL-2 on the ER membrane, participating in the BCL-2-regulated autophagy pathway by modulating the calcium channel activity of the IP3R receptor. In the absence of CISD2, BCL-2 cannot properly release ER calcium stores, leading to increased autophagy (Shen2021CISD2; Kung2021The). Additionally, CISD2 forms a complex with Bcl-2 and Beclin-1, acting as an autophagy regulator by enhancing the Bcl-2-Beclin-1 interaction, thus preventing apoptosis (Kung2021The).

CISD2 interacts with Gimap5, located in the outer mitochondrial membrane of the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) region, which is involved in calcium regulation. Loss of either CISD2 or Gimap5 reduces mitochondrial calcium uptake capacity and elevates cytosolic calcium levels, affecting mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory function (Shen2021CISD2; Liao2021CISD2).
