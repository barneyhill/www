# TMEM184B

## Overview
TMEM184B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 184B, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary significance (Bhattacharya2016TMEM184b; Cho2021The). As a transmembrane protein, TMEM184B is primarily involved in cellular signaling and transport processes, particularly within the nervous system. It plays a crucial role in axon degeneration, neuromuscular junction maintenance, and synaptic transmission, with a significant presence in recycling endosomes within neuronal axons and soma (Bhattacharya2016TMEM184b). TMEM184B is also implicated in the regulation of autophagy and synaptic gene networks, influencing pathways such as Wnt signaling, which are essential for neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Wright2023Transmembrane). Mutations in TMEM184B have been linked to various neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions (Wright2023Transmembrane; Bhattacharya2016TMEM184b).

## Structure
TMEM184B is a transmembrane protein characterized by seven transmembrane domains, as indicated by hydrophobicity analysis and structural predictions (Bhattacharya2016TMEM184b; Gyimesi2022Systematic). These domains suggest its involvement in cellular signaling or transport processes. The protein is highly conserved across species, from flies to humans, indicating its evolutionary importance (Bhattacharya2016TMEM184b; Cho2021The).

The primary structure of TMEM184B consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, with certain variants clustering in regions encoding transmembrane domains or cytoplasmic loops (Chapman2024Pathogenic). Structural modeling and stability analysis suggest that missense variants can significantly disrupt the transmembrane regions, potentially leading to loss of function (Chapman2024Pathogenic).

TMEM184B is localized to recycling endosomes within neuronal axons and soma, particularly colocalizing with Rab11, a marker of recycling endosomes, which suggests its role in axon degeneration and synaptic maintenance (Bhattacharya2016TMEM184b). The protein's involvement in intracellular membrane trafficking is further supported by its presence in endosomal compartments (Cho2021The). The molecular structure of TMEM184B includes a pore domain where many human disease-associated variants cluster, affecting the protein's stability and function (Chapman2024Pathogenic).

## Function
TMEM184B is a transmembrane protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including axon degeneration, neuromuscular junction (NMJ) maintenance, and synaptic transmission. In healthy human cells, TMEM184B is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, where it plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of NMJs and sensory terminals. It is localized to recycling endosomes within neuronal axons and soma, suggesting its involvement in intracellular trafficking and membrane recycling (Bhattacharya2016TMEM184b).

TMEM184B is implicated in the regulation of autophagy, a process essential for cellular homeostasis and the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. Its loss leads to abnormal accumulations of autophagosomal structures, indicating defects in autophagic clearance (Bhattacharya2016TMEM184b). The protein also influences synaptic gene networks, affecting the expression of genes involved in synapse assembly and neural development, which are crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Wright2023Transmembrane).

In the hippocampus, TMEM184B is associated with the regulation of synaptic gene expression and is linked to pathways such as Wnt signaling, which is important for neurogenesis and long-term spatial memory (Wright2023Transmembrane). These functions highlight TMEM184B's role in maintaining proper neuronal function and its potential impact on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TMEM184B gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders. In mice, mutations in TMEM184B lead to significant changes in synaptic and epidermal nerve terminal architecture, resulting in sensory-motor dysfunction. These mutations are associated with defective autophagy, a process crucial for protein degradation, and are linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Bhattacharya2016TMEM184b). TMEM184B is also involved in maintaining synaptic gene networks in the hippocampus, and its disruption can lead to altered synaptic processes, including post-synaptic density organization and synaptic plasticity. This disruption is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (Wright2023Transmembrane).

TMEM184B's role in pruriceptive neurons is crucial for itch sensation, and its absence leads to reduced responses to IL-31, a cytokine linked to atopic dermatitis. This suggests a specific defect in itch sensation without affecting pain responses (Larsen2020TMEM184b). Additionally, TMEM184B has been identified as a candidate gene potentially contributing to Alzheimer's Disease progression, although its exact role remains unclear (Wright2023Transmembrane). The gene's involvement in Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for neurogenesis, further underscores its significance in neurological health (Larsen2020TMEM184b).

## Interactions
TMEM184B is involved in various interactions within the nervous system, particularly in synaptic maintenance and axon degeneration. It localizes to recycling endosomes in neuronal axons and soma, showing extensive colocalization with Rab11, a marker of recycling endosomes, indicating its presence on the plasma membrane of neurons (Bhattacharya2016TMEM184b). This suggests a role in membrane trafficking and synaptic structure maintenance, potentially influencing pathways involved in axon degeneration (Bhattacharya2016TMEM184b).

In the mouse hippocampus, TMEM184B is crucial for the expression of synaptic gene networks, interacting with proteins involved in synaptic functions. The loss of TMEM184B affects synaptic processes, including post-synaptic density organization and synaptic plasticity, with implications for Wnt signaling pathways (Wright2023Transmembrane). TMEM184B's interaction with the Wnt signaling pathway is noted, as it positively influences Wnt components and their targets, suggesting a role in synaptic gene regulatory networks (Wright2023Transmembrane).

In Drosophila, the ortholog of TMEM184B, known as Tmep, is implicated in synaptic excitability and endolysosomal progression, showing significant co-localization with n-Syb, a protein associated with endosomes and synaptic vesicles (Cho2021The). These interactions highlight TMEM184B's involvement in synaptic transmission and its potential contribution to neurological disorders.
