# KAT6B

## Overview
KAT6B is a gene that encodes the protein lysine acetyltransferase 6B, a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression through the acetylation of histone lysine residues, which is crucial for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation. KAT6B is involved in various cellular processes, including neurogenesis, hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, and the maintenance of stem cells, by influencing chromatin organization and gene expression (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). The protein forms a tetrameric complex with other proteins such as BRPF1/2/3, ING5, and MEAF6, enhancing its specificity and affinity for histone modifications (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). Mutations in the KAT6B gene are linked to genetic disorders like Genitopatellar Syndrome and Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson Syndrome, which are characterized by developmental anomalies and intellectual disabilities (Simpson2012De; Clayton-Smith2011Whole-Exome-Sequencing).

## Structure
KAT6B is a member of the MYST family of lysine acetyltransferases, characterized by a conserved domain structure. The protein is 2073 amino acids long and shares 60% amino acid identity with its paralog KAT6A (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). It contains a double PHD zinc finger domain and a MYST domain in the N-terminal region, which are crucial for its function. The PHD zinc finger domains facilitate interaction with histone H3 and are essential for nuclear localization, while the MYST domain is involved in DNA binding and enhances acetylation activity (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). The C-terminal region includes a glutamate/aspartate-rich region and a serine/methionine-rich region (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The).

KAT6B forms a tetrameric complex with other proteins, such as BRPF1/2/3, ING5, and MEAF6, which is involved in acetylating lysine residues on histone H3 tails, particularly H3K23 (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). This acetylation is associated with transcriptionally active genes. KAT6B also recognizes and spreads acetylation through recognition of acylated H3K14 (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including acetylation and phosphorylation, which may affect its function (Shukla2018The). KAT6B has multiple splice variants, contributing to its functional diversity (Shukla2018The).

## Function
KAT6B encodes a lysine acetyltransferase that is part of the MYST family of acetyltransferases, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by modifying histone lysine residues, which modulates chromatin organization (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). It is involved in acetylating histone H3, specifically at lysine residues H3K23, and is associated with transcriptionally active genes (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). KAT6B forms a tetrameric complex with proteins such as BRPF1/2/3, ING5, and MEAF6, enhancing its specificity and affinity for histone modifications (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). This complex is responsible for acetylating lysine residues on histone H3 tails, crucial for normal gene transcription (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The).

KAT6B is also involved in various cellular processes beyond histone acetylation, including transcription, DNA damage repair, metabolism, cellular proliferation, mitosis, signal transduction, protein folding, and autophagy (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). It plays a significant role in neurogenesis and hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, affecting chromatin organization and the expression of neural progenitor markers (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). KAT6B is active in the nucleus, influencing various cellular and organismal processes, including craniofacial and heart development, and the maintenance of stem cells (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KAT6B gene are associated with several genetic disorders, primarily Genitopatellar Syndrome (GPS) and Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson Syndrome (SBBYSS), also known as Ohdo syndrome. These conditions are characterized by a range of congenital anomalies and developmental issues. GPS is marked by skeletal dysplasia, including hypoplastic or absent patellae, large joint contractures, ambiguous genitalia, and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Patients often exhibit severe intellectual disability and facial dysmorphisms (Simpson2012De; Gannon2014Further). SBBYSS is characterized by blepharophimosis, ptosis, a mask-like facial appearance, long thumbs and great toes, and thyroid abnormalities. It also involves severe intellectual disability and developmental delay (Zhang2020Further; Clayton-Smith2011Whole-Exome-Sequencing).

Both disorders share overlapping features such as congenital heart defects, genital abnormalities, and hypotonia, suggesting a broader KAT6B spectrum disorder (Zhang2020Further; Gannon2014Further). Mutations in KAT6B are typically de novo and often result in protein truncation, affecting the gene's role in chromatin modification and gene regulation (Simpson2012De; Campeau2012TheKAT6Brelated). These mutations can lead to either loss or gain of function effects, contributing to the phenotypic variability observed in KAT6B disorders (Zhang2020Further).

## Interactions
KAT6B, also known as lysine acetyltransferase 6B, is a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases and participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. KAT6B forms a tetrameric complex with BRPF1/2/3, ING5, and MEAF6, which is essential for acetylating histone H3 on lysines K9, K14, and K23, thereby promoting transcriptionally active chromatin (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). This complex is involved in recognizing and acylating histone H3, indicating its role in gene regulation and chromatin organization (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The).

KAT6B also interacts with transcription factors such as RUNX1 and RUNX2, which are significant for gene expression regulation and are frequently targeted in leukemia (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). These interactions highlight KAT6B's involvement in transcriptional regulation by acetylating histones and transcription factors in a context-dependent manner (Sheikh2018The).

In cancer, KAT6B is targeted by miRNAs such as miR-22 and miR-4513, which modulate its expression and influence cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). These interactions underscore KAT6B's role in tumor progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
