# HDHD2

## Overview
The HDHD2 gene encodes the protein haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain containing 2, which is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as a hydrolase, involved in the dephosphorylation of small molecules within the cytoplasm, thereby influencing cellular energy balance and signaling pathways (Gohla2019Do). While the specific roles of HDHD2 in human physiology are not comprehensively defined, it is implicated in phosphate metabolism and intermediary metabolism, targeting small metabolites rather than proteins (Linnemann2009Silencing; Gohla2019Do). Research in model organisms suggests a role in glycation repair and potential involvement in brain-specific functions, particularly under conditions of genetic and dietary stress (Niu2014Proteome; SuszyńskaZajczyk2014Hyperhomocysteinemia). Further studies are required to fully understand the molecular mechanisms and physiological implications of HDHD2 in humans.

## Structure


## Function
The HDHD2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, which is involved in dephosphorylation processes within cells. This protein is active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in regulating the phosphorylation state of small molecules, impacting cellular energy balance and signaling pathways (Gohla2019Do). Although specific functions of HDHD2 in healthy human cells are not detailed extensively, it is associated with phosphate metabolism, suggesting its involvement in intermediary metabolism by targeting small metabolites rather than proteins (Linnemann2009Silencing; Gohla2019Do).

In studies involving mice, HDHD2 has been implicated in glycation repair, a process that may be crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions such as exposure to fluoride and lead (Niu2014Proteome). Additionally, HDHD2 expression is upregulated in response to certain genetic and dietary conditions, indicating its potential role in brain-specific functions and neurodegenerative processes (SuszyńskaZajczyk2014Hyperhomocysteinemia). However, the precise molecular activities and organismal outcomes of HDHD2's function in humans remain to be fully elucidated.
