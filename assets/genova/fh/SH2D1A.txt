# SH2D1A

## Overview
The SH2D1A gene encodes the SLAM-associated protein (SAP), a critical intracellular adapter protein involved in immune cell signaling. SAP is characterized by a single Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which facilitates its interaction with the SLAM family of receptors, playing a pivotal role in modulating T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell responses. The protein's unique ability to bind phosphotyrosine sites in a phosphorylation-independent manner allows it to influence various signaling pathways, including those mediated by the Src-family kinase FynT. This interaction is essential for the regulation of immune responses, particularly in the context of T helper cell differentiation and NK cell cytotoxicity. Mutations in the SH2D1A gene are associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) and other immunodeficiencies, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Sumegi2002A; Calpe2008The).

## Structure
The SH2D1A gene encodes the SAP protein, which is primarily composed of a single Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. This domain is crucial for its function in modulating T-cell signaling by interacting with co-activators like SLAM (Li1999Novel). The SH2 domain of SAP is unique in its ability to bind phosphotyrosine (pTyr) sites in a phosphorylation-independent manner, recognizing both amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal sequences relative to the pTyr residue (Li1999Novel). The SAP protein consists of a single SH2 domain flanked by 5 amino-terminal and 26 carboxy-terminal amino acids (Li1999Novel).

The secondary structure of the SAP protein includes two α-helical regions and six β-strands, as predicted based on chemical shift deviations from NMR studies (Li1999Novel). The SH2 domain adopts a conventional fold characterized by a large central beta-sheet flanked by two alpha-helices and a small beta-sheet (Hwang2002A). The SH2 domain's structure is flexible, particularly in the BG and EF loops, which contributes to its ability to accommodate various peptide ligands (Hwang2002A).

SH2D1A functions as a monomer and lacks a quaternary structure. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate its activity. There are known splice variants of SH2D1A, which may affect its function and interactions.

## Function
The SH2D1A gene encodes the SLAM-associated protein (SAP), which plays a critical role in immune cell signaling, particularly in T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. SAP is a small intracellular adapter molecule containing a single SH2 domain, which allows it to interact with the SLAM family of receptors, including SLAM (CD150), 2B4 (CD244), and others (Calpe2008The; Endt2006Modulation). This interaction is crucial for the recruitment and activation of the Src-family kinase FynT, which is essential for SLAM-induced signaling events (Chan2003SAP; Calpe2008The).

SAP's unique binding mechanism involves the SH2 domain of SAP binding to the SH3 domain of FynT, facilitating the activation of Fyn kinase and promoting phosphorylation of SLAM receptors. This process is vital for modulating the balance of T helper cell responses, influencing cytokine production during immune responses (Calpe2008The; Latour2001Regulation). SAP also acts as a natural blocker of SH2 domain-mediated interactions, potentially preventing inhibitory signals in NK cells, thereby enhancing their cytotoxic responses (Endt2006Modulation).

In healthy human cells, SAP expression is tightly regulated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, ensuring precise control over immune cell activation and function (Okamoto2004Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SH2D1A gene are primarily associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP), a rare immunodeficiency disorder characterized by an abnormal response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections. This condition can lead to severe complications such as fatal infectious mononucleosis, malignant lymphoma, and dysgammaglobulinemia (Sumegi2002A; Erdõs2005Characterization). Specific missense mutations, including R32Q, C42W, and T53I, disrupt the SH2D1A protein's ability to bind to target proteins, impairing its function and leading to disease (Sumegi2002A).

SH2D1A mutations are also linked to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a severe immune disorder characterized by excessive immune activation. Some HLH cases involve SH2D1A mutations, such as large interstitial deletions and point mutations like R55X (Arico2001Hemophagocytic; Zhou2017Characterization). Additionally, SH2D1A mutations have been associated with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), which is marked by low serum immunoglobulins and recurrent infections (Sumegi2002A).

The gene's mutations can lead to impaired signaling through SAP-associating receptors, affecting immune cell interactions and responses. This disruption contributes to the immunological defects observed in XLP, such as uncontrolled T-cell proliferation and dysregulated immune responses (Hare2006Missense; Sumegi2002A).

## Interactions
The SH2D1A gene encodes the SLAM-associated protein (SAP), which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for immune cell signaling. SAP is known for its ability to bind both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides of the SLAM (Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule) family of receptors, including SLAM (CD150), 2B4 (CD244), CD84, Ly9 (CD229), and NTB-A (Sumegi2002A; Hwang2002A). This binding occurs through a unique tyrosine-based motif, allowing SAP to modulate signal transduction pathways in T and B lymphocytes (Sumegi2002A).

SAP interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of SLAM at a specific 14 amino acid peptide near the Y281 residue, coordinating hydrogen bonding with specific amino acid residues (Sumegi2002A). This interaction is crucial for inhibiting the recruitment of the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 to SLAM, thereby regulating immune signaling (Sumegi2002A). SAP also competes with SHP-2 for binding to SLAM, affecting the phosphorylation of SLAM's cytoplasmic domain and subsequent signaling pathways (Sumegi2002A).

In addition to SLAM, SAP interacts with the 2B4 receptor on natural killer (NK) cells, displacing SHP-2 and enhancing 2B4 signaling (Sumegi2002A). These interactions highlight SAP's role in modulating immune responses and its involvement in the pathogenesis of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) (Sumegi2002A).
