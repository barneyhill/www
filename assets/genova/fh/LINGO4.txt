# LINGO4

## Overview
The LINGO4 gene encodes the protein leucine rich repeat and Ig domain containing 4, which is implicated in neural development and function. This protein is part of a family characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, which are often involved in protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways. Although the precise biological role of LINGO4 remains to be fully elucidated, it is thought to play a role in the nervous system, potentially influencing processes such as axon guidance and synaptic plasticity. Research has explored the potential involvement of LINGO4 in neurological disorders, such as essential tremor, although current evidence does not support a significant association between LINGO4 variants and this condition in certain populations (Liang2012No).

## Clinical Significance
The LINGO4 gene, which encodes a protein involved in neural development and function, has been investigated for its potential role in neurological disorders. A study by Liang et al. explored the association between LINGO4 gene variants and essential tremor (ET), a common neurological disorder characterized by involuntary shaking. The study focused on a Chinese Han population and involved genetic analysis of the LINGO4 gene's coding region in 150 ET patients and 300 matched controls. Two nucleotide variants were identified: a T > A transition resulting in an amino acid change (Thr444Ser) and a C > T transition near the end of the coding region. Despite these findings, no significant differences in genotypic or allele distributions were observed between ET patients and controls, suggesting that these LINGO4 variants do not significantly contribute to ET susceptibility in this population (Liang2012No).

The study concluded that there is no evidence of an association between LINGO4 gene variants and essential tremor in the studied population, as the statistical analyses showed no significant differences in genotype or allele frequencies between ET patients and controls (Liang2012No).
