# EFHD2

## Overview
EFHD2, also known as Swiprosin-1, is a gene that encodes the EF-hand domain family member D2 protein, a calcium-binding protein characterized by its EF-hand motifs. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton dynamics, immune cell signaling, and synapse formation. EFHD2 is notable for its role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for cell migration and dendritic spine morphology. It is expressed in a variety of cell types, including neurons and immune cells, where it influences processes such as synapse maintenance and cytokine production. The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as tau in neurodegenerative diseases and components of the B cell receptor signaling pathway, underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Unknownauthors2019Swiprosin1EFhd2:fromImmuneRegulatortoPersonalityandBrainDisorders; Vega2016EFhd2; Park2016Structural).

## Structure
EFHD2, also known as Swiprosin-1, is a protein characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are crucial for its calcium-binding capabilities. The primary structure of EFHD2 includes an N-terminal disordered region, a proline-rich PxxP motif, two EF-hand domains, a ligand mimic helix, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (Park2016Structural). The PxxP motif is involved in intracellular localization and actin-binding, interacting with the EF-hand domains through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Park2016Structural).

The secondary structure of EFHD2 features alpha helices, particularly within the EF-hand domains, which form helix-loop-helix structures typical of calcium-binding proteins (Park2016Structural). The tertiary structure of EFHD2 is stabilized by calcium binding, which induces a compact and globular fold necessary for its function (Park2016Structural). In the absence of calcium, EFHD2 exhibits increased conformational flexibility, particularly around the EF-hand domains and the C-terminal linker, affecting its ability to bundle F-actin (Park2016Structural).

The quaternary structure of EFHD2 involves dimerization through a parallel coiled-coil interaction at the C-terminal, which is essential for its actin-bundling activity (Park2016Structural). EFHD2 can also coordinate Zn2+ ions, maintaining a similar structure to its Ca2+-bound state (Mun2023Structural).

## Function
EFHD2, also known as Swiprosin-1, is a calcium-binding protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which are crucial for cell migration and dendritic spine morphology (Unknownauthors2019Swiprosin1EFhd2:fromImmuneRegulatortoPersonalityandBrainDisorders). EFHD2 contains two EF-hand domains that bind calcium ions, influencing its function in enhancing B cell receptor (BCR)-elicited calcium flux, important for immune cell signaling (Unknownauthors2019Swiprosin1EFhd2:fromImmuneRegulatortoPersonalityandBrainDisorders).

In neurons, EFHD2 is highly expressed and is implicated in synapse formation and homeostasis. It co-localizes with neurite markers such as tau, MAP2, synapsin, and PSD95, suggesting its involvement in vesicle transport and synapse maintenance (Vega2016EFhd2). EFHD2 modulates synapse formation by regulating vesicle transport velocity and cytoskeleton rearrangement, although it does not affect synapse maturation (Vega2016EFhd2).

In the immune system, EFHD2 is expressed in various cells, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages, where it regulates processes such as cytokine production and cell migration (Unknownauthors2019Swiprosin1EFhd2:fromImmuneRegulatortoPersonalityandBrainDisorders). It acts as a negative regulator of germinal center-dependent humoral immunity, influencing antibody production and immune responses (Unknownauthors2019Swiprosin1EFhd2:fromImmuneRegulatortoPersonalityandBrainDisorders).

## Clinical Significance
The EFHD2 gene, also known as Swiprosin-1, is implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations, changes in expression levels, or alterations in its interactions. In cancer, EFHD2 overexpression is linked to increased metastasis in melanoma cells and is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, serving as a marker for predicting postsurgical recurrence in lung adenocarcinoma (Unknownauthors2019Swiprosin1EFhd2:fromImmuneRegulatortoPersonalityandBrainDisorders). In non-small cell lung cancer, EFHD2 expression correlates with resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin, affecting patient survival rates (Fan2020EFHD2).

In neurological disorders, EFHD2 is associated with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia through its interaction with tau proteins, forming amyloid structures and affecting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Unknownauthors2019Swiprosin1EFhd2:fromImmuneRegulatortoPersonalityandBrainDisorders). It is also linked to schizophrenia, with changes in expression levels observed in patients, and specific polymorphisms associated with increased risk (Gao2020Association).

EFHD2 is involved in psychiatric disorders, influencing behaviors related to sensation-seeking, low anxiety, and alcohol addiction. Knockout mice studies show altered responses to alcohol and increased risk-taking behaviors, suggesting EFHD2's role in addiction and anxiety traits (Mielenz2017EFhd2Swiprosin1).

## Interactions
EFHD2, also known as Swiprosin-1, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with F-actin, a component of the cytoskeleton, in a calcium-dependent manner, facilitating actin bundling through its coiled-coil domain and EF-hand motifs (Park2016Structural). EFHD2 also plays a role in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling by interacting with proteins such as Syk and PLCγ2, enhancing their assembly in membrane rafts and promoting calcium flux (Kroczek2010Swiprosin1EFhd2).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, EFHD2 interacts with tau proteins, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. It co-aggregates with tau, influencing tau's liquid-liquid phase separation and promoting the formation of solid-like structures in a calcium-dependent manner (Soliman2024EFhd2; Vega2019EFhd2). The coiled-coil domain of EFHD2 is essential for these interactions, facilitating the modulation of tau's phase behavior and aggregation (Soliman2024EFhd2; Vega2019EFhd2). These interactions suggest that EFHD2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of tau-related neurodegenerative diseases by affecting tau aggregation dynamics (Soliman2024EFhd2).
