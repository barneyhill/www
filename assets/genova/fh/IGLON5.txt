# IGLON5

## Overview
IGLON5 is a gene that encodes the IgLON family member 5 protein, a neuronal cell adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its three Ig-like C2 domains and is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, a feature common among IgLON family members (Kubick2018Molecular; Ranaivoson2019A). IgLON5 plays a crucial role in neuronal development and synaptic function by mediating cell-cell interactions, contributing to processes such as neuronal outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and cytoskeletal organization (Salluzzo2024MicroRNAs; Landa2023Patients’). The protein can form both homo- and heterodimers, facilitating interactions across cells or synaptic clefts (Ranaivoson2019A). Clinically, the presence of autoantibodies against IgLON5 is associated with anti-IgLON5 disease, a rare neurological disorder characterized by sleep disturbances, movement disorders, and cognitive decline, linked to both autoimmune processes and tauopathy (Honorat2017IgLON5; Gaig2017Clinical).

## Structure
IGLON5 is a member of the IgLON family, characterized by its structure comprising three Ig-like C2 domains. These domains are involved in mediating cellular interactions, particularly in neuronal development (Kubick2018Molecular). The protein is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is a common feature among IgLON family members (Ranaivoson2019A). 

The crystal structure of the NEGR1/IgLON5 complex was determined at a resolution of 3.3 Å, revealing that IgLON5 has an unpaired cysteine at position 45, similar to Cys83 in NTRI, which does not participate in disulfide bonding (Ranaivoson2019A). The IgLON5 homodimer structure was solved with R work and R free values of 26.02% and 30.78%, respectively, indicating a reliable structural model (Ranaivoson2019A). 

IgLON5 can form both homo- and heterodimers, with the Ig1 domain being crucial for these interactions. The Ig1-Ig1 dimeric association is preserved across the family, allowing interactions across cells or synaptic clefts (Ranaivoson2019A). The protein also contains several putative N-linked glycosylation sites, with three conserved across all IgLON family members, which may influence its stability and function (Ranaivoson2019A).

## Function
The IGLON5 protein is a member of the IgLON family, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It plays a significant role in neuronal development and synaptic function by mediating cell-cell interactions. IGLON5 is involved in processes such as neuronal outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and cytoskeletal organization, contributing to neuronal connectivity and communication (Salluzzo2024MicroRNAs; Landa2023Patients’).

In healthy cells, IGLON5 interacts with other IgLON family members and specific membrane proteins, suggesting its involvement in cytoskeletal organization and neuronal development. It undergoes ectodomain shedding, a process where the protein is cleaved from the cell membrane, which is implicated in neurobiological mechanisms such as neuronal plasticity and cell migration (Landa2023Patients’). The soluble form of IGLON5 can establish intercellular interactions, potentially forming heterodimers with other IgLONs, indicating a role in intercellular communication or signaling (Landa2023Patients’).

IGLON5 is also expressed in muscle cells, where it is crucial for myotube formation and maturation during differentiation. It regulates the expression of myogenic genes and is involved in cell adhesion, affecting the structural development of myotubes (Lim2021IgLON5).

## Clinical Significance
Anti-IgLON5 disease is a rare neurological disorder associated with antibodies against the IgLON5 protein, a neuronal cell adhesion molecule. This condition is characterized by a combination of sleep disturbances, movement disorders, bulbar dysfunction, and cognitive decline (Gaig2021Frequency; Gaig2017Clinical). The presence of IgLON5 antibodies is a key diagnostic marker, and the disease shows a strong association with certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, specifically HLA-DRB1*10:01 and HLA-DQB1*05:01 (Pierro2024Further; Gaig2017Clinical).

The disease often presents with sleep-related symptoms such as parasomnias and sleep apnea, alongside neurological symptoms like gait abnormalities and cognitive issues (Gaig2017Clinical). Neuropathological findings include tauopathy, with neuronal loss and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, suggesting a novel tauopathy (Madetko2022AntiIgLON5; Honorat2017IgLON5). The pathogenesis of anti-IgLON5 disease involves both autoimmune processes and tauopathy, with subcortical deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau observed in various brain regions (Pierro2024Further).

Immunotherapy has shown limited success, but some patients have responded well to treatments such as glucocorticoid monotherapy, indicating variability in disease outcomes (Pierro2024Further; Honorat2017IgLON5). The disease's progression may involve neurodegeneration and tau deposition, which can affect the response to immunotherapy (Pierro2024Further).

## Interactions
IGLON5, a member of the IgLON family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in the nervous system. It predominantly forms homomeric and heteromeric interactions with other IgLON family members, such as IgLON1, IgLON2, IgLON3, and IgLON4, through its immunoglobulin-like domains. These interactions occur both within the same cell (cis-interactions) and between different cells (trans-interactions) (Landa2023Patients’; Ranaivoson2019A). 

IGLON5 also interacts with proteins like IGSF21, CACNA2D2, and KIDINS220, which were identified as bona-fide interactors through mass spectrometry (Landa2023Patients’). The interactions of IGLON5 are mediated by its first Ig domain, which is necessary and sufficient for binding, as demonstrated by biolayer interferometry studies (Ranaivoson2019A). 

The presence of autoantibodies against IGLON5 can disrupt these interactions, particularly affecting the cytoskeletal organization in neurons, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of anti-IgLON5 disease (Landa2023Patients’). IGLON5 undergoes ectodomain shedding, a process that may play a role in neuronal plasticity and other neurobiological mechanisms (Landa2023Patients’).
