# MINAR2

## Overview
MINAR2 is a gene that encodes the protein membrane integral NOTCH2 associated receptor 2, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of cholesterol distribution within sensory hair cells of the inner ear. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, particularly within the hair bundles, which is essential for normal auditory function. The protein is primarily localized to lysosomes and facilitates the transport of cholesterol to the apical regions of hair cells, impacting mechanotransduction processes necessary for hearing (Gao2022Kiaa1024LMinar2). Mutations in the MINAR2 gene have been linked to hearing loss in both humans and animal models, underscoring its critical role in auditory physiology (Ingham2019Mouse; Gao2022Kiaa1024LMinar2).

## Function
The MINAR2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol distribution within hair cells, which is essential for normal hearing function. In healthy cells, MINAR2 is involved in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, particularly in the hair bundles of sensory hair cells. This regulation is vital for the structural integrity and function of these cells, as cholesterol is highly enriched in the hair bundle membrane (Gao2022Kiaa1024LMinar2). The protein is primarily localized to lysosomes and is involved in recruiting cholesterol to these organelles, which is evidenced by increased cholesterol labeling in cultured cells expressing MINAR2 (Gao2022Kiaa1024LMinar2).

MINAR2 interacts with cholesterol through conserved motifs similar to the caveolin scaffolding domain, facilitating the transport of cholesterol to the apical regions of hair cells (Gao2022Kiaa1024LMinar2). This interaction is crucial for proper hair bundle morphogenesis and function, impacting mechanotransduction processes necessary for hearing (Gao2022Kiaa1024LMinar2). The protein's activity in these cellular compartments underscores its importance in maintaining the physiological processes required for auditory function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MINAR2 gene are associated with hearing loss in both humans and animal models. In zebrafish, mutations in MINAR2 lead to a progressive reduction in hair cell numbers, resulting in hearing impairment (Gao2022Kiaa1024LMinar2). In mice, MINAR2 knockout results in profound deafness and degeneration of hair cells, highlighting its critical role in auditory function (Gao2022Kiaa1024LMinar2). The gene is essential for regulating cholesterol distribution in hair bundles of the inner ear, and its dysfunction can lead to defects in mechanotransduction, altered hair bundle morphology, and enlarged apical lysosomes (Gao2022Kiaa1024LMinar2).

In humans, mutations in the MINAR2 gene have been reported to cause deafness, suggesting that alterations in its expression or function can lead to hearing loss (Gao2022Kiaa1024LMinar2). The study by Ingham et al. identified MINAR2 as one of the genes associated with raised auditory thresholds in mice, indicating its involvement in hearing loss (Ingham2019Mouse). These findings underscore the importance of MINAR2 in maintaining normal auditory function and suggest that its mutations or altered expression can contribute to hearing-related conditions.
