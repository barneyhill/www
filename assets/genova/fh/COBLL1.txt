# COBLL1

## Overview
COBLL1, or cordon-bleu WH2 repeat protein like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell morphology and motility. The protein, categorized as an actin-binding protein, contains a WH2 domain that facilitates its interaction with actin monomers, playing a significant role in actin filament formation and cellular dynamics (Takayama2018COBLL1; Izadi2017Cobllike). COBLL1 is expressed in various isoforms and undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its functional interactions, particularly in the context of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer (Takayama2018COBLL1). Beyond its structural role, COBLL1 is implicated in several clinical conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, due to its involvement in metabolic pathways and genetic associations with metabolic traits (Kwak2023Gene–Nutrient; Sun2022Metabolic).

## Structure
COBLL1 (cordon-bleu WH2 repeat protein like 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton organization. It contains a WH2 domain, which is crucial for binding actin monomers and is involved in actin filament formation (Takayama2018COBLL1; Izadi2017Cobllike). The WH2 domain is a conserved motif that facilitates the interaction with actin, and its presence is essential for COBLL1's function in regulating cell morphology and actin dynamics (Takayama2018COBLL1; Izadi2017Cobllike).

COBLL1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and functions, particularly in the context of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer (Takayama2018COBLL1). The protein is expressed in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect its functional properties and interactions with other proteins (Izadi2017Cobllike).

The structure of COBLL1 allows it to interact with other proteins, such as the androgen receptor and cyclin-dependent kinase 1, facilitating processes like AR phosphorylation and genomic binding in prostate cancer cells (Takayama2018COBLL1). These interactions are crucial for its role in cell morphology and cancer progression.

## Function
COBLL1 (cordon-bleu WH2 repeat protein like 1) is involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a crucial role in cell morphology and motility. The protein contains a WH2 domain, which is an actin monomer-binding motif, suggesting its involvement in actin regulation and cellular movement (Takayama2018COBLL1). In healthy human cells, COBLL1 is active in the cytoplasm and influences cell shape by interacting with actin filaments. This interaction is essential for processes such as cell migration and signaling pathways, which are critical for maintaining cellular and organismal functions (Izadi2017Cobllike).

COBLL1 is also implicated in morphogenetic processes, similar to its paralog COBL, which is known for influencing axonal and dendritic branching. The protein's role in actin filament formation and dendritic branching is facilitated through its interaction with the F-actin-binding protein Abp1, and this interaction is regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) signaling (Izadi2017Cobllike). This regulation is crucial for COBLL1's function in promoting actin filament formation and dendritic branching, highlighting its importance in neuronal morphogenesis and cellular architecture (Izadi2017Cobllike).

## Clinical Significance
The COBLL1 gene is clinically significant due to its association with various metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. Alterations in COBLL1 expression or genetic variants, such as the rs6717858 variant, have been linked to obesity-related traits, including body mass index (BMI), central obesity, and waist circumference. These effects are particularly pronounced in women, where the gene influences plasma leptin levels and adipose tissue function, contributing to increased lipid storage and obesity risk (Kwak2023Gene–Nutrient).

In prostate cancer, COBLL1 is involved in androgen receptor (AR) signaling, promoting AR phosphorylation and activation, which are crucial for cancer progression. High COBLL1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and increased tumor growth in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (Takayama2018COBLL1).

COBLL1 is also implicated in type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Variants at the GRB14/COBLL1 locus are associated with fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, and leptin levels, indicating a role in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. These genetic associations suggest COBLL1's involvement in insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders (Sun2022Metabolic).

## Interactions
COBLL1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and morphology. In prostate cancer, COBLL1 is involved in modulating androgen receptor (AR) signaling. It enhances AR phosphorylation at Ser81, a modification facilitated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). This interaction is crucial for AR protein stability and nuclear localization. COBLL1 interacts with CDK1 in the nucleus, and this interaction is necessary for AR phosphorylation and activity. The actin-binding WH2 domain of COBLL1 is important for its interaction with AR, and actin knockdown inhibits this association. CDK1 knockdown also disrupts the COBLL1-AR interaction, suggesting that both CDK1 and actin are involved in forming the COBLL1/AR complex (Takayama2018COBLL1).

In the context of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, COBLL1 expression is repressed by the viral protein EBNA3C. EBNA3C interacts with the histone lysine demethylase KDM2B to facilitate the demethylation of H3K4me3, a mark associated with active transcription, thereby repressing COBLL1. This interaction is crucial for the rapid loss of H3K4me3 and subsequent gene repression. EBNA3C recruits polycomb repressive complexes (PRC1 and PRC2) to the COBLL1 locus, leading to gene silencing (Gillman2018EpsteinBarr).
