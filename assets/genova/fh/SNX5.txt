# SNX5

## Overview
Sorting nexin 5 (SNX5) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking and membrane remodeling. The protein, also named sorting nexin 5, is characterized by the presence of a Phox homology (PX) domain and a BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain, which are crucial for its role in endosomal sorting and membrane curvature sensing, respectively. SNX5 is part of the sorting nexin family, which is known for its involvement in endosomal transport processes. The protein plays a significant role in the recycling of transmembrane proteins, such as the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and is involved in macropinocytosis and retrograde trafficking. SNX5's interactions with other proteins, including SNX1 and bacterial effectors, underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Teasdale2011Insights; Simonetti2019Molecular; Itai2018The).

## Structure
Sorting nexin 5 (SNX5) is characterized by its Phox homology (PX) domain, which is crucial for binding phosphoinositides and associating with membranes. The PX domain of SNX5 is unique due to a large conserved insertion following the polyproline loop, forming an extended helix-turn-helix structure. This insertion may influence the protein's interaction with membranes (Teasdale2011Insights). The PX domain is involved in binding phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), a lipid marker found in endosomal membranes, although it lacks a clear binding pocket for PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Teasdale2011Insights).

SNX5 also contains a BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain, which contributes to membrane curvature sensing and tubulation. The BAR domain is involved in various cellular functions, including trafficking and signaling, and its phosphorylation at serine 226 (S226) regulates retrograde transport and macropinocytosis (Itai2018The).

SNX5 can form complexes with other proteins, such as SNX1 and SNX2, indicating potential quaternary structures. The interaction between SNX5 and the bacterial effector protein IncE is mediated by a unique helical hairpin in the PX domain, which is essential for binding (Sun2017Structural). This interaction is crucial for the cellular localization of IncE and its inhibitory function on retromer-mediated transport (Sun2017Structural).

## Function
Sorting nexin 5 (SNX5) is a protein involved in various intracellular trafficking processes, particularly in endosomal sorting and membrane remodeling. In healthy human cells, SNX5 plays a crucial role in the endosomal recycling of transmembrane proteins, such as the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), by preventing their degradation in lysosomes. It recognizes a specific β-hairpin structure in the cytosolic tails of cargo proteins, which is essential for their recycling back to the plasma membrane (Simonetti2019Molecular).

SNX5 is also involved in macropinocytosis, a form of endocytosis, where it regulates the formation of macropinosomes. Overexpression of SNX5 significantly increases macropinosome formation, indicating its role as a regulator in this process (Wang2010The). SNX5 interacts with other proteins, such as SNX1, to form heterodimers that are crucial for its function in endosomal sorting and trafficking (Simonetti2019Molecular).

Additionally, SNX5 is involved in the retrograde trafficking of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, a process regulated by its phosphorylation state (Itai2018The). These functions highlight SNX5's essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
SNX5 (sorting nexin 5) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular processes such as endosomal sorting and trafficking. In cancer, SNX5 is highly expressed in several types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it promotes cancer progression by activating the EGFR-ERK1/2 pathway and inhibiting EGFR endocytosis and degradation (Yang2020Sorting). In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a circular RNA derived from SNX5, known as circSNX5, is upregulated and associated with poor survival rates. CircSNX5 acts as a miRNA sponge, promoting oncogenesis by regulating ADAM10 expression and contributing to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Chen2024Noncanonical).

In Parkinson's disease, SNX5 knockdown has shown protective effects against alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity. SNX5 is involved in the trafficking of alpha-synuclein, and its knockdown prevents the fragmentation of the trans-Golgi network, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for neuroprotective strategies (Höllerhage2024A). These findings highlight SNX5's significant role in disease progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Sorting Nexin 5 (SNX5) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. SNX5 interacts with SNX1 to form heterodimers, which are important for its role in macropinocytosis. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of SNX5 to maturing macropinosomes, where it promotes tubulation (Lim2008A).

SNX5 also interacts with the bacterial effector protein IncE from Chlamydia trachomatis. This interaction occurs through the PX domain of SNX5, where IncE binds to a hydrophobic groove, forming an anti-parallel β-sheet. This binding is specific and involves key hydrophobic interactions, which are critical for the function of IncE in inhibiting retromer-mediated transport (Sun2017Structural).

In the context of antiviral signaling, SNX5 interacts with the RIG-I/VISA signalosome. It acts as a negative regulator by inhibiting the activation of key transcription factors and antiviral gene expression. SNX5 enhances K48-linked polyubiquitination and reduces K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, affecting its stability and function (Li2020SNX5).

SNX5 also interacts with VPS13A, a lipid transfer protein, through its VAB domain. This interaction is involved in mediating associations with endosomes and mitochondria, potentially impacting endosome-Golgi retrograde transport (TorneroÉcija2023The).
