# ELMOD2

## Overview
ELMOD2 is a gene that encodes the ELMO domain-containing 2 protein, which functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) involved in various cellular processes. The ELMOD2 protein plays a critical role in centrosomal microtubule nucleation, cytokinesis, and mitochondrial fusion. It interacts with ARF family GTPases, including ARF6 and ARL2, to regulate microtubule dynamics and cell division. ELMOD2's involvement in these processes is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and function, and its dysregulation has been linked to diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cancer (Turn2020The; Schiavon2019ELMOD2; Ivanova2014Characterization).

## Function
The ELMOD2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and is involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ELMOD2 plays a significant role in centrosomal microtubule nucleation and cytokinesis. It is implicated in the recruitment of γ-tubulin to the pericentriolar material, which is essential for microtubule nucleation at centrosomes. ELMOD2 interacts with ARL2 and TBCD, proteins involved in γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) anchoring, and its absence affects their recruitment to centrosomes, especially under stress conditions (Turn2020The).

ELMOD2 also regulates cytokinesis through the ARF6/FIP3/Rab11 pathway. Its deletion results in defects in ARF6 recruitment to midbodies, leading to delayed or failed cytokinesis. ELMOD2 may facilitate ARF6 dissociation at recycling endosomes and its recruitment to midbodies, acting as an ARF6 GAP to favor RAB11 binding to FIP3 (Turn2020The).

In addition to its role in cell division, ELMOD2 is involved in mitochondrial fusion, acting downstream of ARL2 in a mitofusin-dependent manner. It helps maintain mitochondrial morphology, and its absence leads to increased mitochondrial fragmentation (Schiavon2019ELMOD2).

## Clinical Significance
ELMOD2 has been implicated in several human diseases due to its role in various cellular processes. Alterations in ELMOD2 expression or function have been associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a condition characterized by progressive lung scarring. ELMOD2 is considered a candidate susceptibility gene for IPF, although the precise mechanisms linking it to the disease remain unclear. The gene's involvement in lipid droplet localization and its potential impact on the antiviral protein viperin may be relevant to IPF pathogenesis (Suzuki2015ELMOD2).

ELMOD2 also plays a role in cell division and microtubule organization. Its absence can lead to defects such as multinucleation, polyploidy, and supernumerary centrosomes, which are associated with cell division abnormalities. These defects suggest a potential link to cancer, as they are characteristic of transformed or cancerous cells (Turn2020The).

Additionally, ELMOD2 is involved in mitochondrial fusion, and its loss results in mitochondrial fragmentation, similar to the effects seen with the loss of mitofusin proteins. This disruption in mitochondrial dynamics could contribute to conditions where mitochondrial function is compromised (Schiavon2019ELMOD2).

## Interactions
ELMOD2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as cytokinesis and microtubule dynamics. It functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for ARF family GTPases, including ARF6 and ARL2. ELMOD2 is involved in the regulation of centrosomal microtubule nucleation and cytokinesis by interacting with ARL2, which is essential for the recruitment of γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to centrosomes, thereby affecting microtubule stability (Turn2020The).

ELMOD2 also interacts with ARF6 at recycling endosomes, where it influences the recruitment of proteins such as FIP3 and RAB11. The absence of ELMOD2 leads to increased ARF6 and decreased RAB11 recruitment to FIP3-GFP positive endosomes, suggesting a competitive binding model (Turn2020The). The GAP activity of ELMOD2 is crucial for these interactions, as demonstrated by the inability of a GAP-dead mutant to reverse defects in cytokinesis and centrosome amplification (Turn2020The).

Additionally, ELMOD2 binds to the non-opioid sigma-1 receptor (S1R), which inhibits its GAP activity against ARL2, indicating a regulatory interaction that affects its function in cell signaling (Ivanova2014Characterization).
