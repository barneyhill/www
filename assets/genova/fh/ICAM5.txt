# ICAM5

## Overview
ICAM5, also known as the intercellular adhesion molecule 5, is a gene that encodes the protein telencephalin, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein. This protein is predominantly expressed in the telencephalon region of the brain and is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) (Yang2012Structure; Recacha2014Crystal). Telencephalin plays a crucial role in neuronal development, particularly in dendritic spine formation and synaptic plasticity, by facilitating homophilic adhesion and interactions with the actin cytoskeleton (Paetau2017Neuronal; Tian2007Activation). Additionally, ICAM-5 is involved in modulating immune responses within the central nervous system by interacting with leukocyte integrins, thereby influencing leukocyte-neuron interactions (Paetau2017Neuronal; Yang2012Structure). The protein's involvement in both neuronal and immune functions underscores its significance in maintaining brain homeostasis and its potential implications in various neurological disorders (Lindsberg2002Release).

## Structure
The ICAM-5 protein, also known as telencephalin, is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 130 kDa, comprising a 107 kDa polypeptide. It is characterized by a large extracellular region, a single transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular region consists of nine tandemly arranged immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, which are part of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) (Yang2012Structure; Recacha2014Crystal). These domains contribute to the protein's role in cell adhesion and interactions within the immune and nervous systems.

The primary structure of ICAM-5 includes a signal peptide, nine extracellular Ig-like domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular region is composed of 805 amino acids, with 15 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which are conserved across species (Yang2012Structure). The cytoplasmic region is 64 residues long (Yang2012Structure).

The tertiary structure of ICAM-5 reveals a curved molecule with pronounced bends between domains D2-D3 and D3-D4, facilitating homotypic interactions. The protein forms trans/trans zipper adhesive structures, with antiparallel orientations in the crystal lattice (Recacha2014Crystal). The D1-D5 fragment mediates these interactions, with D1 and D4 playing critical roles (Recacha2014Crystal). The protein's unique charge distribution, with basic D1-D2 and acidic D3-D5, supports electrostatic-based homophilic adhesions (Recacha2014Crystal).

## Function
ICAM-5, also known as telencephalin, is a neuronal adhesion molecule primarily expressed in the telencephalon region of the brain. It plays a significant role in dendritic spine development and synaptic plasticity. ICAM-5 is involved in the regulation of dendritic elongation and spine maturation, processes crucial for synaptic connections and neuronal communication (Tian2007Activation; Yang2012Structure). 

The protein facilitates dendritic outgrowth and arborization through homophilic adhesion, binding to itself to promote these processes (Tian2000Intercellular). ICAM-5 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, and its cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) upon NMDA receptor activation is essential for dendritic spine remodeling and maturation (Paetau2017Neuronal; Tian2007Activation). 

ICAM-5 also plays a role in immune response modulation within the central nervous system. It binds to leukocyte integrins, influencing leukocyte-neuron interactions and potentially regulating microglial functions (Paetau2017Neuronal; Yang2012Structure). In pathological conditions, soluble ICAM-5 can modulate immune responses, suggesting a protective role in maintaining brain homeostasis (Lindsberg2002Release).

## Clinical Significance
ICAM5, also known as telencephalin, plays a significant role in various neurological conditions due to its involvement in immune responses and neuronal interactions. Alterations in ICAM5 expression or its interactions have been linked to several diseases. In HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), elevated levels of soluble ICAM5 (sICAM5) in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma correlate with neurocognitive impairment, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for HAND (Yuan2017Intercellular). In the context of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury, ICAM5 appears in serum shortly after injury, indicating its potential as a marker for neuronal damage (Guo2000Release).

ICAM5 is also implicated in acute encephalitis, where increased sICAM5 levels in cerebrospinal fluid are associated with immune response regulation during microbial neuroinvasion (Lindsberg2002Release). In herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infections, ICAM5 modulates cytokine and chemokine production in the central nervous system, influencing the severity of herpes simplex encephalitis (Tse2009ICAM5). Additionally, ICAM5 serves as a functional entry receptor for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), which is linked to respiratory illnesses and neurological disorders such as acute flaccid myelitis (Wei2016ICAM5Telencephalin). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ICAM5 in various neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
ICAM-5, also known as telencephalin, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the immune and nervous systems. It binds to the leukocyte integrin CD11a/CD18, also known as LFA-1, through its first immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, which is crucial for this interaction. This binding supports T cell adhesion to neurons, specifically in the somatodendritic regions, and can be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies targeting the first domain of ICAM-5 or CD11a/CD18 (Tian2000Binding; Yang2012Structure).

ICAM-5 also interacts with ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family proteins, which link membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is important for the formation of dendritic filopodia, which are precursors to dendritic spines, playing a role in synaptogenesis and neural circuit formation (Furutani2007Interaction; Yang2012Structure).

Additionally, ICAM-5 can engage in homophilic binding, where it binds to itself through interactions between its NH2-terminal domain 1 and domains 4-5. This homophilic adhesion promotes dendritic outgrowth and arborization in hippocampal neurons (Tian2000Intercellular). ICAM-5's interactions with integrins and ERM proteins highlight its role in both immune responses and neuronal development.
