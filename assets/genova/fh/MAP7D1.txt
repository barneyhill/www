# MAP7D1

## Overview
MAP7D1 (MAP7 domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a microtubule-associated protein involved in the stabilization and organization of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular processes, including neuronal development and intracellular transport. The MAP7D1 protein is particularly significant in the context of neural development, where it plays a critical role in axon elongation and the maintenance of stable microtubules. It acts as a substrate for the serine/threonine protein kinase DCLK1, which phosphorylates MAP7D1 at specific sites, facilitating its function in promoting axon growth. The expression of MAP7D1 is notably observed in the developing brain, especially within the cortical plate, where it is associated with growing axons. Beyond its role in the nervous system, genetic variations in MAP7D1 have been implicated in clinical conditions such as cardiomyopathy and heart failure, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Patel2023Genomic; Koizumi2016DCLK1).

## Function
MAP7D1 (MAP7 domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in microtubule stabilization and organization, playing a crucial role in neuronal development and function. The MAP7D1 protein is a substrate for the kinase activity of DCLK1, which phosphorylates it at several sites, including serine 315, a major phosphorylation site. This phosphorylation is essential for axon elongation in cortical neurons, indicating that MAP7D1 functions downstream of DCLK1 in promoting axon growth (Koizumi2016DCLK1).

MAP7D1 is expressed in the developing mouse brain, particularly in the cortical plate, and is associated with microtubules, similar to other members of the MAP7 family. It is predominantly localized to growing axons, where it is required for callosal axon elongation (Koizumi2016DCLK1). In addition to its role in axon elongation, MAP7D1 is crucial for maintaining acetylated, stable microtubules, which are important for cell motility and neurite outgrowth. Knockdown of MAP7D1 reduces the level of acetylated tubulin, a marker of stable microtubules, suggesting its specific involvement in the maintenance of microtubule stability (Kikuchi2021Map7D2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAP7D1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly in the context of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. A study by Li et al. identified the MAP7D1 gene as a significant factor in the susceptibility to doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (DIC) and heart failure (HF). Genetic variations in MAP7D1, specifically two rare variants, were associated with a significant decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and an increased risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients undergoing doxorubicin chemotherapy. These findings suggest that genetic screening for MAP7D1 variants could help identify patients at higher risk of cardiomyopathy and HF following doxorubicin treatment (Patel2023Genomic).

In neuronal cells, MAP7D1 plays a role in microtubule stabilization, and its disruption can affect cellular processes such as cell motility and neurite outgrowth. Alterations in MAP7D1 expression could potentially link to diseases involving these processes, although specific diseases were not directly addressed in the studies (Kikuchi2021Map7D2). Additionally, MAP7D1 is involved in axon elongation in cortical neurons, and its phosphorylation by DCLK1 is crucial for this process, indicating its importance in neural development (Koizumi2016DCLK1).

## Interactions
MAP7D1 is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a role in microtubule stabilization and intracellular transport. It is known to interact with other proteins involved in these processes. One significant interaction is with DCLK1 (Doublecortin-like kinase 1), a serine/threonine protein kinase. DCLK1 phosphorylates MAP7D1, specifically at serine 315, which is crucial for promoting axon elongation in cortical neurons. This phosphorylation event is essential for MAP7D1's function in neural development, particularly in axon growth (Koizumi2016DCLK1).

MAP7D1 is also involved in maintaining acetylated, stable microtubules, which is critical for microtubule dynamics in neuronal cells. Knockdown of MAP7D1 has been shown to reduce acetylated tubulin levels, indicating its role in microtubule stabilization (Kikuchi2021Map7D2). While specific protein interactions involving MAP7D1 are not detailed in some studies, its role in microtubule dynamics suggests potential interactions with tubulin deacetylases like HDAC6 and Sirt2, which may regulate acetylated tubulin levels (Kikuchi2021Map7D2).
