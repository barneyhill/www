# MYOZ1

## Overview
MYOZ1 is a gene that encodes the protein myozenin 1, also known as calsarcin-2, which is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues. Myozenin 1 is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a critical role in the structural organization and functional regulation of the sarcomere, the basic contractile unit of muscle fibers. It is localized to the Z-disc, where it interacts with various proteins such as α-actinin, filamin, telethonin, and calcineurin, contributing to muscle integrity and function (Clark2002Striated; Arola2007Mutations). The protein is involved in key processes such as muscle differentiation, fiber type specification, and signal transduction, particularly through its modulation of calcineurin activity, which is essential for hypertrophic responses and muscle fiber type differentiation (Zhou2022MYOZ1; Martin2015Genetic). Genetic variations in MYOZ1 have been linked to cardiac conditions such as atrial fibrillation, highlighting its clinical significance in muscle-related diseases (Martin2015Genetic; Lin2014Gene).

## Function
MYOZ1, or myozenin 1, encodes a protein primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues, where it plays a crucial role in the organization and stabilization of the sarcomere, the fundamental contractile unit of muscle fibers. The protein is localized to the Z-disc, a key structural component of the sarcomere, and interacts with several other proteins, including α-actinin, filamin, telethonin, and calcineurin, to maintain muscle integrity and function (Clark2002Striated; Arola2007Mutations).

In cardiac muscle, MYOZ1 is involved in tethering calcineurin to α-actinin at the Z-disc, which is essential for signal transduction and muscle function (Martin2015Genetic). This interaction is significant for the regulation of calcineurin activity, which is crucial for initiating hypertrophic responses in muscle tissue (Clark2002Striated). MYOZ1's expression is modulated by genetic variants associated with atrial fibrillation, suggesting its role in cardiac health and disease (Lin2014Gene).

In skeletal muscle, MYOZ1 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of the Z-line, contributing to myofibrillogenesis and muscle fiber differentiation. It is also implicated in muscle cell proliferation and differentiation, as evidenced by its interaction with miR-432, which regulates these processes (Ren2016Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
MYOZ1, also known as myozenin 1, has been implicated in various cardiac and muscle-related conditions due to its role in muscle structure and function. Alterations in MYOZ1 expression have been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). Genetic studies have shown that certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to AF are associated with decreased expression of MYOZ1 in atrial tissue, suggesting that reduced MYOZ1 expression may contribute to AF pathogenesis (Martin2015Genetic).

In the context of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), MYOZ1 has been considered a candidate gene. However, studies have not found significant mutations in MYOZ1 among DCM patients, indicating that MYOZ1 mutations may not play a major role in the genetic etiology of this condition (Arola2007Mutations).

MYOZ1 is also involved in muscle differentiation and sarcomere architecture. The protein is regulated by the E3 ligase FBXL21, which mediates its ubiquitination and degradation. Disruption in this regulatory pathway, such as FBXL21 deficiency, leads to MYOZ1 accumulation, impaired NFAT signaling, and altered muscle differentiation, potentially affecting muscle function (Lim2022The).

## Interactions
MYOZ1, also known as myozenin 1 or calsarcin-2, is a protein that plays a significant role in muscle structure and function by interacting with various proteins at the Z-disc of muscle fibers. It binds to α-actinin-2/-3, myotilin, and filamin-C, forming a complex that stabilizes MYOZ1 proteins at the Z-disc (Lim2022The). MYOZ1 also interacts with telethonin and calcineurin, suggesting its involvement in the assembly and stabilization of the Z line and myofibrillogenesis (Arola2007Mutations). 

MYOZ1 is known to inhibit calcineurin/NFAT signaling, which is crucial for muscle differentiation. This interaction affects the conversion of fast-twitch to slow-twitch muscle fibers by modulating calcineurin activity (Zhou2022MYOZ1). The protein's interaction with calcineurin is significant for muscle fiber type differentiation and muscle quality traits (Zhou2022MYOZ1).

Additionally, MYOZ1 is a target for ubiquitination-mediated degradation by the E3 ligase FBXL21, which regulates its stability and turnover, impacting myoblast differentiation and sarcomere architecture (Lim2022The). This degradation process is modulated by GSK-3β, which phosphorylates MYOZ1, promoting its degradation in an FBXL21-dependent manner (Lim2022The).
