# MXRA8

## Overview
MXRA8, or matrix remodeling associated 8, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, matrix remodeling, and signaling. The protein, characterized by immunoglobulin-like domains, plays a significant role in mediating interactions with cellular components and facilitating viral entry, particularly for arthritogenic alphaviruses such as the chikungunya virus. MXRA8 is expressed in several cell types, including epithelial, bone marrow, and mesenchymal cells, and is notably involved in modulating integrin signaling and cell-cell interactions. It is also implicated in the regulation of adipose tissue physiology and metabolic processes, influencing conditions such as obesity. Clinically, MXRA8 has been associated with cancer progression and metastasis, particularly in colorectal and breast cancers, and is considered a potential target for therapeutic interventions in both cancer and viral infections (Jia2024MXRA8; Belder2024Prognostic; Simpson2023Loss).

## Structure
MXRA8 encodes a protein that is involved in cell adhesion and matrix remodeling. The protein structure includes immunoglobulin-like domains, which are characteristic of many cell surface proteins. These domains are crucial for the protein's role in mediating interactions with other cellular components and facilitating viral entry, particularly for alphaviruses. The presence of these domains suggests a complex tertiary structure that allows MXRA8 to participate in diverse biological processes.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are likely to occur in MXRA8, which can influence its stability, localization, and function. Glycosylation is a common modification for proteins with extracellular roles, enhancing their ability to interact with other molecules and cells. The specific sites and types of glycosylation on MXRA8, however, are not detailed in the available information.

While the primary sequence and specific secondary structures of MXRA8 are not explicitly described, the presence of immunoglobulin-like domains implies a folded structure that supports its functional roles. Information on splice variant isoforms of MXRA8 is not provided, indicating that further research may be needed to fully elucidate the diversity of its structural forms.

## Function
The MXRA8 gene encodes a type I transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily related to cell adhesion and signaling. In healthy human cells, MXRA8 is expressed in adhesion molecules found in epithelial, bone marrow, and mesenchymal cells, where it plays a role in modulating integrin signaling and cell-cell interactions (Belder2024Prognostic). This protein interacts with integrin αVβ3, influencing cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix, which are crucial for maintaining tissue structure and function (Simpson2023Loss).

MXRA8 is also highly expressed in white adipose tissue (WAT), particularly in adipocyte progenitor cells and mature adipocytes. It is involved in the regulation of adipose tissue physiology, including the differentiation of osteoclasts and chondrocytes, and is implicated in the whitening of beige and brown adipose tissues, contributing to obesity pathogenesis (Jia2024MXRA8). In MXRA8 mutant mice, increased expression of Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) suggests a role in thermogenesis and energy expenditure, indicating that MXRA8 may influence metabolic processes and obesity (Jia2024MXRA8). The exact mechanisms by which MXRA8 influences these processes in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
MXRA8 (matrix remodeling associated 8) has been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), breast cancer, and others. In CRC, high MXRA8 expression is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. It is linked to cancer hallmark pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, and angiogenesis, which are crucial for tumor progression (Tan2023MXRA8; Belder2024Prognostic). MXRA8 expression is also correlated with immune checkpoint molecule expression and is negatively associated with microsatellite instability, suggesting its role in immune evasion (Tan2023MXRA8).

In breast cancer, particularly aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MXRA8 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Loss of MXRA8 expression in TNBC cells has been shown to delay tumor development and reduce metastasis, indicating its role in tumor progression (Simpson2023Loss).

MXRA8 is also known as a receptor for arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as the chikungunya virus, which highlights its role in viral entry and potential implications in viral infections (Belder2024Prognostic). These findings suggest that MXRA8 could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and viral diseases.

## Interactions
MXRA8 is known to interact with several proteins and participate in various biological processes. It acts as a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Mayaro virus (MAYV), O'nyong'nyong virus (ONNV), and Ross River virus (RRV). This interaction facilitates viral entry into host cells by binding to the viral E2 and E1 proteins, as confirmed by structural studies using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (Holmes2020A; Kim2022A). The binding of MXRA8 to these viral proteins can be inhibited by anti-MXRA8 monoclonal antibodies or soluble MXRA8-Fc decoy molecules, highlighting its role in viral pathogenesis (Kim2022A).

In addition to its role in viral infections, MXRA8 is involved in cell adhesion and matrix remodeling. It interacts with integrin β3, a cell-surface receptor that plays a role in extracellular matrix interactions and intracellular signaling pathways, such as RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT, which are implicated in cancer metastasis (Simpson2023Loss). These interactions suggest that MXRA8 may influence tumor progression by modulating the tumor microenvironment and cell-cell interactions (Simpson2023Loss).
