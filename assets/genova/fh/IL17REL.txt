# IL17REL

## Overview
The IL17REL gene encodes the interleukin 17 receptor E like (IL17REL) protein, which is a member of the IL17 receptor family. Unlike other members of this family, IL17REL is characterized as a soluble oligomeric receptor due to its lack of transmembrane regions, distinguishing it from typical membrane-bound receptors (Wu2011Evolution). The protein is involved in immune response modulation and shares structural homology with other IL17 receptors, including the presence of fibronectin domains that facilitate receptor oligomerization and ligand recognition (Wu2011Evolution). Despite lacking the SEFIR motif, which is crucial for intracellular signaling in other IL17 receptors, IL17REL maintains a conserved genomic organization across vertebrates, indicating its evolutionary importance (Wu2011Evolution). The gene's role in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and certain cancers, highlights its clinical relevance and potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2024Developing; Sasaki2016Wholeexome; Ge2023Identification).

## Structure
The IL17REL protein is a member of the IL17 receptor family, identified as a soluble oligomeric receptor due to the absence of transmembrane regions (Wu2011Evolution). It shares homology with the extracellular domains of IL17REs and contains at least one fibronectin (FN) domain, either FNI or FNIII, which are characteristic of class I and class II cytokine receptors. These domains are involved in receptor oligomerization and ligand recognition (Wu2011Evolution). The IL17REL protein lacks the SEFIR motif found in other IL17 receptors, which is typically involved in intracellular signaling (Wu2011Evolution).

The genomic organization of IL17REL is conserved across vertebrates, with a region composed of seven to eight exons, and the protein sequences for this region show relative conservation with ten conserved protein motifs identified (Wu2011Evolution). The dN/dS ratios for IL17RELs are much smaller than 1, indicating purifying selection and suggesting that their functional properties are highly conserved (Wu2011Evolution). Despite these insights, specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL17REL gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its subtypes, such as ulcerative colitis (UC). Whole-exome sequencing studies have identified rare variants in IL17REL that are associated with both familial and sporadic forms of IBD. These variants, such as rs200958270 and rs142430606, have been linked to an increased risk of UC, suggesting that IL17REL is a susceptibility locus for this condition (Sasaki2016Wholeexome). Genome-wide association studies have also identified IL17REL as a risk locus for UC, highlighting its potential involvement in the disease's genetic predisposition (Franke2010Genomewide).

In addition to IBD, IL17REL has been studied in the context of cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), IL17REL is identified as a new biomarker, with elevated expression levels in tumor tissues, indicating its role in immune regulation associated with the disease (Ge2023Identification). Conversely, in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), IL17REL expression is lower, correlating with poor prognosis. Overexpression of IL17REL in melanoma cells has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2024Developing). These findings underscore the gene's clinical significance across different conditions.
