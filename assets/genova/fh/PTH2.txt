# PTH2

## Overview
The PTH2 gene encodes the parathyroid hormone 2 (PTH2), also known as tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39), which is a neuropeptide involved in various neuroendocrine functions. PTH2 is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, where it plays a crucial role in modulating pain perception and other neuroendocrine processes (SuarezBregua2017PTH). The protein functions as an endogenous ligand for the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2R), a G-protein coupled receptor, and is involved in signaling pathways that regulate stress responses, hormone release, and cognitive functions (Dobolyi2012The). The interaction between PTH2 and PTH2R is characterized by its ability to preferentially increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, highlighting its role in cAMP-mediated signaling pathways (Dobolyi2010The).

## Function
The PTH2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the parathyroid hormone family, primarily binding to the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2R). This protein is involved in neuroendocrine signaling and plays a significant role in modulating pain perception. In mammals, PTH2 is expressed in the thalamic and hypothalamic regions of the brain, suggesting its involvement in regulating nociception, pain, and other hypothalamic hormones (SuarezBregua2017PTH). The PTH2 protein, also known as tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39), acts as an endogenous ligand for PTH2R, which is a G-protein coupled receptor primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in neuroendocrine centers such as the preoptic area and various nuclei in the hypothalamus (Dobolyi2012The).

The TIP39-PTH2R signaling system is implicated in several neuroendocrine functions, including modulating the stress response, affecting the release of pituitary hormones like arginine-vasopressin and growth hormone, and playing a role in thermoregulation and nociceptive information processing (Dobolyi2012The). This system is also involved in maternal adaptation, such as prolactin release during lactation, and may influence memory performance and cognitive functions (Dobolyi2012The).

## Interactions
Parathyroid hormone 2 (PTH2), also known as tuberoinfundibular peptide 39 (TIP39), is a peptide that interacts primarily with the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2R), a G protein-coupled receptor. This interaction is crucial for the activation of PTH2R, leading to the accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in cells expressing the receptor (Dobolyi2010The; Seitz2024Characterization). PTH2 shares sequence similarities with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHLH), but it exhibits distinct binding and activation profiles. The interaction selectivity of PTH2R is mediated by specific interactions between Tyr-318 of PTH2R and the 5th residues of these ligands (Seitz2024Characterization).

PTH2 is more effective in increasing cAMP levels compared to calcium levels, indicating a preference for cAMP-mediated signaling pathways (Dobolyi2010The). The N-terminal region of TIP39 is crucial for the activation of PTH2R, while the C-terminal region is important for high-affinity binding (Dobolyi2010The). These interactions highlight the specificity and functional importance of PTH2 in modulating physiological processes through its receptor, PTH2R.
