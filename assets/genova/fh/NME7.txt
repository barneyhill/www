# NME7

## Overview
The NME7 gene encodes the protein NME/NM23 family member 7, which is part of the NME/NM23 family involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, including an N-terminal DM10 domain and two nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) domains, although it lacks the residues necessary for kinase activity and instead exhibits exonuclease activity (Reish2016A; Desvignes2009Nme). NME7 plays a critical role in the biogenesis and function of motile cilia, essential for establishing left-right asymmetry during embryonic development and regulating the microtubule-organizing center (Šedová2021SemiLethal; Vogel2010Situs). It is also implicated in glucose regulation and metabolism, with genetic variability influencing glycemic responses (Vejražková2024The). Mutations in NME7 have been associated with clinical conditions such as situs inversus totalis and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in both developmental and metabolic pathways (Reish2016A; Šedová2021Heterozygous).

## Structure
The NME7 protein is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes specific domains and structural features. It contains an N-terminal DM10 domain and two nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) domains, known as NDPk_7A and NDPk_7B (Reish2016A; Desvignes2009Nme). The DM10 domain's function is not fully understood, but it may act as a regulatory module or be involved in axonemal targeting or assembly (Ćetković2014Nme). The NDPK domains in NME7 lack several residues necessary for enzymatic activity, rendering the protein kinase inactive, although it exhibits exonuclease activity (Reish2016A; Desvignes2009Nme).

A notable mutation in NME7 results in the skipping of exon 10, leading to an in-frame deletion of 34 amino acids. This deletion affects both splice variants of the protein, removing a central beta sheet and two alpha helices, which is predicted to unfold the NDK2 domain (Reish2016A). The 3D structure of NME7 has been modeled using the RaptorX Webserver, based on the structure of the Aquifex aeolicus nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Reish2016A). NME7 is ubiquitously expressed, with high levels in the brain and testis (Reish2016A).

## Function
The NME7 gene encodes a protein that is part of the NME/NM23 family, which is involved in various cellular processes. NME7 is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with particularly high expression in the brain and testis (Reish2016A). The protein contains an N-terminal DM10 domain and two nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) domains, although it lacks the residues necessary for kinase activity and instead exhibits exonuclease activity (Reish2016A). The DM10 domain may function as a regulatory module for flagellar NDPK or be involved in axonemal targeting or assembly (Reish2016A).

NME7 plays a crucial role in the biogenesis and function of motile cilia, which are essential for proper cellular and organismal functions, including the establishment of left-right asymmetry during embryonic development (Šedová2021SemiLethal; Vogel2010Situs). It is involved in the regulation of the microtubule-organizing center, particularly in the microtubule-nucleating activity of the γ-tubulin ring complex in centrosomes, which is vital for ciliogenesis and ciliary transport (Šedová2021SemiLethal). NME7 is also implicated in glucose regulation and metabolism, with genetic variability in the gene influencing the shape of glycemic curves during oral glucose tolerance tests (Vejražková2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NME7 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, particularly those related to ciliary dysfunction. A homozygous mutation in NME7 has been linked to situs inversus totalis, a condition where the major visceral organs are mirrored from their normal positions. This mutation affects the splicing of the NME7 gene, leading to the skipping of exon 10 and resulting in an in-frame deletion of 34 amino acids in the protein's NDPK domain, which is predicted to disrupt its function (Reish2016A). 

In mice, the absence of the Nme7 gene results in phenotypes consistent with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), such as hydrocephalus and situs inversus, indicating its role in ciliary motility and left-right asymmetry during development (Vogel2010Situs). 

Additionally, heterozygous mutations in NME7 in rats have been linked to metabolic conditions, including impaired glucose tolerance and increased adiposity. These mutations lead to changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, suggesting a potential role for NME7 in metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and obesity (Šedová2021Heterozygous).

## Interactions
NME7, a member of the NME/NM23 family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is part of the γ-tubulin ring complex, which is crucial for microtubule organization. A mutation in NME7 that results in the deletion of an exon disrupts its interaction with this complex, as it removes amino acids essential for binding (Reish2016A). NME7 also plays a role in stem cell pluripotency by being secreted by early stem cells and binding to the extracellular domain of MUC1*, promoting growth and maintaining pluripotency in the naive state (Romani2018Extracellular).

In the context of ciliary function, NME7 is associated with ciliary motility and is tightly linked to the flagellar axoneme in organisms like Chlamydomonas, suggesting a role in axonemal targeting or assembly (Ćetković2014Nme). Despite its involvement in these processes, studies in rats have shown that NME7 deficiency does not significantly affect ciliary structure, although it leads to severe phenotypes such as hydrocephalus and situs inversus (Šedová2021SemiLethal). These interactions highlight NME7's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and its potential impact on various physiological processes.
