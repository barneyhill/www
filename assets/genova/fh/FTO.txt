# FTO

## Overview
The FTO gene encodes the FTO alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, a protein that belongs to the family of Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent dioxygenases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the demethylation of nucleic acids, specifically targeting N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in RNA, which plays a crucial role in regulating RNA processing, stability, and splicing (Jia2011N6-Methyladenosine; Gerken2007The). The FTO protein is characterized by a double-stranded beta-helix (DSBH) fold, a structural motif that facilitates its catalytic activity (Clifton2006Structural). It is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing processes such as adipogenesis and energy homeostasis (Berulava2012FTO; Merkestein2015FTO). Variants in the FTO gene have been associated with obesity and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance in metabolic and oncogenic pathways (Chen2018Novel; Lan2020FTO).

## Structure
The FTO protein, encoded by the FTO gene, is characterized by a double-stranded beta-helix (DSBH) fold, a structural motif common to Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent dioxygenases (Clifton2006Structural; Gerken2007The). This fold consists of eight beta strands forming a beta-sandwich structure with two four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets, stabilized by internal hydrophobic interactions and supported by conserved alpha-helices (Clifton2006Structural). The FTO protein's sequence is highly conserved across various organisms, indicating its evolutionary importance (Gerken2007The; SanchezPulido2007The).

The N-terminal domain of FTO contains the catalytic core, which includes five obligate amino acid residues necessary for 2OG and Fe(II) binding (Gulati2013The). This domain is similar to the structure of AlkB, another member of the non-heme dioxygenase family, suggesting a similar secondary structure (SanchezPulido2007The). FTO also features a unique Loop 1 region, conserved among FTO proteins, which provides specificity for single-stranded nucleic acids (Gulati2013The).

The protein is predicted to have a molecular mass of 50 KDa and may contain a bipartite Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), suggesting potential nuclear-cytoplasmic localization (SanchezPulido2007The). The specific target of FTO's catalytic action remains unknown, but it is hypothesized to involve oxidative reactions with iron and 2-oxoglutarate as essential cofactors (SanchezPulido2007The).

## Function
The FTO gene encodes a protein that functions as a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent nucleic acid demethylase, primarily involved in the demethylation of RNA and DNA. This enzymatic activity is crucial for regulating RNA processing, stability, and splicing, which in turn influences gene expression (Berulava2012FTO; Gerken2007The). FTO specifically targets N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in nuclear RNA, affecting post-transcriptional regulation processes such as RNA splicing and translation (Lan2020FTO). The protein is localized mainly in the nucleus, particularly in nuclear speckles and nucleoli, suggesting its involvement in RNA splicing and ribosomal RNA processing (Berulava2012FTO).

FTO plays a significant role in adipogenesis by regulating mitotic clonal expansion, a critical early event in the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes. This regulation is mediated through the expression of the pro-adipogenic short isoform of the transcription factor RUNX1T1, enhancing adipocyte proliferation (Merkestein2015FTO). Overexpression of FTO leads to increased adipogenesis and fat mass, while knockout or mutation results in reduced body weight and fat mass (Merkestein2015FTO). These molecular processes underscore FTO's role in energy homeostasis and body weight regulation (Gerken2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FTO gene are associated with several diseases and conditions, primarily obesity and cancer. Variants of FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as rs9939609, have been linked to increased body mass index (BMI) and obesity across various populations, including European, East Asian, and Brazilian groups. These SNPs are associated with increased energy intake and reduced satiety, leading to overeating (Chen2018Novel; Lan2020FTO). The FTO gene's role in obesity is further supported by its involvement in adipogenesis and regulation of hormones related to eating (Lan2020FTO).

In cancer, FTO acts as an oncogene, with SNPs like rs9939609 linked to higher risks of several cancers, including lung, renal, breast, prostate, pancreatic, and endometrial cancers (Chen2018Novel; Lan2020FTO). FTO is highly expressed in many cancer tissues, influencing tumorigenesis and therapeutic responses through m6A-dependent pathways (Lan2020FTO). FTO inhibitors have shown potential in treating cancers such as leukemia and glioblastoma by targeting its demethylation function (Lan2020FTO).

A specific mutation, R316Q, inactivates FTO enzymatic activity and causes severe growth retardation and multiple malformations, highlighting its critical role in development (Boissel2009LossofFunction).

## Interactions
The FTO protein, also known as FTO alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with CaMKII isoforms (α, β, and γ), which are protein kinases involved in phosphorylating various substrates. This interaction is functional, as FTO overexpression in human neuroblastoma cells delays the dephosphorylation of CREB, leading to increased expression of CREB targets like NPY1R and BDNF, which regulate food intake and energy homeostasis (Lin2014Fat). The interaction with CaMKIIγ was confirmed in vivo through co-immunoprecipitation (Lin2014Fat).

FTO also plays a role in nucleic acid demethylation, particularly targeting N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in RNA. It demethylates m6A in single-stranded RNA and DNA, with a preference for single-stranded nucleic acids (Jia2011N6-Methyladenosine). FTO's demethylation activity is linked to its ability to bind α-KG and iron(II), essential for its function (Jia2011N6-Methyladenosine). The protein localizes to the cell nucleus, particularly in nuclear speckles, suggesting interactions with nuclear RNA and splicing factors (Jia2011N6-Methyladenosine). These interactions indicate FTO's involvement in post-transcriptional mRNA processing.
