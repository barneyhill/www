# ETV1

## Overview
ETV1, or ETS variant transcription factor 1, is a gene that encodes a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a conserved ETS DNA-binding domain. The protein product of ETV1 plays a crucial role as a transcriptional regulator, influencing gene expression in various tissues, including the heart and nervous system. As a transcription factor, ETV1 is involved in critical biological processes such as cardiac conduction and neuronal cell fate decisions. It is known to interact with several signaling pathways, including the ErbB2 and MAPK pathways, which modulate its activity and function (Shekhar2016Transcription). ETV1's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in several cancers, where its overexpression, mutations, and chromosomal rearrangements contribute to tumor progression and aggressiveness, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Baena2013ETV1; Sizemore2017The).

## Structure
ETV1 (ETS variant transcription factor 1) is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, characterized by a conserved ETS DNA-binding domain. The primary structure of ETV1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific residues such as Lys-379, Tyr-396, Tyr-397, and Lys-404 playing crucial roles in DNA binding (Cooper2015Structures).

The secondary structure of ETV1 features a typical fold consisting of three α-helices flanking a four-stranded β-sheet, with an additional C-terminal helix (α4) (Cooper2015Structures). The recognition helix (α3) inserts into the major groove of DNA, making multiple contacts with the base pairs and the phosphate backbone (Cooper2015Structures).

In terms of tertiary structure, ETV1 forms a three-dimensional shape that allows it to interact with DNA and other molecules. The quaternary structure involves the formation of disulfide-linked homodimers, which are redox-dependent and inhibit DNA binding (Cooper2015Structures).

ETV1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Ser-334, which affects its DNA-binding ability (Cooper2015Structures). The protein also has regions that mediate autoinhibition, involving interactions between structured and disordered regions that affect the DNA-binding interface (Currie2017Structured).

## Function
ETV1 (ETS variant transcription factor 1) is a critical transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression in various tissues, including the heart and nervous system. In cardiomyocytes, ETV1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of rapid conduction gene regulatory networks, essential for maintaining normal heart rhythm and preventing arrhythmias. It promotes the expression of genes associated with rapid conduction, such as Nkx2-5, Gja5, and Scn5a, and is involved in the development of the His-Purkinje system (HPS) (Shekhar2018ETV1). ETV1 is highly expressed in Purkinje cells and is responsible for establishing the fast conduction phenotype by enriching the expression of these key cardiac genes (Shekhar2016Transcription).

ETV1 is also a known target of the ErbB2 and MAPK signaling pathways, which are involved in cell fate decisions and functional modulation of neuronal cell types (Shekhar2016Transcription). In the heart, ETV1 expression and activity are confined to subendocardial atrial and Purkinje myocytes, where it orchestrates the expression of the fast conduction gene program (Shekhar2016Transcription). The transcription factor motif analysis revealed that the ETV1-binding motif is significantly enriched in the promoters of Purkinje-enriched genes, further supporting its role in cardiac conduction (Shekhar2016Transcription).

## Clinical Significance
ETV1 (ETS variant transcription factor 1) is implicated in several cancers due to its overexpression, mutations, and chromosomal rearrangements. In prostate cancer, ETV1 is often overexpressed due to chromosomal translocations, leading to aggressive tumor phenotypes. It enhances androgen receptor signaling, contributing to increased testosterone production and aggressive cancer progression. ETV1 overexpression is associated with higher Gleason scores and poorer prognosis, making it a potential biomarker for aggressive prostate cancer (Shin2009Induction; Baena2013ETV1).

In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), ETV1 is overexpressed due to mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, which stabilizes ETV1 through the MEK-ERK pathway. This overexpression drives an oncogenic transcriptional program essential for GIST growth and survival, making ETV1 a potential target for novel therapies (ZHANG2014Altered; Chi2010ETV1; Sizemore2017The).

ETV1 is also implicated in melanoma, where its gene locus is frequently amplified. This amplification leads to increased ETV1 expression, contributing to melanoma progression. ETV1 amplifications and potential translocations are observed in a significant portion of melanoma cases, highlighting its role in this cancer type (JanéValbuena2010An).

## Interactions
ETV1, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, participates in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function as a transcriptional regulator. In p53-deficient human cancer cells, ETV1 acts as a transcriptional activator of the TERT gene by binding to its promoter, specifically within intron 1. This interaction is crucial for TERT transcriptional activity and is observed in p53-deficient HCT116 cells (Xie2012A). ETV1's binding to the TERT promoter is regulated by ATR, a protein kinase that phosphorylates and stabilizes ETV1, enhancing its binding capability. ATR itself is also bound to the TERT promoter, indicating a physical association between ATR and ETV1 (Xie2012A).

ETV1 is also involved in autoinhibitory interactions within its own structure. The C-terminal inhibitory domain (CID) and the N-terminal inhibitory domain (NID) of ETV1 interact with the ETS domain to mediate autoinhibition of DNA binding. These interactions involve specific residues and structural elements, such as the α-helix in the CID, which interacts with the ETS domain to affect its DNA-recognition helix (Currie2017Structured). These intramolecular interactions are unique to the ETV1/4/5 subfamily and are modulated by cellular signals, such as acetylation, which can disrupt these inhibitory interactions and activate DNA binding (Currie2017Structured).
