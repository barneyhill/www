# ACTN2

## Overview
The ACTN2 gene encodes the protein actinin alpha 2, a crucial component of the spectrin superfamily, predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues. Actinin alpha 2 is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a vital role in the structural organization and function of muscle cells, particularly within the Z-disc of sarcomeres in striated muscle. It functions as an F-actin-crosslinking protein, facilitating the transmission of mechanical forces across sarcomeres and contributing to muscle elasticity and integrity (Rodriguez2023Disruption; Haywood2016Hypertrophic). The protein's structure includes an actin-binding domain, a central rod domain with spectrin repeats, and a calmodulin-like domain, which are essential for its interactions with other proteins such as titin and phosphoinositides (Weng2022Characterization; Grison2017αActinintitin). Mutations in the ACTN2 gene have been linked to various cardiac and muscular disorders, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and congenital myopathies, underscoring its clinical significance in muscle function and disease (Lornage2019ACTN2; Haywood2016Hypertrophic).

## Structure
The ACTN2 gene encodes the protein alpha-actinin-2, which is a member of the spectrin superfamily and is primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The molecular structure of alpha-actinin-2 includes several distinct domains. At the N-terminus, it features an actin-binding domain (ABD) composed of two calponin homology (CH) domains, CH1 and CH2, which are crucial for actin filament crosslinking (Atang2023Cardiomyopathyassociated; Haywood2016Hypertrophic). The central rod domain consists of four spectrin repeats, forming a cylindrical structure that provides interaction sites for various proteins (Weng2022Characterization). The C-terminal region contains a calmodulin-like domain with two EF-hand motifs, although these motifs have lost their calcium-binding ability in striated muscle-specific isoforms (Haywood2016Hypertrophic).

Alpha-actinin-2 forms an antiparallel homodimer, contributing to its quaternary structure, which is essential for its function in the Z-disc of muscle cells (Weng2022Characterization; Haywood2016Hypertrophic). The protein's structure is further stabilized by interactions with phosphoinositides, which regulate its conformation and actin-binding capability (Lornage2019ACTN2). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which may influence its interaction with other proteins and its role in cellular signaling pathways (Weng2022Characterization).

## Function
The ACTN2 gene encodes α-actinin 2, a protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of muscle cells, particularly in the Z-disc of sarcomeres in striated muscle. α-Actinin 2 is an F-actin-crosslinking protein that belongs to the spectrin superfamily and is primarily expressed in cardiac muscle. It forms crosslinks with actin in thin filaments, establishing a lattice-like structure that facilitates longitudinal force transmission from one sarcomere to the next (Rodriguez2023Disruption). This protein is involved in two main communication pathways: one where it interacts with actin to modulate thin filament regulation, and another where it interacts with titin to modulate the activation state of thick filaments (Rodriguez2023Disruption).

Structurally, α-actinin 2 has an N-terminal actin-binding domain, a central rod formed by spectrin repeats, and a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain with EF-hands that interact with titin (Rodriguez2023Disruption). The dynamic binding of α-actinin 2 to F-actin is crucial for enabling rapid Z-disk remodeling in healthy tissue (Atang2023Cardiomyopathyassociated). It also binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PiP2), affecting actin filament function (Rodriguez2023Disruption). Variants of ACTN2 are associated with cardiomyopathies and heart failure, suggesting that alterations in α-actinin 2 can lead to sarcomere dysfunction and cardiac disease (Rodriguez2023Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTN2 gene are associated with several cardiac and muscular disorders. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one such condition, characterized by a hypertrophic left ventricle and impaired diastolic relaxation. Specific mutations in the ACTN2 gene, such as A119T and G111V, have been shown to alter the protein's structure and reduce its binding affinity to F-actin, potentially contributing to HCM by affecting the protein's incorporation into the cardiomyocyte Z-disc (Haywood2016Hypertrophic). Another mutation, p.T247M, is linked to HCM and is associated with myofibrillar disarray and increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (Prondzynski2019Disease).

ACTN2 mutations are also implicated in 'Multiple Structured Core Disease' (MsCD), a congenital myopathy characterized by muscle weakness and distinctive Z-line abnormalities. The p.Leu727Arg mutation in ACTN2 has been identified as pathogenic for this condition, leading to early-onset muscle weakness and progressive disease (Lornage2019ACTN2).

Additionally, the Ala119Thr mutation in ACTN2 has been associated with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and left ventricular noncompaction, conditions that can lead to sudden cardiac death (Bagnall2014Exome).

## Interactions
ACTN2 (actinin alpha 2) is a key structural component of the sarcomere Z-disk, where it interacts with various proteins to maintain muscle integrity and function. It binds to actin filaments through its actin-binding domain, facilitating the organization of the cytoskeleton and contributing to sarcomere assembly and function (Haywood2016Hypertrophic). ACTN2 interacts with titin, a giant protein that plays a critical role in muscle elasticity and structure, particularly through its EF3-4 domain, which binds to specific titin Z-repeats (Grison2017αActinintitin).

ACTN2 also forms interactions with RNA-binding proteins, such as IGF2BP2, which is crucial for the localization of electron transport chain transcripts to actinin neighborhoods. This interaction is significant for oxidative metabolism and cell survival, especially in the context of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Ladha2021Actinin). The interaction between ACTN2 and IGF2BP2 involves the rod domain of actinin and the KH domain of IGF2BP2, highlighting its role in metabolic adaptation (Ladha2021Actinin).

Additionally, ACTN2 interacts with angiogenin (ANG), where the segment of residues 383-632 in ACTN2 binds to ANG, influencing cell motility and potentially affecting tumor growth and angiogenesis (Weng2022Characterization). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of ACTN2 in cellular processes beyond structural support.
