# C1QTNF12

## Overview
C1QTNF12, also known as CTRP12, is a gene that encodes the protein C1q and TNF related 12, which is a member of the C1q and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed in adipose tissue and plays a crucial role in metabolic regulation, particularly in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Structurally, CTRP12 is characterized by a C1q domain and typically forms a trimeric structure, with significant post-translational modifications such as N-linked glycosylation influencing its stability and function (Stewart2018NLinked). Functionally, CTRP12 enhances insulin signaling and exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus (Wei2012C1qTNFrelated; Enomoto2011AdipolinC1qdc2CTRP12). The protein's interactions with adiponectin receptors further underscore its role in regulating energy homeostasis and maintaining metabolic health.

## Structure
C1QTNF12, also known as CTRP12, is a protein that belongs to the C1q and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. The protein is characterized by a C1q domain and typically forms a trimeric structure. Each monomer of CTRP12 contains a signal peptide, a collagen-like domain, and a globular C1q domain. The primary structure includes three conserved asparagine residues: Asn-39, Asn-287, and Asn-297, which are potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (Stewart2018NLinked).

N-linked glycosylation is a significant post-translational modification for CTRP12, particularly at Asn-39, which is glycosylated and plays a crucial role in modulating the protein's cleavage and stability. This glycosylation affects the protein's folding and secretion, with complex-type N-glycans influencing the cleavage process mediated by the enzyme furin/PCSK3 (Stewart2018NLinked). The presence of N-glycans can act as independent domains that affect the protein's conformation and accessibility to proteolytic enzymes (Stewart2018NLinked).

Mutations at these glycosylation sites, such as Asn-287, can lead to protein misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, highlighting the importance of these modifications in maintaining the protein's structural integrity and function (Stewart2018NLinked).

## Function
C1QTNF12, also known as CTRP12, is a protein that plays a significant role in metabolic regulation, particularly in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. It is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and is secreted by adipocytes, circulating in plasma (Wei2012C1qTNFrelated; Enomoto2011AdipolinC1qdc2CTRP12). CTRP12 enhances insulin signaling by increasing IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation in adipose tissue and liver, which contributes to improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control (Wei2012C1qTNFrelated). It acts on the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway to regulate glucose metabolism in hepatocytes and adipocytes, independent of insulin (Wei2012C1qTNFrelated).

In addition to its metabolic functions, CTRP12 exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. It reduces macrophage accumulation and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue, which is associated with improved glucose metabolism and reduced insulin resistance (Enomoto2011AdipolinC1qdc2CTRP12). The protein's expression is negatively regulated by obesity-associated stresses, such as inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which can lead to its reduced levels in obese states (Enomoto2011AdipolinC1qdc2CTRP12). These functions highlight CTRP12's potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus.

## Interactions
C1QTNF12, also known as CTRP12, is involved in metabolic regulation through its interactions with other proteins. It is known to interact with adiponectin receptors, which play a significant role in glucose and lipid metabolism. These interactions are crucial as they can influence insulin sensitivity and modulate inflammatory responses. The binding of C1QTNF12 to adiponectin receptors suggests a functional similarity to adiponectin, a protein known for its beneficial effects on metabolic processes. Through these interactions, C1QTNF12 may contribute to the regulation of energy homeostasis and the maintenance of metabolic health. The precise mechanisms of these interactions and their physiological implications are subjects of ongoing research, highlighting the importance of C1QTNF12 in metabolic pathways.
