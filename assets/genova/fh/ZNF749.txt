# ZNF749

## Overview
ZNF749 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 749, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 749 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by binding to specific DNA sequences. This protein plays a role in modulating gene expression and is implicated in several biological pathways, although its precise functions and interactions are still under investigation. The study of ZNF749 and its encoded protein is crucial for understanding its potential implications in health and disease, particularly in the context of its regulatory functions within the cell (Qiu2020aarFDC).
