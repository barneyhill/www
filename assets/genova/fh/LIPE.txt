# LIPE

## Overview
The LIPE gene encodes the enzyme hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a crucial component in lipid metabolism. HSL is a lipase enzyme that plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of stored triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol, primarily within adipocytes, facilitating energy mobilization during fasting or physical exertion (Large1998Hormonesensitive; Langin1996Adipocyte). The enzyme is characterized by an α/β-hydrolase fold and a catalytic triad, and it is regulated through phosphorylation, which is influenced by hormonal signals such as catecholamines and insulin (Holm2000Molecular; Langin1996Adipocyte). Beyond adipose tissue, HSL is expressed in various tissues, including the adrenal glands, ovaries, testes, and skeletal muscle, indicating its broader role in energy homeostasis (Holm1988HormoneSensitive). Mutations in the LIPE gene are associated with metabolic disorders such as familial partial lipodystrophy type 6 and multiple symmetric lipomatosis, highlighting its clinical significance in lipid metabolism and energy regulation (Sollier2021LIPErelated; Zhou2024Case).

## Structure
The LIPE gene encodes hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a key enzyme in lipid metabolism. The primary structure of HSL consists of 775 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 84,032 Da (Holm2000Molecular). The protein's sequence can be divided into three distinct regions: an N-terminal region, a poorly conserved linker, and a catalytic core with a regulatory module (Holm2000Molecular). The catalytic core is characterized by an α/β-hydrolase fold, a common structure among lipases and esterases, which includes a catalytic triad composed of serine, aspartate, and histidine (Holm2000Molecular).

HSL is known to form dimers in solution, indicating a quaternary structure (Holm2000Molecular). The enzyme contains specific domains, including a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal domain, which is involved in regulatory functions. The regulatory module includes phosphorylation sites that are crucial for the enzyme's activation and function (Holm2000Molecular). Phosphorylation at specific serine residues, such as Ser-659 and Ser-660, is necessary for HSL activation and translocation to lipid droplets (Holm2000Molecular).

The human HSL gene also produces a testis-specific isoform, HSL tes, which has an additional N-terminal domain with a putative SH3 binding motif, suggesting interactions with other proteins (Holm2000Molecular).

## Function
The LIPE gene encodes hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a critical enzyme in lipid metabolism. HSL is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of stored triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol within adipocytes, a process known as lipolysis. This enzymatic activity is essential for mobilizing energy reserves during periods of fasting or physical activity (Large1998Hormonesensitive; Langin1996Adipocyte). HSL is unique among lipases as it is regulated through phosphorylation, primarily by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which enhances its activity. This regulation is influenced by hormonal signals, with catecholamines activating HSL and insulin inhibiting it (Holm1988HormoneSensitive; Langin1996Adipocyte).

In addition to its role in adipocytes, HSL is expressed in various tissues, including the adrenal glands, ovaries, testes, and skeletal muscle, indicating its broader role in energy homeostasis (Holm1988HormoneSensitive). HSL also interacts with carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) in adipocytes, influencing insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. This interaction is independent of HSL's catalytic activity and suggests a role in regulating insulin signaling pathways (Morigny2018Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LIPE gene, which encodes hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), are associated with several metabolic disorders. One such condition is familial partial lipodystrophy type 6 (FPLD6), characterized by abnormal fat distribution, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, and fatty liver disease. Patients with FPLD6 often exhibit fat loss in the limbs and face, with fat accumulation in the neck and back. This condition is caused by recessive mutations in the LIPE gene, leading to impaired lipolytic capacity and metabolic complications (Zhou2024Case; FossFreitas2020Diagnostic).

LIPE mutations are also linked to multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL), a rare disorder marked by the development of large adipose tissue masses, lipoatrophy, and metabolic complications such as insulin resistance and diabetes. Neuromuscular manifestations, including pes cavus, are common, and unique ophthalmological signs like sub-retinal yellowish deposits have been observed. These symptoms result from null variants in the LIPE gene, leading to a complete loss of HSL expression and impaired adipocyte differentiation (Sollier2021LIPErelated).

Alterations in the LIPE gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes mellitus and abdominal obesity, conditions associated with metabolic syndrome. Variants in the LIPE gene may contribute to abnormal lipid metabolism and insulin resistance (Klannemark1998The).

## Interactions
Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), encoded by the LIPE gene, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence its function in lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. HSL interacts with the carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) in adipocytes, inhibiting ChREBP's transcriptional activity. This interaction is independent of HSL's catalytic activity and affects the expression of ELOVL6, a fatty acid elongase linked to insulin sensitivity (Morigny2018Interaction). The interaction between HSL and ChREBP is specific to adipose tissue and does not occur in hepatocytes, indicating tissue-specific modulation of insulin signaling (Morigny2018Interaction).

HSL also physically interacts with ChREBPα, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells and adipocytes. This interaction affects the cellular distribution of ChREBP, leading to increased nuclear translocation and enhanced transcriptional activity when HSL expression is reduced (Morigny2018Interaction). Additionally, a short form of HSL, lacking enzymatic activity, retains the ability to bind ChREBP and modulate insulin signaling (Morigny2018Interaction).

HSL is regulated by phosphorylation, with specific serine residues being crucial for its activation. Protein Kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates HSL, facilitating its translocation to lipid droplets and initiating triglyceride hydrolysis (Holm2000Molecular).
