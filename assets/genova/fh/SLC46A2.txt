# SLC46A2

## Overview
SLC46A2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 46 member 2, a transmembrane transporter involved in critical immune signaling pathways. This protein is predominantly expressed in immune cells such as CD14+ monocytes and macrophages, where it serves as a primary importer of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), facilitating the activation of the STING pathway, a key component of the innate immune response (Cordova2021Human; Cordova2020Human). Additionally, SLC46A2 is expressed in epidermal keratinocytes, where it transports DAP-muropeptides to the NOD1 receptor, triggering immune responses essential for skin defense (Bharadwaj2022Methotrexate). The protein's function is significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, and is modulated by inhibitors such as sulfasalazine (Cordova2020Human).

## Function
The SLC46A2 gene encodes a transmembrane transporter protein that plays a crucial role in immune signaling in human cells. It is highly expressed in CD14+ monocytes and macrophages, where it functions as the dominant importer of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a key molecule involved in immune response activation. SLC46A2 facilitates the sensing of extracellular cGAMP, which is essential for the activation of the STING pathway, a critical component of the innate immune response (Cordova2021Human; Cordova2020Human).

In the skin, SLC46A2 is expressed in epidermal keratinocytes and is involved in the transport of DAP-muropeptides to the cytosolic innate immune receptor NOD1. This process triggers immune responses, including the recruitment of neutrophils, which are vital for skin barrier defense against bacterial infections (Bharadwaj2022Methotrexate).

SLC46A2's activity is crucial for the import of cGAMP and other cyclic dinucleotides, impacting immune responses to various stimuli, including cancer and infections. Its function is modulated by inhibitors like sulfasalazine, which can affect cGAMP signaling and potentially modulate immune responses in pathological conditions (Cordova2021Human; Cordova2020Human).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC46A2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in transporting muropeptides and its involvement in immune responses. In the context of psoriasis, SLC46A2 is crucial for the transport of DAP-muropeptides, which activate the NOD1 receptor pathway in keratinocytes. This activation is essential for the skin's immune response and barrier function. Methotrexate, a drug used to treat psoriasis, inhibits the SLC46A2-mediated transport of these muropeptides, thereby reducing psoriatic inflammation (Bharadwaj2022Methotrexate).

In lung squamous cell carcinoma, SLC46A2 has been identified as a prognostic biomarker. Altered expression of SLC46A2, along with other genes, can predict lymph node metastasis and overall survival, suggesting its role in cancer progression and patient prognosis (Khashei2023Genes).

A rare frameshift mutation in SLC46A2 has been identified in a study on hidradenitis suppurativa, although it is considered an additional risk factor rather than a primary cause of the condition. This mutation may exacerbate the disease in individuals with concurrent mutations in other genes (Theut2021Full).
