# PBX3

## Overview
PBX3 is a gene that encodes the PBX homeobox 3 protein, a member of the TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by a conserved homeodomain that facilitates DNA binding, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during developmental processes. PBX3 is involved in various cellular functions, including differentiation and proliferation, by forming complexes with other transcription factors such as HOX proteins. The protein's activity is modulated by alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with potentially distinct functions. PBX3 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, indicating its broad role in development and cellular function. Clinically, PBX3 has been implicated in oncogenesis, particularly in cancers such as papillary thyroid carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia, where it acts as an oncogene and is associated with poor prognosis (Guo2017PBX3; Burglin1997Analysis; Chen2020PBX3).

## Structure
The PBX3 protein is a member of the TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) family of transcription factors, characterized by a conserved DNA-binding homeodomain (HD) located towards the carboxy-terminus. This homeodomain is approximately 60 amino acids long and forms a helix-loop-helix DNA-binding motif, which includes an insertion of three amino acids between helix 1 and helix 2, typical of TALE proteins (Longobardi2013Biochemistry; Milech2001Novel). The PBX3 protein is approximately 430 amino acids in length and contains two protein-protein interaction domains, PBC-A and PBC-B, located towards the amino terminus. The PBC-A domain is 75 residues long, and the PBC-B domain is 88 residues long, with the latter containing conserved serine residues involved in the regulation of nuclear export (Longobardi2013Biochemistry).

PBX3 has two canonical isoforms, PBX3A and PBX3B, and two novel isoforms, PBX3C and PBX3D, which result from alternative splicing. These novel isoforms have truncated N-termini, affecting the PBC domain crucial for protein interactions (Milech2001Novel). The PBX3 protein can form heterodimers with other proteins, such as PREP1 and MEIS, influencing its quaternary structure and function (Milech2001Novel). The extensive sequence similarity and conserved domains suggest a generalized, overlapping role in transcriptional regulation (Monica1991PBX2).

## Function
PBX3 (PBX homeobox 3) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression during development. It is part of the TALE superclass of homeobox genes, specifically belonging to the PBC class, which is characterized by a unique homeodomain structure that includes three extra residues between helix 1 and helix 2 (Burglin1997Analysis). PBX3 is involved in transcriptional regulation by binding to specific DNA sequences, often in cooperation with other proteins such as HOX proteins, to influence cellular differentiation and proliferation (Monica1991PBX2).

The PBX3 protein is expressed in a wide range of fetal and adult tissues, suggesting a generalized role in various cell types (Monica1991PBX2). It is active in the nucleus, where it forms complexes with other transcription factors to regulate the expression of target genes involved in critical developmental processes, including hematopoiesis and organogenesis (Monica1991PBX2). The protein's activity is modulated by alternative splicing, which results in different translation products that may have distinct functional properties (Monica1991PBX2). This splicing pattern contributes to the diversity of PBX3's roles in cellular and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
PBX3 (PBX homeobox 3) is implicated in various cancers due to its role as an oncogene. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), PBX3 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with larger tumor size, lymphatic metastasis, advanced TMN stage, and reduced overall survival in patients. PBX3 promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis through the AT1R/VEGFR2 signaling pathway, making it a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PTC (Chen2020PBX3).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PBX3 acts as an oncogene, particularly in MLL-rearranged leukemia, where it is crucial for leukemia stem cell maintenance. High PBX3 expression correlates with poor prognosis and is involved in drug resistance. Its expression is regulated by microRNAs, which can inhibit its oncogenic pathways (Morgan2020PBX3; Guo2017PBX3).

PBX3 is also involved in other cancers, such as hepatic cellular carcinoma, glioma, and gastric cancer, where it promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis through various signaling pathways, including MAPK, AKT, and WNT. Its interactions and expression levels are often linked to poor clinical outcomes (Morgan2020PBX3).

## Interactions
PBX3, a transcription factor, engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. It forms complexes with HOX proteins, which are crucial for transcriptional regulation during development. These interactions are mediated by specific motifs within the HOX proteins, although recent studies suggest a more complex interaction mechanism (Laurent2008PBX).

In the context of leukemia, PBX3 interacts with MEIS1 and HOXA9 proteins. This interaction is essential for the formation of a trimeric complex that enhances the transcriptional activity of HOXA9, contributing to leukemogenesis. PBX3 stabilizes MEIS1 by protecting it from ubiquitination and degradation, thereby facilitating its interaction with HOXA9 (Thorne2015Dangerous).

PBX3 also interacts with the tumor suppressor gene p53. It binds directly to the p53 promoter, suppressing its transcriptional activity, which affects the p53/p21 axis and promotes tumor cell growth by inhibiting apoptosis and enhancing proliferation (Li2021The).

Additionally, PBX3 is involved in various signaling pathways, such as MAPK, AKT, and WNT, influencing cancer progression through interactions with components like the Myc transcription factor and the Snail transcription factor (Morgan2020PBX3).
