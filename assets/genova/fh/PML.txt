# PML

## Overview
The PML gene encodes the promyelocytic leukemia protein, a crucial component of PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) within the cell nucleus. These nuclear bodies are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including growth regulation, apoptosis, and antiviral responses. The PML protein is characterized by a tripartite motif (TRIM) that includes a RING finger domain, B-boxes, and a coiled-coil region, which are essential for its role as a scaffold protein in the assembly of PML-NBs (Jensen2001PML; Borden1995The). PML-NBs are implicated in maintaining genomic stability, DNA damage repair, and telomere maintenance, interacting with key proteins such as p53 and CHK2 to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis (Bernardi2003Role; Chang2018The). The PML protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, including SUMOylation, which affects its interactions and stability (Jensen2001PML). Alterations in the PML gene are notably associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and other cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor (Gang1998Role; Gurrieri2004Loss).

## Structure
The PML protein, encoded by the PML gene, is a key component of nuclear bodies and is characterized by a tripartite motif (TRIM) that includes a RING finger domain, two B-boxes, and a coiled-coil region. The RING finger domain is a cysteine-rich zinc-binding module essential for protein-protein interactions and E3 ubiquitin ligase activities, playing a crucial role in PML nuclear body formation (Jensen2001PML; Borden1995The). The RING domain's structure includes two zinc fingers in a 'cross-brace' mode, with specific cysteine and histidine residues coordinating zinc ions, which are vital for maintaining its structural integrity (Huang2015The; Borden1995The).

The B-box domains also bind zinc and contribute to the structural integrity and function of PML, including growth suppression and nuclear body formation (Jensen2001PML; Borden1996In). The coiled-coil region facilitates PML multimerization and interactions with other proteins, such as the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) (Jensen2001PML).

PML undergoes post-translational modifications, including SUMOylation, which influences its function and localization (Jensen2001PML). The PML gene produces several alternatively spliced transcripts, resulting in different isoforms that share a common N-terminal region but differ in their central or C-terminal regions, affecting their functional interactions (Jensen2001PML).

## Function
The PML gene encodes the promyelocytic leukemia protein, which is a key component of PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) in the cell nucleus. These nuclear bodies are involved in various cellular functions, including growth regulation, apoptosis, and antiviral activities. PML-NBs play a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in DNA damage sensing and repair, as well as telomere maintenance (Chang2018The). The PML protein interacts with several key proteins involved in DNA repair, such as Bloom's syndrome protein (BLM), RAD51, and RP-A, facilitating their accumulation at sites of DNA repair (Bernardi2003Role).

PML is also involved in regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis through its interactions with proteins like p53 and CHK2, which are crucial for the DNA damage response (Bernardi2003Role; Chang2018The). The protein's role in apoptosis is further highlighted by its involvement in p53-dependent apoptotic pathways (Jensen2001PML). PML's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation, which influences its interactions and stability (Jensen2001PML).

In healthy cells, PML is inducible by interferons and plays a role in cellular defense mechanisms, including antiviral responses (Jensen2001PML). The protein's activities are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive cell growth, as evidenced by increased proliferation in PML-deficient cells (Gang1998Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PML gene are significantly associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and other cancers. In APL, the PML gene is involved in a chromosomal translocation that fuses it with the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene, creating the PML-RARA fusion protein. This fusion disrupts normal PML function and contributes to leukemogenesis by impairing differentiation and promoting the survival of leukemic cells (Gang1998Role; Rego2001Role). Mutations in PML or RARA can be present at diagnosis and may expand under treatment, affecting disease progression (Liquori2020Acute).

Beyond APL, PML expression is often reduced or absent in various solid tumors, including prostate, breast, and CNS cancers. This loss is associated with higher tumor grades and progression, suggesting that PML acts as a tumor suppressor (Salomoni2008New; Gurrieri2004Loss). The loss of PML protein expression is frequently due to post-translational mechanisms, such as proteasome-dependent degradation, rather than mutations (Gurrieri2004Loss). PML inactivation provides a survival advantage to cancer cells by modulating key tumor-suppressive pathways, including those controlled by p53 and Rb (Gurrieri2004Loss).

## Interactions
The PML protein, a key component of PML nuclear bodies (NBs), engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. PML NBs are formed through the oligomerization of PML proteins, influenced by reactive oxygen species and cysteine residues, leading to intermolecular crosslinking via disulfide bridges and non-covalent interactions mediated by the PML RBCC motif (Ryabchenko2023The). 

PML interacts with the SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9, facilitating SUMOylation, which is essential for PML-PML interactions through SUMO-SIM interactions. This process is crucial for the assembly and stability of PML NBs (Corpet2020PML; Silonov2023PML). The PML protein also interacts with other proteins such as Sp100 and DAXX, which contain SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs) that allow noncovalent binding to SUMO, influencing their recruitment to PML NBs (Corpet2020PML; Brand2010Assembly).

PML NBs are associated with chromatin and specific genomic loci, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and TP53 gene locus, indicating a role in gene regulation and chromatin-loop organization (Corpet2020PML). These interactions suggest that PML NBs concentrate regulatory factors to facilitate transcriptional events nearby (Boisvert2000Promyelocytic).
