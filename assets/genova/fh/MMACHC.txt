# MMACHC

## Overview
The MMACHC gene encodes a protein that plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of cobalamin (vitamin B12), a crucial nutrient involved in various cellular processes. The MMACHC protein is primarily involved in the conversion of cobalamin into its active coenzyme forms, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, which are essential for the function of enzymes such as methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Hannibal2011The; Hannibal2009Processing). Structurally, MMACHC is characterized by a unique vitamin B12-binding motif and exhibits flexibility that allows it to bind different forms of cobalamin, facilitating its role in vitamin B12 metabolism (Plesa2011Interaction; Antony2023Interaction). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as MMADHC, are critical for the proper trafficking and processing of cobalamin within cells (Froese2015Structural). Mutations in the MMACHC gene can lead to disorders such as cblC type methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (LernerEllis2009Spectrum; Wang2019Mutation).

## Structure
The MMACHC protein, encoded by the MMACHC gene, is composed of 282 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 31.7 kDa (Xu2022Structural; Plesa2011Interaction). Its primary structure includes a unique vitamin B12-binding motif, specifically residues 122-HXXGX-126-154-GG-156, which is crucial for its function in cobalamin metabolism (Plesa2011Interaction; Antony2023Interaction).

The secondary structure of MMACHC features an N-terminal region with a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices, and a short antiparallel two-stranded β-sheet. The C-terminal region consists of four α-helices (Antony2023Interaction). The C-terminal domain also shows structural similarity to TonB proteins, which are involved in bacterial vitamin B12 uptake (Plesa2011Interaction).

In terms of tertiary structure, the MMACHC protein forms a functional 3D shape that allows it to bind various forms of cobalamin, including adenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, cyanocobalamin, and hydroxocobalamin (Antony2023Interaction). The protein can exist in a monomeric form but may switch to a homodimeric state upon binding with unprocessed cobalamin and glutathione (Antony2023Interaction). This structural flexibility is essential for its role in vitamin B12 metabolism.

## Function
The MMACHC gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the intracellular metabolism of cobalamin (vitamin B12) by converting it into its active forms, methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) (Hannibal2011The; Hannibal2009Processing). These active forms are essential cofactors for the enzymes methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which are involved in DNA synthesis and energy metabolism (Hannibal2011The; Guéant2018A). The MMACHC protein facilitates the decyanation of cyanocobalamin and the dealkylation of alkylcobalamins, processes necessary for the biosynthesis of these active coenzyme forms (Plesa2011Interaction; Hannibal2009Processing).

In healthy cells, MMACHC is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it maintains the homeostasis of cobalamin derivatives, ensuring proper cellular function and metabolic balance (Hannibal2011The; Plesa2011Interaction). The protein's activity is vital for preventing cobalamin deficiency-related disorders, which can lead to elevated levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, and result in neurological and metabolic dysfunctions (Hannibal2011The; Hannibal2009Processing). The MMACHC protein also interacts with other proteins, such as MMADHC, to regulate the balance between MeCbl and AdoCbl synthesis, further highlighting its role in vitamin B12 metabolism (Plesa2011Interaction; FofouCaillierez2013Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MMACHC gene are primarily associated with cblC type methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, a disorder of vitamin B12 metabolism. This condition is characterized by a range of clinical symptoms, including developmental delays, neurological deterioration, anemia, and metabolic abnormalities (LernerEllis2009Spectrum; Wang2019Mutation). The disease can present as early-onset, often severe and potentially fatal in infancy, or as late-onset, which is usually milder (Wang2019Mutation).

Common mutations in the MMACHC gene include c.271dupA, c.394C>T, and c.331C>T, with c.271dupA being the most prevalent in early-onset cases (LernerEllis2009Spectrum). The c.394C>T mutation is associated with both early and late-onset disease and is more prevalent in Middle Eastern populations (LernerEllis2009Spectrum). These mutations can lead to impaired synthesis of cobalamin coenzymes, disrupting normal metabolic processes (Wang2019Mutation).

Alterations in MMACHC interactions, such as with methionine synthase, can also contribute to clinical manifestations. Specific mutations like p.R161Q and p.R206W affect the stability of these interactions, potentially leading to imbalances in cobalamin metabolism (FofouCaillierez2013Interaction). These disruptions can result in a broad spectrum of symptoms, including neurological, skeletal, muscular, and hematological abnormalities (Hannibal2011The).

## Interactions
The MMACHC protein is involved in several critical interactions within the cobalamin (vitamin B12) metabolism pathway. It forms a complex with the MMADHC protein, which is essential for vitamin B12 trafficking. This interaction is characterized by a 1:1 stoichiometry and is facilitated by the removal of the upper cobalamin ligand, with preincubation with methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and glutathione (GSH) enhancing the interaction (Froese2015Structural). The MMACHC-MMADHC complex is crucial for delivering cobalamin to mitochondrial methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and cytosolic methionine synthase, with specific regions of both proteins necessary for their interaction (Froese2015Structural).

Mutations in MMACHC can disrupt its interaction with MMADHC, affecting the formation of the complex and leading to diseases related to cobalamin metabolism (Froese2015Structural). Additionally, MMACHC interacts with methionine synthase (MS) isoforms, with the interaction being significantly reduced in cblC cell lines with specific MMACHC mutations. This interaction is important for the regulation of cellular cobalamin processing, necessary for cobalamin cofactor synthesis (FofouCaillierez2013Interaction). These interactions highlight the critical role of MMACHC in maintaining proper cobalamin metabolism and cellular function.
