# RPL3

## Overview
RPL3 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein L3, a vital component of the 60S large ribosomal subunit in eukaryotic cells. This protein plays a critical role in ribosome assembly and function, particularly in the formation of early pre-60S ribosomal particles and the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which is essential for peptide bond formation during protein synthesis (Russo2017Ribosomal; Pecoraro2021Ribosome). Ribosomal protein L3 is categorized as a structural ribosomal protein, and it is involved in intra-ribosome communication, influencing translation efficiency (Małecki2021Human). Beyond its primary role in the ribosome, RPL3 also exhibits extra-ribosomal functions, such as acting as a transcription factor under conditions of ribosome biogenesis disruption and participating in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis (Russo2017Ribosomal). Additionally, RPL3 has been implicated in mitochondrial function, suggesting a broader impact on cellular energy production and metabolism (Milenkovic2021Dynamic).

## Structure
The human RPL3 gene encodes the ribosomal protein L3, a component of the 60S large ribosomal subunit. The primary structure of RPL3 includes a sequence of amino acids that are highly conserved across species, with a 66% sequence identity between yeast and humans (Małecki2021Human). The secondary structure of RPL3 features specific domains such as the NH2-terminal extension, W finger, and basic thumb, which extend into the core region of the 60S subunit and are situated near the CCA terminus of the A-tRNA in the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining).

The tertiary structure of RPL3 is characterized by its interaction with RNA helices, with the COOH-terminal region interacting with RNA helices and the NH2-terminal region extending towards the core of the 60S subunit (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining). The quaternary structure involves its assembly with other ribosomal proteins and rRNA to form the functional ribosome.

Post-translational modifications of RPL3 include methylation at a specific histidine residue (His-245 in humans), which is crucial for ribosome biogenesis and function (Małecki2021Human). This methylation is conserved from yeast to humans and is important for the proper assembly and function of the ribosome.

## Function
RPL3, also known as ribosomal protein L3, is a crucial component of the 60S subunit of the ribosome, playing a significant role in ribosome assembly and function. It is involved in the formation of early pre-60S ribosomal particles, essential for ribosome assembly, and is located near the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), a critical site for peptide bond formation during protein synthesis (Russo2017Ribosomal; Pecoraro2021Ribosome). RPL3 is also involved in intra-ribosome communication, transmitting the tRNA occupancy status to the elongation factor binding region and the PTC, which is vital for efficient translation (Małecki2021Human).

In addition to its role in ribosome assembly, RPL3 has extra-ribosomal functions, such as acting as a transcription factor when ribosome biogenesis is disturbed and regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis in response to nucleolar stress (Russo2017Ribosomal). RPL3 is active in both the nucleolus and cytoplasm, contributing to cellular growth and proliferation. It also plays a role in mitochondrial function, as RPL3-containing ribosomes have been shown to interact with mitochondria, potentially affecting mitochondrial activity and energy production (Milenkovic2021Dynamic).

## Interactions
RPL3, a ribosomal protein, is involved in several interactions crucial for its function in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. It interacts with the histidine-specific methyltransferase METTL18, which methylates RPL3 at histidine 245. This modification is essential for proper ribosome maturation and function, as METTL18 localizes to nucleoli, the sites of ribosome assembly (Małecki2021Human). RPL3 also interacts with the chaperone Rrb1, which binds to RPL3 in the cytoplasm and facilitates its incorporation into pre-60S ribosomal subunits, preventing unspecific interactions and aggregation (Pausch2015Cotranslational).

RPL3 plays a role in the cellular response to nucleolar stress, particularly in cancer cells lacking functional p53. It binds to the p21 promoter, enhancing p21 expression and stability, which is crucial for the cytotoxic effects of Actinomycin D (Act D) in these cells (Russo2016Regulatory). RPL3 also interacts with the MEK/ERK pathway, inducing ERK phosphorylation, which is essential for p21 expression (Russo2016Regulatory). These interactions highlight RPL3's role in regulating apoptosis and cell migration, making it a potential target for enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapy in p53-negative tumors.
