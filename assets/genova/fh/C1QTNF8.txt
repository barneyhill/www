# C1QTNF8

## Overview
C1QTNF8 is a gene that encodes the protein C1q and TNF related 8, also known as CTRP8, which is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family. This family of proteins is characterized by their involvement in various physiological processes, including those related to the immune, endocrine, and vascular systems. The C1QTNF8 gene is predominantly expressed in lung and testis tissues, and the protein it encodes is secreted as trimers that can assemble into higher-order oligomeric structures. These structural formations are crucial for the protein's functional diversity, allowing it to form both homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomeric complexes, particularly with the C1q-related factor (CRF) (Peterson2009CTRP8). The protein's modular structure includes a signal peptide, an N-terminal region, a collagen domain, and a C-terminal globular domain homologous to the immune complement protein C1q, which is essential for its trimerization and oligomerization capabilities (Peterson2009CTRP8; Tom2005The). While the specific functions of C1QTNF8 in human cells are not fully understood, its structural properties and interactions suggest a role in cellular signaling and potentially in the regulation of immune responses and metabolism (Peterson2009CTRP8).

## Structure
The C1QTNF8 protein, also known as CTRP8, is characterized by a modular structure typical of the C1q/TNF-related protein family. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide (residues 1-17), an N-terminal region (residues 18-69) containing two cysteine residues, a collagen domain with 14 Gly-X-Y repeats (residues 70-111), and a C-terminal globular domain homologous to the immune complement protein C1q (residues 112-252) (Peterson2009CTRP8). The C1q domain is a common structural motif in this protein family, contributing to its trimerization and oligomerization capabilities (Tom2005The).

The tertiary structure of C1QTNF8 likely includes a 10-strand jelly-roll fold, similar to other C1q-domain proteins, with a central hydrophobic core stabilized by invariant residues (Tom2005The). This structural arrangement is crucial for the protein's stability and function. C1QTNF8 can form homotrimers and hetero-oligomers, particularly with the C1q-related factor (CRF), but not with other family members like adiponectin, CTRP3, and CTRP5 (Peterson2009CTRP8).

C1QTNF8 is predominantly expressed in lung and testis tissues and is secreted as trimers, which can further assemble into higher-order oligomeric structures (Peterson2009CTRP8). The protein's ability to form these complex structures is essential for its functional diversity.

## Function
C1QTNF8, also known as CTRP8, is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, which is involved in various physiological processes, including immune, endocrine, and vascular systems. The protein is predominantly expressed in the lung and testis and is secreted as trimers, forming both homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomeric complexes with other C1q/TNF family members, specifically with C1q-related factor (CRF) (Peterson2009CTRP8). This ability to form different oligomeric structures suggests that C1QTNF8 may generate a variety of functionally distinct ligands with altered receptor specificities, potentially expanding the functional repertoire of these proteins (Peterson2009CTRP8).

The protein consists of four domains: a signal peptide, an N-terminal region with cysteine residues, a collagen domain, and a C-terminal globular domain homologous to the immune complement protein C1q (Peterson2009CTRP8). While the specific function of C1QTNF8 in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, its structural properties and interactions suggest a role in cellular signaling and possibly in the regulation of immune responses and metabolism (Peterson2009CTRP8).

## Interactions
C1QTNF8, also known as CTRP8, is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family and is known to participate in specific protein-protein interactions. CTRP8 is capable of forming homotrimers, which are its basic structural units, similar to other members of the C1q/TNF family. It can also form hetero-oligomeric complexes with other family members. Notably, CTRP8 has been shown to form specific hetero-oligomeric complexes with the C1q-related factor (CRF) when co-expressed in mammalian HEK293T cells. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, where CTRP8 and CRF were reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated from the supernatants of transfected cells (Peterson2009CTRP8).

CRF itself is known to form hetero-oligomeric complexes with other C1q/TNF family members such as CTRP1, CTRP9, and CTRP10, but not with others like adiponectin, CTRP3, and CTRP5, indicating a specific pattern of interaction within the family (Peterson2009CTRP8). These interactions suggest that CTRP8's ability to form complexes with CRF and potentially other C1q/TNF family members is crucial for its role in physiological processes (Peterson2009CTRP8). There is no mention of interactions between CTRP8 and nucleic acids in the available literature.
