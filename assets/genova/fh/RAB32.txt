# RAB32

## Overview
RAB32 is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, which is a member of the Ras superfamily. The RAB32 protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular vesicular trafficking and mitochondrial dynamics, functioning as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) that associates with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (Alto2002Rab32). It is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of mitochondria-ER contacts (MERCs), autophagy, and mTORC1 signaling, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress conditions (DrizyteMiller2020The; HerreraCruz2021Rab32). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and SNX6, further underscore its role in mitochondrial fission and Golgi trafficking (Waschbüsch2019Rab32; OrtizSandoval2014Interaction). Alterations in the RAB32 gene have been linked to diseases such as glioblastoma and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Huang2023High; Hop2024Systematic).

## Structure
Rab32 is a small GTPase protein that is part of the Ras superfamily, involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking and mitochondrial dynamics. The primary structure of Rab32 consists of 225 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 25.0 kDa (Bao2002Molecular). It features a unique GTP-binding sequence, WDIAGQE, instead of the more common WDTAGQE found in other Rab proteins (Bao2002Molecular). 

The secondary structure of Rab32 includes six central β-strands and five α-helical regions, with the α5 helix being crucial for its function as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) (Alto2002Rab32). This helix is exposed on the surface, facilitating interactions with the type II regulatory subunit of PKA (Alto2002Rab32).

Rab32 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, which is suggested by the presence of a prenylated form in murine homologs (CohenSolal2003Identification). The protein can exist in different isoforms, with evidence of a longer form, Rab32L, which includes an additional 268 amino acids and features a proline-rich region and a 16 amino-acid repeat (Bao2002Molecular).

## Function
Rab32 is a small GTPase involved in various cellular processes, primarily related to intracellular trafficking and autophagy. It is particularly enriched at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondria-ER contacts (MERCs), which are essential for cellular functions such as calcium signaling and lipid exchange (HerreraCruz2021Rab32). Rab32 interacts with the ER-phagy receptor reticulon-3L (RTN3L) to mediate the autophagic degradation of mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) proteins, a process termed "MAM-phagy" (HerreraCruz2021Rab32).

Rab32 also functions as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP), associating with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to influence mitochondrial dynamics, including fusion and fission processes (Alto2002Rab32). It is localized to mitochondria, where it participates in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology and motility (Alto2002Rab32).

In addition to its role in autophagy and mitochondrial dynamics, Rab32 is involved in mTORC1 signaling, which is crucial for cell metabolism and growth. It localizes to lysosomes and influences mTORC1 activity by facilitating its association with lysosomes, thereby affecting cell proliferation and size (DrizyteMiller2020The). Rab32's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular stress conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RAB32 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably glioblastoma and Parkinson's disease. In glioblastoma, RAB32 is overexpressed, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival in patients. The gene's high expression levels are linked to the activation of cancer-related signaling pathways and increased immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting its role in tumor progression and immune evasion. RAB32 overexpression is considered an independent risk factor for glioma, and its hypomethylation correlates with worse survival outcomes, making it a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment (Huang2023High).

In Parkinson's disease, a specific variant of RAB32, p.S71R, has been identified as a susceptibility factor, particularly in familial cases. This variant is associated with increased LRRK2 kinase activity, a known pathological mechanism in Parkinson's disease. The RAB32 p.S71R mutation enhances LRRK2 autophosphorylation and RAB10 phosphorylation, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis. The variant is rare in the general population but shows a significant association with Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in the genetic landscape of the disorder (Hop2024Systematic; Gustavsson2024A).

## Interactions
Rab32, a member of the RAS oncogene family, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It acts as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) by interacting with the type II regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), facilitating the anchoring of PKA to mitochondria (Alto2002Rab32). This interaction is mediated by an amphipathic helix within Rab32, which is essential for its function as an AKAP (Alto2002Rab32).

Rab32 also interacts with dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a GTPase involved in mitochondrial fission. This interaction is more pronounced when Rab32 is in its active, GTP-bound form, suggesting that Drp1 acts as an effector protein for Rab32 in mitochondrial dynamics (OrtizSandoval2014Interaction).

Rab32 is involved in Golgi trafficking through its interaction with SNX6, a component of the retromer complex. This interaction is confirmed by yeast two-hybrid and GST-pulldown experiments, indicating that Rab32 may influence retromer-dependent trafficking (Waschbüsch2019Rab32).

Rab32 also interacts with mTOR kinase, influencing mTORC1 signaling. This interaction is independent of Rab32's nucleotide-bound state and is crucial for mTORC1's association with lysosomes, affecting cellular growth and metabolism (DrizyteMiller2020The).
