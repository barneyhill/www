# DDAH1

## Overview
Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1, which is primarily involved in the regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production. This enzyme is classified as a hydrolase and plays a critical role in vascular health by degrading asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (Sun2013Correlations; Zhang2013DDAH1). The activity of DDAH1 is essential for maintaining normal NO levels, which are crucial for endothelial function, including vasodilation, blood flow, and angiogenesis (Zhang2013DDAH1). DDAH1 is also implicated in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, influencing various signaling pathways such as the Ras/Akt pathway, which affects endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Zhang2013DDAH1). The gene's expression and function have significant clinical implications, with alterations linked to vascular diseases, cancer, and psychiatric disorders (Hulin2020Inhibition; Kozlova2022Assessment).

## Structure
The DDAH1 enzyme features a 5-stranded alpha/beta propeller-like fold, which is crucial for its function. The substrate binds within a central cavity or 'barrel' of the protein, where catalysis occurs. This barrel is closed at one end by a 'flap' formed from a looped polypeptide chain, contributing to the enzyme's specificity and function (Doman2024Recent). The active site of DDAH1 is located in a negatively charged cleft at the center of this barrel, facilitating substrate interaction and catalysis (Doman2024Recent).

Key catalytic residues in DDAH1 include Cys274, His173, and Asp127, which form a catalytic triad essential for substrate metabolism. The binding interactions involve guanidine atoms and Asp79, with the ligand backbone interacting with Phe76, and amino nitrogen atoms forming hydrogen bonds with Asp73, Leu30, and Val268 (Doman2024Recent). These interactions are critical for the enzyme's function and the binding of inhibitors.

X-ray crystal structures of DDAH1 from various species, including humans, have been resolved, providing insights into its structural configuration. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not explicitly detailed in the available excerpts (Doman2024Recent). Common post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, may occur, although specific modifications for DDAH1 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The DDAH1 gene encodes the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production by degrading asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (Sun2013Correlations; Zhang2013DDAH1). This degradation process is essential for maintaining normal levels of NO, a key regulator of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis (Zhang2013DDAH1). NO production is vital for vascular health, influencing vasodilation and blood flow (Zhang2013DDAH1).

DDAH1 is involved in cell cycle progression and angiogenesis. In endothelial cells, DDAH1 regulates the expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, which are critical for cell cycle transitions and checkpoint control (Zhang2013DDAH1). It also activates the Akt signaling pathway, promoting endothelial cell proliferation in an NO/cGMP-independent manner (Zhang2013DDAH1). DDAH1's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells, where it influences NO-mediated processes (Sun2013Correlations).

The enzyme's function extends to the modulation of apoptosis and angiogenesis, as evidenced by its role in NO-mediated caspase-3 activation, which affects cellular growth and tube formation in endothelial cells (Trittmann2019DDAH1). DDAH1's regulation of NO production and its interaction with signaling pathways underscore its importance in maintaining endothelial function and vascular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DDAH1 gene have significant clinical implications. DDAH1 is crucial in regulating endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis by degrading asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase. Deficiency in DDAH1 leads to increased ADMA levels, reduced NO production, and impaired endothelial function, contributing to vascular diseases such as thrombotic stroke and coronary heart disease (Zhang2013DDAH1).

In cancer, DDAH1 expression is altered in various types. It is overexpressed in cancers like breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer, correlating with disease aggressiveness, while it is downregulated in gastric cancer, where its low expression is linked to poorer outcomes (Hulin2020Inhibition). In prostate cancer, DDAH1 overexpression enhances cell proliferation and migration, while its inhibition reduces these processes (Hulin2020Inhibition).

DDAH1 polymorphisms are associated with psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, where altered expression levels have been observed (Kozlova2022Assessment). Additionally, a specific SNP in DDAH1 is linked to a lower risk of pulmonary hypertension in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Trittmann2016A).

## Interactions
DDAH1 interacts with several proteins that influence cell cycle progression and angiogenesis. It is known to interact with neurofibromin 1 (NF1), a tumor suppressor with Ras GTPase activating protein activity. This interaction affects the Ras/Akt signaling pathway. DDAH1 overexpression decreases NF1 levels, enhancing Ras signaling, while DDAH1 knockdown increases NF1 levels, potentially reducing Ras signaling and contributing to growth arrest in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Zhang2013DDAH1).

DDAH1 also plays a role in the Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway, which is crucial for upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Overexpression of DDAH1 increases VEGF expression, an effect that is blocked by Ras inhibition, indicating a direct interaction with the Ras pathway (Zhang2013DDAH1). Additionally, DDAH1 is involved in the phosphorylation of NF1 by protein kinase A (PKA), which negatively regulates NF1's GAP function, thereby increasing Ras signaling (Zhang2013DDAH1).

These interactions highlight DDAH1's role in modulating key signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and angiogenesis, primarily through its effects on NF1 and the Ras/Akt pathway.
