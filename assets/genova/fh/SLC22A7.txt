# SLC22A7

## Overview
The SLC22A7 gene encodes the organic anion transporter 2 (OAT2), a member of the solute carrier family 22, which is part of the major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins. OAT2 is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains and is primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys, where it plays a pivotal role in the transport of a wide array of organic anions and drugs across cell membranes (Koepsell2013The; Shen2016Organic). This transporter is involved in the uptake and efflux of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and other nucleotides, as well as endogenous compounds such as creatinine, glutamate, and urate, thereby contributing to their renal excretion and hepatic uptake (Koepsell2013The; Cropp2008Organic). The functional significance of OAT2 extends to its involvement in drug metabolism and detoxification processes, highlighting its importance in pharmacokinetics and potential drug-drug interactions (Yee2021Emerging). Despite its critical roles, the full spectrum of OAT2's functions and specific substrates remains an active area of research (Shen2016Organic).

## Structure
The SLC22A7 gene encodes the organic anion transporter 2 (OAT2), a member of the solute carrier family 22. OAT2 is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains, which are typical of the major facilitator superfamily, and both its N- and C-termini are localized intracellularly (Koepsell2013The; Shen2016Organic). A large extracellular loop between the first and second transmembrane domains contains N-glycosylation sites, which are crucial for membrane targeting and stability (Shen2016Organic; Volk2013OCTs). The protein also features intracellular loops with phosphorylation sites, indicating regulation by reversible phosphorylation (Shen2016Organic).

OAT2 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, including OAT2-546 and OAT2-548, which differ in their amino acid length and functional localization. The OAT2-546 isoform is membrane-localized and functional in transport, while the OAT2-548 isoform is intracellular and non-functional in transport (Shen2016Organic; Cropp2008Organic). These structural variations can significantly impact the transport capabilities and substrate specificity of the protein. The sequence near Glu131 is conserved and critical for the protein's stability and trafficking (Shen2016Organic).

## Function
The SLC22A7 gene encodes the organic anion transporter 2 (OAT2), which is a member of the solute carrier family 22. OAT2 is primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys, where it plays a crucial role in the transport of a wide variety of organic anions and drugs across cell membranes (Shen2016Organic; Yee2021Emerging). This transporter is involved in the uptake and efflux of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and other nucleotides, suggesting a role in regulating intracellular cGMP levels and signaling pathways (Shen2016Organic; Cropp2008Organic). OAT2 is also implicated in the transport of endogenous compounds such as creatinine, glutamate, and urate, contributing to their renal excretion and hepatic uptake (Koepsell2013The; Shen2016Organic).

In the liver, OAT2 is located in the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes, facilitating the uptake of various drugs and endogenous compounds, which is essential for drug metabolism and detoxification processes (Koepsell2013The). The transporter is also expressed in the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubule cells, where it mediates the tubular secretion of organic anions (Koepsell2013The). Despite its significant roles, the full scope of OAT2's functions and its specific substrates remain areas of ongoing research (Shen2016Organic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC22A7 gene, which encodes the organic anion transporter 2 (OAT2), have significant clinical implications. Variants in SLC22A7 can affect the transporter's function, leading to changes in the pharmacokinetics of anionic drugs. This can result in altered drug metabolism, biliary excretion, and renal excretion, potentially causing drug-induced toxicity or therapeutic failure (Koepsell2013The). 

In the context of renal function, OAT2 plays a crucial role in the secretion of uric acid. Alterations in its activity can influence serum uric acid levels, which are associated with conditions such as gout, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases (Sato2010Renal). 

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), SLC22A7 expression is significantly reduced, and low expression levels are linked to poor overall survival and disease-free survival. This suggests that SLC22A7 could serve as a prognostic biomarker in ccRCC (Kang2020The). 

Additionally, the expression of SLC22A7 is down-regulated by hepatic growth factor, which is elevated in conditions like fulminant hepatic failure or liver cirrhosis, potentially impacting drug handling in these diseases (Koepsell2013The).

## Interactions
The SLC22A7 gene, encoding the organic anion transporter 2 (OAT2), is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. SLC22A7 is modulated by the microRNA hsa-miR-29a-3p, which targets the 3′-UTR of SLC22A7 mRNA, leading to reduced expression of the gene. This interaction is sequence-specific and has been confirmed through reporter gene assays and RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Yu2015Modulation).

SLC22A7 also participates in protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in drug uptake, particularly in the liver and kidney. These interactions can affect the expression and stability of the transporter, influencing drug pharmacokinetics and potential drug-drug interactions (Zhang2019Proteinprotein).

Additionally, SLC22A7 is involved in the transport of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and interacts with enzymes such as guanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase, which are involved in cGMP regulation. This transporter can facilitate both the uptake and efflux of cGMP, distinguishing it from other efflux transporters (Cropp2008Organic). These interactions highlight the role of SLC22A7 in modulating intracellular cGMP levels and its potential impact on cellular signaling pathways.
