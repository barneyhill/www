# CSNK1A1

## Overview
The CSNK1A1 gene encodes the protein casein kinase 1 alpha 1 (CK1α), a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. CK1α is involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB pathways, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses (Jiang2018Casein). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in multiple cellular compartments, such as the nucleus, centrosome, and endoplasmic reticulum, reflecting its diverse functional roles (Jiang2018Casein). CK1α is also implicated in the DNA damage response and mRNA metabolism, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling and homeostasis (Carreras2013Systems; Jiang2018Casein). The gene's expression and mutations are associated with various diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders, making it a significant focus for therapeutic research (Liu2021Csnk1a1; Jiang2018Casein).

## Structure
The CSNK1A1 gene encodes the protein casein kinase 1 alpha 1 (CK1α), a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. The primary structure of CK1α consists of a polypeptide chain with 337 amino acids, with the kinase domain spanning from Ile12 to Ala282 (Jiang2018Casein). The secondary structure of CK1α includes a β-hairpin loop formed by the first 93 amino acids, which is involved in binding to the CRL4 CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitination and degradation (Jiang2018Casein). The tertiary structure of CK1α features a bilobal kinase domain with a β-sheet-rich N-terminal lobe and an α-helical C-terminal lobe (Shafie2021Identification). The ATP binding site is located at Lys46, and the active site is at Asp136 (Shafie2021Identification).

CK1α is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is crucial for its function in various signaling pathways (Liu2002Control). The CSNK1A1 gene expresses four alternatively spliced transcript variants, resulting in different protein isoforms that vary by specific amino acid inserts in the kinase domain and near the C terminus (Jiang2018Casein). These isoforms contribute to the diverse functional roles of CK1α in cellular processes.

## Function
Casein kinase 1 alpha 1 (CK1α), encoded by the CSNK1A1 gene, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in numerous cellular processes essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. CK1α plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by phosphorylating β-catenin, which leads to its ubiquitination and degradation, thus preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Jiang2018Casein). It is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly in the G1-S transition, by phosphorylating CDC25A and promoting the degradation of c-myc (Jiang2018Casein).

CK1α is active in various cellular compartments, including the cell membrane, nucleus, centrosome, microtubules, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum, indicating its widespread functional significance (Jiang2018Casein). It is involved in mRNA metabolism by localizing at nuclear speckles and modifying small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) (Jiang2018Casein). CK1α also plays a role in the immune response by phosphorylating components of the NF-κB pathway, which can modulate immune responses and inflammation (Jiang2018Casein).

In addition to its role in cellular signaling, CK1α is involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in embryonic stem cells, where it regulates apoptosis and Wnt signaling in response to genotoxic stress (Carreras2013Systems).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CSNK1A1 gene, which encodes the protein kinase CK1α, are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, CK1α acts as a tumor suppressor in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Altered expression levels of CSNK1A1 are linked to different cancer prognoses, especially in colorectal cancer, where low levels may contribute to tumorigenesis, and overexpression correlates with poor survival outcomes (Jiang2018Casein). CK1α is also highly expressed in glioma tissues, with its overexpression associated with poorer patient outcomes, suggesting its role in glioma pathogenesis (Liu2021Csnk1a1). In glioblastoma multiforme, CSNK1A1 overexpression promotes cell proliferation, while its inhibition reduces tumor cell viability and enhances sensitivity to radiotherapy (Liu2021Csnk1a1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, CK1α is involved in the phosphorylation of proteins related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It phosphorylates β-secretase and tau protein in Alzheimer's, contributing to disease pathology, and α-synuclein in Parkinson's, which aggregates in Lewy bodies (Jiang2018Casein). These roles highlight the clinical significance of CSNK1A1 in both cancer and neurodegenerative conditions, making it a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CSNK1A1, or casein kinase 1 alpha 1, is involved in numerous protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It is a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation (Jiang2018Casein). In the Hedgehog signaling pathway, CSNK1A1 phosphorylates Gli transcription factors, promoting their proteolysis (Jiang2018Casein). It also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, targeting it for degradation through interactions with MDM2 and MDM4 (Jiang2018Casein).

CSNK1A1 is involved in the regulation of autophagy by phosphorylating autophagy-related proteins such as LC3B and GABARAPs through the transcription factor FOXO3A (Jiang2018Casein). It also phosphorylates DEPTOR, an mTOR inhibitor, affecting mTOR signaling and autophagy (Jiang2018Casein). In the context of cancer, CSNK1A1 phosphorylates proteins like histone demethylase 1A (KDM1A) and Rap guanine exchange factor 2 (RAPGEF2), which are crucial for glioblastoma and breast cancer metastasis, respectively (Jiang2018Casein).

CSNK1A1's interactions extend to the NF-κB signaling pathway, where it phosphorylates TNF receptors and RIP1, influencing NF-κB activation (Jiang2018Casein). These interactions highlight CSNK1A1's role in cellular signaling and homeostasis.
