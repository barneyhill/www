# PPP1R3B

## Overview
The PPP1R3B gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3B, a crucial regulatory component of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is primarily involved in glycogen metabolism. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit, facilitating the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase, thereby promoting glycogen synthesis and storage in the liver (Mehta2017Hepatic). As a metabolic regulator, PPP1R3B plays a significant role in maintaining glucose homeostasis by modulating the balance between glycogen storage and lipid metabolism, particularly during fasting and feeding states (Creasy2023PPP1R3B). The gene's expression is responsive to nutritional states, and its activity is linked to various metabolic health indicators, including fasting plasma glucose levels and glycemic traits (Uehara2024mTORC1). Variants in PPP1R3B have been associated with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, underscoring its clinical significance (Niazi2019Increased).

## Function
The PPP1R3B gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which plays a crucial role in glycogen metabolism in the liver. This protein is involved in the regulation of glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase, promoting glycogen synthesis and inhibiting glycogen breakdown (Mehta2017Hepatic). PPP1R3B facilitates the dephosphorylation and activation of GS by recruiting PP1 to glycogen, thus enhancing glycogen storage in the liver (Mehta2017Hepatic). 

In healthy human cells, PPP1R3B acts as a metabolic switch, shifting hepatic energy storage from lipids to glycogen. This function is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis, particularly during fasting, by storing glucose as glycogen and utilizing it when needed (Creasy2023PPP1R3B). The gene's expression is induced by feeding and is necessary for proper glycogen storage, which is crucial for systemic glucose homeostasis (Uehara2024mTORC1). 

PPP1R3B is primarily active in the liver, where it plays a significant role in regulating glycogen levels and maintaining energy balance during fasting and feeding states. Its activity is linked to glycemic traits, such as fasting plasma glucose levels, and is associated with metabolic health (Uehara2024mTORC1; Mehta2017Hepatic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPP1R3B gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in metabolic disorders. Variants in PPP1R3B are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and are linked to elevated HbA1c levels, altered fat distribution, and increased LDL-cholesterol levels among carriers (Niazi2019Increased). These variants may lead to reduced activity of the PPP1R3B/PP1 complex, resulting in decreased glycogen synthesis and increased plasma glucose levels (Niazi2019Increased).

Alterations in PPP1R3B expression also impact hepatic energy storage, shifting it from lipids to glycogen. Overexpression of PPP1R3B in mice results in increased liver glycogen content and improved glucose disposal, while deletion leads to reduced glycogen stores and rapid fasting hypoglycemia (Creasy2023PPP1R3B). These changes are linked to conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance (Creasy2023PPP1R3B).

The gene's role in glucose metabolism is further underscored by its association with glycemic traits in genome-wide association studies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders (Mehta2017Hepatic).

## Interactions
PPP1R3B, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is involved in several critical protein interactions. It interacts with glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP), playing a significant role in glycogen metabolism by promoting glycogen synthesis and inhibiting glycogenolysis through dephosphorylation (Mehta2017Hepatic; Creasy2023PPP1R3B). PPP1R3B recruits PP1 to GS, facilitating its dephosphorylation and activation, which is crucial for glycogen storage (Mehta2017Hepatic).

In the context of cell cycle regulation, PPP1R3B mediates the association between PP1 and Greatwall kinase (Gwl). It enhances the interaction between PP1 and Gwl, which is essential for the dephosphorylation of Gwl at Ser-883, a critical step for mitotic exit. This interaction is cell cycle-dependent, with PPP1R3B binding to unphosphorylated Gwl during interphase (Ren2017Cell). The dissociation and re-association of PPP1R3B with Gwl during mitotic transitions regulate Gwl activity, influencing mitotic entry and exit (Ren2017Cell).

These interactions highlight PPP1R3B's role as a molecular scaffold, facilitating the regulation of glycogen metabolism and cell cycle progression through its interactions with key proteins.
