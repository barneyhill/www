# PLA2G12B

## Overview
PLA2G12B is a gene that encodes the protein phospholipase A2 group XIIB, a member of the secreted phospholipase A2 family. Unlike other phospholipases, the protein encoded by PLA2G12B is catalytically inactive due to a substitution of a critical histidine residue with leucine, which alters its enzymatic function (Murakami2011Recent). Despite its lack of traditional phospholipase activity, phospholipase A2 group XIIB plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Thierer2024Pla2g12b). The protein is characterized by its membrane-binding properties and calcium-dependent interactions, which are essential for its function in lipid homeostasis and its potential impact on cardiovascular health (Thierer2024Pla2g12b). Mutations in the PLA2G12B gene have been associated with altered lipid levels and resistance to atherosclerosis, highlighting its clinical significance in lipid-related disorders (Thierer2024Pla2g12b).

## Structure
PLA2G12B is a member of the secreted phospholipase A2 family, characterized by specific structural features that influence its function. The primary structure of PLA2G12B includes an amino-terminal signal peptide and a carboxy-terminal ER-retention motif (KDEL), which suggests its retention within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Thierer2024Pla2g12b). The protein also contains hydrophobic A and B domains, which are indicative of membrane-binding properties (Thierer2024Pla2g12b). These domains are adjacent to each other on the protein surface, separate from the calcium-binding domain, as predicted by AlphaFold (Thierer2024Pla2g12b).

The secondary structure of PLA2G12B is not explicitly detailed in the available context, but the presence of hydrophobic domains suggests potential alpha-helical regions that facilitate membrane interaction. The tertiary structure is implied by the spatial arrangement of functional domains, which include a conserved calcium-binding motif and an essential cysteine residue (Thierer2024Pla2g12b).

PLA2G12B is catalytically inactive, differing from other phospholipases due to a leucine replacing the catalytic histidine, which affects its enzymatic activity (Murakami2011Recent). The protein is not secreted into the bloodstream but is retained within the ER, where it interacts with key components of the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein assembly pathway (Thierer2024Pla2g12b).

## Function
PLA2G12B is a member of the phospholipase A2 enzyme family, although it lacks traditional phospholipase activity. It plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the expansion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. PLA2G12B facilitates the incorporation of triglycerides into nascent APOB-containing lipoproteins, which is essential for the production and secretion of TRLs (Thierer2024Pla2g12b). 

The protein is localized to the ER membrane, where it interacts with key components of the TRL assembly pathway, such as APOB and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the membrane association of MTP, thereby promoting efficient lipid transfer to TRLs (Thierer2024Pla2g12b). PLA2G12B's function is calcium-dependent, with its calcium-binding domain playing a significant role in lipid partitioning between lipid droplets and TRLs (Thierer2024Pla2g12b).

In healthy human cells, PLA2G12B is involved in lipid homeostasis by ensuring efficient lipid transport and preventing excess intracellular lipid accumulation. Its activity is linked to resistance to atherosclerosis, suggesting a balance between triglyceride transport and cardiovascular disease risk (Thierer2024Pla2g12b).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PLA2G12B gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease. In mice, mutations in PLA2G12B result in hypolipidemia, characterized by lower serum triglycerides and cholesterol levels, which may confer resistance to atherosclerosis (Thierer2024Pla2g12b). Human genome-wide association studies have linked polymorphisms in the PLA2G12B promoter with plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels, suggesting a genetic association with serum lipid levels (Thierer2024Pla2g12b).

Alterations in PLA2G12B expression can impact hepatic triglyceride metabolism and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion. In mice lacking the Pla2g12b gene, there is an accumulation of large lipid droplets in the liver, indicating impaired VLDL-TG secretion, which is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis (Chen2019Estrogen‐related). The gene's expression is regulated by nuclear receptors such as ERRγ and FXR, which influence lipid metabolism pathways. For instance, FXR activation reduces PLA2G12B expression, leading to decreased serum triglyceride levels and hepatic VLDL secretion, highlighting its potential role in managing hyperlipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Liu2016Activation).

These findings underscore the potential of targeting PLA2G12B expression as a therapeutic strategy for lipid-related disorders and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
PLA2G12B is involved in several interactions critical for triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) biogenesis. It interacts with core components of the TRL assembly pathway, including apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) subunits. These interactions facilitate the lipidation of nascent TRLs within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen (Thierer2022Pla2g12b; Thierer2024Pla2g12b). PLA2G12B acts as a scaffold protein, recruiting MTP and calcium to the lumenal face of the ER membrane, enhancing lipid transfer to nascent TRLs (Thierer2022Pla2g12b).

PLA2G12B is retained within the ER due to an amino-terminal signal peptide and a carboxy-terminal ER-retention motif (KDEL), and it is found exclusively in membrane fractions, indicating its membrane-binding properties (Thierer2024Pla2g12b). The protein's calcium-binding domain is crucial for its function, as calcium enhances the lipidation of ApoB, promoting TRL expansion (Thierer2024Pla2g12b). In PLA2G12B mutants, there is a reduced association of MTP with the ER membrane, highlighting PLA2G12B's role in concentrating MTP along the ER membrane for efficient TRL biogenesis (Thierer2024Pla2g12b). These interactions underscore PLA2G12B's essential role in lipid metabolism and its potential impact on cardiovascular health.
