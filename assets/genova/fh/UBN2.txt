# UBN2

## Overview
UBN2, or ubinuclein 2, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The protein ubinuclein 2 is a key component of the HIRA complex, which is responsible for the deposition of the histone variant H3.3 at cis-regulatory elements, such as promoters and enhancers, in embryonic stem cells. This process is crucial for transcriptional regulation during cell differentiation, particularly in neural progenitor cells (Xiong2018UBN12). Ubinuclein 2 interacts specifically with H3.3, facilitating its deposition at active genomic regions, and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Xiong2018UBN12). Additionally, UBN2 has been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer, where it is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhao2019UBN2).

## Function
UBN2 (ubinuclein 2) is a nuclear protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is a component of the HIRA complex, which is responsible for the deposition of the histone variant H3.3 at cis-regulatory elements, such as promoters and enhancers, in mouse embryonic stem cells. This process is essential for transcriptional regulation during cell differentiation, particularly in neural progenitor cell differentiation (Xiong2018UBN12).

UBN2 specifically recognizes and binds to H3.3, facilitating its deposition at active genomic regions. This interaction is crucial for the activation of developmental genes and is involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression (Xiong2018UBN12). UBN2, along with UBN1, forms part of the HIRA complex, which operates independently of the histone chaperone Asf1a, indicating a unique pathway for H3.3 deposition (Xiong2018UBN12).

In addition to its role in chromatin dynamics, UBN2 is implicated in cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation, influencing organismal outcomes like neural development. Its activity in the nucleus underscores its importance in maintaining proper gene expression and cellular function (Xiong2018UBN12).

## Clinical Significance
The Ubinuclein 2 (UBN2) gene has been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) due to its role in promoting tumor growth and metastasis. UBN2 is significantly upregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, and this upregulation is associated with advanced clinical stages, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. High expression levels of UBN2 correlate with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival in CRC patients (Zhao2019UBN2). The gene promotes tumor progression through the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation, adhesion, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (Zhao2019UBN2).

Research has shown that UBN2 is a direct target of microRNA-802 (miR-802), which acts as a tumor suppressor in CRC. MiR-802 is frequently downregulated in CRC tissues, and its low expression is linked to poorer tumor grade and worse patient outcomes. Overexpression of miR-802 suppresses CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by targeting UBN2, while UBN2 overexpression can reverse these effects, highlighting its tumor-promoting role (p&gt; MicroRNA802; Yang2020&lt). These findings suggest that UBN2 could serve as a potential biomarker for predicting CRC prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
UBN2, a component of the HIRA complex, plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It interacts with the histone variant H3.3, facilitating its deposition at cis-regulatory elements in mouse embryonic stem cells. UBN2, along with UBN1, specifically recognizes and binds to H3.3, which is crucial for gene transcription regulation during cell differentiation (Xiong2018UBN12). The HIRA complex, which includes UBN2, HIRA, and Cabin1, is the first chaperone identified to specifically bind and deposit H3.3 (Xiong2018UBN12).

UBN2 forms distinct complexes with HIRA, and these complexes are responsible for the deposition of H3.3 at both euchromatin and heterochromatin regions. Despite their co-localization, UBN1 and UBN2 do not physically interact with each other, even in the presence of HIRA, suggesting that they form independent complexes with HIRA (Xiong2018UBN12). UBN2's interaction with H3.3 is mediated by specific amino acid residues, and mutations in these residues can disrupt this interaction, highlighting their importance in the recognition and deposition of H3.3 (Xiong2018UBN12).
