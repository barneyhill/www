# STX11

## Overview
STX11 is a gene that encodes the protein syntaxin 11, a member of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) family, which is integral to vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion processes. Syntaxin 11 is distinct from other syntaxins due to its lack of a C-terminal transmembrane domain, instead relying on a cysteine-rich C-terminus for membrane association through acylation (Kinoshita2019Syntaxin; Tang2015A). This protein is predominantly expressed in immune cells, where it plays a critical role in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules in natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells, as well as in the transport of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in macrophages (Kinoshita2019Syntaxin; Marsh2010STX11). Mutations in STX11 are linked to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 4 (FHL4), a severe immune disorder characterized by impaired NK cell function and excessive immune activation (Müller2014An; Marsh2010STX11). Additionally, STX11 has been implicated in peripheral T-cell lymphomas, where it may function as a tumor suppressor (Yoshida2015STX11).

## Structure
Syntaxin 11 (STX11) is a member of the SNARE protein family, which plays a crucial role in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. Unlike other syntaxins, STX11 lacks a C-terminal transmembrane domain for membrane anchorage. Instead, it has a cysteine-rich C-terminus that undergoes acylation, allowing it to associate with membranes (Kinoshita2019Syntaxin; Tang2015A). 

The primary structure of STX11 includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. Notably, it contains an N-terminal Habc domain, which is critical for binding to Munc18-2, a protein necessary for the exocytosis process in cytotoxic lymphocytes (Müller2014An). The Habc domain is located in the α-helical strand of the protein (Müller2014An).

STX11 forms part of a unique SNARE complex, interacting with proteins such as SNAP-23 and VAMP, which are involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules and platelet granules (Tang2015A). This interaction is crucial for the final fusion step of granule exocytosis at the plasma membrane, highlighting its role in the quaternary structure of the SNARE complex (Tang2015A). 

Post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation, are significant for its membrane association and function (Kinoshita2019Syntaxin).

## Function
Syntaxin 11 (STX11) is a SNARE protein that plays a critical role in intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly in immune cells. It is involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules in natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells, which are essential for targeting and destroying infected or malignant cells (Marsh2010STX11). Syntaxin 11 is also implicated in the exocytosis of neutrophil granules, indicating a broader role in immune cell function (Marsh2010STX11).

In macrophages, STX11 is crucial for the transport of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to the plasma membrane, a process essential for recognizing microbial components and inducing immune responses. This transport is regulated in a stimulus-dependent manner, particularly in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and involves interaction with SNAP-23, another SNARE protein (Kinoshita2019Syntaxin). STX11 facilitates the fusion of vesicles carrying TLR4 with the plasma membrane, ensuring proper immune signaling (Kinoshita2019Syntaxin).

Mutations in STX11 can lead to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 4 (FHL4), characterized by impaired NK cell function and severe immune activation (Müller2014An; Marsh2010STX11).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STX11 gene are associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 4 (FHL4), a severe systemic inflammatory condition characterized by impaired natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte function. These mutations lead to defects in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion, resulting in uncontrolled immune activation and inflammation (Hellewell2014Analysis; zur2005Linkage). Specific mutations, such as Leu194ProfsX2, result in a truncated protein lacking the SNARE domain, crucial for protein-protein interactions in vesicular membrane fusion events, leading to a loss of function (Danielian2009Novel). 

In addition to FHL4, alterations in STX11 expression have been implicated in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), where STX11 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Loss of STX11 expression is associated with increased proliferation of T-cell lines and poorer prognosis in PTCL cases, often linked with hemophagocytic syndrome (Yoshida2015STX11). The STX11 gene's role in these conditions highlights its importance in immune system regulation and the potential for targeted therapies in related diseases (Yoshida2015STX11).

## Interactions
Syntaxin 11 (STX11) is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in immune cell function. It interacts with Munc18-2, a protein essential for vesicle fusion, particularly in the context of cytotoxic lymphocyte exocytosis. This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), as it aids in the docking and fusion of lytic granules at the immunological synapse (Müller2014An; Halimani2013Syntaxin11). 

STX11 also forms part of a SNARE complex with SNAP-23, which is involved in the transport of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to the plasma membrane in macrophages. This interaction is important for the immune response, as it regulates the transport of TLR4 in a stimulus-dependent manner (Kinoshita2019Syntaxin). 

In NK cells, STX11 interacts with SNAP23, although this interaction can be disrupted by certain familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 4 (FHL-4) mutations. Despite these mutations, STX11 maintains its ability to bind Munc18-2, highlighting the importance of the N-terminal region for this interaction (Hellewell2014Analysis). 

STX11's interactions are not limited to stable complexes; it also participates in more transient interactions that regulate immune cell functions, such as macrophage phagocytosis (Zhang2008Syntaxin‐11).
