Deficiency of the muscle-specific enzyme is apparently a common cause of exercise-induced myopathy and probably the most common cause of metabolic myopathy in the human. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified in this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2010].", "symbol": "AMPD1", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1412387"}, "unigene": "Hs.89570", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P23109", "TrEMBL": "A0A1B0GTL6"}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "AMP deaminase"}}
