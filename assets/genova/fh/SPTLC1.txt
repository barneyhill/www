# SPTLC1

## Overview
The SPTLC1 gene encodes the serine palmitoyltransferase long chain base subunit 1, a critical component of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme complex. This enzyme is integral to the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids, which are essential components of eukaryotic cell membranes and play significant roles in cell signaling, apoptosis, and stress responses (Lone2022SPTLC1; Hanada2003Serine). The SPTLC1 protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and at ER-mitochondria contact sites, where it forms a complex with SPTLC2 and other regulatory proteins (Lone2022SPTLC1; Aaltonen2021Serine). Mutations in the SPTLC1 gene have been implicated in various neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1) and juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), due to their impact on sphingolipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Rotthier2011Characterization; Mohassel2024Serine).

## Structure
The SPTLC1 gene encodes a subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme, which is crucial for sphingolipid biosynthesis. The SPT enzyme complex is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and at ER-mitochondria contact sites, typically consisting of two SPTLC1-SPTLC2 dimers that interact with accessory subunits ssSPTa/b and regulatory ORMDL proteins (Lone2022SPTLC1; Aaltonen2021Serine). The SPTLC1 protein includes several domains, such as the N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD), which is essential for its interaction with ORMDL proteins and integration into the ER membrane (Lone2022SPTLC1). 

The TMD plays a key role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the SPTLC1 protein, and variants in this domain can impair interactions with ORMDL proteins, leading to altered sphingolipid synthesis (Lone2022SPTLC1). The protein's structure is characterized by its interaction with other proteins and its role in the synthesis of sphingolipids, with specific amino acids in the TMD being crucial for its function and regulation (Lone2022SPTLC1). The SPTLC1-SPTLC2 interface is critical for catalytic activity, and variants affecting this interface can lead to pathogenic outcomes (Rochat2024Functional).

## Function
The SPTLC1 gene encodes a subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme complex, which is crucial for the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids (SLs) in human cells. SPT catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in this process by conjugating palmitoyl-CoA with L-serine in a pyridoxal 5-phosphate-dependent reaction (Lone2022SPTLC1). This enzyme complex is typically composed of SPTLC1-SPTLC2 dimers and interacts with accessory subunits ssSPTa/b and regulatory ORMDL proteins, which act as lipid sensors that negatively regulate SPT activity (Lone2022SPTLC1). 

In healthy cells, SPTLC1 is involved in maintaining the balance of sphingolipid metabolism, which is crucial for proper organelle function and cellular homeostasis (Parthibane2019Sptlc1). Sphingolipids are essential components of eukaryotic cell membranes and play vital roles in cell signaling, apoptosis, and stress responses (Hanada2003Serine). The SPT enzyme complex resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and at ER-mitochondria contact sites, highlighting its role in cellular lipid metabolism and homeostasis (Lone2022SPTLC1). SPTLC1's function is intrinsic to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors, and its absence triggers compensatory stress-induced hematopoiesis (Parthibane2019Sptlc1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPTLC1 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1) and juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). HSAN1 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by early-onset sensory neuropathy and variable motor neuropathy. It is primarily caused by missense mutations in SPTLC1, such as p.C133W and p.C133Y, which lead to a toxic gain-of-function in serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) activity. This results in the production of neurotoxic 1-deoxysphingolipids, which disrupt axonal and myelin stability (Rotthier2011Characterization; Mohassel2024Serine).

Juvenile ALS linked to SPTLC1 is caused by gain-of-function variants that lead to unrestrained SPT activity and overproduction of canonical sphingolipids. This condition manifests with motor neuron dysfunction, such as spasticity and weakness, without sensory symptoms (Mohassel2024Serine). Certain SPTLC1 variants, like p.S331F, are associated with severe phenotypes, including early-onset insensitivity to pain and motor impairment (Rotthier2011Characterization; SUH2013Earlyonset). The presence of these mutations can disrupt the interaction of SPTLC1 with ORMDL proteins, affecting sphingolipid synthesis and contributing to the disease mechanisms (Lone2022SPTLC1).

## Interactions
SPTLC1, a subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme, interacts with several proteins that influence its function and regulation. It forms a complex with SPTLC2 and ORMDL proteins, which are crucial for the regulation of sphingolipid synthesis. ORMDL proteins act as negative regulators of SPT activity, and their interaction with SPTLC1 is essential for feedback inhibition by ceramides. Pathogenic variants of SPTLC1, such as S331F, L39del, F40S41del, and ex2del, disrupt this interaction, leading to increased sphingolipid synthesis and altered lipid signatures (Lone2022SPTLC1; Lone2022SPTLC1a).

SPTLC1 also interacts with the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), negatively regulating its trafficking and cholesterol efflux activity. This interaction is significant in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Inhibition of SPTLC1, either through myriocin or siRNA knockdown, enhances ABCA1 activity by disrupting the SPTLC1-ABCA1 complex, thereby increasing cholesterol efflux (Tamehiro2008SPTLC1). These interactions highlight the role of SPTLC1 in both sphingolipid metabolism and cholesterol regulation, with implications for diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1) (Lone2022SPTLC1a).
