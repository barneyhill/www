# SIRPD

## Overview
The SIRPD gene encodes the signal regulatory protein delta, a member of the signal regulatory protein (SIRP) family, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is involved in cellular signaling processes and is characterized as a transmembrane receptor. Signal regulatory proteins, including SIRPD, play crucial roles in the regulation of immune responses and cellular communication. The SIRPD protein is implicated in various cellular functions, including modulation of immune cell activity and maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
