# PCK1

## Overview
The PCK1 gene encodes the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PEPCK-C), a pivotal cytosolic enzyme involved in metabolic pathways such as gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis. As a key regulatory enzyme, PEPCK-C catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, a critical step in the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, thereby playing an essential role in maintaining glucose homeostasis during fasting or stress (Yu2021Phosphoenolpyruvate). Beyond its gluconeogenic function, PEPCK-C is involved in cataplerosis and amino acid metabolism, contributing to cellular growth and proliferation (Yu2021Phosphoenolpyruvate). The enzyme's activity is finely regulated by post-translational modifications, including acetylation and phosphorylation, which modulate its function in response to the cell's metabolic needs (LatorreMuro2018Dynamic). PCK1's interactions with various proteins further underscore its role in complex metabolic networks, influencing conditions such as diabetes and cancer (Shao2021Association).

## Function
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1) is a critical enzyme in gluconeogenesis, primarily active in the liver, kidney, and intestine, where it catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the cytosol. This reaction is the first and rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis, essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis, especially during fasting or stress, by converting non-carbohydrate substrates like lactate and amino acids into glucose (Yu2021Phosphoenolpyruvate). PCK1 also plays a role in glyceroneogenesis, particularly in adipose tissue, contributing to the triglyceride/fatty acid cycle and influencing plasma triglyceride levels (Yu2021Phosphoenolpyruvate).

In addition to its role in gluconeogenesis, PCK1 is involved in cataplerosis, diverting TCA cycle intermediates into the cytosol, and participating in amino acid metabolism, notably in the serine biosynthetic pathway. This function is crucial for cell growth and proliferation, as serine is a key substrate for one-carbon metabolism, nucleotide synthesis, and antioxidation (Yu2021Phosphoenolpyruvate). PCK1's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, which modulate its function between gluconeogenic and anaplerotic reactions, allowing it to adapt to the cell's energy status (LatorreMuro2018Dynamic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCK1 gene, which encodes the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PEPCK-C), are associated with a rare metabolic disorder known as cytosolic PEPCK deficiency (PCKDC). This autosomal recessive condition is characterized by symptoms such as hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, liver dysfunction, and abnormal excretion of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites in the urine (Oishi2020Novel; Vieira2021Cytosolic). Patients with PCKDC often experience hypoglycemic episodes, particularly after fasting or physical exertion, which can lead to severe outcomes like hypoglycemic coma and seizures (Vieira2021Cytosolic). 

The deficiency is linked to various mutations in the PCK1 gene, including missense variants and deletions that affect the enzyme's stability and function (Adams2014Three; Santra2016Cytosolic). These mutations can lead to impaired gluconeogenesis, resulting in metabolic disturbances such as low ketone levels and elevated liver transaminase values (Vieira2021Cytosolic). 

Alterations in PCK1 expression have also been implicated in metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). PCK1 deficiency can promote hepatic lipid accumulation and fibrosis through the activation of the PI3K/AKT/PDGF axis, contributing to the development of MAFLD (Ye2023Deficiency).

## Interactions
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1) interacts with several proteins that modulate its activity and stability through post-translational modifications. PCK1 is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300, which enhances its anaplerotic activity and reduces its gluconeogenic function under high glucose conditions (LatorreMuro2018Dynamic). The deacetylase SIRT1 counteracts this modification by deacetylating PCK1, thereby restoring its gluconeogenic activity (LatorreMuro2018Dynamic).

PCK1 also interacts with GSK3b, which is involved in its phosphorylation. This phosphorylation increases PCK1's ubiquitination and degradation, indicating a regulatory mechanism that controls protein turnover (LatorreMuro2018Dynamic). Additionally, PCK1 has been identified as an AKT-dependent protein kinase that interacts with INSIG1/2 proteins, leading to the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and promoting lipogenesis (Shao2021Association).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving PCK1, which is modulated by acetylation, phosphorylation, and protein-protein interactions, impacting its role in metabolic pathways and conditions such as diabetes and cancer (LatorreMuro2018Dynamic).
