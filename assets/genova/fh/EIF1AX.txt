# EIF1AX

## Overview
EIF1AX is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A X-linked, a protein essential for the initiation phase of eukaryotic translation. This protein plays a critical role in the assembly of the pre-initiation complex, facilitating the binding of the small ribosomal subunit to mRNA and ensuring accurate start codon recognition, which is vital for proper protein synthesis. The EIF1AX protein is characterized by a conserved oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold, which interacts with the 40S ribosomal subunit, and is involved in maintaining the fidelity of translation initiation. Mutations in the EIF1AX gene have been implicated in various cancers, including thyroid cancers and uveal melanoma, highlighting its clinical significance in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (KüstersVandevelde2016SF3B1; Krishnamoorthy2019EIF1AX; Etemadmoghadam2017EIF1AX).

## Structure
The EIF1AX protein is a crucial component of the eukaryotic translation initiation process, characterized by a highly conserved amino acid sequence across species, including humans and yeast, indicating its essential role in protein synthesis (Etemadmoghadam2017EIF1AX). The primary structure of EIF1AX includes specific amino acid sequences that are subject to mutations, particularly in cancer contexts (Karunamurthy2016Prevalence).

The secondary structure of EIF1AX features an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold, which is a central domain in the protein. This domain is involved in binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit, interacting with 18S rRNA and ribosomal proteins (Etemadmoghadam2017EIF1AX). The protein also contains a helical subdomain and unstructured N- and C-terminal tails (NTT and CTT), which play roles in translation initiation and start codon selection (Karunamurthy2016Prevalence).

The tertiary structure of EIF1AX is not detailed in the context, but the presence of structured domains like the OB fold suggests a complex three-dimensional conformation. The quaternary structure is not explicitly described, but EIF1AX's role in the pre-initiation complex implies interactions with other proteins.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in proteins like EIF1AX, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. Splice variant isoforms, such as the A113splice variant, have been identified, affecting the protein's function in translation initiation and cancer progression (Krishnamoorthy2019EIF1AX).

## Function
EIF1AX, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A X-linked, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the initiation phase of eukaryotic translation. This protein is pivotal in the assembly of the pre-initiation complex, a critical step in the translation process where the small ribosomal subunit binds to mRNA. EIF1AX facilitates this binding, ensuring that the ribosome is correctly positioned to recognize the start codon on the mRNA, which is essential for the accurate initiation of protein synthesis. This process is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function and growth, as it influences the overall protein synthesis within the cell.

The EIF1AX protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it performs its role in translation initiation. By ensuring the fidelity of start codon recognition, EIF1AX contributes to the precise regulation of gene expression at the translational level. This regulation is vital for cellular homeostasis and the proper functioning of various biological processes. The activity of EIF1AX in translation initiation underscores its importance in cell biology, as it directly impacts the synthesis of proteins necessary for cell growth and proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EIF1AX gene are implicated in various cancers, notably thyroid cancers and uveal melanoma. In thyroid cancers, EIF1AX mutations are found in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). These mutations often co-occur with RAS mutations in advanced thyroid cancers, suggesting a cooperative role in tumorigenesis. The EIF1AX-A113splice mutation is particularly prevalent in advanced thyroid cancers and is associated with increased protein synthesis and tumor progression through the stabilization of c-MYC and activation of mTOR signaling (Krishnamoorthy2019EIF1AX).

In uveal melanoma, EIF1AX mutations are linked to a less aggressive form of the disease and often co-occur with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. These mutations are frequently found in tumors with disomy for chromosome 3 (KüstersVandevelde2016SF3B1; Martin2013Exome).

EIF1AX mutations are also present in benign thyroid conditions, such as follicular adenomas and hyperplastic nodules, but their presence, especially when combined with other mutations like RAS, TP53, and TERT promoter mutations, is associated with a higher risk of malignancy (Gargano2021Characterization; Karunamurthy2016Prevalence).

## Interactions
The EIF1AX protein is a critical component of the ribosomal preinitiation complex (PIC) and is involved in several key interactions that facilitate translation initiation. It acts synergistically with eIF1 to enhance the scanning ability of the 48S PIC and is essential for selecting the cognate AUG initiation codon. The structure of EIF1AX includes a central domain with an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold, which binds in the A site of the 40S ribosomal subunit and interacts with 18S rRNA and ribosomal proteins uS12 (S23) and eS30 (S30) (Etemadmoghadam2017EIF1AX).

The N-terminal tail (NTT) of EIF1AX inhibits the scanning-competent conformation of the PIC and stabilizes the locked conformation of initiator tRNA in the P site of the 40S subunit by interacting with ribosomal protein eS31, mRNA, rRNA, and the anticodon stem loop (ASL) of tRNAi (Etemadmoghadam2017EIF1AX). Mutations in EIF1AX, such as the A113splice variant, have been shown to increase the affinity for translation initiation factors like EIF2α and the PIC component EIF5, suggesting that these mutants stabilize the PIC and enhance protein synthesis (Krishnamoorthy2019EIF1AX). These interactions underscore the role of EIF1AX in maintaining the fidelity and efficiency of translation initiation.
