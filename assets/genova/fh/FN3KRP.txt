# FN3KRP

## Overview
The FN3KRP gene encodes the fructosamine-3 kinase-related protein, a member of the kinase family involved in glucose metabolism and the prevention of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) formation. This protein is structurally similar to fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) and plays a crucial role in protecting proteins from non-enzymatic glycation, a process that can lead to AGE accumulation. AGEs are associated with various degenerative diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. FN3KRP is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the deglycation process, helping to maintain protein function and cellular homeostasis. The gene's polymorphisms, such as rs1046875 G>A, have been linked to protective effects against diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, as well as recurrent pregnancy loss, highlighting its significance in metabolic regulation and disease prevention (Kwon2022Genetic; Beeraka2021The).

## Function
The FN3KRP gene encodes the fructosamine-3 kinase-related protein, which plays a significant role in glucose metabolism and the prevention of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) formation. This protein shares about 65% structural similarity with fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) and is involved in protecting proteins from non-enzymatic glycation, a process that can lead to the formation of AGEs. AGEs are implicated in various degenerative diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which share common risk factors with pregnancy disorders (Kwon2022Genetic).

FN3KRP is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the deglycation process, which helps in the removal of fructosamines from proteins. This activity is crucial for maintaining protein function and preventing the accumulation of AGEs, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Beeraka2021The). The FN3KRP isoform of FN3K may help protect proteins from glycation, potentially reducing the risk of conditions associated with AGE formation (Kwon2022Genetic). The gene's polymorphism, particularly rs1046875 G>A, has been associated with protective effects against diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, suggesting its role in maintaining normal glucose metabolism and platelet formation in healthy human cells (Kwon2022Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FN3KRP gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, particularly those related to glucose metabolism and pregnancy. The FN3KRP rs1046875 G>A polymorphism has been linked to elevated levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which is a marker of long-term glucose levels in the blood. Elevated HbA1c is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and platelet dysfunction in diabetes mellitus (Kwon2022Genetic). This polymorphism affects the binding affinity of miR-34a, a microRNA involved in suppressing angiogenesis and glucose metabolism, potentially influencing the development of cardiometabolic diseases (Kwon2022Genetic).

In the context of pregnancy, the FN3KRP rs1046875 G>A variant has been studied for its role in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Research indicates that the AA genotype of this polymorphism may have a protective effect against RPL, as it is less frequently observed in women with RPL compared to healthy controls. This protective association is particularly significant in cases with multiple pregnancy losses (Kwon2022Genetic). The FN3KRP gene's involvement in reducing advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) may contribute to its protective role, as AGEs are implicated in various degenerative diseases (Kwon2022Genetic).
