# ADRB1

## Overview
The ADRB1 gene encodes the beta-1 adrenergic receptor, a critical component of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is predominantly expressed in cardiac tissue. This receptor plays a vital role in the cardiovascular system by mediating the physiological effects of catecholamines, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, thereby regulating heart rate and cardiac contractility (Taylor2006Pharmacogenetics; Post1999βADRENERGIC). Structurally, the ADRB1 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitate its function in signal transduction (SorianoUrsúa2013Recent). Beyond its cardiac functions, ADRB1 is also involved in energy metabolism, particularly in human brown adipose tissue, where it regulates thermogenic activity and lipolysis (RiisVestergaard2019Beta1). The gene's polymorphisms, such as Arg389Gly and Ser49Gly, have been associated with various cardiovascular conditions, influencing both disease risk and treatment efficacy (Pacanowski2008Adrenergic; Nicoulina2010Association).

## Structure
The ADRB1 (adrenoceptor beta 1) protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs. The primary structure of ADRB1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form these helices, which are integral to its function in signal transduction (SorianoUrsúa2013Recent). The tertiary structure includes distinct extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains, which are crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation (SorianoUrsúa2013Recent).

The ADRB1 receptor has specific structural features that influence its function. The second extracellular loop is significant in defining the entrance of ligands to the binding pocket, and docking simulations suggest that the binding pocket closes upon ligand arrival (SorianoUrsúa2013Recent). The third intracellular loop contains a proline-rich region that affects the potency of isoproterenol for activating adenylyl cyclase (SorianoUrsúa2013Recent).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a critical role in the receptor's function. The Arg-389 variant of ADRB1 is hyperphosphorylated, which affects its activation speed and efficacy in cAMP formation (Ahles2015Interhelical). This variant also shows faster activation kinetics compared to the Gly-389 variant, attributed to increased phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment (Ahles2015Interhelical).

## Function
The ADRB1 gene encodes the beta-1 adrenergic receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor predominantly expressed in cardiac tissue. This receptor plays a crucial role in the cardiovascular system by mediating the effects of catecholamines, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, which are essential for regulating heart rate and cardiac contractility (Taylor2006Pharmacogenetics; Post1999βADRENERGIC). Upon activation, ADRB1 stimulates the Gs protein, leading to the conversion of ATP to cAMP by adenylate cyclase. This process increases calcium cycling, enhancing both systolic and diastolic cardiac function (Taylor2006Pharmacogenetics).

In addition to its role in the heart, ADRB1 is also involved in human brown adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism. It is the predominant adrenergic receptor in human BAT, where it regulates thermogenic activity and lipolysis. Stimulation of ADRB1 in brown adipocytes increases the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and glycerol release, indicating its significant role in energy metabolism (RiisVestergaard2019Beta1). These functions highlight ADRB1's importance in maintaining circulatory homeostasis and energy balance in the body.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the ADRB1 gene, which encodes the beta-1 adrenergic receptor, have been associated with various cardiovascular conditions. The Arg389Gly polymorphism is linked to increased cardiovascular risk, particularly in women without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), where Gly389 carriers are at heightened risk for myocardial infarction and heart failure (Pacanowski2008Adrenergic). This polymorphism also influences the efficacy of beta-blocker treatments, as it affects receptor desensitization and response to these medications (Telles2023Non‑synonymous).

The Ser49Gly variant of ADRB1 is associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), with a significant prevalence of the heterozygous Ser49Gly genotype in individuals with AF compared to controls, suggesting it may serve as a genetic predictor for AF development (Nicoulina2010Association). This variant is also linked to susceptibility to agonist-promoted downregulation, which may contribute to ventricular arrhythmias (Nicoulina2010Association).

In heart failure patients, the Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly polymorphisms have been studied for their potential role as biomarkers for arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death risk, although findings have been mixed and further research is needed to confirm these associations (Telles2023Non‑synonymous).

## Interactions
The human β1-adrenoceptor (ADRB1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function. ADRB1 interacts with β-arrestin2 (ARRB2), a key player in receptor internalization and signaling. Phosphorylation of specific serine residues, particularly Ser461 and Ser462 in the C-terminus of ADRB1, is critical for the recruitment of ARRB2. Mutations at these sites significantly impair ARRB2 recruitment, affecting receptor internalization (Hinz2017Two).

ADRB1 also interacts with G protein-coupled receptor-associated sorting proteins (GASPs). Different GASP family members show varying interaction strengths with ADRB1, with GASP-1, -2, and -3 exhibiting strong interactions, while GASP-7 shows weaker interactions (Bornert2013Identification).

The Arg389Gly polymorphism in ADRB1 affects its interaction with β-arrestins in cardiac myocytes. The Arg389 variant interacts with both β-arrestin 1 (βarr1) and β-arrestin 2 (βarr2), while the Gly389 variant only interacts with βarr1. This differential binding influences the receptor's signaling and response to β-blockers, with the Arg389 variant showing enhanced procontractile function due to its interaction with βarr2 (McCrink2016β).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of ADRB1, involving phosphorylation and specific protein interactions that modulate its signaling pathways.
