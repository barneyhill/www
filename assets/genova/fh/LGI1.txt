# LGI1

## Overview
The LGI1 gene encodes the leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) protein, which is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. LGI1 is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and epitempin (EPTP) domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins, such as ADAM22 and ADAM23, forming complexes essential for synaptic function (Yamagata2019Insights; Yamagata2018Structural). As a secreted protein, LGI1 is involved in maintaining synaptic stability and regulating the expression of ion channels and receptors critical for cognitive and neurological functions (Ramberger2020Distinctive). Mutations in the LGI1 gene are associated with neurological disorders, including autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE), highlighting its clinical significance (Kalachikov2002Mutations; MoranteRedolat2002Mutations).

## Structure
The LGI1 protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and epitempin (EPTP) domains, which are crucial for its structural stability and function. The LRR domain consists of central five LRR repeats flanked by N- and C-terminal caps, contributing to the protein's ability to interact with other molecules (Yamagata2019Insights). The EPTP domain forms a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, with each blade composed of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. This structure is stabilized by a unique disulfide bond and coordinated calcium ion, resembling a WD40 domain (Yamagata2019Insights; Yamagata2018Structural).

The LGI1 protein can form a 2:2 heterotetramer complex with ADAM22, involving interactions between the LRR and EPTP domains and the ectodomain of ADAM22 (Yamagata2018Structural). Specific residues in the LRR domain form hydrogen bonds with the EPTP domain of another LGI1 molecule and with the disintegrin domain of ADAM22, highlighting the importance of these interactions in the protein's function (Yamagata2018Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, are present in LGI1, affecting its secretion and function. Glycosylation sites are located on the LRR and EPTP domains, influencing the protein's surface properties and ligand-binding capabilities (Leonardi2011A).

## Function
The LGI1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. In healthy human cells, the LGI1 protein is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons, and is involved in maintaining synaptic stability. It interacts with the trans-synaptic complex formed by the pre- and postsynaptic receptors ADAM22 and ADAM23, which is crucial for synaptic function (Ramberger2020Distinctive). This interaction helps regulate the expression of presynaptic Kv1.1 channels and postsynaptic AMPA receptors, which are essential for normal cognitive and neurological functions (Ramberger2020Distinctive).

LGI1 is also involved in cell-cell communication, potentially influencing neuronal cell migration and axon growth-cone guidance, similar to other leucine-rich repeat (LRR) containing proteins (Kalachikov2002Mutations). The protein's structure includes LRRs, which are typically involved in ligand binding or protein-protein interactions, indicating its role in signal transduction pathways (Kalachikov2002Mutations). Additionally, LGI1 is implicated in synaptic plasticity and neuronal communication, which are essential for learning and memory processes (Ramberger2020Distinctive). The protein's expression is asymmetric in the brain, with higher levels in the left globus pallidus, suggesting a role in brain asymmetry and development (Jang2018LGI1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LGI1 gene are linked to several neurological conditions, most notably autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) and autosomal-dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF). These conditions are characterized by seizures that often include auditory symptoms, such as auditory auras or aphasic seizures (Kalachikov2002Mutations; Gu2002LGI1; MoranteRedolat2002Mutations). 

In ADLTE, mutations in LGI1 lead to premature stop codons, resulting in truncated proteins that are implicated in the disease. These mutations are absent in healthy populations, underscoring their pathogenic role (MoranteRedolat2002Mutations). The LGI1 gene is located on chromosome 10q24 and is expressed predominantly in neurons, particularly in brain regions associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (Kalachikov2002Mutations). 

The clinical phenotype of ADLTE includes a mean age of onset at 21.6 years, with seizures that are generally mild and respond well to treatment (Michelucci2003Autosomal). Genetic heterogeneity is noted, as some families with similar phenotypes do not have mutations in LGI1, suggesting the involvement of other genes (Michelucci2003Autosomal; MoranteRedolat2002Mutations). 

LGI1 mutations are also associated with haploinsufficiency, where a single functional copy of the gene is insufficient for normal function, contributing to the development of epilepsy (Kalachikov2002Mutations).

## Interactions
LGI1 (leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1) is a protein that participates in various interactions critical for synaptic function and neuronal signaling. LGI1 forms a complex with the transmembrane proteins ADAM22 and ADAM23, which are essential for synaptic transmission. This interaction is mediated by the EPTP domain of LGI1 binding to the disintegrin domain of ADAM22, forming a tripartite complex with PSD-95, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein (Fukata2006EpilepsyRelated; Fukata2010Disruption). LGI1 also interacts with the Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1), competing with Nogo66 for the same binding site, which is significant in modulating neuronal growth by antagonizing inhibitory signals from myelin (Thomas2010LGI1).

LGI1 is involved in synaptic complexes that include Kv1 channel subunits and MAGUKs, and it interacts with proteins like PSD93, PSD95, SAP97, and SAP102 at synaptic sites (RamirezFranco2022Patientderived). It also associates with presynaptic proteins such as rabphilin-3A and CASK-binding proteins Lin7A and 7C, and is linked to G-protein signaling through LANC2 (RamirezFranco2022Patientderived). The protein's interactions extend to cytoskeletal proteins, including microtubule-associated proteins, tubulins, and tau, as well as lipid raft proteins and myelin proteome components in oligodendrocytes (RamirezFranco2022Patientderived). These interactions highlight LGI1's role in maintaining synaptic integrity and function.
