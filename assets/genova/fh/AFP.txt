# AFP

## Overview
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a gene that encodes the alpha-fetoprotein, a glycoprotein primarily produced during fetal development by the liver, yolk sac, and gastrointestinal tract. The AFP gene is located on chromosome 4q13.3 and plays a crucial role in the transport of various ligands, including estrogens, fatty acids, and metal ions, due to the protein's high affinity for these substances (Gillespie2000Structure). Alpha-fetoprotein is structurally similar to human serum albumin and is characterized by its high α-helical content and lack of β-structure, which contributes to its functional versatility (Terentiev2006Structural). The protein is involved in immunosuppression, particularly during pregnancy, by modulating the maternal immune response to the developing embryo (Gillespie2000Structure). Clinically, AFP is significant as a biomarker for certain cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, and its levels can be indicative of various pathological conditions (Sauzay2016Alphafoetoprotein).

## Structure
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass ranging from 68 to 73 kDa, depending on its carbohydrate content, which constitutes approximately 4% of the molecule (Terentiev2006Structural). The mature human AFP consists of 591 amino acid residues, following the cleavage of an 18-residue peptide from the immature form (Terentiev2006Structural). The primary structure of AFP shows a 39% identity with serum albumin, with the highest similarity in domain II (48%) (Terentiev2006Structural; Morinaga1983Primary).

AFP is characterized by a high α-helical content, with up to 65-67% of its structure composed of α-helices, and it lacks β-structure (Terentiev2006Structural). The protein is organized into three homologous domains (I, II, and III), each consisting of two globular subdomains linked by disulfide bonds (Terentiev2006Structural). Domain II is flexible and considered a 'hinge region,' promoting interactions with ligands and other proteins (Terentiev2006Structural).

The tertiary structure of AFP is U-shaped, with three regions of electron-dense contour masses. Domains I and III are rigid, while domain II is more flexible, corresponding to a molten globule form (Terentiev2006Structural). AFP contains 15 disulfide bridges, contributing to its structural stability (Gillespie2000Structure). The protein also exhibits micro-heterogeneity due to differences in glycosylation, with one glycosylation site at Asn233 (Terentiev2006Structural; Gillespie2000Structure).

## Function
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a significant plasma protein involved in various molecular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily produced by the fetal liver, yolk sac, and gastrointestinal tract during embryonic development. AFP plays a crucial role in the transport of various substances, including estrogens, fatty acids, bilirubin, and metal ions like Cu2+ and Ni2+, due to its high affinity binding to these ligands (Gillespie2000Structure). This transport function is essential for regulating cell multiplication and metabolism, as well as modulating immune responses (Gillespie2000Structure).

AFP is structurally similar to human serum albumin, sharing about 40% sequence homology, and is characterized by its ability to undergo conformational changes, which are crucial for its function (Gillespie2000Structure). The protein's structure is described as 'V-shaped' with three distinct domains, facilitating the binding or release of potential ligands (Gillespie2000Structure). AFP's immunosuppressive activity is notable, as it interacts with macrophages and T-lymphocytes, potentially helping to suppress the mother's immune response to the developing embryo (Gillespie2000Structure; Terentiev2006Structural). This immunoregulatory function is modulated by the ligand composition and is thought to involve a molten globule-like conformation of the protein (Gillespie2000Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AFP gene can lead to various clinical conditions. Hereditary persistence of alpha-fetoprotein (HP-AFP) is associated with mutations in the HNF-1 binding sites of the AFP gene promoter, resulting in elevated AFP levels in adults. This condition can mimic germ cell cancer and testicular dysfunction in males, and cause endocrine dysfunctions such as exaggerated bone growth and precocious puberty in females (mizejewski2012congenital). In contrast, congenital deficiency of alpha-fetoprotein (CD-AFP) involves mutations that introduce stop codons in the AFP gene, leading to low AFP levels. While CD-AFP is generally benign, it can complicate cancer monitoring in adults and is associated with pregnancy complications like pre-eclampsia and low birthweight (mizejewski2012congenital).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AFP overexpression is linked to various genetic and epigenetic changes, including low methylation of the AFP promoter and mutations in transcriptional regulators like ZBTB20 and ZHX2 (Xu2021The). AFP plays a role in tumor progression by inhibiting apoptosis, promoting cell proliferation, and enhancing invasion and metastasis through pathways such as PI3K/AKT (Zheng2020Effects). Elevated AFP levels are also used as a diagnostic marker for HCC and other cancers (Sauzay2016Alphafoetoprotein).

## Interactions
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is known to interact with various proteins, influencing cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. AFP interacts with caspase-3, a crucial enzyme in the apoptotic pathway, inhibiting its activity and thereby blocking apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This interaction is selective, as AFP does not bind to caspase-8, and is confirmed through techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis (Li2009Alpha; Lin2017Structural).

AFP also interacts with cell cycle proteins, particularly through its third domain (AFP-3D). Specific peptides derived from AFP-3D, known as growth inhibitory peptides (GIPs), downregulate cell cycle proteins like cyclin E and SKP2, preventing the transition from G1 to S-phase. These peptides also maintain cytosolic levels of cyclin inhibitors such as p21, affecting the S-phase to G2-phase transition (Mizejewski2016The).

AFP contains potential heterodimerization motifs that may interact with nuclear receptors and transcription factors, similar to those found in the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily. These motifs suggest that AFP could function as a transcription-associated protein or co-factor, potentially influencing transcriptional regulation (Dauphinée2002Human).
