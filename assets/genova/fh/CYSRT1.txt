# CYSRT1

## Overview
CYSRT1, also known as C9orf169, is a human gene that encodes the cysteine-rich tail 1 protein, which is characterized by its high cysteine content. This protein is hypothesized to be involved in redox reactions and structural stability due to its cysteine-rich domains, which are often associated with cellular signaling, protein-protein interactions, and metal ion binding. These functions are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The CYSRT1 protein is part of the p53 core transcriptional program and is activated by compounds such as actinomycin D and Nutlin-3a, indicating its potential role in cellular stress responses and tumor suppression pathways (Rusin2024The). Additionally, CYSRT1 interacts with proteins involved in antimicrobial activity, suggesting a role in immune defense mechanisms (Rusin2024The). While the precise biological functions and interactions of CYSRT1 are still under investigation, its involvement in various cellular processes and potential implications in cancer biology underscore its significance in human health and disease (Bard2022Multimodal; Alotaibi2023Global).

## Function
CYSRT1 (cysteine rich tail 1) is a human gene encoding a protein notable for its high cysteine content, which suggests potential involvement in redox reactions or structural stability. Proteins with cysteine-rich domains are often implicated in cellular signaling, protein-protein interactions, and metal ion binding. These functions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, which is essential for the overall health of an organism. The specific molecular processes and cellular roles of CYSRT1 are still under investigation, but it is hypothesized that the protein may play a role in these pathways due to its structural characteristics. The presence of cysteine-rich domains typically indicates a capacity for engaging in complex molecular interactions, which can influence various cellular processes. While the exact cellular location and detailed functions of CYSRT1 remain to be fully elucidated, its structural properties suggest it may contribute to the stability and function of cellular components, potentially impacting organismal health through these mechanisms. The ongoing research aims to clarify the precise biological activities and interactions of CYSRT1 within human cells.

## Clinical Significance
CYSRT1 has been implicated in various cancers through alterations in its expression levels. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), CYSRT1 is among the differentially expressed genes that exhibit an opposite expression trend in normal esophageal tissues compared to ESCC tissues, suggesting its potential role in the disease (Alotaibi2023Global). Although the specific clinical significance of CYSRT1 in ESCC is not detailed, its differential expression pattern indicates it may be crucial in the progression of this cancer type (Alotaibi2023Global).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), elevated expression of CYSRT1 is associated with better median survival outcomes. The B1 cluster, characterized by high CYSRT1 expression, shows improved survival rates compared to other clusters, indicating a positive correlation between CYSRT1 expression and overall survival in HNSC patients (Bard2022Multimodal). This suggests that CYSRT1 could serve as a prognostic biomarker in HNSC, aiding in the classification of tumor subtypes and potentially guiding therapeutic interventions (Bard2022Multimodal). The gene's role in these cancers highlights its importance in understanding tumor biology and developing targeted treatments.

## Interactions
CYSRT1, also known as C9orf169, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular interactions. The CYSRT1 protein is part of the p53 core transcriptional program and is strongly activated by actinomycin D and Nutlin-3a. It has a high p53 expression score, with the p53 protein binding to both its promoter and enhancer (Rusin2024The). 

CYSRT1 is known to interact with protein members of the LCE group, which are small cationic epidermal proteins with antimicrobial properties. This interaction suggests a role for CYSRT1 in antibacterial activity, particularly against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Rusin2024The). 

In the context of toxicological studies, CYSRT1 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene in response to repeated exposures to ultrafine particles, with a fold change of 2.50. This suggests that CYSRT1 may be involved in pathways associated with inflammation, AHR signaling, and cell cycle processes, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids were not detailed (Sotty2019Toxicological). 

While CYSRT1 is included in the protein-protein interaction network related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, specific details about its interactions within this network are not provided (Amanatidou2020Construction).
