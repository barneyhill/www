# ADAMTS3

## Overview
ADAMTS3 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 3, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family. This protein is a secreted metalloprotease involved in the proteolytic activation of pro-VEGF-C, a critical process for lymphangiogenesis, which is the formation of lymphatic vessels (Mead2018ADAMTS). The ADAMTS3 protein is characterized by a modular structure, including a metalloproteinase catalytic domain and thrombospondin type 1 motifs, and is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling (Tang2001ADAMTS:; Takeda2016ADAM). It plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of the lymphatic system, contributing to fluid balance, immune function, and fat absorption (Zhong2019A). Mutations in the ADAMTS3 gene have been linked to Hennekam lymphangiectasia-lymphedema syndrome, underscoring its importance in normal physiological processes and its potential involvement in pathological conditions (Brouillard2017Loss; Shinwari2023In-silico).

## Structure
The ADAMTS3 protein is part of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a modular structure. It includes a signal sequence at the N-terminus, followed by a prodomain with a furin cleavage site consensus (RX(K/R)R), a metalloproteinase catalytic domain with a reprolysin-type Zn-binding motif, and a conserved methionine forming the 'met-turn' (Tang2001ADAMTS:; PORTER2005The). The catalytic site consensus HEXXH indicates its catalytic activity (Tang2001ADAMTS:). Following the protease domain is a disintegrin-like domain, similar to snake venom disintegrins, although its interaction with integrins is not confirmed (Tang2001ADAMTS:). The protein also features thrombospondin type 1 (TSP-1) motifs, a cysteine-rich domain, and a spacer domain (Tang2001ADAMTS:; Takeda2016ADAM).

ADAMTS3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including disulfide bonding, N- and O-glycosylation, C-mannosylation, and O-fucosylation (Dubail2015Insights). The protein is secreted and lacks a transmembrane domain, distinguishing it from most ADAM proteins (Tang2001ADAMTS:). The ADAMTS3 protein is involved in the processing of fibrillar procollagens and VEGF-C activation, playing a role in collagen biosynthesis and lymphangiogenesis (Shinwari2023In-silico; Dubail2015Insights).

## Function
ADAMTS3 is a crucial protease involved in the proteolytic activation of pro-VEGF-C, a process essential for lymphangiogenesis, which is the formation of lymphatic vessels. This activation is vital for the proper development and function of the lymphatic system, particularly in forming organized lymphatic networks (Mead2018ADAMTS). ADAMTS3 interacts with the N-terminal domain of collagen and calcium-binding EGF domain 1 (CCBE1), which is also critical for lymphangiogenesis (Mead2018ADAMTS). The protein's activity is necessary for the excision of propeptides from VEGF-C, enabling its maximal activation of VEGFR3, a receptor involved in lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation (Mead2018ADAMTS).

In healthy human cells, ADAMTS3 plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of the lymphatic system, contributing to fluid balance, immune function, and fat absorption (Zhong2019A). It is also involved in the regulation of placental angiogenesis and is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, lung, cartilage, and brain (Zhong2019A). Loss of ADAMTS3 activity has been associated with Hennekam lymphangiectasia-lymphedema syndrome, highlighting its importance in normal physiological processes (Zhong2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADAMTS3 gene are associated with Hennekam lymphangiectasia–lymphedema syndrome 3 (HKLLS3), a rare genetic disorder characterized by lymphatic dysplasia, intestinal lymphangiectasia, severe lymphedema, and distinctive facial features (Brouillard2017Loss; Shinwari2023In-silico). Specific mutations, such as c.503 T > C; p.Leu168Pro (L168P) and c.872 T > C; p.Ile291Thr (I291T), have been identified as damaging, leading to abnormal cleavage and secretion of the ADAMTS3 protein. These mutations result in the intracellular accumulation of the protein, preventing its normal processing and secretion, which is crucial for the activation of VEGF-C, a growth factor essential for lymphangiogenesis (Brouillard2017Loss).

The absence or dysfunction of ADAMTS3 disrupts the VEGFR3 signaling pathway, which is vital for the development of the lymphatic vasculature. This disruption is linked to the clinical manifestations of Hennekam syndrome, including primary lymphedema (Brouillard2017Loss). In silico studies have identified several high-risk non-synonymous SNPs in ADAMTS3 that may destabilize the protein, further contributing to the pathogenesis of related disorders (Shinwari2023In-silico). These findings underscore the importance of ADAMTS3 in maintaining lymphatic system function and its potential role in other pathological conditions, such as cancer and metastasis (Janssen2015ADAMTS3).

## Interactions
ADAMTS3 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various biological processes. It is involved in the proteolytic activation of the pro-lymphangiogenic factor VEGF-C, a process facilitated by its interaction with the protein CCBE1. The N-terminal domain of CCBE1 assists in binding pro-VEGFC to VEGFR3, while ADAMTS3 performs the actual cleavage necessary for VEGF-C activation (Brouillard2017Loss; Dubail2015Insights). This interaction is critical for effective lymphangiogenesis, as mutations in ADAMTS3 can impair this process, leading to conditions such as primary lymphedema (Brouillard2017Loss).

ADAMTS3 also forms a complex with alpha2-macroglobulin, a universal inhibitor of endoproteinases. This interaction is essential for the proteolytic activity and secretion of ADAMTS3, as it forms covalent complexes with proteolytically active proteins (Brouillard2017Loss). Additionally, ADAMTS3 has been identified as interacting with cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and connective tissue growth factor (CCN2), indicating a broader pattern of protein-protein interactions within the ADAMTS family (Dennler2023Phylogenetic). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of ADAMTS3 in extracellular matrix remodeling and its involvement in various physiological processes.
