# CELF3

## Overview
CELF3, or CUGBP Elav-like family member 3, is a gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein predominantly expressed in the nervous system. The CELF3 protein is characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are essential for its role in RNA processing activities such as pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, and translation regulation (Dasgupta2011The). Notably, CELF3 is involved in the formation of nuclear bodies known as CS bodies, where it interacts with long non-coding RNAs and other proteins, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Ishizuka2014Formation). The protein's unique structural features, including a linker domain with polyglutamine sequences, facilitate its localization and function within these nuclear bodies (Ishizuka2014Formation). CELF3's activity is crucial for neuronal differentiation and function, influencing processes such as synaptic plasticity and memory formation, thereby underscoring its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Dasgupta2011The).

## Structure
CELF3, a member of the CELF family of RNA-binding proteins, contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that are crucial for its function. These RRMs are involved in binding to RNA sequences, with the second and third RRMs connected by a linker domain that includes polyglutamine sequences. This linker domain is essential for the localization of CELF3 to CS bodies, a type of RNA-dependent nuclear body, independent of the RRMs (Ishizuka2014Formation). The linker region shows weak homology to DUF630, a domain of unknown function, suggesting a potential role in nucleic acid binding (Ishizuka2014Formation).

The CELF3 protein is known to have multiple isoforms, as indicated by the detection of various forms or degraded products in Neuro2A cells and adult brain samples (Ishizuka2014Formation). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CELF3, as well as information on post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available literature. The protein's role in RNA binding and regulation is primarily facilitated by its RRMs and the unique linker domain, which contribute to its functional specificity within the CELF family.

## Function
CELF3 (CUGBP Elav-like family member 3) is an RNA-binding protein primarily expressed in the nervous system, where it plays a significant role in RNA processing, including pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, and translation regulation (Dasgupta2011The). CELF3 is involved in the formation of nuclear bodies, specifically CS bodies, in Neuro2A cells, where it interacts with the long non-coding RNA Gomafu and the protein SF1 (Ishizuka2014Formation). These interactions suggest a role in transcriptional regulation, as CS bodies are sensitive to transcriptional inhibition and RNase treatment (Ishizuka2014Formation).

CELF3's function in RNA processing is linked to its structural domains, particularly a linker region that is crucial for its localization to CS bodies, independent of its RNA recognition motifs (Ishizuka2014Formation). The protein is also implicated in neuronal differentiation and function, as its expression correlates with Gomafu during central nervous system development (Ishizuka2014Formation). CELF3's activity in neurons influences processes such as synaptic plasticity and memory formation, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Dasgupta2011The).

## Interactions
CELF3, a member of the CELF protein family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing. CELF3 was identified as a novel Gomafu-interacting protein through a custom siRNA library screen targeting RNA-binding proteins. It binds to the middle regions of the long non-coding RNA Gomafu, as demonstrated by CLIP analysis, although their subnuclear distributions differ (Ishizuka2014Formation). CELF3 and another Gomafu-binding protein, SF1, form distinct nuclear bodies called CS bodies in Neuro2A cells. These bodies are sensitive to transcriptional inhibition and RNase treatment, indicating their RNA dependency (Ishizuka2014Formation).

CELF3 also interacts with other RNAs such as 7SK and Malat1, but not significantly with 18S ribosomal RNA (Ishizuka2014Formation). In the context of alternative splicing, CELF3, also known as ETR3, influences the splicing of the α-actinin gene by promoting SM exon inclusion and NM exon skipping, often displacing polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) from its binding sites (GROMAK2003Antagonistic). These interactions highlight CELF3's role in regulating gene expression at multiple levels.
