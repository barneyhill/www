# CEP135

## Overview
CEP135 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 135, a critical component of the centrosome involved in centriole biogenesis and microtubule organization. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate interactions with other centrosomal proteins, playing a scaffolding role essential for maintaining centrosome integrity and function (Farooq2015A; Ohta2002Characterization). Centrosomal protein 135 is active throughout the cell cycle and is crucial for the recruitment of centrosomal linker proteins, ensuring proper centrosome cohesion and microtubule nucleation (Chu2022Mitotic; Ohta2002Characterization). Mutations in the CEP135 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including primary microcephaly and multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella, highlighting its importance in neurogenesis and fertility (Sha2017A; Hussain2012A). Additionally, dysregulation of CEP135 is implicated in cancer, where it contributes to centrosome amplification and chromosomal instability (Ganapathi2019CEP135).

## Structure
CEP135 is a centrosomal protein characterized by its extensive coiled-coil domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions and contribute to its role in microtubule organization. The protein is composed of 1,140 amino acids and includes several key domains: an N-terminal microtubule interacting domain (residues 1-190), a central CPAP interacting domain (50-460), and a C-terminal hsSAS-6 interacting domain (416-1140) (Farooq2015A). These domains facilitate its function as a scaffolding protein during centriole biogenesis.

The secondary structure of CEP135 is rich in α-helices, which are typical of coiled-coil proteins (Ohta2002Characterization). The protein also contains two leucine zipper motifs and three putative tyrosine phosphorylation motifs, suggesting potential sites for post-translational modifications (Ohta2002Characterization). 

CEP135 has at least two isoforms: the full-length CEP135 and a shorter isoform, CEP135 mini. The mini isoform is generated by alternative polyadenylation and includes only the first 233 amino acids, with a unique 16 amino acid tail (Ganapathi2019CEP135). This isoform diversity may influence the protein's function in centriole assembly and centrosome amplification.

## Function
CEP135 is a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining centrosome integrity and microtubule organization in healthy human cells. It is involved in centriole biogenesis and is presumed to have a scaffolding role, contributing to the structure and organization of the centrosome and microtubules (Hussain2012A). CEP135 is essential for the recruitment and stable loading of centrosomal linker proteins such as C-NAP1 and rootletin, which are critical for centrosome cohesion. Its absence leads to premature centrosome splitting and a reduction in pericentriolar material, affecting microtubule organization (Chu2022Mitotic).

CEP135 is active at the centrosome throughout the cell cycle, independent of the microtubule network, and is associated with the electron-dense material surrounding centrioles (Ohta2002Characterization). It interacts with proteins like SSX2IP and WDR8, forming a complex essential for centrosome assembly and function (Chu2022Mitotic). The protein's role in microtubule nucleation and stabilization is vital for mitotic spindle formation, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Ohta2002Characterization). Disruption of CEP135 function can lead to centrosomal and microtubule disorganization, impacting cell division and neurogenesis (Hussain2012A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP135 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. A specific mutation, c.970delC, results in a frameshift and premature termination codon, leading to primary microcephaly, a disorder characterized by reduced brain size and intellectual disability. This mutation disrupts centrosomal function, crucial for normal neurogenesis, and has been identified in affected individuals from consanguineous families in Pakistan (Hussain2012A). The mutation causes disorganized microtubule networks and fragmented centrosomes, contributing to the disease phenotype (Hussain2012A).

CEP135 mutations are also linked to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), a condition causing male infertility. A homozygous mutation in CEP135 was found to disrupt protein localization, affecting centriole and flagella structure, which is critical for sperm motility (Sha2017A).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, dysregulation of CEP135 isoforms contributes to centrosome amplification and chromosome mis-segregation. Elevated levels of the full-length CEP135 isoform are associated with increased centriole duplication, promoting tumor progression (Ganapathi2019CEP135). The balance between CEP135 isoforms is crucial for maintaining centrosome numbers, and its dysregulation is a feature in aggressive cancer subtypes (Ganapathi2019CEP135).

## Interactions
CEP135 is a centrosomal protein that engages in several critical interactions essential for centriole duplication and centrosome function. It directly interacts with Sas-6, playing a significant role in centriole-to-centrosome conversion by associating with proteins such as Ana1/Cep295 and Asterless/Cep152. These interactions are vital for establishing the centriole's competence for duplication in the subsequent cell cycle (Chu2022Mitotic).

CEP135 also interacts with the WD40 repeat-containing protein WDR8, which communicates with the centriolar satellite protein SSX2IP. This interaction is important for proper cell division, although the exact role of these proteins in centrosome structure is not fully understood (Chu2022Mitotic). In Xenopus laevis oocytes, CEP135 forms a stable complex with Ssx2ip and Wdr8, which is likely involved in preparing the egg cell for fertilization and rapid centrosome assembly during early development (Chu2022Mitotic).

In human cells, CEP135 is crucial for the recruitment of centrosomal linker proteins such as C-NAP1 and rootletin, which are essential for maintaining centrosome cohesion. The loss of CEP135 leads to a significant reduction in these proteins, resulting in compromised physical linkage between centrosomes and premature centrosome splitting (Chu2022Mitotic).
