# UBQLN2

## Overview
UBQLN2 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquilin 2, which is a member of the ubiquilin family involved in protein quality control and degradation pathways. Ubiquilin 2 is characterized as a shuttle protein that plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) by facilitating the delivery of polyubiquitylated proteins to the proteasome for degradation. This function is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins. The protein contains several structural domains, including a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which are crucial for its interactions with ubiquitin and proteasomes. Additionally, ubiquilin 2 is involved in autophagy and interacts with various proteins to regulate cellular processes such as stress response and protein quality control. Mutations in the UBQLN2 gene have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining neuronal health (Lin2021UBQLN; Deng2011Mutations; Hjerpe2016UBQLN2).

## Structure
UBQLN2, a member of the ubiquilin family, is characterized by several distinct structural domains that facilitate its role in protein degradation pathways. The protein contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which are crucial for its interactions with ubiquitin and proteasomes (Lin2021UBQLN). The UBL domain adopts a ubiquitin fold, which is essential for binding to proteasome subunits, while the UBA domain binds ubiquitin moieties (Chen2019Structure; Lin2021UBQLN).

UBQLN2 also features two Stress inducible 1 (STI1) domains, which are involved in interactions with HSP70-like proteins and play a role in chaperoning activities (Lin2021UBQLN). A unique proline-rich (PXX) domain is present in UBQLN2, where many ALS/FTD-linked mutations are located, although its exact function remains unclear (Lin2021UBQLN).

The protein can form dimers and trimers, but not higher-order oligomers or aggregates, as indicated by analytical ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography (Hjerpe2016UBQLN2). Post-translational modifications of UBQLN2 include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may influence its functional properties (Lin2021UBQLN). Splice variants of UBQLN2 may exist, potentially altering its functional characteristics (Lin2021UBQLN).

## Function
UBQLN2 is a crucial protein involved in maintaining protein homeostasis in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), where it acts as a shuttle factor, facilitating the delivery of polyubiquitylated proteins to the proteasome for degradation. This process is essential for the clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins, preventing cellular damage and dysfunction (Renaud2019Key; Hjerpe2016UBQLN2).

UBQLN2 also interacts with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) to manage protein aggregates, particularly under stress conditions. It binds to HSP70 and associated misfolded proteins, aiding in their disaggregation and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, independent of autophagy (Hjerpe2016UBQLN2).

In addition to its role in the UPS, UBQLN2 is involved in autophagy, particularly in the regulation of autophagosome acidification and the degradation of large protein complexes and organelles. It interacts with the V-ATPase proton pump to ensure proper autophagosome function, which is crucial for activating acid hydrolases that catabolize proteins (Lin2021UBQLN).

UBQLN2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular processes such as stress response and protein quality control, contributing to the overall maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Lin2021UBQLN; Renaud2019Key).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UBQLN2 gene are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These mutations are often found in the PXX repeat region of the gene and are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner, with males typically experiencing more severe symptoms (Lin2021UBQLN; Deng2011Mutations). The mutations lead to impaired protein degradation pathways, resulting in the accumulation of protein aggregates in neurons, which is a hallmark of these diseases (Lin2021UBQLN; Deng2011Mutations).

In ALS and ALS/FTD, UBQLN2 mutations cause the formation of ubiquilin2-positive inclusions in the spinal cord and brain, which are immunoreactive with proteins such as TDP-43 and p62, but not SOD1 (Deng2011Mutations). These inclusions are associated with axonal loss and astrocytosis, contributing to neurodegeneration (Deng2011Mutations). The mutations also disrupt the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy pathways, leading to impaired protein homeostasis and increased neuronal stress (Lin2021UBQLN; Renaud2019Key).

UBQLN2 mutations have been shown to cause cognitive deficits and motor neuron disease in animal models, mimicking human ALS-FTD (Le2016Motor). The pathogenic effects are thought to arise from a gain of toxic functions, as knockout models do not exhibit the same pathological changes (Wu2014Pathogenic).

## Interactions
UBQLN2 interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in protein quality control and cellular processes. It contains a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) and a ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA), which facilitate its interaction with the proteasome and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (Renaud2019Key). UBQLN2 interacts with the membrane protein LC3, promoting autophagosome formation and lysosomal fusion (Renaud2019Key). It also binds to epsin proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, indicating a role in endosomal-lysosomal trafficking (Lin2021UBQLN).

UBQLN2 is involved in stress granule (SG) formation and interacts with FUS-RNA complexes, preventing the liquid-to-solid transition of FUS and suppressing SG formation (Alexander2018Ubiquilin). It associates with SG components through its Sti1-like linker region and regulates the dynamics of molecular complexes in phase separation (Alexander2018Ubiquilin). UBQLN2 also interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), modulating protein-RNA interaction dynamics (Alexander2018Ubiquilin).

Mutations in UBQLN2, such as P506T, affect its interaction with the Hsp70-Hsp110 disaggregase complex, impairing the degradation of misfolded proteins (Lin2021UBQLN). These mutations also disrupt its binding with the S5a subunit of the proteasome, leading to the accumulation of insoluble aggregates (Lin2021UBQLN).
