# PPWD1

## Overview
PPWD1 is a gene that encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase domain and WD repeat containing 1, which is a member of the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. This protein is characterized by its multidomain structure, including an N-terminal WD40 domain and a C-terminal peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain. The WD40 domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, forming a beta-propeller structure that is crucial for complex assembly and signal transduction, while the PPIase domain facilitates protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues (Rajiv2018Structural). PPWD1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing as part of the spliceosome C complex, interacting with proteins such as PRPF8 and U5 snRNP 200 kDa (Rajiv2018Structural; Thapar2015Roles). Beyond its role in splicing, PPWD1 has been implicated in clinical conditions such as postmenopausal osteoporosis, where its expression levels may serve as a biomarker for disease risk (Qian2019PPWD1).

## Structure
PPWD1 is a multidomain cyclophilin protein characterized by an N-terminal seven-bladed WD40 domain and a C-terminal peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain (Rajiv2018Structural). The WD40 domain, spanning amino acids 80-453, is involved in protein-protein interactions and forms a beta-propeller structure, which is common in proteins that mediate complex assembly and signal transduction (Rajiv2018Structural). The PPIase domain, located between amino acids 490-645, facilitates protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues (Rajiv2018Structural).

The crystal structure of the PPWD1 isomerase domain was initially solved by the Structural Genomics Consortium, revealing a proline-mediated interaction between molecules in the asymmetric unit, a feature common in cyclophilin structures (Rajiv2018Structural). This interaction may contribute to the crystallizability and potential for higher-order aggregation in NMR studies (Rajiv2018Structural).

PPWD1 is highly abundant in the C complex of the spliceosome, where it interacts with PRPF8 and U5 snRNP 200 kDa, forming a neighborhood around the WD40 domain (Rajiv2018Structural). These interactions highlight the role of PPWD1 in spliceosomal function and its potential involvement in RNA-driven processes.

## Function
PPWD1 is a member of the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, which are involved in protein folding and function as molecular chaperones. In healthy human cells, PPWD1 plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression. It is a component of the spliceosome C complex, where it interacts with other spliceosomal proteins such as PRPF8 and U5 snRNP 200 kDa, suggesting a regulatory role in RNA splicing (Rajiv2018Structural). 

PPWD1 contains a C-terminal isomerase domain and an N-terminal WD40 domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions within the spliceosome (Davis2010Structural; Thapar2015Roles). Although PPWD1 exhibits peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, its specific substrate preferences and catalytic mechanisms in the context of splicing are not fully understood (Thapar2015Roles). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it is involved in the assembly and function of spliceosomal complexes, potentially influencing the splicing cycle and the regulation of gene expression (Adams2015Nuclear; Rajiv2018Structural).

## Clinical Significance
The PPWD1 gene has been implicated in the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), a condition characterized by bone loss and increased fracture risk due to estrogen deficiency. Research by Qian et al. identified PPWD1 as a potential key biomarker for PMO through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The study found that PPWD1 expression levels were significantly upregulated in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density (BMD) compared to those with high BMD, suggesting a link between altered PPWD1 expression and PMO occurrence (Qian2019PPWD1).

In premenopausal women, the expression of PPWD1 was significantly decreased in those with high BMD compared to those with low BMD, indicating that PPWD1 expression may be inversely related to BMD in different menopausal statuses (Qian2019PPWD1). These findings suggest that PPWD1 plays a role in bone metabolism and its altered expression could contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, particularly in postmenopausal women. The study highlights the potential of PPWD1 as a target for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention in PMO (Qian2019PPWD1).

## Interactions
PPWD1 is a multidomain cyclophilin that plays a significant role in the human spliceosome C complex. It interacts with several proteins within this complex, notably forming contacts with PRPF8 through its isomerase domain, particularly around the β7-α2 region (Rajiv2018Structural). The WD40 domain of PPWD1 is also involved in interactions, although the specific proteins it interacts with remain less clear (Rajiv2018Structural). 

PPWD1 is known to interact with the U5 snRNP 200 kDa protein, which is located near its WD40 domain, although they are separated by a distance of over 90 Å (Rajiv2018Structural). These interactions suggest that PPWD1 contributes to the structural organization and function of the spliceosomal complex (Rajiv2018Structural).

Despite its ability to bind certain peptides, PPWD1 does not exhibit peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity towards them, indicating a more complex role in protein interactions beyond catalysis (Thapar2015Roles). The interactions of PPWD1 within the spliceosome highlight its potential regulatory role in splicing, although the exact mechanisms and additional interacting partners remain to be fully elucidated (Adams2015Nuclear).
