# CNGB3

## Overview
The CNGB3 gene encodes the cyclic nucleotide gated channel subunit beta 3, a critical component of the cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels. These channels are integral membrane proteins that play a pivotal role in the phototransduction pathway, which is essential for color vision in humans. The CNGB3 protein, categorized as a transmembrane protein, forms a heterotetrameric complex with the CNGA3 subunit, facilitating the influx of cations in response to cyclic GMP. This process is crucial for the conversion of light signals into electrical signals in the retina. Mutations in the CNGB3 gene are predominantly associated with achromatopsia, a condition characterized by color blindness and other visual impairments, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal visual function (Michalakis2018Retinal; Kohl2004CNGB3; Kohl2000Mutations).

## Structure
The CNGB3 protein is a subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel, primarily involved in phototransduction in cone photoreceptors. The primary structure of CNGB3 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific residues such as R403 and R442 playing crucial roles in its function. R403 in the pore helix forms hydrogen bonds with pore-lining backbone carbonyl oxygens, while R442 in the S6 segment occludes the pore below the hydrophobic cavity gate (Zheng2021Structure).

The secondary structure of CNGB3 features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is essential for its role in the CNG channel. The quaternary structure of the CNGB3 protein involves its assembly with three CNGA3 subunits to form a heterotetrameric channel complex (Hu2023Conformational; matveev2008native).

CNGB3 contains a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) and a transmembrane domain, which are critical for its function in the channel. The CNBD undergoes conformational changes upon binding with cyclic nucleotides, which are crucial for channel gating (Hu2023Conformational).

## Function
The CNGB3 gene encodes the beta subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, which are essential for the phototransduction process in cone photoreceptor cells of the retina. These channels are non-selective cation channels that allow the passage of ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ and are activated by cyclic nucleotides like cGMP. In darkness, high levels of cGMP keep the channels open, allowing a 'dark current' of Na+ and Ca2+ that depolarizes the photoreceptor cells. Upon light stimulation, cGMP levels decrease, leading to the closure of CNG channels, hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor, and reduced glutamate release, which is crucial for transmitting visual information to the brain (Michalakis2018Retinal; Kohl2004CNGB3).

In healthy human cells, CNGB3, along with CNGA3, forms heteromeric channels that are part of the superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels. These channels are located in the plasma membrane of the outer segment of photoreceptors and are crucial for maintaining an inward current in darkness or dim light. CNGB3 does not form functional channels on its own but requires co-expression with CNGA3 to form channels that display properties typical of native CNG channels (Ma2013Loss; Maguire2017CNGB3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CNGB3 gene are primarily associated with achromatopsia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by total color blindness, photophobia, reduced visual acuity, and nystagmus. This condition is linked to the ACHM3 locus on chromosome 8q21. CNGB3 mutations account for approximately 50% of achromatopsia cases, particularly in patients of European origin (Kohl2004CNGB3; Kohl2000Mutations). The most common mutation, c.1148delC, is responsible for over 70% of CNGB3 mutant alleles in these patients (Kohl2004CNGB3).

The CNGB3 gene encodes the beta-subunit of the cone photoreceptor cGMP-gated channel, and mutations often result in truncated polypeptides that lead to non-functional cone CNG channels (Kohl2004CNGB3; Kohl2000Mutations). Some mutations, such as S435F, are associated with specific populations, like the Pingelapese islanders, where it causes a high prevalence of achromatopsia known as Pingelapese blindness (Kohl2000Mutations).

In addition to achromatopsia, CNGB3 mutations have been linked to other retinal diseases, including macular degeneration and Stargardt's disease. These mutations can lead to a gain-of-function phenotype, altering CNG channel activity and contributing to photoreceptor dysfunction (Meighan2015Inherited).

## Interactions
The CNGB3 protein is a subunit of the cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel, which forms a heterotetrameric complex with the CNGA3 subunit. This interaction is crucial for the formation of functional CNG channels in cone photoreceptors, facilitating phototransduction by allowing the influx of cations in response to cyclic GMP (Kohl2000Mutations; matveev2008native). The CNGB3 subunit modulates the biophysical properties of the channel, although the alpha-subunit CNGA3 can form functional channels independently (Kohl2000Mutations).

Biochemical studies have demonstrated a direct interaction between CNGA3 and CNGB3, confirming the presence of heteromeric channel complexes in vivo (matveev2008native). Co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking experiments have shown that CNGA3 and CNGB3 form oligomeric complexes, including heterotetrameric structures (matveev2008native). Despite attempts to identify interactions with other proteins, no interaction was found between CNGA3 and the Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchanger NCKX2, suggesting a distinct mechanism for calcium homeostasis in cones (matveev2008native).

The CNGB3 subunit exhibits limited interaction with calmodulin (CaM) compared to CNGA3, indicating a specific, Ca2+-dependent interaction primarily involving CNGA3 (matveev2008native).
