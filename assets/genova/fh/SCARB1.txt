# SCARB1

## Overview
The SCARB1 gene encodes the scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-BI), a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. As a member of the CD36 superfamily, SR-BI is primarily involved in the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoproteins (HDL) into cells, facilitating reverse cholesterol transport and contributing to anti-atherosclerotic processes (Ma2020Differential; Sahebi2019Scavenger). The protein is characterized by its large extracellular loop, two transmembrane domains, and short cytoplasmic tails, which are essential for its function in lipid transport (Scarselli2002The; Sahebi2019Scavenger). SR-BI is expressed predominantly in the liver and steroidogenic tissues, where it is crucial for cholesterol delivery necessary for steroidogenesis and maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (Hu2010Cellular). Variants and mutations in the SCARB1 gene have been linked to alterations in lipoprotein profiles and cardiovascular disease risk, highlighting its clinical significance (GraciaRubio2021SRB1; Hu2022Functional).

## Structure
The SCARB1 gene encodes the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) protein, which is a member of the CD36 superfamily of membrane-bound glycoproteins. The primary structure of SR-BI consists of 509 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 57 kDa, although it appears as an 80-84 kDa protein due to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Stylianou2011Scavenger; Acton1994Expression). The protein features a large extracellular loop, two transmembrane domains, and short cytoplasmic tails at the N- and C-termini (Scarselli2002The; Sahebi2019Scavenger).

The extracellular domain is heavily glycosylated and contains disulfide bonds, contributing to its structural stability and ligand-binding capabilities (Scarselli2002The). SR-BI can form oligomers, such as dimers and tetramers, through interactions in the transmembrane and C-terminal regions, which are essential for its function in lipid transport (Stylianou2011Scavenger). The protein is also fatty acylated at specific cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic domain, which may influence its membrane association and function (Stylianou2011Scavenger).

Alternative splicing of SR-BI mRNA results in variants like SR-BII, which differ in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, potentially affecting their cellular localization and function (Sahebi2019Scavenger).

## Function
The SCARB1 gene encodes the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a crucial protein in cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis. SR-BI is primarily involved in the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoproteins (HDL) into cells, a process essential for reverse cholesterol transport. This mechanism allows excess cholesterol to be transported from peripheral tissues to the liver, where it is converted into bile acids for excretion, thereby reducing cholesterol levels in the body and exerting anti-atherosclerotic effects (Ma2020Differential; Sahebi2019Scavenger).

SR-BI is abundantly expressed in the liver and steroidogenic tissues, such as the adrenal glands, ovaries, and testicular Leydig cells, where it plays a vital role in cholesterol delivery for steroidogenesis (Hu2010Cellular). In hepatocytes, SR-BI mediates the uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL, crucial for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (Ma2020Differential). The receptor is also involved in the transfer of cholesterol from macrophages to HDL, reducing cholesterol storage in cells and lowering the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (Ma2020Differential).

SR-BI's function is regulated by various factors, including tropic hormones and accessory proteins like PDZK1, which enhance its activity in the liver (Hu2010Cellular). The receptor's activity is also influenced by signaling pathways, such as PI3K and PKC, and its expression can be affected by factors like oxidized LDL (Sahebi2019Scavenger).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SCARB1 gene, which encodes the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiovascular diseases. Variants in SCARB1 are associated with changes in lipoprotein profiles, influencing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. For example, the exon 1 variant (c.4G>A, p.(Gly2Ser)) is linked to increased HDL cholesterol (HDLc) and decreased LDL cholesterol (LDLc) levels, suggesting a reduced atherogenic profile (GraciaRubio2021SRB1). However, not all mutations are protective; the p.(Pro376Leu) mutation increases coronary artery disease (CAD) risk despite high HDLc levels, indicating that elevated HDL is not always protective against CVD (GraciaRubio2021SRB1).

Promoter variants such as rs144334493 and rs557348251 are associated with increased susceptibility to coronary heart disease (CHD) by affecting SCARB1 expression and cholesterol transport (Hu2022Functional). The rs144334493 variant, in particular, reduces SR-BI expression due to decreased binding of the transcription factor FOXA1, contributing to CHD risk (Hu2022Functional).

In addition to cardiovascular implications, SCARB1 mutations may also play a role in primary adrenal insufficiency, as SR-BI is crucial for cholesterol uptake necessary for glucocorticoid synthesis (Hoekstra2020Identification).

## Interactions
SCARB1, also known as scavenger receptor class B member 1, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in lipid metabolism and cellular processes. SCARB1 interacts with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, facilitating the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters and free cholesterol into cells without the degradation of HDL particles (Niemsiri2015Genetic). It also binds to other lipoproteins such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), playing a role in cholesterol efflux and anti-atherogenic functions (Niemsiri2015Genetic).

In the context of atherosclerosis, SCARB1 expression is regulated by the DNMT3b/SP1 pathway. DNMT3b interacts with the transcription factor SP1, forming a complex that decreases SP1's binding to the SCARB1 promoter, thereby inhibiting SCARB1 expression (Guo2020Homocysteine). This interaction is crucial for understanding the regulation of SCARB1 in foam cells and its role in lipid accumulation and atherosclerosis development (Guo2020Homocysteine).

SCARB1 is also involved in the regulation of macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, SCARB1-rich extracellular vesicles influence macrophage function by interacting with transcription factors such as KLF9, which modulates the expression of genes like HAAO and CYP1B1, affecting macrophage behavior and promoting tumor metastasis (Chen2023SCARB1).
