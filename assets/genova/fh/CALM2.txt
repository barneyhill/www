# CALM2

## Overview
The CALM2 gene encodes calmodulin 2, a pivotal calcium-binding messenger protein involved in numerous cellular processes. Calmodulin 2 is categorized as a calcium sensor protein, characterized by its ability to bind calcium ions through its EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures. This protein plays a critical role in calcium signaling pathways by modulating the activity of various target proteins, including ion channels and enzymes, in response to fluctuations in intracellular calcium levels. The structural configuration of calmodulin 2, with its two globular domains connected by a flexible linker, allows it to undergo conformational changes upon calcium binding, thereby facilitating interactions with a wide array of proteins. These interactions are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and are particularly significant in the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Mutations in the CALM2 gene can lead to severe cardiac conditions, such as Long QT Syndrome, by disrupting normal calcium signaling (Crotti2019Calmodulin; Chazin2020Calmodulin; Villalobo2019Proteins).

## Structure
Calmodulin 2 (CaM2), encoded by the CALM2 gene, is a calcium-binding messenger protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. The protein is composed of 148 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 16.7 kDa (Jensen2018Human). Its structure includes two globular domains, the N-terminal (CaM-N) and C-terminal (CaM-C) lobes, connected by a flexible linker. Each lobe contains two EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures capable of binding calcium ions (Chazin2020Calmodulin; Villalobo2019Proteins).

The C-terminal lobe of CaM2 has a higher calcium affinity compared to the N-terminal lobe, which is significant for its function as a calcium sensor (Jensen2018Human). Upon calcium binding, the protein undergoes a conformational change, exposing hydrophobic surfaces that facilitate interactions with target proteins (Chazin2020Calmodulin). This structural flexibility allows CaM2 to modulate the activity of various proteins, including ion channels and enzymes, in response to changes in calcium concentration (Villalobo2019Proteins).

Common post-translational modifications of calmodulin include phosphorylation and methylation, which can influence its interaction with target proteins. However, specific details on splice variant isoforms of CALM2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CALM2 gene encodes calmodulin 2, a calcium-binding messenger protein that plays a crucial role in calcium signaling pathways within human cells. Calmodulin 2 is involved in sensing changes in intracellular calcium concentrations and modulating various target proteins through a process known as calmodulation. This protein is composed of 148 amino acids and features two lobes, each containing two EF-hand motifs that bind calcium ions. The C-terminal lobe of calmodulin has a higher affinity for calcium, allowing it to sense a wide range of calcium concentrations and regulate cellular responses accordingly (Jensen2018Human).

In the central nervous system, CALM2 is particularly important for maintaining neuronal health and function. It is involved in processes such as neuronal cell death, especially in the context of calcium overload following excitotoxic insults. Calmodulin antagonists that interact with CALM2 can protect neurons against hypoxia and reduce brain damage, highlighting its role in critical calcium signaling pathways (Caracausi2015A).

In cardiac cells, calmodulin 2 regulates several ion channels, including L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors, which are essential for normal cardiac electrophysiological properties. Mutations in CALM2 can lead to conditions like Long QT Syndrome by impairing these regulatory functions (Yamamoto2017Allelespecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CALM2 gene are associated with several severe cardiac conditions, primarily due to their impact on calcium signaling. These mutations can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias such as Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT), and Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrillation (IVF) (Crotti2019Calmodulin; Jensen2018Human). LQTS caused by CALM2 mutations is particularly severe, often presenting with a mean QTc interval greater than 600 ms and associated with adrenergic triggers for cardiac events (Crotti2019Calmodulin). 

Specific mutations, such as Asn98Ser, have been linked to unexplained cardiac arrest in infants, with low clinical penetrance making early diagnosis challenging (JiménezJáimez2016Calmodulin). Other mutations, like D96V and E141K, are associated with severe arrhythmic events and cardiac dysfunction, sometimes resembling Timothy syndrome (Fukuyama2023Calmodulinopathy). These mutations often occur de novo and are not found in the general population, indicating their rarity and potential pathogenicity (Crotti2013Calmodulin).

The clinical manifestations of CALM2 mutations can vary, with some cases also presenting neurological and developmental disorders, highlighting the gene's broader impact beyond cardiac conditions (Fukuyama2023Calmodulinopathy).

## Interactions
Calmodulin 2 (CaM2), encoded by the CALM2 gene, is a calcium-binding messenger protein that interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. One of its primary interactions is with the cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), a calcium release channel in cardiomyocytes. CaM2 binds to RyR2 and inhibits its activity, which is essential for proper cardiac function (Søndergaard2019Role). This interaction involves multiple CaM-binding domains on RyR2, with the CaM C-domain binding to CaMBD2 being critical for CaM-dependent inhibition (Søndergaard2019Role).

Mutations in CALM2 can alter these interactions, leading to cardiac arrhythmias. For instance, the N53I mutation in CaM2 affects its interaction with RyR2 by increasing the dissociation rate of Ca2+ from the CaM-N53I:CaMBD2 complex, resulting in less efficient closure of RyR2 (Holt2020The). Similarly, the D96V mutation enhances RyR2 binding, potentially increasing diastolic calcium release (Vassilakopoulou2015Distinctive).

CaM2 also interacts with other proteins, such as kinases and phosphatases, modulating their activity. These interactions are crucial for processes like muscle contraction and signal transduction pathways, highlighting the versatile role of CaM2 in cellular regulation (Hwang2014Divergent).
