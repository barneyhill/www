# TMEM86B

## Overview
TMEM86B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 86B, which is categorized as an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. This protein, known as alkenylglycerophosphocholine hydrolase, plays a critical role in the acyl chain remodeling of phosphatidylcholine, a process linked to immune cell activity and cellular homeostasis. TMEM86B is primarily active in the lysosomal membrane, where it contributes to the breakdown and recycling of cellular components, thus maintaining energy balance and proper cellular function (Zhang2023Metabolic; Watschinger2013Orphan). The gene's expression is notably present in immune cells and may be influenced by genetic variants, which can affect susceptibility to infections and other health conditions (Chen2024HostPathogen). TMEM86B's involvement in lipid metabolism and immune regulation underscores its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states, including infections, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer (Wei2024Assessment; Chen2024HostPathogen; Tabassum2018Genetics).

## Structure


## Function
TMEM86B is involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the acyl chain remodeling of phosphatidylcholine, which is linked to immune cell activity. Abnormalities in this lipid metabolism process may increase susceptibility to infections, such as those caused by K. pneumoniae (Chen2024HostPathogen). The protein encoded by TMEM86B functions as an enzyme known as alkenylglycerophosphocholine hydrolase. It catalyzes the cleavage of the vinyl ether bond of lysoplasmenylcholines, producing a fatty aldehyde and a glycerol derivative. This enzymatic activity is crucial for ether lipid metabolism, and TMEM86B also accepts lysoplasmenylethanolamines as substrates, displaying dual enzymatic activities (Watschinger2013Orphan).

TMEM86B is expressed in immune cells, with its expression potentially influenced by genetic variants. This suggests a role in regulating immune cell activity, although its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed (Chen2024HostPathogen). The protein is primarily active in the lysosomal membrane, where it contributes to the breakdown and recycling of cellular components, maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy balance. This activity is essential for the proper functioning of cellular processes related to membrane transport and lipid metabolism (Zhang2023Metabolic).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM86B has been implicated in various health conditions due to its role in immune cell function and lipid metabolism. Alterations in TMEM86B expression, particularly due to genetic variants, have been associated with increased susceptibility to Klebsiella pneumoniae infections, including urinary tract infections, in the Taiwanese population. The rs4337407 mutation in TMEM86B is linked to increased gene expression in whole blood, which may influence immune responses and infection risk (Chen2024HostPathogen).

The gene is also involved in lipid metabolism pathways, such as acyl chain remodeling of phosphatidylcholine, which may affect immune cell activity and contribute to infection risk (Chen2024HostPathogen). Additionally, TMEM86B has been identified as a locus associated with lipid species, suggesting a potential link to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes through its role in lipid metabolism (Tabassum2018Genetics).

In the context of cancer, TMEM86B interacts with gasdermin family genes, which are associated with tumor progression and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways (Wei2024Assessment).
