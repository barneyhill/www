# DPYSL5

## Overview
DPYSL5, or dihydropyrimidinase-like 5, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) family, which is integral to the nervous system's development and function. The DPYSL5 protein, also known as CRMP5, is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, neurite extension, axonal guidance, and synaptic plasticity. It plays a critical role in maintaining dendritic quiescence during axonogenesis and modulating synaptic strength through its interactions with cytoskeletal elements and signaling proteins. The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, influencing its role in cytoskeleton dynamics and synaptic physiology. Alterations in the DPYSL5 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in neural development and function (Desprez2023Contribution).

## Function
DPYSL5, also known as dihydropyrimidinase-like 5, is a member of the collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) family, which plays a significant role in the developing nervous system. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, neurite extension, axonal guidance, dendritic spine development, and synaptic plasticity (Desprez2023Contribution). DPYSL5 is particularly important for maintaining dendrites in a quiescent state during axonogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons. It forms a ternary complex with tubulin and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which inhibits neurite outgrowth by reducing the interaction between DPYSL2 and tubulin (Desprez2023Contribution).

In terms of synaptic physiology, DPYSL5 is involved in the regulation of synaptic strength and plasticity. It modulates the endocytosis of the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors via phosphorylation of GluA2 at Serine 880, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and may influence social behaviors (Desprez2023Contribution). The protein's activity is regulated by its phosphorylation status, which affects its interactions with the cytoskeleton and signaling proteins, thereby coordinating cytoskeleton dynamics and influencing processes like filopodia formation and neurite outgrowth (Desprez2023Contribution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DPYSL5 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). De novo missense mutations in DPYSL5 have been identified in individuals with developmental disorders, suggesting a significant role in these conditions (Desprez2023Contribution). The gene is involved in synaptic plasticity and dendritic morphology, particularly in the cerebellum, and its dysfunction can impact synaptic function and contribute to behavioral phenotypes associated with NDDs (Desprez2023Contribution).

Alterations in DPYSL5 expression or interactions can affect synaptic architecture and activity, potentially leading to social deficits and other symptoms of ASD (Desprez2023Contribution). The phosphorylation state of DPYSL5 is crucial for its role in synaptic signaling pathways, and changes in this post-translational modification can disrupt its normal function, contributing to the pathophysiology of NDDs (Desprez2023Contribution). Additionally, DPYSL5 is involved in the regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking, and its dysfunction may affect glutamatergic synapses, further implicating it in neurodevelopmental disorders (Desprez2023Contribution).

## Interactions
DPYSL5, also known as CRMP5, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in neuronal development. It forms a ternary complex with tubulin and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which inhibits neurite outgrowth by reducing the interaction between DPYSL2 and tubulin. This suggests that DPYSL5 modulates the activity of DPYSL2, potentially through hetero-oligomerization, as both proteins can form hetero-tetramers in vivo (Desprez2023Contribution). DPYSL5 interacts with tubulin to inhibit microtubule polymerization, contrasting with other DPYSL proteins like DPYSL1-3, which promote polymerization and stabilization (Desprez2023Contribution).

DPYSL5 is also involved in the regulation of synaptic activity through its role in the endocytosis of the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors, mediated by the phosphorylation of GluA2 at Serine 880. This interaction is significant at glutamatergic synapses and is linked to social deficits (Desprez2023Contribution). While specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, DPYSL5's involvement in these protein interactions highlights its role in modulating synaptic physiology and neural network formation.
