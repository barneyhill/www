# DNMBP

## Overview
DNMBP, or dynamin binding protein, is a gene located on chromosome 10q24.2 in humans, encoding a multifunctional scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein, also referred to as Tuba, is characterized by its multiple Src homology-3 (SH3) domains, a RhoGEF domain specific for CDC42, and a BAR domain, which collectively facilitate its role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and endocytosis. As a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), DNMBP is pivotal in activating the Rho GTPase CDC42, influencing cell proliferation, motility, and polarity. The protein's interactions with actin regulatory proteins and its involvement in the exocyst complex underscore its significance in cellular signaling and structural organization. DNMBP is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the testis, brain, and heart, and is implicated in developmental processes and pathological conditions, including neural tube defects and cancer progression (singh2017analysis; DeLay2019Dynamin; Yang2022DNMBPAS1).

## Structure
DNMBP, also known as Tuba, is a scaffold protein encoded by a large gene located on chromosome 10q24.2 in humans. The protein consists of 1577 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 177 kDa (singh2017analysis). The structure of DNMBP includes several functional domains. At the N-terminus, it contains four Src homology-3 (SH3) domains, labeled SH3-1 to SH3-4, which are involved in binding to dynamin, a GTPase crucial for endocytic processes (singh2017analysis). The C-terminal end of DNMBP features two additional SH3 domains, SH3-5 and SH3-6, with SH3-6 interacting with actin regulatory proteins and actin itself (singh2017analysis).

DNMBP also possesses a RhoGEF domain specific for the CDC42 GTPase, which plays a significant role in cellular signaling and actin dynamics (singh2017analysis). A distinctive feature of DNMBP is its BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain, which forms 'banana'-shaped structures that bind to curved membranes, facilitating membrane localization and modulation of GEF activity (singh2017analysis). Unlike most RhoGEFs, DNMBP lacks a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, relying instead on the BAR domain for these functions (singh2017analysis).

DNMBP is expressed in multiple tissues, with the highest expression in the testis, followed by the brain, heart, liver, spleen, and lung. It exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which results in splice variants of different sizes (singh2017analysis).

## Function
DNMBP, also known as dynamin binding protein, is a scaffold protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and endocytosis. It contains multiple Src homology-3 (SH3) domains that facilitate interactions with dynamin and actin regulatory proteins, linking dynamin to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is crucial for receptor-mediated endocytosis and actin organization, affecting processes such as transferrin uptake and cell movement (singh2017analysis).

DNMBP is also a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rho GTPase CDC42, which is essential for various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, motility, and polarity. It is involved in the formation of filopodia, structures necessary for neural tube development, and plays a role in ciliogenesis and lumenogenesis in epithelial cells (singh2017analysis).

The protein is active in several cellular locations, including the plasma membrane, Golgi complex, and presynaptic actin in the brain. It is expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in the testis, followed by the brain, heart, liver, spleen, and lung (singh2017analysis). DNMBP's interactions and regulatory roles are integral to maintaining cellular structure and function (Mehrabipour2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DNMBP gene have been implicated in several developmental and pathological conditions. DNMBP is a significant activator of the Rho GTPase CDC42, which is crucial for cytoskeleton organization. Variants of DNMBP that are not fully functional can lead to reduced levels of active CDC42, resulting in neural tube defects (NTDs) such as anencephaly and exencephaly. These defects are linked to abnormalities in neural tube closure, a process heavily reliant on actin-based mechanisms (singh2017analysis).

In addition to its role in neural development, DNMBP is essential for kidney development. Disruption of DNMBP expression in Xenopus laevis leads to significant developmental issues in the kidney, including impaired development of nephron structures and glomus defects. This disruption can result in edema and other functional abnormalities (DeLay2019Dynamin).

DNMBP is also involved in colon cancer progression. The long non-coding RNA DNMBP-AS1, which regulates DNMBP expression, acts as a tumor suppressor by sponging microRNAs that would otherwise downregulate NHLRC3, a gene implicated in colon cancer. Alterations in DNMBP-AS1 expression can influence cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Yang2022DNMBPAS1).

## Interactions
DNMBP (dynamin binding protein) is known to interact with several proteins involved in actin regulation and cellular signaling. It directly interacts with actin regulatory proteins such as N-WASP and members of the Ena/VASP family, which are crucial for actin assembly and cytoskeletal dynamics (DeLay2019Dynamin). DNMBP also functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specifically for CDC42, a small GTPase involved in various cellular processes, including cell polarity and migration. This interaction is essential for activating CDC42 by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is necessary for CDC42's function in kidney epithelial cells (DeLay2019Dynamin).

In addition to its role in actin assembly, DNMBP is associated with the exocyst complex, which is involved in vesicle targeting and docking at the plasma membrane. CDC42 regulates this process, and DNMBP, as a GEF for CDC42, plays a critical role in this regulatory pathway (Baek2016Dynamin). These interactions highlight DNMBP's involvement in crucial cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and nephrogenesis, particularly through its regulation of CDC42 activity and its association with actin-binding proteins (Baek2016Dynamin).
