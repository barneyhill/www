# PYM1

## Overview
PYM1 is a gene that encodes the protein PYM homolog 1, an exon junction complex (EJC) associated factor. This protein is categorized as an intrinsically disordered protein, which plays a critical role in the disassembly of the EJC during the early stages of mRNA translation. PYM homolog 1 interacts with the Mago-Y14 heterodimer, a core component of the EJC, and binds to RNA in a sequence-independent manner. The protein's structure is characterized by a predominantly disordered sequence, with specific regions forming secondary structures such as an α-helix and a β-strand-turn-β-strand motif. These structural features facilitate its interaction with RNA and other proteins, influencing mRNA processing and transport (Verma2023The).

## Structure
The PYM1 protein, specifically the PYM 1-160 construct, is an intrinsically disordered protein involved in the disassembly of the exon junction complex (EJC). The primary structure of PYM 1-160 includes a sequence that is predominantly disordered, with specific regions forming secondary structures. An α-helix is present between amino acids 68 and 81, while a transient β-strand-turn-β-strand motif is observed in the N-terminal region, comprising amino acids 16-33 (Verma2023The).

In its free form, PYM 1-160 does not exhibit a well-defined tertiary structure, maintaining a disordered character even when bound to RNA. However, the N-terminal region shows a preference for more compact, globular-like conformations, which facilitate RNA binding through a colocalization of positive charges (Verma2023The). The interaction with RNA is largely independent of the RNA sequence, and the same protein residues are involved in interactions with various RNAs (Verma2023The).

The PYM 1-160 construct lacks 51 amino acids at the C-terminus compared to the full-length protein, which contributes to its stability and ability to replicate the effects of PYM over-expression on RNA localization (Verma2023The). The C-terminal domain of PYM is required for ribosome binding in human cells, a function not present in flies due to sequence differences (Verma2023The).

## Function


## Interactions
PYM1, also known as PYM homolog 1, is an intrinsically disordered protein that interacts with various proteins and RNA molecules. In humans, PYM1 is involved in the disassembly of the exon junction complex (EJC) during the initial rounds of mRNA translation. It interacts with the Mago-Y14 heterodimer, which is a core component of the EJC, suggesting that PYM1's binding to RNA may prevent its interaction with Mago-Y14, thereby regulating EJC disassembly (Verma2023The).

PYM1 forms a complex with RNA, maintaining its disordered nature even upon binding. The protein interacts with RNA through a globular-like region formed by amino acids 22-34, which are also involved in interactions with the Mago-Y14 dimer, indicating mutually exclusive interactions (Verma2023The). The binding of PYM1 to RNA is largely independent of the RNA sequence, and the protein can bind to both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA structures (Verma2023The).

The interaction of PYM1 with RNA is significant as it may serve to sequester PYM1, preserving the EJC until mRNA localization is complete. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of mRNA processing and transport, highlighting PYM1's role in modulating its activity through RNA binding (Verma2023The).
