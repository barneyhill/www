# CD276

## Overview
CD276, also known as B7-H3, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the B7 family of immune regulatory proteins. The CD276 protein plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses and is characterized by its extracellular domain composed of immunoglobulin-like folds. In humans, this domain is organized into two pairs of IgV-IgC domains, resulting in the 4IgB7-H3 isoform, while the mouse version contains a single pair, known as the 2IgB7-H3 isoform (Durlanik2021CD276; Getu2023New; Zhou2021B7H3CD276:). The protein's structure includes a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail, which lacks known adaptor protein motifs, leaving its downstream signaling pathways largely unresolved (Durlanik2021CD276). CD276 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and immune evasion, making it a significant focus of research for potential therapeutic interventions (Liu2021The).

## Structure
The CD276 protein, also known as B7-H3, is a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the B7 family of immune regulatory proteins. Its structure includes an extracellular domain composed of immunoglobulin-like folds, specifically organized as two pairs of IgV-IgC domains due to exon duplication in humans, resulting in the 4IgB7-H3 isoform (Durlanik2021CD276; Zhou2021B7H3CD276:). The mouse version of B7-H3, however, contains only a single pair of these domains, corresponding to the 2IgB7-H3 isoform (Getu2023New). The protein also features a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail, which lacks known adaptor protein motifs, leaving its downstream signaling unresolved (Durlanik2021CD276).

Post-translational modifications of B7-H3 include glycosylation, which is crucial for its stability, membrane expression, and immunosuppressive function, particularly in cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer (Getu2023New). Other modifications include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, with specific modification sites identified (Getu2023New). B7-H3 can also exist in a soluble form, cleaved from the cell surface by matrix metallopeptidases or produced through alternative splicing (Zhou2021B7H3CD276:).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The CD276 gene, also known as B7-H3, is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its role as an immune checkpoint molecule. Alterations in CD276 expression are associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including glioblastoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and bladder cancer (Dai2023Multiomics; Harland2022Elevated). In glioblastoma, high CD276 expression correlates with increased tumor proliferation, invasion, and resistance to chemotherapy, contributing to a poor prognosis (Dai2023Multiomics). Similarly, in bladder cancer, CD276 is expressed in both primary tumors and lymph node metastases, and its expression is linked to tumor cell proliferation and metastasis (Harland2022Elevated).

CD276 is also involved in immune evasion by inhibiting T cell function, which allows tumors to escape immune surveillance (Liu2021The). This immunosuppressive role makes CD276 a potential target for cancer immunotherapy, with strategies such as monoclonal antibodies and CAR T-cell therapy being explored (Liu2021The). Additionally, CD276 expression is regulated by microRNAs and cytokines, which can influence its role in cancer progression (Liu2021The). Overall, CD276's altered expression and interactions in cancer highlight its clinical significance as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CD276, also known as B7-H3, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cancer progression and immune responses. In breast cancer stem cells (CSCs), CD276 interacts laterally with CD147 within lipid raft microdomains. This interaction is crucial for maintaining stemness and drug resistance, particularly against the chemotherapy agent docetaxel. The co-expression of CD276 and CD147 is associated with poor clinical outcomes in HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer patients (Seo2023Lateral).

CD276 also forms a direct protein-protein complex with MDM2 in the presence of Nutlin-3, a small molecule that disrupts MDM2-p53 interactions. This interaction is not mediated by a bridging protein, as demonstrated by proximity ligation assays (Li2020The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, CD276 promotes vasculogenic mimicry through the PI3K/AKT/MMPs signaling pathway. It influences the expression of key molecules such as AKT1, MMP14, and MMP2, affecting cell invasion and migration (Cheng2020&lt; p&gt; CD276).

CD276 is also implicated in macrophage recruitment into tumors, where it regulates the production of PAI-1, an extracellular matrix modulator. This role highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Durlanik2021CD276).
