# SLC30A6

## Overview
SLC30A6 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 30 member 6, commonly referred to as ZnT6. ZnT6 is a zinc transporter protein that belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family, characterized by its role in the translocation of zinc ions across cellular membranes. The protein is distinguished by its six transmembrane domains and a unique serine-rich intracellular loop, which differentiates it from other members of the ZnT family (Seve2004In). ZnT6 primarily functions as a zinc/proton exchanger, although it lacks intrinsic zinc transport activity due to the absence of a zinc-binding site. Instead, it modulates zinc transport by forming heterodimers with other zinc transporters, such as ZnT5, to facilitate zinc homeostasis within cells (Kumar2015Altered; Kambe2015The). ZnT6 is localized to the Golgi apparatus and the trans-Golgi network, where it plays a crucial role in the activation of zinc-requiring enzymes and the secretion of zinc, particularly in the mammary gland (Kumar2015Altered; Kambe2015The). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer prognosis and zinc deficiency disorders (Kumar2015Altered; Guo2020Comprehensive).

## Structure
SLC30A6, also known as ZnT-6, is a zinc transporter protein that is part of the solute carrier family 30. The protein is characterized by a predicted structure with six transmembrane domains, which are typical of the ZnT family, facilitating the transport of zinc ions across cellular membranes (Seve2004In). Unlike other members of the ZnT family, ZnT-6 features a serine-rich intracellular loop between helices IV and V, instead of the more common histidine-rich loop found in other family members (Seve2004In).

SLC30A6 forms heterodimers with SLC30A5, which is necessary for its zinc transport function. Although SLC30A6 does not have a zinc-binding site, it may act as a modulator in the transport process (Kumar2015Altered). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including germinal B-cells, colon, eye, and lung, with in vivo detection in the liver, brain, small intestine, and kidney (Seve2004In).

The protein's intracellular localization is primarily in small vesicles throughout the cytoplasm, suggesting a role in zinc sequestration into vesicles for secretion (Kumar2015Altered). There are two mRNA variants of SLC30A6, indicating alternative splicing, although no differences in exon-intron structure have been found between patient and control cells (Kumar2015Altered).

## Function
The SLC30A6 gene encodes the ZnT6 protein, a zinc transporter primarily involved in the translocation of zinc ions from the cytoplasm into the Golgi apparatus and other intracellular compartments. ZnT6 is part of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family and functions as a zinc/proton exchanger, although it lacks intrinsic zinc transport activity due to substitutions in its zinc-binding site (Kambe2017Understanding; Kambe2015The). Instead, ZnT6 often forms heterodimers with ZnT5, which are crucial for delivering zinc into the early secretory pathway. This process is essential for the activation of zinc-requiring enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatases, and for maintaining zinc homeostasis within cells (Kambe2017Understanding; Kambe2015The).

ZnT6 is localized to the Golgi apparatus and the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it plays a role in modulating the activity of ZnT5 rather than directly transporting zinc (Kambe2015The). The expression of ZnT6 is less ubiquitous compared to ZnT5, and its subcellular localization can change under high zinc conditions, indicating specific biological functions in certain cell types (Kambe2015The). In the mammary gland, SLC30A6, along with SLC30A5, is implicated in the secretion of zinc into milk, highlighting its role in zinc transport and mammary gland function (Kumar2015Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC30A6 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In gastric cancer, higher expression levels of SLC30A6 are associated with improved overall survival, particularly in stage IV patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Guo2020Comprehensive). Conversely, in cervical carcinoma, elevated expression of SLC30A6 is correlated with poorer overall survival, indicating a complex role in cancer biology (Zhang2022The).

SLC30A6 is also implicated in a mammary gland disorder characterized by reduced zinc secretion into milk, which can lead to zinc deficiency in breastfed infants. This condition is associated with decreased mRNA and protein levels of SLC30A6 in maternal tissues, although no mutations were found in the gene itself. The disorder highlights the importance of SLC30A6 in zinc transport and secretion processes (Kumar2015Altered).

In the context of transient neonatal zinc deficiency (TNZD), a splice variant of the ZnT2 protein, encoded by SLC30A6, disrupts its normal function. This variant impairs the protein's ability to dimerize and transport zinc, contributing to the clinical manifestation of TNZD (Golan2017Identification). These findings underscore the critical role of SLC30A6 in maintaining zinc homeostasis and its potential impact on various health conditions.

## Interactions
SLC30A6, also known as ZnT6, is involved in zinc transport and forms heterodimers with SLC30A5 (ZnT5). This oligomerization is essential for their zinc transport function, as the interaction between SLC30A5 and SLC30A6 is crucial for the effective transport of zinc. A reduction in either protein can impair the function of the dimer in transporting zinc, highlighting the importance of their interaction (Kumar2015Altered). 

ZnT6 does not have a zinc-binding site within its trans-membrane domain, suggesting it may function as a modulator of zinc transport rather than directly binding zinc itself (Kumar2015Altered). The interaction with ZnT5 is significant for maintaining zinc homeostasis, which is crucial for various cellular functions, including transcription, ATP production, and intracellular signaling (Lieberwirth2021Biallelic). 

While specific interactions of SLC30A6 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available excerpts, its role in forming heterodimers with ZnT5 and its involvement in zinc transport pathways suggest it may participate in broader protein networks related to zinc homeostasis and cellular signaling (Kumar2015Altered; Lieberwirth2021Biallelic).
