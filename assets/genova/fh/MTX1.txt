# MTX1

## Overview
The MTX1 gene encodes the protein metaxin 1, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Metaxin 1 is involved in the import and assembly of proteins into mitochondria, playing a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. As a part of the mitochondrial protein sorting and assembly machinery, metaxin 1 interacts with other proteins such as MTX2 and MIRO-1 to facilitate mitochondrial transport within neurons, which is essential for neuronal health and the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases (Armstrong1997Metaxin; Zhao2021Metaxins). Additionally, metaxin 1 is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis through its interactions with pro-apoptotic proteins, influencing cell death pathways (Petit2017The). The gene's mutations have been associated with modifying the phenotypic expression of Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Davidson2018Exploring; GanOr2011Homozygosity).

## Function
The MTX1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to mitochondrial function, particularly in the import and assembly of proteins into the mitochondria. MTX1 is a component of the mitochondrial outer membrane and plays a crucial role in the import of preproteins, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Armstrong1997Metaxin). It is involved in forming a complex with MTX2 and MIRO-1, which facilitates the transport of mitochondria within neurons, ensuring proper distribution and function of mitochondria in dendrites and axons (Zhao2021Metaxins). This transport is vital for neuronal health and the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases (Zhao2021Metaxins).

MTX1 also participates in the regulation of apoptosis. It is part of the Sorting and Assembly Machinery (SAM) that assists in the membrane insertion of beta-barrel proteins, including the Voltage Dependent Anionic Channel (VDAC). During apoptosis, MTX1 interacts with pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bak, influencing cell death pathways (Petit2017The). The phosphorylation state of MTX1 affects its interaction with these proteins, thereby playing a role in the regulation of apoptosis (Petit2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MTX1 gene have been implicated in modifying the phenotypic expression of Gaucher disease (GD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The MTX1 gene is located near the GBA1 gene on chromosome 1q21, and its proximity suggests it could influence GD through genetic recombination events that might disrupt the 3'-UTR of GBA1, affecting gene expression and contributing to phenotypic heterogeneity in GD (Davidson2018Exploring). A specific mutation in MTX1, p.F202L, has been associated with GD, particularly in patients with the common N370S mutation in the GBA gene. This polymorphism may act as a genetic modifier, influencing the severity of GD (LaMarca2004A).

In Parkinson's disease, the MTX1 c.184T>A (p.S63T) alteration has been linked to an earlier onset of motor symptoms in patients with GBA mutations. The homozygous MTX1 c.184A/A genotype is associated with a significantly earlier age of onset for motor symptoms in these patients, suggesting a modifying effect on the clinical course of GBA-associated PD (GanOr2011Homozygosity). These findings indicate that MTX1 mutations or expression alterations could be significant in the context of GD and PD, although further research is needed to fully understand these associations (Davidson2018Exploring).

## Interactions
Metaxin 1 (MTX1) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for mitochondrial function and apoptosis. MTX1 interacts with Bak, a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, during TNFα-induced apoptosis. This interaction is essential for Bak activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a key step in apoptosis. The interaction between MTX1 and Bak is regulated by the phosphorylation of MTX1, particularly at residues Y228 and possibly Y232, which is crucial for Bak's function in apoptosis (Petit2017The).

MTX1 also forms part of a multi-protein complex with Bak, VDAC2, and Metaxin 2 (MTX2) in both resting and apoptotic cells. During apoptosis, Bak shifts its association from MTX2 and VDAC2 to a closer interaction with MTX1, highlighting the dynamic nature of these interactions (Petit2017The). Antibodies against MTX1 have been shown to inhibit cytochrome c-induced DEVDase activation, further indicating its role in the apoptotic pathway (Cartron2014Metaxins).

In addition to its role in apoptosis, MTX1 is part of the mitochondrial protein sorting and assembly machinery, interacting with MTX2 to facilitate the import and assembly of proteins into the mitochondria (Cartron2014Metaxins).
