# MEIS3

## Overview
MEIS3 (Meis homeobox 3) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the TALE (three-amino-acid loop extension) homeobox family, which plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during developmental processes. The MEIS3 protein is characterized by its DNA-binding homeodomain and conserved protein-protein interaction domains, MEIS-A and MEIS-B, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins such as PBX. These interactions are crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation. MEIS3 is involved in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and organogenesis, with significant roles in nervous system development and pancreatic β-cell survival. It also participates in the regulation of signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt, influencing cell survival and apoptosis. Clinically, alterations in MEIS3 expression have been linked to several diseases, notably cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Geerts2005MEIS; Liu2010Three-amino-acid-loop-extension; Longobardi2013Biochemistry).

## Structure
The MEIS3 protein is a member of the MEINOX family and contains several conserved domains crucial for its function. It has a DNA-binding homeodomain (HD) located towards the carboxy-terminus, which is essential for its role in transcriptional regulation (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). The protein also features two protein-protein interaction domains, MEIS-A and MEIS-B, towards the amino terminus. These domains are conserved within the MEINOX family and are important for interactions with other proteins, such as PBX (Longobardi2013Biochemistry).

The MEIS-A domain includes binding sequences for Pbx1, P160, and 4EHP, and is essential for forming complexes with PBX proteins, enhancing DNA binding and selectivity (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). MEIS3 contains an insert of six residues in the carboxyterminal half of the MEIS-A domain, though the functional relevance of this insert is unknown (Longobardi2013Biochemistry).

MEIS3 is known to form heterodimers with other homeodomain proteins, influencing its quaternary structure. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its activity. Splice variants of MEIS3 can lead to different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). However, specific details about the tertiary structure of MEIS3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
MEIS3 (Meis homeobox 3) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression during development, particularly in the nervous system. It is part of the TALE (three-amino-acid loop extension) homeobox family and is involved in various molecular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and organogenesis. MEIS3 functions by binding to DNA in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of target genes (Geerts2005MEIS).

In the context of hindbrain development, MEIS3 is part of a regulatory circuit involving Wnt3a and Tsh1, which collectively repress the hindbrain developmental program to promote neuron differentiation. MEIS3 is necessary for early hindbrain formation and primary neuron induction, maintaining early-induced primary neurons in a proliferative progenitor state and preventing differentiation (Elkouby2012A). This dual role is crucial for ensuring proper neuronal differentiation and tissue maturation (Elkouby2012A).

MEIS3 also plays a role in cell survival, particularly in pancreatic β-cells, where it regulates the PDK1/Akt signaling pathway. It directly targets the Pdpk1 gene, influencing cell survival and apoptosis regulation (Liu2010Three-amino-acid-loop-extension). This function extends to both healthy and cancerous cells, highlighting MEIS3's importance beyond traditional developmental roles (Liu2010Three-amino-acid-loop-extension).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MEIS3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high levels of MEIS3 expression are associated with poor prognosis, especially in stages II and III. This is linked to enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion, potentially through processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor budding. Silencing MEIS3 in CRC cell lines reduces their migration and invasion capabilities, suggesting its role in metastasis (Li2022High).

MEIS3 is also involved in pancreatic β-cell survival, which is crucial for maintaining β-cell mass and function. This has implications for the pathogenesis of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as MEIS3 regulates cell survival through the PDK1/Akt signaling pathway (Liu2010Three-amino-acid-loop-extension).

In cancer, MEIS3 is uniquely involved in regulating PDK1 expression and cell survival in tumor cells, unlike other MEIS family members. It is expressed in ovarian carcinoma cells, where its silencing leads to increased apoptosis, indicating a potential role in tumor cell survival and ovarian carcinogenesis (Liu2010Three-amino-acid-loop-extension). MEIS3's expression is also upregulated in glioblastoma, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis and metastasis in various cancers (Krasnytska2022The).

## Interactions
MEIS3 (Meis homeobox 3) is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. MEIS3 forms complexes with PBX proteins, which are crucial for its function. These interactions require the MEIS-A and MEIS-B domains, which are highly conserved across MEIS and PREP sub-family members. The MEIS-A domain is essential for forming a PREP1-PBX1 complex, while the MEIS-B domain's role is less clear and may be partially dispensable for PBX binding (Longobardi2013Biochemistry).

MEIS3 also interacts with HOXA1, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HOXA1 binds to the MEIS3 enhancer region, enhancing histone modifications that increase MEIS3 expression. This interaction is associated with promoting HCC cell viability, migration, and invasion (Zhang2021TumorSuppressive).

In addition to protein interactions, MEIS3 is involved in the regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by directly targeting 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). This interaction is crucial for cell survival, as MEIS3 regulates the expression of PDK1, which in turn affects the activation of caspase-3, a key player in apoptosis (Liu2010Three-amino-acid-loop-extension).
