# SLC46A1

## Overview
The SLC46A1 gene encodes the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), a critical member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of solute transporters. This integral membrane protein is primarily involved in the transport of folate across cell membranes, playing a vital role in folate absorption in the small intestine and contributing to hepatic iron metabolism. The PCFT protein is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains and operates optimally in acidic environments, such as those found in the duodenum and upper jejunum. Mutations in SLC46A1 can lead to hereditary folate malabsorption, a condition marked by systemic folate deficiency and associated clinical manifestations. The gene's expression is regulated by iron levels, indicating its involvement in broader nutrient transport and metabolic processes (Date2017Expression; Li2020SLC46A1; Alam2020Clinical).

## Structure
The SLC46A1 gene encodes the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), an integral membrane protein crucial for folate transport. The PCFT protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs), with both the N and C termini directed towards the cytoplasm (Alam2020Clinical). The protein includes a conserved motif, GXXXDXXGRR/K, which is essential for its function and is a characteristic feature of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of solute transporters (Aluri2019Substitutions). 

The first intracellular loop, particularly the Asp109 residue, plays a critical role in the conformational changes necessary for transporter function. Mutations at this site can lock the transporter in an inward-open conformation, affecting its activity without altering protein expression or trafficking (Aluri2019Substitutions). The external gate, formed by the exofacial regions of TMDs 1, 2, 7, and 11, is crucial for substrate transport, with mutations at Asn411 affecting the transport of specific folate substrates (Aluri2018Hereditary).

Post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, occur in the loop connecting TMD1 and TMD2, influencing the protein's stability and function (Alam2020Clinical). The structural dynamics of PCFT are essential for its role in folate transport across cell membranes.

## Function
The SLC46A1 gene encodes the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), which is essential for the absorption of folate in the small intestine. This transporter facilitates the uptake of folic acid, a vital nutrient involved in DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation, processes crucial for cell division and growth (Date2017Expression; Laftah2008Haem). PCFT operates optimally in acidic environments, such as those found in the duodenum and upper jejunum, where it is primarily active on the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells (Date2017Expression).

In addition to its role in folate transport, SLC46A1 is involved in hepatic iron metabolism by importing heme into hepatocytes, thereby influencing iron homeostasis. This function is crucial for maintaining iron balance in the body, as demonstrated by changes in hepatic and serum iron levels when SLC46A1 expression is altered (Li2020SLC46A1). The gene's expression is responsive to iron levels, increasing under iron-deficient conditions and decreasing when there is iron overload (Li2020SLC46A1).

SLC46A1 is also expressed in the liver and kidneys, indicating its broader role in nutrient transport and metabolism beyond the intestine (Cordova2021Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC46A1 gene, which encodes the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), are linked to hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM), an autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by impaired intestinal absorption of folates and reduced transport into the cerebrospinal fluid, leading to systemic folate deficiency. Clinical manifestations include megaloblastic anemia, immune deficiency, neurological deficits, and seizures (Tozawa2019A; Zhao2009A).

Specific mutations, such as Asp109, Gly112, Arg113, and Phe392, can lock the transporter in an inward-open conformation, resulting in a loss of function and impaired folate transport (Aluri2019Substitutions; Zhan2020A). The N411K mutation affects the external gate of the PCFT, leading to a substrate-specific defect in transport (Aluri2018Hereditary). A deep intronic mutation, c.1166-285 T > G, creates a cryptic splice donor site, causing premature termination and absent PCFT expression, which is particularly noted in some Japanese patients (Tozawa2019A).

These mutations highlight the genetic complexity of HFM and underscore the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent severe outcomes and neurological complications (Aluri2018Hereditary; Zhao2007The).
