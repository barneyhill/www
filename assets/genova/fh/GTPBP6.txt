# GTPBP6

## Overview
GTPBP6 is a gene that encodes the GTP binding protein 6 (putative), which is involved in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and recycling. This protein is categorized as a GTP-binding protein, playing a crucial role in the maturation of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) by facilitating structural rearrangements necessary for the peptidyl transferase center's development. GTPBP6 interacts with specific components of the mtLSU, such as helix 69, to promote the dissociation of the mitoribosome into subunits, a process essential for ribosome recycling (HS2022Structural). The gene has also been implicated in the context of Klinefelter syndrome, where its expression levels are associated with variations in cognitive performance, potentially influenced by the X-chromosome inactivation pattern (Simonetti2021Intelligence).

## Clinical Significance
The GTPBP6 gene has been studied in the context of Klinefelter syndrome (KS), a chromosomal disorder characterized by an extra X chromosome in males. Research indicates that variability in intelligence quotient (IQ) among KS patients is associated with the expression of GTPBP6, which is regulated by the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern. KS patients with a random X-inactivation (RXI) pattern exhibit higher GTPBP6 expression and lower IQ scores compared to those with a skewed X-inactivation (SXI) pattern, who show lower GTPBP6 expression and average IQ scores (Simonetti2021Intelligence). This suggests that the XCI pattern may influence cognitive performance in KS patients through its effect on GTPBP6 expression.

The study also highlights that KS patients often face a higher risk of comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and seizures, which can negatively impact cognitive development (Simonetti2021Intelligence). While a negative correlation trend between GTPBP6 expression and full-scale IQ was observed, it was not statistically significant. However, patients with IQ below 80 and an RXI pattern showed higher GTPBP6 expression, suggesting a potential link between GTPBP6 expression and intellectual performance in KS patients (Simonetti2021Intelligence). Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these associations.

## Interactions
GTPBP6 is involved in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and recycling, interacting specifically with the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU). During the maturation of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the mtLSU, GTPBP6 displaces GTPBP5 and the MTERF4-NSUN4 complex, leading to necessary conformational changes in the PTC. This interaction involves the insertion of a loop from GTPBP6 into the PTC, causing structural rearrangements that are crucial for its maturation (HS2022Structural). GTPBP6 also plays a role in ribosome recycling by binding to the mature mtLSU and interacting with helix 69 (h69), causing a shift that promotes the dissociation of the 55S mitoribosome into subunits (HS2022Structural).

GTPBP6 binds GTP but not ATP during these processes, indicating that GTP hydrolysis is not required for its binding to the mtLSU (HS2022Structural). The interactions of GTPBP6 with the mtLSU involve specific residues and structural rearrangements, such as the insertion of a tryptophan residue next to a base pair in h69, which is crucial for its function in ribosome recycling (HS2022Structural). These interactions suggest a hierarchical action of GTPBP6 and GTPBP5 during mtLSU biogenesis, with GTPBP6 binding being mutually exclusive with GTPBP5/MTERF4-NSUN4, indicating sequential action (HS2022Structural).
