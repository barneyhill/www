# PLCG1

## Overview
Phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCγ1), a pivotal component in cellular signal transduction pathways. PLCγ1 is a phospholipase enzyme that plays a critical role in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), leading to the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are key secondary messengers involved in calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation (Ji1997Essential). The protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes several functional domains such as pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, Src homology 2 (SH2) and 3 (SH3) domains, and a TIM barrel, facilitating its interaction with various signaling molecules (Khan2021A). PLCγ1 is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases and is involved in diverse cellular processes, including cell motility, morphology, and early secretory trafficking (Jones2005PLCγ1; Millarte2015Phospholipase). Mutations in the PLCG1 gene have been implicated in several malignancies, underscoring its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Khan2021A; Gallardo2022Genetics).

## Structure
The PLCG1 gene encodes the phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCγ1) protein, which plays a crucial role in intracellular signal transduction. The protein consists of several domains, including an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, EF-hand motifs, a TIM barrel (comprising X and Y catalytic domains), and a C-terminal C2 domain. Additionally, there is an insertion of two parts of another PH domain between the TIM barrel catalytic domain, which are further split into two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and one Src homology 3 (SH3) domain (Khan2021A). These domains facilitate the protein's function in hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (Woo2017Molecular).

PLCγ1 exists as a monomer and has two isoforms, P19174-1 and P19174-2, with the P19174-1 isoform containing 1290 amino acid residues (Khan2021A). The protein's structure is characterized by its ability to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are essential for its activation (Liu2020Structural). The structural analysis of PLCγ1 has revealed that it can exist in an auto-inhibited form, with specific domains occluding the active site to regulate its activity (Liu2020Structural).

## Function
PLCG1 (phospholipase C gamma 1) is a critical enzyme involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in signal transduction by hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are secondary messengers essential for intracellular calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation (Ji1997Essential). PLCG1 is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as those for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), through phosphorylation, which is crucial for its function in cell motility and morphology (Jones2005PLCγ1).

In the context of integrin signaling, PLCG1 is essential for early events that lead to cell motility, including the formation of cell protrusions and spreading (Jones2005PLCγ1). It is also involved in early secretory trafficking, interacting with the tethering protein p115, which is crucial for ER-to-Golgi transport and cell migration (Millarte2015Phospholipase). In the nervous system, PLCG1 is activated by tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptors and is important for the formation and function of inhibitory synapses (Kanemaru2023Activation). These functions highlight PLCG1's role in maintaining normal cellular and physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PLCG1 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly various types of lymphomas. The PLCG1 gene is implicated in T-cell lymphomas, including peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Missense mutations in PLCG1 have been identified in patients with CTCL and AITL, affecting protein stability and function, which may contribute to disease pathogenesis (Khan2021A). In CTCL, PLCG1 mutations occur in 9-21% of cases, highlighting its role in TCR/NF-κB signaling pathways that are crucial for the disease's development (Gallardo2022Genetics).

PLCG1 is also linked to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), where its expression is significantly reduced. This reduction is associated with inferior survival outcomes, suggesting that PLCG1 haploinsufficiency due to chromosomal deletions may play a role in MDS pathogenesis (Shiseki2019Reduced). Additionally, PLCG1 mutations have been found in uterine mixed endometrial carcinoma and leiomyosarcoma, indicating its broader relevance in cancer (Khan2021A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PLCG1 in various malignancies and its potential as a target for genetic screening and therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1) is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling. The SH3 domain of PLCG1 interacts with a variety of proteins, including GTPases, kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors. Notably, it interacts with hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), where the SH3 domain of PLCG1 inhibits HPK1's kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Wu2007Systematic). This interaction is constitutive and independent of T cell receptor activation, highlighting a regulatory role for PLCG1 in kinase signaling pathways (Wu2007Systematic).

PLCG1 also plays a significant role in integrin signaling, where it interacts with Src kinases and the adaptor protein GIT1. This interaction is essential for the phosphorylation of PLCG1 on tyrosine residue Y783, a modification necessary for its activation and subsequent cell motility processes (Jones2005PLCγ1). The interaction with GIT1 and β-Pix is crucial for the activation of small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1, which are involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell spreading (Jones2007Role).

Additionally, PLCG1 interacts with the tethering protein p115, which is important for regulating early secretory trafficking and cell migration. This interaction is independent of PLCG1's catalytic activity and is crucial for controlling ER-to-Golgi trafficking (Millarte2015Phospholipase).
