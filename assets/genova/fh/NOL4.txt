# NOL4

## Overview
NOL4, or nucleolar protein 4, is a gene that encodes a nucleolar protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the nucleolus. The protein encoded by NOL4 is characterized by several splice variants, including NOL4-L, NOL4-S, and NOL4-SΔ, which exhibit distinct structural and functional properties. These variants are implicated in transcription regulation and protein interactions, with specific roles in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing. NOL4 is expressed in tissues such as the brain and testis, suggesting its involvement in tissue-specific functions. Additionally, NOL4 has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene, with its methylation linked to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), indicating its silencing in cancerous tissues (DEMOKAN2013Validation; TakayanagiKiya2017Mblk1). The gene's expression during development, particularly in the lip and palate regions, further suggests its role in facial development (Kumari2018Genetic).

## Structure
The NOL4 gene encodes a nucleolar protein with several splice variants, including NOL4-L, NOL4-S, and NOL4-SΔ, which differ in their molecular structure and function (TakayanagiKiya2014Splicing; TakayanagiKiya2017Mblk1). NOL4-L and NOL4-S contain a conserved nuclear localization sequence (NLS), which is absent in NOL4-SΔ (TakayanagiKiya2017Mblk1). All variants share a conserved coiled-coil domain at the C-terminus, which is a structural feature that may facilitate protein-protein interactions (TakayanagiKiya2017Mblk1).

The presence of the NLS in NOL4-L and NOL4-S suggests these variants are directed to the nucleus, while the absence of this sequence in NOL4-SΔ may affect its subcellular localization and function (TakayanagiKiya2014Splicing). The coiled-coil domain is a common structural motif that can contribute to the protein's tertiary structure by promoting the formation of stable, elongated structures.

NOL4 is expressed in the human brain and testis, and its expression in the nucleoli of cultured cells suggests a role in nucleolar functions (TakayanagiKiya2017Mblk1). The specific molecular functions of NOL4 remain uncharacterized, but its structural features and splice variants indicate potential roles in transcription regulation and protein interactions (TakayanagiKiya2017Mblk1).

## Function
The NOL4 gene encodes a nucleolar protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily within the nucleolus. In healthy human cells, NOL4 is implicated in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing, contributing to protein synthesis and cell cycle regulation. This protein is expressed in specific tissues, including the brain and testis, suggesting a role in brain and testis-specific functions (TakayanagiKiya2014Splicing). 

NOL4 has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene, with studies indicating its methylation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) but not in normal tissues, suggesting its silencing in cancer (DEMOKAN2013Validation). The gene's expression during development, particularly in the lip and palate regions, indicates its involvement in facial development, although its exact function in these processes remains unclear (Kumari2018Genetic).

In mice, NOL4 is expressed in the adult testis and brain, as well as during lip and palate development, supporting its developmental role (Kumari2018Genetic). The gene's expression pattern and potential interactions with transcription factors suggest it may play a role in tissue-selective transcription regulation (TakayanagiKiya2014Splicing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NOL4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably van der Woude syndrome (VWS) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In the context of VWS, a rare intronic variant in the NOL4 gene was identified in a family affected by the syndrome. This variant was found to create a binding site for the miRNA hsa-miR-4796-5p, leading to a significant reduction in NOL4 expression. This downregulation is believed to interfere with normal lip and palate development, contributing to the VWS phenotype (Kumari2018Genetic).

In head and neck cancer, specifically HNSCC, the NOL4 gene has been identified as a novel methylated tumor suppressor gene. The promoter region of NOL4 is highly methylated in tumor samples, while it remains unmethylated in normal tissues. This cancer-specific methylation pattern suggests that NOL4 may serve as a biomarker for HNSCC, with its methylation leading to transcriptional silencing and contributing to tumorigenesis (DEMOKAN2013Validation). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NOL4 in both genetic syndromes and cancer, emphasizing its role in disease through altered gene expression and epigenetic modifications.

## Interactions
NOL4 (nucleolar protein 4) is known to interact with several proteins, particularly the murine homologs of the Mblk-1 transcription factor family, Mlr1 and Mlr2. NOL4 has three splicing variants: NOL4-L, NOL4-S, and NOL4-SΔ, which exhibit different binding properties and regulatory effects on these proteins. NOL4-S binds strongly to both Mlr1 and Mlr2, while NOL4-SΔ binds only to Mlr1 (TakayanagiKiya2014Splicing; TakayanagiKiya2017Mblk1). The presence of a conserved nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in NOL4-S is crucial for its interaction with Mlr2 but not necessary for binding with Mlr1 (TakayanagiKiya2014Splicing).

These interactions influence the transcriptional activities of Mlr1 and Mlr2. NOL4-S suppresses the transactivation activity of both Mlr1 and Mlr2, whereas NOL4-SΔ suppresses Mlr1 and enhances the transcriptional activity of Mlr2 (TakayanagiKiya2014Splicing; TakayanagiKiya2017Mblk1). The differential effects of these splicing variants suggest that NOL4 plays a significant role in modulating the transcriptional regulation mediated by Mlr proteins, potentially through direct binding and conformational changes or indirect mechanisms involving other interacting proteins like CtBP1 (TakayanagiKiya2017Mblk1).
