# ZAN

## Overview
The ZAN gene encodes zonadhesin, a sperm-specific adhesion protein that plays a pivotal role in the fertilization process by mediating species-specific binding of sperm to the zona pellucida (ZP), the extracellular matrix surrounding the egg. Zonadhesin is a mosaic protein characterized by a complex domain architecture, including MAM (meprin/A5 antigen/mu receptor tyrosine phosphatase), mucin-like, and von Willebrand factor D domains, which contribute to its function in sperm-egg adhesion (Gao1998Species; Herlyn2008The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and oligomerization, enhancing its binding affinity to the ZP and facilitating successful fertilization (Herlyn2008The). Zonadhesin's role in species-specific gamete recognition is crucial for reproductive success and maintaining biological diversity (Herlyn2008The).

## Structure
Zonadhesin (ZAN) is a mosaic protein characterized by a complex domain architecture. In humans, the ZAN protein includes a signal peptide, two MAM (meprin/A5 antigen/mu receptor tyrosine phosphatase) domains, a mucin-like domain, and four complete D domains homologous to von Willebrand factor D domains. The C-terminus features an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a transmembrane segment, and a short basic tail (Herlyn2008The). The primary structure of ZAN is marked by these domains, which contribute to its role in sperm-egg adhesion.

The secondary and tertiary structures are influenced by the presence of these domains, which form extended and flexible regions. The MAM domains are implicated in cell adhesion processes, while the mucin-like domain is rich in specific amino acids that may facilitate cell-cell interactions (Gao1998Species). The D domains, particularly D1-4, have strong zona pellucida binding affinity, and the presence of conserved motifs like CXXC suggests potential self-oligomerization (Herlyn2008The).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in ZAN, particularly in the mucin-like domain, which may affect its binding properties and structural integrity (BI2003Processing). These modifications and the protein's oligomerization state are crucial for its function in sperm adhesion (Herlyn2008The).

## Function
The ZAN gene encodes zonadhesin, a sperm-specific protein that plays a critical role in the fertilization process by mediating the species-specific binding of sperm to the zona pellucida (ZP), the extracellular matrix surrounding the egg (Herlyn2008The; Gasper2006Molecular). Zonadhesin is localized on the sperm head and is involved in the initial recognition and adhesion to the ZP, facilitating successful fertilization (Herlyn2008The). The protein is composed of multiple domains, including VWD, MAM, and mucin-like domains, which contribute to its binding activity and interaction with the ZP (Herlyn2008The; Gasper2006Molecular).

Zonadhesin undergoes posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation and oligomerization, which are crucial for its activation and function (Herlyn2008The). These modifications enhance the protein's binding avidity to the ZP, which is essential for sperm to penetrate the ZP and reach the egg cell membrane (Herlyn2008The). The protein's dynamic redistribution during spermatogenesis and epididymal maturation suggests its involvement in the post-acrosomal reaction rather than in cell adhesion (Herlyn2008The). Zonadhesin's role in species-specific gamete recognition is vital for maintaining biological diversity and reproductive success (Herlyn2008The).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Zonadhesin (ZAN) is a sperm-specific protein that plays a crucial role in sperm-egg interactions, particularly in binding to the zona pellucida (ZP) of the egg. ZAN is composed of multiple domains, including MAM, mucin-like, and D domains, which contribute to its binding activity. The D1-4 domains of ZAN have been shown to have strong ZP binding activity, and there is indirect evidence suggesting that MAM domains may also be involved in ZP binding (Herlyn2008The). 

ZAN undergoes processing into subunits, glycosylation, and oligomerization, which are crucial for its activation. The formation of dimers and higher molecular oligomers, particularly involving subunits II and III, enhances ZP binding avidity (Herlyn2008The). In pigs, ZAN exists in different molecular weight forms, such as p45 and p105, which are derived from a single precursor molecule. These forms are stabilized by disulfide bonds and exhibit ZP binding activity (Hickox2001Heterogeneous). 

ZAN can form multimers, but these do not bind the ZP as effectively as the monomeric form. The presence of a conserved CG(L/V)CG sequence motif in ZAN's D1, D2, and D3 domains suggests a role in oligomerization, similar to von Willebrand factor and porcine submaxillary mucin (Hickox2001Heterogeneous).
