# LPAR3

## Overview
Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (LPAR3) is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) known as lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains and is involved in a variety of cellular signaling pathways. LPAR3 primarily interacts with Gαi/o and Gαq/11 protein types, playing a crucial role in processes such as calcium mobilization and adenylyl cyclase inhibition. The receptor is implicated in numerous physiological functions, including cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as in embryonic development and hematopoiesis. LPAR3's involvement in cancer progression and chemoresistance, as well as its role in neuropathic pain, highlights its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic; Solís2024Lysophosphatidic; Solís2024Lysophosphatidica).

## Structure
The LPAR3 gene encodes the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. These domains are connected by three intracellular loops and three extracellular loops, with an extracellular amino terminus and an intracellular carboxyl terminus (Solís2024Lysophosphatidic; Solís2024LPA3). The receptor primarily interacts with Gαi/o and Gαq/11 protein types, which are involved in various signaling pathways, including calcium mobilization and adenylyl cyclase inhibition (Solís2024Lysophosphatidic).

Phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification of LPA3, occurring at specific sites in the intracellular loop 3 and the carboxyl terminus. These sites include S221, T224, S225, S229 in the intracellular loop 3, and S321, S325, S331, T333, S335, Y337, S343 in the carboxyl terminus (Solís2024LPA3; Solís2024Lysophosphatidica). Phosphorylation at these sites is crucial for receptor desensitization, internalization, and interaction with β-arrestins, which are involved in receptor regulation and signaling (Solís2024Lysophosphatidic; Solís2024LPA3). The phosphorylation barcode hypothesis suggests that different phosphorylation patterns can lead to distinct functional outcomes for the receptor (Solís2024LPA3).

## Function
Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (LPAR3) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various cellular and physiological processes. It primarily interacts with G protein types Gαi/o and Gαq/11, which are involved in adenylyl cyclase inhibition and calcium mobilization, triggering diverse signaling pathways (Solís2024Lysophosphatidic). LPAR3 is implicated in processes such as chemotaxis, migration, proliferation, and differentiation, and is crucial for embryo implantation and the determination of vertebrate left-right patterning during embryogenesis (Solís2024Lysophosphatidic; Solís2024Lysophosphatidica).

In the context of hematopoiesis, LPAR3 is essential for erythropoiesis, particularly at the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor stage. Activation of LPAR3 promotes erythroid differentiation and increases erythrocyte production, which is vital for maintaining hematic homeostasis (Chiang2021Lysophosphatidic). LPAR3 activation also plays a protective role against oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, by enhancing the expression of anti-ferroptosis genes (Huang2024Lysophosphatidic).

LPAR3 is active in the cell membrane and is involved in both immediate membrane signaling and a second wave of endosomal signaling, although the latter is less documented (Solís2024Lysophosphatidic). Its phosphorylation is an early event in the desensitization of G protein-mediated signaling, which is crucial for receptor regulation and function (Solís2024Lysophosphatidic).

## Clinical Significance
LPAR3 is implicated in various cancers, including ovarian, colon, liver, lung, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In ovarian cancer, LPAR3 overexpression is associated with poor survival, promoting cell expansion and invasion through mechanisms like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic; Balijepalli2021Lysophosphatidic). In hepatocellular carcinoma, LPAR3 enhances cancer migration through the LPAR3-Gi-ERK/MAPK pathway and contributes to proliferation and invasion via the β-catenin pathway (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic). 

LPAR3 also plays a role in chemoresistance. In lung cancer, its knockdown increases survival rates in response to cisplatin treatment, while overexpression attenuates migration (Balijepalli2021Lysophosphatidic). In ovarian cancer, targeting LPAR3 with miR-15b can suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis via the PI3K/Akt pathway (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic). 

Beyond cancer, LPAR3 is involved in neuropathic pain, where it amplifies central LPA production via glial cells, contributing to chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic). These findings suggest that LPAR3 is a critical player in cancer progression and neuropathic pain, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
LPAR3, or lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3, is a G protein-coupled receptor that participates in various cellular interactions. It is involved in signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation, migration, and survival. LPAR3 interacts with G proteins to mediate these signaling pathways, including those involving Ras, Rac, Rho, and PI3K, which are crucial for promoting motility and invasiveness in several cancers, such as colon, liver, and lung cancers (Lin2021Lysophosphatidic).

In oral squamous carcinoma cells, LPAR3 is implicated in LPA-induced cell migration, where it interacts with protein kinase C (PKC) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways. This interaction is essential for the transactivation of EGFR, particularly in E10 cells, and is dependent on PKC activity (Brusevold2014Role). The receptor also engages in phosphorylation of signaling molecules such as Akt and ERK, which are critical for cell migration (Brusevold2014Role).

LPAR3's role extends to forming multiprotein complexes and interacting with integrins, which may further influence its signaling capabilities and cellular effects (Geraldo2021Role). These interactions highlight LPAR3's involvement in complex signaling networks that regulate various cellular processes.
