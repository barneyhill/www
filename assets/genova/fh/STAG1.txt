# STAG1

## Overview
STAG1 is a gene that encodes a protein component of the cohesin complex, which is integral to chromatin organization and sister chromatid cohesion. The STAG1 protein belongs to the HAWK-protein family, characterized by its α-helical hook-shaped structures, and plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression. As a part of the cohesin complex, STAG1 is involved in critical cellular processes such as chromosome segregation during cell division, DNA repair, and chromatin loop formation, which are essential for proper genome organization and function (Golov2024Cohesin; Di2021Novel). The gene's significance is underscored by its involvement in developmental processes, with mutations linked to cohesinopathies and various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Arruda2020Distinct; Di2021Novel).

## Structure
STAG1 is a component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for genome organization and chromatin loop formation. The protein is part of the HAWK-protein family, characterized by α-helical hook-shaped structures composed of approximately 20 tandem HEAT-repeats. Each HEAT-repeat consists of 30-40 amino acids organized as a pair of interacting antiparallel amphipathic α-helices, contributing to the protein's elongated shape (Golov2024Cohesin). STAG1 binds stably to the kleisin subunit and is a constitutive component of the cohesin complex, interacting with other cohesin components such as SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21 (Golov2024Cohesin).

The protein's structure includes several HEAT repeat domains, which are crucial for its function in the cohesin complex. These domains facilitate interactions with other cohesin subunits and are involved in the regulation of cohesin's ATPase activity, which is essential for chromatin loop extrusion (Golov2024Cohesin). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the function of STAG1, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The protein's role in genome architecture is linked to its ability to generate chromatin loops, with CTCF acting as a boundary element (Cuadrado2022Contribution).

## Function
The STAG1 gene encodes a subunit of the cohesin complex, which is essential for several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. This complex plays a vital role in chromosome segregation during cell division by ensuring sister chromatid cohesion, which is crucial for accurate chromosome alignment and separation (Di2021Novel). STAG1, as part of the cohesin complex, is involved in maintaining genomic stability, DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression (Di2021Novel). It contributes to chromatin architecture and is necessary for the proper distribution of genetic material to daughter cells during mitosis (Di2021Novel).

In terms of molecular activity, STAG1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it helps mediate the loading of cohesin onto chromatin. This function is crucial for the cohesin complex's role in DNA replication and repair, as well as in the regulation of gene transcription (Di2021Novel). The cohesin complex, including STAG1, also plays a role in chromatin loop formation, which is important for genome organization and gene expression regulation (AlonsoGil2023Different). STAG1's function is critical for normal development, as evidenced by developmental defects and embryonic lethality in knockout mice (Di2021Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STAG1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, collectively known as cohesinopathies. These disorders often present with developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and dysmorphic features. A specific frameshift mutation, c.2769_2770del p.(Ile924Serfs*8), has been identified in a patient with a syndromic form of neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by developmental delays, craniofacial dysmorphisms, and other physical anomalies. This mutation is classified as likely pathogenic and is a de novo event, meaning it was not inherited from the parents (Di2021Novel).

STAG1 mutations have also been implicated in various cancers. The gene is frequently mutated in cancers such as myeloid leukemia and glioblastoma, although its exact contribution to these diseases is not fully understood (Arruda2020Distinct). Altered expression of STAG1 is observed in several solid tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, breast, and ovarian cancers. The gene is upregulated in these cancers, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Giannini2003EGF‐; Rae2001Characterization). The overexpression and amplification of STAG1 in cancer cells are linked to the abnormal activation of pathways such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway, indicating its potential as a tumor marker (Giannini2003EGF‐).

## Interactions
STAG1 is a component of the cohesin complex, which plays a crucial role in chromatin organization and sister chromatid cohesion. It interacts with other cohesin subunits, including SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21. The interaction between STAG1 and RAD21 is particularly significant, as it involves a long, flat interface primarily formed through polar interactions, including hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. This interaction is essential for the cohesin complex's function in maintaining chromatid cohesion (van2020STAG1).

STAG1 also associates with CTCF, a transcriptional regulator, and is involved in chromatin looping and transcriptional control. It has a stronger affinity for CTCF compared to its paralog STAG2, allowing it to accumulate at CTCF sites even when NIPBL levels are reduced. This interaction helps prevent WAPL-mediated unloading of cohesin from chromatin (Gil2022Different).

In cancer contexts, STAG1 is a critical dependency in STAG2-mutated cells. The loss of both STAG1 and STAG2 leads to severe mitotic defects and apoptosis, highlighting a synthetic lethal interaction between these subunits. This interaction suggests potential therapeutic strategies targeting STAG1 in STAG2-deficient cancers (van2017Synthetic; van2020STAG1).
