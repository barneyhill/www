# USP47

## Overview
USP47, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 47, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein stability and cellular processes. The protein product of USP47 is categorized as a deubiquitinating enzyme, which functions by removing ubiquitin moieties from substrate proteins, thereby preventing their degradation via the proteasome. This enzymatic activity is crucial for various cellular functions, including DNA repair, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. USP47 is known to stabilize key proteins such as katanin-p60, E-cadherin, and β-catenin, influencing processes like neuronal development, epithelial cell adhesion, and Wnt signaling, respectively (Shi2015Deubiquitinase; Pan2021Role; Yang2013USP47). The gene's expression and activity have been implicated in several cancers, where it may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Pan2021Role; Silvestrini2020Proteomics).

## Structure
USP47, a ubiquitin-specific protease, is characterized by a catalytic domain that includes the Fingers, Palm, and Thumb subdomains, forming a conserved right-handed architecture. This structure is stabilized by a structural zinc ion coordinated by cysteine residues, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Shin2023Structural). The catalytic domain of USP47 is similar to that of other USPs, such as USP7, but with distinct differences in the blocking loops (BL1, BL2, and BL3) that contribute to its specificity and function (Shin2023Structural).

The primary structure of USP47 includes conserved cysteine and histidine residues essential for its catalytic activity. The secondary structure features an antiparallel β-sheet and several α-helices, which form a deep cleft for ubiquitin binding (Shin2023Structural). The tertiary structure involves significant conformational changes upon ubiquitin binding, particularly in the switching loop and blocking loops, which are critical for aligning the catalytic residues (Shin2023Structural).

USP47 also contains a non-catalytic C-terminal region with a conserved 'Hyd-xxx-Hyd' motif, which may stabilize certain structural regions (Shin2023Structural). This region is less conserved compared to USP7, which has additional ubiquitin-like domains that enhance its activity (Shin2023Structural; Piao2015Expression). The structural differences between USP47 and USP7, particularly in the binding surface and loop regions, are important for designing selective inhibitors (Shin2023Structural).

## Function
USP47 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 47) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining protein stability by removing ubiquitin from substrates, thereby preventing their degradation. In healthy human cells, USP47 is involved in several key molecular processes. It stabilizes katanin-p60, a protein essential for axonal growth, by deubiquitinating it, which is vital for neuronal development (Yang2013USP47). USP47 also contributes to cell adhesion by deubiquitinating E-cadherin, protecting it from degradation and maintaining epithelial cell adhesion (Pan2021Role).

In the context of DNA repair, USP47 deubiquitinates DNA polymerase β, a critical enzyme in the base excision repair pathway, thus playing a role in the DNA damage response and maintaining genomic stability (Pan2021Role; Piao2015Expression). Additionally, USP47 is involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling by stabilizing β-catenin, a key component of this pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and growth (Shi2015Deubiquitinase).

USP47 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes and organismal outcomes, such as cell proliferation and response to DNA damage (Pan2021Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of USP47 have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance. In colorectal cancer (CRC), USP47 is overexpressed in tumor tissues, correlating with lymph node metastasis and shorter survival. It influences cell proliferation, survival, and migration by regulating pathways such as Hippo, EMT, and P53 (Pan2021Role). Conversely, another study found that decreased USP47 expression in primary CRCs is associated with shorter disease-free survival, suggesting a complex role in CRC progression (Hou2021USP47Mediated).

In breast cancer, USP47 is highly expressed and associated with metastasis and lower survival rates. Its role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the deubiquitination of β-catenin and other EMT markers has been noted, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Silvestrini2020Proteomics).

USP47 is also implicated in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), where its expression is upregulated by BCR-ABL. Inhibition of USP47 reduces cell proliferation and drug resistance, suggesting its potential as a target to overcome tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance (Pan2021Role; Lei2021Targeting).

In gastric cancer, USP47 knockdown enhances drug sensitivity by modulating NF-κB signaling, indicating its role in chemoresistance (Naghavi2018Deubiquitinylase). These findings underscore the potential of targeting USP47 in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

## Interactions
USP47, a deubiquitinating enzyme, interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It binds to and stabilizes Y-box binding protein 1, which is involved in DNA damage repair in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (Lei2021Targeting). USP47 also interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, preventing its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby promoting Wnt signaling and cancer cell proliferation (Shi2015Deubiquitinase).

In colorectal cancer cells, USP47 stabilizes the transcription factor Snail, which is crucial for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) under hypoxic conditions. This interaction enhances Snail's stability, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and regulate EMT-related gene expression (Choi2017Hypoxia). USP47 also interacts with the Yes-associated protein (YAP), a major effector of the Hippo pathway, regulating its stability and promoting colorectal cancer progression (Pan2019USP47mediated).

Additionally, USP47 is involved in the regulation of katanin-p60, a microtubule-severing enzyme. It deubiquitinates and stabilizes katanin-p60, promoting axonal growth, while competing with the E3 ligase CHIP, which facilitates katanin-p60 degradation (Yang2013USP47).
