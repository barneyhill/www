# ANG

## Overview
The ANG gene encodes angiogenin, a secreted ribonuclease that plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels. Angiogenin is a member of the pancreatic ribonuclease family and is characterized by its unique structural features, including a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 14,400 Da and a tertiary structure stabilized by disulfide bonds (Strydom1985Amino; Leonidas1999Refined). Functionally, angiogenin is involved in promoting cell proliferation and migration by facilitating ribosomal RNA transcription in the nucleus and participating in tRNA metabolism in the cytoplasm (Sheng2016Three; Hoang2016Molecular). The protein's interactions with cell surface receptors, actin, and other proteins underscore its role in cellular processes and angiogenesis (Hu1997A; Hu1993Actin). Clinically, mutations in the ANG gene have been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Renton2013State).

## Structure
Angiogenin (ANG) is a protein characterized by a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 14,400 Da, consisting of 123 amino acid residues (Strydom1985Amino). The primary structure of ANG shows significant homology to the pancreatic ribonuclease family, with conserved active-site residues such as His-12, His-119, and Lys-41, which are crucial for its catalytic activity (Strydom1985Amino). 

The secondary structure of ANG includes a combination of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a kidney-shaped tertiary fold divided into two lobes. Lobe I consists of four antiparallel β-strands and two helices, while Lobe II contains a β-sheet and two helices (Leonidas1999Refined). The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by three disulfide bonds, fewer than those found in pancreatic RNases (Leonidas1999Refined). 

ANG lacks a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. It does not undergo significant post-translational modifications, except for the formation of pyroglutamic acid at the N-terminus (Riordan1997Structure). The protein's unique structural features, such as the absence of strand B2 and differences in helix H2, contribute to its distinct physiological properties, including its role in neovascularization during tumor growth (Leonidas1999Refined).

## Function
Angiogenin (ANG) is a secreted ribonuclease that plays a significant role in promoting angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, by stimulating cell proliferation and migration. In healthy human cells, ANG is involved in several molecular processes, primarily through its activity in the nucleus and cytoplasm. ANG is internalized into cells and translocates to the nucleus, where it promotes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription, a critical step for cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Hoang2016Molecular; Kishimoto2004Endogenous). This process involves the cleavage of promoter-associated RNA, which derepresses rDNA transcription by preventing the recruitment of the nucleolar remodeling complex (Hoang2016Molecular).

ANG's ribonucleolytic activity, although weaker than that of RNase A, is essential for its function in neovascularization and is regulated by phosphorylation, which facilitates its nuclear translocation (Hoang2016Molecular). In the cytoplasm, ANG is involved in tRNA metabolism, where it cleaves tRNA to form tiRNA in response to stress, aiding in protein translation reprogramming and cell survival (Sheng2016Three). ANG's activity is crucial for endothelial cell proliferation and is necessary for the angiogenic activity of other growth factors like bFGF and VEGF (Kishimoto2004Endogenous).

## Clinical Significance
The ANG gene, encoding angiogenin, has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), though its role remains ambiguous. Mutations in ANG have been identified in both familial and sporadic ALS cases, but the evidence for its involvement in ALS pathogenesis is not definitive (Renton2013State). Specific mutations, such as c.122A>T/p.Lys41Ile (K17I), have been found in families with dominant inheritance patterns, although these mutations have also been observed in healthy individuals, complicating their interpretation (Millecamps2010SOD1). Other variants, like c.232A>G/p.Lys78Glu (K54E) and c.434G>A/p.Arg145His (R121H), have been reported in ALS cases but were not consistently found in affected relatives, suggesting a complex genetic contribution to the disease (Millecamps2010SOD1).

The ANG gene's role in ALS is further complicated by its interaction with other genetic mutations. For instance, some individuals carrying ANG mutations also possess mutations in the FUS gene, indicating potential overlapping genetic contributions to ALS (Millecamps2010SOD1). Despite these findings, the precise mechanisms by which ANG mutations contribute to ALS remain unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance (Renton2013State).

## Interactions
Angiogenin (ANG) is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in angiogenesis and cellular processes. ANG binds specifically to a 170-kDa cell surface protein on endothelial cells, which is suggested to be a putative receptor. This interaction is crucial for ANG-stimulated cell growth and is concentration-dependent (Hu1997A). The binding of ANG to this receptor is specific and can be inhibited by excess unlabeled angiogenin, confirming the specificity of the interaction (Hu1997A).

ANG also interacts with actin, a ubiquitous protein involved in cell structure and motility. This interaction induces actin polymerization, which is significant for angiogenic processes, as it can lead to cell migration and proliferation (Hu1993Actin). The binding of ANG to actin is strong, with a dissociation constant of 0.5 nM, indicating a robust interaction (Hu1993Actin).

Additionally, ANG interacts with fibulin 1, an extracellular matrix protein, which may play a role in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis (zhang2008interaction). ANG also binds to FHL3, a protein that influences its nuclear translocation and is necessary for ANG-mediated cell proliferation (Xia2012Identification). These interactions highlight ANG's multifaceted role in cellular processes and angiogenesis.
