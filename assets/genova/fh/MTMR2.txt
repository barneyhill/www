# MTMR2

## Overview
MTMR2 is a gene that encodes the myotubularin-related protein 2, a phosphoinositide phosphatase involved in critical cellular processes such as phosphoinositide metabolism and membrane dynamics. This protein is categorized as a phosphatase due to its enzymatic activity, which includes dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2). Myotubularin-related protein 2 plays a significant role in endosomal trafficking and synaptic function, particularly in neurons and Schwann cells, where it is essential for maintaining myelin sheath integrity and nerve function. Mutations in the MTMR2 gene are linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B1, a hereditary neuropathy characterized by demyelination and nerve conduction deficits (Bolis2005Loss; Berger2003Loss). The protein's structure includes domains crucial for its function, such as a PH-GRAM domain for membrane association and a coiled-coil domain for dimerization, which are vital for its regulatory roles in cellular homeostasis (Bolis2007MyotubularinRelated; gegenschatz2012structural).

## Structure
MTMR2, or myotubularin-related protein 2, is a phosphatase involved in phosphoinositide metabolism. The protein's molecular structure includes several key domains: a PH-GRAM domain, a phosphatase domain, and a coiled-coil domain. The PH-GRAM domain, located at the N terminus, is essential for binding to phosphoinositides and mediating membrane association (Bolis2007MyotubularinRelated; gegenschatz2012structural). The phosphatase domain, which spans amino acids 205-580, is responsible for the protein's enzymatic activity, specifically dephosphorylating phosphoinositides like PI-3-P and PI-3,5-P2 (Bolis2007MyotubularinRelated; gegenschatz2012structural). The coiled-coil domain at the C terminus facilitates homodimerization, which is crucial for its function and membrane localization (gegenschatz2012structural).

MTMR2 also features a PDZ binding motif, which is important for protein-protein interactions, particularly with proteins like Sap97/Dlg1 and Psd-95/Sap90 (gegenschatz2012structural). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Serine 58, regulate its subcellular localization and interaction with other proteins (Franklin2011Endosomal). The protein can form both homodimers and heterodimers, interacting with inactive members of the myotubularin family, which influences its catalytic activity and substrate specificity (gegenschatz2012structural).

## Function
MTMR2 is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that plays a critical role in the regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism, specifically dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) (Begley2006Molecular; Berger2006Multilevel). This activity is essential for endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics, processes crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper nerve function (Robinson2006Myotubularin; Hnia2012Myotubularin).

In neurons, MTMR2 is involved in maintaining excitatory synapses by modulating endosomal traffic. It interacts with PSD-95, a synaptic scaffolding protein, which localizes MTMR2 to dendritic spines and synaptic membranes, thereby influencing synaptic function and plasticity (Lee2010The). MTMR2's phosphatase activity is crucial for its role in these processes, as demonstrated by the reduction in synapse density and function upon MTMR2 knockdown, which can be rescued by wild-type MTMR2 but not by mutants lacking phosphatase activity (Lee2010The).

In Schwann cells, MTMR2 is involved in myelin growth and maintenance, interacting with proteins like FIG4 to regulate phosphoinositide homeostasis, which is vital for nerve function (Hnia2012Myotubularin). Its activity is also linked to the regulation of myelin sheath structure, with deficiencies leading to neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Robinson2006Myotubularin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MTMR2 gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B1 (CMT4B1), a severe hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. CMT4B1 is characterized by demyelination, focally folded myelin sheaths, and reduced nerve conduction velocity, leading to muscle weakness and sensory loss (Bolis2005Loss; Berger2003Loss). The disease often results in severe progressive muscular weakness, sensory loss, and decreased nerve conduction velocity, frequently leading to mobility loss and wheelchair dependency by the second or third decade of life (Wang2019GenotypePhenotype). 

MTMR2 mutations disrupt the homeostasis of phosphatidylinositol phosphates, leading to altered myelin growth and myelin outfolding, which are believed to be the mechanisms behind CMT4B1 (Wang2019GenotypePhenotype). The loss of MTMR2 phosphatase activity in Schwann cells, rather than motor neurons, is sufficient to cause CMT4B1 neuropathy, suggesting that therapeutic approaches could target Schwann cells specifically (Bolis2005Loss). 

The severity of CMT4B1 is influenced by the type of mutation in MTMR2, with frameshift and nonsense mutations leading to more severe phenotypes due to the loss of critical protein domains (Pareyson2019A; Wang2019GenotypePhenotype).

## Interactions
MTMR2 interacts with several proteins that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It forms stable homodimers and does not heterodimerize or tetramerize with myotubularin-related protein-13/set-binding factor-2 (SBF2), although SBF2 significantly enhances MTMR2's phosphatase activity (Berger2006Multilevel). MTMR2 also interacts with Discs large 1 (Dlg1), a scaffolding protein involved in polarized trafficking and membrane addition. This interaction is essential for maintaining myelin structure in Schwann cells, as evidenced by the rescue of myelin outfoldings upon MTMR2 replacement (Bolis2009Dlg1). Dlg1 serves as a scaffold platform coordinating the functions of Sec8 and MTMR2 to maintain membrane homeostasis (Bolis2009Dlg1).

MTMR2 is also involved in a complex with the kinesin kif13B and the Sec8 exocyst component, which are involved in vesicle trafficking and membrane tethering, respectively. Kif13B transports Dlg1 to sites of membrane remodeling, where Dlg1 interacts with Sec8 and MTMR2 to control myelination (Bolis2009Dlg1). These interactions highlight MTMR2's role in regulating membrane dynamics and maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the context of Schwann cell myelination.
