# CCDC174

## Overview
CCDC174 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 174 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neural development and muscle function. The protein is a component of the exon junction complex (EJC), playing a significant role in RNA processing, nonsense-mediated decay, and translation. It interacts with EIF4A3, a core component of the EJC, and is localized in the cell nucleus, where it participates in essential molecular processes (Volodarsky2015CDC174). Mutations in the CCDC174 gene have been linked to developmental disorders, including congenital hypotonia and psychomotor developmental delay, due to its critical role in neural and muscle development (Volodarsky2015CDC174). Additionally, CCDC174 expression levels have been associated with fertility in bulls, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for reproductive success (Selvaraju2020Orchestrating).

## Function
CCDC174 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that plays a critical role in neural development and muscle function. It is a component of the exon junction complex, which is involved in RNA processing, nonsense-mediated decay, and translation. CCDC174 interacts with EIF4A3, a core component of this complex, as confirmed by co-localization studies and yeast-two-hybrid assays (Volodarsky2015CDC174). The protein is localized to the cell nucleus, where it likely participates in these molecular processes (Volodarsky2015CDC174).

In functional studies using Xenopus embryos, knockdown of the CCDC174 ortholog resulted in defects in neural fold closure and reduced expression of neural markers, indicating its essential role in early neural plate patterning and neuron formation. The wild-type human CCDC174 protein was able to rescue these defects, highlighting its importance in normal neural development (Volodarsky2015CDC174).

Mutations in CCDC174 can lead to significant developmental disorders, such as a syndrome characterized by hypotonia and psychomotor developmental delay. This is due to the mutation's impact on neural development and muscle function, as evidenced by the depletion of RYR1 and myopathic changes in skeletal muscle (Volodarsky2015CDC174).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC174 gene are associated with a syndrome characterized by congenital hypotonia and psychomotor developmental delay. A specific mutation, c.1404A>G, p.(*468Trpext*6), results in the loss of a stop codon, extending the CCDC174 protein by six amino acids. This mutation has been identified in individuals of Jewish-Ethiopian and Bedouin descent and is linked to significant developmental disorders. Functional studies in Xenopus embryos have shown that knockdown of CCDC174 leads to defects in neural development and embryonic lethality, which can be rescued by the wild-type human CCDC174 protein but not by the mutant form. The mutant protein also causes rapid apoptosis and nuclear aggregation, disrupting normal neural development (Volodarsky2015CDC174).

Alterations in CCDC174 expression levels have been linked to bull fertility. Higher expression levels of CCDC174 are observed in high-fertility bulls compared to sub-fertile ones, suggesting its role as a potential biomarker for fertility. CCDC174 interacts with proteins involved in RNA processing and sperm maturation, indicating its influence on translation and RNA decay processes, which are crucial for reproductive success (Selvaraju2020Orchestrating).

## Interactions
CCDC174 is known to interact with EIF4A3, a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC). This interaction was demonstrated through a yeast-two-hybrid assay, which showed that both wild-type and mutant forms of CCDC174 can interact with EIF4A3. The proteins are co-localized in the nucleus, as observed in transfection experiments with neuroblastoma cells. Overexpression of the mutant CCDC174 protein in these cells led to rapid apoptosis, indicating that the interaction with EIF4A3 may be crucial for cell survival (Volodarsky2015CDC174).

In addition to its interaction with EIF4A3, CCDC174 is implicated in translation-dependent mechanisms through its interaction with PPP1R35. This interaction may play a role in regulating epididymal sperm maturation and motility, as suggested by studies on bull fertility. The expression levels of CCDC174 are significantly correlated with bull fertility, highlighting its potential role in reproductive processes (Selvaraju2020Orchestrating).

The mutation in CCDC174, c.1404A>G, p.[*468Trpext*6], affects its function, leading to developmental issues such as hypotonia and psychomotor delay. This mutation also results in the depletion of RYR1 and myopathic changes in skeletal muscle, further emphasizing the importance of CCDC174's interactions in maintaining normal physiological functions (Volodarsky2015CDC174).
