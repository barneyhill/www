# COX7B2

## Overview
The COX7B2 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7B2, a protein that is a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase. This complex is crucial for the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. As a subunit of this complex, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7B2 plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity and functional efficiency of the enzyme. The gene's expression and the protein's function are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including energy metabolism and mitochondrial-related diseases (Čunátová2020Role; de2023Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the COX7B2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. COX7B2 is associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it is involved in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of liver cells (de2023Mutations). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a rare alteration in COX7B2 has been linked to a high risk of developing the disease, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in Chinese patients, including a His26Gln substitution (Čunátová2020Role; Xiong2010Identification).

In breast cancer, COX7B2 has not been previously associated, but recent studies suggest its potential impact on cancer progression through its role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and the Warburg Effect (de2023Mutations). The gene is also implicated in type 2 diabetes, with significant associations found in a genome-wide association study, suggesting a genetic contribution to the disease (Al2013A).

COX7B2 is involved in cancer pathways and mitochondrial diseases, with its altered expression linked to processes such as apoptosis, epithelial tissue development, and angiogenesis (de2023Mutations). These findings highlight the gene's potential role in various pathologies related to mitochondrial dysfunction.
