# DCAF6

## Overview
DCAF6, or DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 6, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as an adaptor within the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its role in facilitating interactions between the ligase complex and its substrates. The DCAF6 protein is characterized by the presence of WD40-repeat domains and an H-box motif, which are essential for its interaction with DDB1, a core component of the ubiquitin ligase complex (Li2009A; Zhou2020Cullin). These structural features enable DCAF6 to participate in the regulation of various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation (Mistry2020Expression). The protein's activity is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology, where it has been implicated in the stabilization of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer, highlighting its potential role as a tumor promoter (Chen2017NRIPDCAF6).

## Structure
DCAF6 is a protein that functions as an adaptor in the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It is part of the DCAF family, which includes proteins that often contain WD40-repeat domains. These domains are crucial for mediating interactions with DDB1, a key component of the complex, through a conserved 'WDXR' or 'DXR' structural region (Zhou2020Cullin). The WD40-repeat domain typically forms a beta-propeller structure, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Zimmerman2010Structural).

DCAF6 also contains an H-box motif, a 13 amino acid sequence predicted to adopt an α-helical secondary structure. This motif is important for binding to DDB1 and is characterized by specific residues at certain positions, such as hydrophobic residues at positions 2, 3, and 6, and a Val/Leu/Ile residue at position 11 (Li2009A). The interaction of DCAF6 with DDB1 likely involves a bipartite interface, utilizing both the H-box motif and the WD40-repeat domain.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity and interactions of DCAF6. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of DCAF6 can result in structural and functional diversity, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
DCAF6 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 6) functions as an adaptor protein within the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is crucial for targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination, leading to their subsequent degradation by the proteasome. DCAF6 plays a significant role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and helps maintain genomic stability (Mistry2020Expression).

In healthy human cells, DCAF6 is involved in the ubiquitination of target proteins, a process essential for controlling protein levels and activity within the cell. This regulation is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins, which could lead to cellular dysfunction or disease (Mistry2020Expression). The activity of DCAF6 in the nucleus underscores its role in transcriptional regulation, where it may influence the expression of genes involved in critical cellular pathways (Mistry2020Expression). Through these mechanisms, DCAF6 contributes to the proper functioning of cellular processes and the overall maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
DCAF6 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In prostate cancer, DCAF6, also known as NRIP, acts as a transcriptional cofactor that enhances androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcriptional activity and protects AR from proteasome degradation. This interaction is significant because it competes with DNA damage binding protein 2 (DDB2) for AR binding, suggesting that DCAF6 functions as a tumor promoter while DDB2 acts as a tumor suppressor. The imbalance between DCAF6 and DDB2 may contribute to aggressive forms of prostate cancer (Chen2017NRIPDCAF6).

DCAF6 is also overexpressed in prostate cancer, indicating its involvement in the onset and progression of this malignancy. The mechanisms by which DCAF6 contributes to cancer include destabilizing tumor suppressors and regulating cell cycle progression, genomic instability, and apoptosis (Cheng2019The). Additionally, DCAF6 is involved in modulating the activity of the Cul4A/DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase towards the androgen receptor, which is crucial for nucleosome assembly and maintaining sufficient histone supply during DNA replication. This role in histone density and cell proliferation further underscores its significance in cancer biology (Bruhn2022Cancer).

## Interactions
DCAF6, also known as NRIP, is involved in stabilizing the androgen receptor (AR) protein in prostate cancer by interacting with the DDB1-CUL4A complex. It competes with DDB2 for binding sites on this complex, which is crucial for its role in preventing AR degradation. DCAF6 binds to DDB1 through a double DxR box, a motif essential for this interaction, and can also directly associate with AR, stabilizing it independently of DDB1 interaction (Chen2017NRIPDCAF6).

In prostate cancer cell lines, DCAF6's competition with DDB2 for AR binding is significant, particularly in cribriform prostate cancer, where low levels of DDB2 and high levels of DCAF6 and AR are observed. This interaction is demonstrated through experiments such as co-transfection and GST-pull down assays, which show the competitive binding of DCAF6 and DDB2 to AR (Chen2017NRIPDCAF6).

DCAF6 also modulates the activity of the Cul4A/DDB1 complex towards the androgen receptor, which is important for nucleosome assembly through the ubiquitylation of histone H3 on lysine 56. Depletion of DCAF6 affects histone dosage and cell proliferation, indicating its role in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly (Bruhn2022Cancer).
