# LIN7C

## Overview
LIN7C is a gene that encodes the protein lin-7 homolog C, a component of the crumbs cell polarity complex. This protein is integral to maintaining cell polarity and epithelial cell organization, as well as playing a significant role in synaptic function and neuronal development. Lin-7 homolog C is characterized by the presence of PDZ and L27 domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins, such as IRSp53, and contribute to its scaffolding function. These interactions are crucial for processes like neuritogenesis and synaptic vesicle trafficking. The protein's involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration highlights its importance in cellular dynamics and its potential implications in various diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (Han2022miRNA‑124; Crespi2012LIN7).

## Structure
LIN7C, also known as lin-7 homolog C, is a protein that plays a role in cell polarity and synaptic function. It is characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain, which is crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions, particularly with the C-terminal residues of interacting proteins (ferrari2015role; Crespi2012LIN7). This domain allows LIN7C to interact with various proteins, including IRSp53, and is essential for its role in neurite outgrowth and filopodia formation (ferrari2015role; Crespi2012LIN7).

LIN7C also contains an L27 domain, which is important for its association with plasma membrane protein complexes and for recruiting IRSp53 to specific cellular locations (Crespi2012LIN7; Kamijo2019Scaffold). The L27 domain is involved in forming heterodimeric complexes with other proteins, contributing to its scaffolding function (Kamijo2019Scaffold).

The protein has a predicted molecular weight of 22 kDa, as determined by immunoblotting (Crespi2012LIN7). LIN7C may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. Splice variant isoforms of LIN7C exist, potentially altering its structural and functional properties.

## Function
The LIN7C gene encodes a protein that is a component of the crumbs cell polarity complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cell polarity and epithelial cell organization. In human retinal pigment epithelial cells, LIN7C is involved in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration. Overexpression of LIN7C suppresses EMT by increasing the expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and ZO-1, while decreasing mesenchymal markers like fibronectin and α-SMA. This regulation is essential for maintaining epithelial characteristics and inhibiting cell migration, which are vital for healthy cell function (Han2022miRNA‑124).

In neuronal cells, LIN7C is critical for the formation of filopodia and neurites, structures important for cell movement and morphology. It interacts with IRSp53, a protein that promotes these structures, through its PDZ and L27 domains. This interaction is necessary for the proper localization and function of IRSp53 at the tips of actin-filled protrusions, supporting neuritogenesis and potentially influencing neurodevelopmental processes (Crespi2012LIN7). LIN7C also plays a role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release, contributing to neuronal signaling and communication (ferrari2015role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the LIN7C gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration, LIN7C plays a significant role in human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Overexpression of LIN7C suppresses EMT and cell migration, while its knockdown enhances these processes. This regulation is particularly relevant in conditions like proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), where EMT contributes to disease progression (Han2022miRNA‑124).

LIN7C is also involved in neurodevelopmental processes through its interaction with IRSp53, a protein that promotes the formation of filopodia and neurites. Altered expression of LIN7C can disrupt these interactions, potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Crespi2012LIN7). The absence or downregulation of LIN7C leads to impaired formation of neuronal structures, which may be linked to synaptic dysfunctions and psychiatric conditions (Crespi2012LIN7).

These findings suggest that LIN7C is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions, and its dysregulation can have significant pathological consequences in both ocular and neurological contexts.

## Interactions
LIN7C, a component of the crumbs cell polarity complex, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in maintaining cell polarity and synaptic organization. LIN7C interacts with IRSp53, a protein involved in the formation of filopodia and neurites. This interaction is mediated through LIN7C's PDZ and L27 domains, which are essential for the recruitment of IRSp53 to plasma membrane complexes, facilitating the formation of actin-rich protrusions necessary for neuritogenesis (Crespi2012LIN7).

In the context of mouse seminiferous tubules, LIN7C interacts with membrane palmitoylated protein 6 (MPP6). This interaction is important for the transport and stabilization of LIN7C in germ cells, as evidenced by reduced LIN7C expression in MPP6-deficient mice. LIN7C forms a tripartite complex with MAGUK proteins such as MPP7 and Dlg1, which are critical for cell-cell adhesion and tissue homeostasis (Kamijo2019Scaffold).

LIN7C also interacts with the solute carrier protein SLC43A2, where its PDZ domain binds to the intracellular C-terminal tail of SLC43A2. This interaction is part of the regulatory mechanism for SLC43A2 trafficking, affecting its localization and distribution in the plasma membrane (Frommelt2024The).
