# TMEM62

## Overview
Transmembrane protein 62 (TMEM62) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. These proteins are integral components of cellular membranes and play crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling and transport. TMEM62 is involved in the structural organization of the membrane and may participate in cellular communication and signaling pathways. Although the specific functions and interactions of TMEM62 are not fully elucidated, its role in the membrane suggests it could be significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating intercellular interactions. Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance and potential implications of TMEM62 in human health and disease.
