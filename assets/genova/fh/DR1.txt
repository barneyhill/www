# DR1

## Overview
The DR1 gene encodes the protein known as down-regulator of transcription 1, which functions as a transcriptional repressor. This protein plays a critical role in modulating gene expression by interacting with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a key component of the transcription factor TFIID. DR1 is characterized by its ability to inhibit the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex, thereby repressing transcription from both TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters. The protein achieves this through its TBP-binding domain and a glutamine-alanine-rich repression domain, which are essential for its repressive activity. DR1 forms a complex with DRAP1, enhancing its ability to prevent the entry of transcription factors TFIIA and TFIIB into the preinitiation complex, thus inhibiting active transcription complex formation. This mechanism underscores DR1's role as a general repressor of transcription, influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and differentiation (Mermelstein1996Requirement; Yeung1994Structurefunction).

## Structure
The DR1 protein is a transcriptional repressor that interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and forms a complex with DRAP1. Its structure includes several key domains essential for its function. The TBP-binding domain, located between amino acids 85 and 99, is crucial for anchoring DR1 to the promoter and facilitating interaction with TBP (Yeung1997Functional; Yeung1994Structurefunction). This domain is described as a 20-amino-acid amphipathic helical region (Yeung1994Structurefunction).

The protein also contains a glutamine-alanine (QA)-rich repression domain between amino acids 144 and 157, which is necessary for transcriptional repression (Yeung1997Functional; Yeung1994Structurefunction). The histone fold motif at the amino terminus is essential for interaction with DRAP1, enhancing DR1-mediated repression (Mermelstein1996Requirement).

DR1 does not possess DNA-binding activity and relies on its interaction with TBP for promoter tethering (Yeung1994Structurefunction). The protein's interaction with DRAP1 is critical for its repressive function, as DRAP1 enhances the repression by disrupting transcription factor interactions at the promoter level (Mermelstein1996Requirement). The DR1-DRAP1 complex prevents the entry of TFIIA and TFIIB into the preinitiation complex, inhibiting active transcription complex formation (Yeung1997Functional).

## Function
The DR1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a repressor of class II gene transcription by interacting with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a component of the transcription factor TFIID. This interaction is crucial for DR1's ability to inhibit the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex, thereby modulating gene expression in healthy human cells (Yeung1994Structurefunction). DR1 can repress transcription from both TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters, and this repression can be reversed by overexpression of TBP, indicating a competitive mechanism (Yeung1994Structurefunction).

The DR1 protein contains two distinct domains necessary for its repressive function: a TBP-binding domain and a repression domain rich in alanine residues. The TBP-binding domain is essential for tethering DR1 to the promoter, while the alanine-rich domain functions as a repressor domain (Yeung1997Functional; Yeung1994Structurefunction). DR1's repression mechanism involves preventing the association of TFIIA and/or TFIIB with the TFIID(TBP)-DNA complex, making it a general repressor of transcription (Yeung1994Structurefunction). DR1 is primarily active in the nucleus, influencing cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and differentiation.

## Interactions
The DR1 protein interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form a repressive complex that inhibits transcription initiation. This interaction is crucial for DR1's function as a transcriptional repressor, as it prevents the entry of transcription factors TFIIA and TFIIB into the preinitiation complex, thereby inhibiting the formation of an active transcription complex (Mermelstein1996Requirement; Yeung1994Structurefunction). DR1 also forms a heterodimer with DRAP1 (DR1-associated protein 1), which enhances its repressive function. The DR1-DRAP1 complex stabilizes the DR1-TBP-TATA motif complex, further precluding the entry of TFIIA and/or TFIIB, and enhancing transcriptional repression (Mermelstein1996Requirement; Yeung1997Functional).

The interaction between DR1 and TBP is mediated by specific domains in DR1, including a TBP-binding domain and a glutamine-alanine-rich repression domain. The TBP-binding domain is essential for tethering DR1 to the promoter, which is necessary for DRAP1's corepressor function (Yeung1997Functional; Yeung1994Structurefunction). DR1's interaction with TBP can be disrupted by certain transcriptional activators, such as VP16, which can displace DR1 from the transcription complex, thereby overcoming DR1-mediated repression (Mermelstein1996Requirement; Yeung1994Structurefunction).
