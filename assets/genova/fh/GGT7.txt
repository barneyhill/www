# GGT7

## Overview
GGT7 is a gene that encodes the enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase 7, which is part of the gamma-glutamyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, playing a crucial role in glutathione metabolism, amino acid transport, and detoxification processes. Gamma-glutamyltransferase 7 is a membrane-associated enzyme that contributes to maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting cells from oxidative stress (Jean2003The). The gene is expressed in various tissues and is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting its importance in fundamental cellular functions (Heisterkamp2008The). Alterations in GGT7 expression have been linked to several diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker and influence cancer progression through its effects on reactive oxygen species levels and immune cell infiltration (Tian2021Expression).

## Function
Gamma-glutamyltransferase 7 (GGT7) is an enzyme involved in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, which is crucial for glutathione metabolism. GGT7 catalyzes the transfer of gamma-glutamyl functional groups, facilitating amino acid transport and detoxification processes. This enzyme is active in the cell membrane and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress (Jean2003The).

GGT7 is expressed in various normal tissues and is evolutionarily conserved, indicating its importance in cellular functions (Heisterkamp2008The). Although its specific function in healthy cells is not fully detailed, GGT7 shares amino acid sequence similarity with other gamma-glutamyltransferases like GGT1 and GGT5, which are involved in glutathione metabolism and leukotriene conversion, respectively (Heisterkamp2008The). This suggests that GGT7 might have related roles in glutathione metabolism and antioxidant defense.

In the context of glioblastoma, GGT7 expression is reduced compared to normal brain tissue, and its presence is associated with decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, indicating a protective role against oxidative damage (Bui2015γGlutamyl). This antioxidant function may be relevant in healthy cells as well, contributing to cellular protection and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
GGT7, a member of the gamma-glutamyltransferase family, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GGT7 is significantly overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This high expression is associated with poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in HCC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker for survival prediction (Tian2021Expression). The study also found a negative correlation between DNA methylation and mRNA expression of GGT7, indicating that methylation may regulate its expression levels (Tian2021Expression).

GGT7's role extends beyond liver cancer. It is also involved in other cancers, such as lung cancer and glioblastoma, where it may influence cancer progression through the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Tian2021Expression). The gene's expression is correlated with immune cell infiltration in tumors, including CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, highlighting its involvement in the tumor immune microenvironment (Tian2021Expression). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GGT7 in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
GGT7, a member of the gamma-glutamyltransferase gene family, has been identified to interact with the plasma membrane-associated protein CT120. This interaction was discovered through a yeast two-hybrid screen, suggesting a potential physical interaction between GGT7 and CT120 (Heisterkamp2008The). Despite this finding, specific details regarding the nature of this interaction or its functional implications remain limited. The interaction with CT120 indicates that GGT7 may play a role in cellular processes involving membrane-associated proteins, but further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms and effects of this interaction.

The current literature does not provide additional information on other specific physical interactions of GGT7 with proteins or nucleic acids. While GGT7 is expressed in various normal tissues and human tumor specimens, suggesting dynamic regulation, the precise interactions and pathways involving GGT7 are not well-characterized (Heisterkamp2008The). The evolutionary conservation of GGT7, as evidenced by its presence in the mouse genome, implies potential functional significance, but detailed studies are required to understand its interaction network fully.
