# CHRNE

## Overview
The CHRNE gene encodes the epsilon (ε) subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a critical component of the neuromuscular junction. This receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that facilitates synaptic transmission by allowing the flow of cations, primarily sodium ions, into muscle cells upon binding with acetylcholine, thereby initiating muscle contraction. The ε subunit is integral to the adult form of the nAChR, replacing the γ subunit found in the fetal form, and contributes to the receptor's structural and functional properties, including its conductance and agonist binding sites. Mutations in the CHRNE gene are associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), which are characterized by impaired neuromuscular transmission and muscle weakness (Ohno1997Congenital; Schaaf2014Nicotinic). Understanding the role of the CHRNE gene and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these neuromuscular disorders and developing targeted therapeutic strategies (Engel2015Congenital).

## Structure
The CHRNE gene encodes the epsilon (ε) subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a ligand-gated ion channel with a pentameric structure. The adult form of the receptor is composed of two α1, one β1, one δ, and one ε subunit, replacing the γ subunit found in the fetal form (Cetin2020The; Schaaf2014Nicotinic). Each subunit, including the ε subunit, contains a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains (M1-M4), and a cytoplasmic loop domain between M3 and M4 (Cetin2020The). The ε subunit has a specific consensus sequence for phosphorylation by protein kinase A in its M3-M4 loop, which is absent in the γ subunit (Cetin2020The).

The quaternary structure of the receptor involves the assembly of these subunits into a heteropentamer, forming a cation-selective ion pore (Steinlein2007Genetic). The ε subunit contributes to the receptor's agonist binding sites, located at the α/ε and α/δ interfaces, with the α/ε site having a lower affinity for acetylcholine due to fewer aromatic core residues involved in binding (Cetin2020The). The M2 domain of the ε subunit is crucial for the receptor's conductance properties, with specific residues like εS276 and εI277 playing significant roles (Cetin2020The).

## Function
The CHRNE gene encodes the epsilon (ε) subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), a ligand-gated ion channel crucial for neuromuscular transmission. In healthy human cells, the AChR is located at the neuromuscular junction, where it plays a key role in muscle contraction. The receptor is composed of five subunits with a stoichiometry of α2βδε in adult muscle (Shen2012Highly). When motor neurons release acetylcholine (ACh), it binds to the AChR, triggering the opening of the ion channel and allowing cations, primarily sodium ions, to flow into the muscle cell. This ion flow leads to depolarization of the muscle cell membrane and initiates muscle contraction (Ohno1997Congenital; Almatrafi2023Homozygous).

The ε subunit is essential for the proper assembly and function of the AChR, contributing to the receptor's ability to respond to ACh by opening ion channels (Ohno1997Congenital). The ε subunit, along with other subunits, forms the agonist binding site where ACh binds, leading to channel opening and ion flow, which is essential for muscle contraction (Shen2012Highly). The CHRNE gene's role in neuromuscular transmission is critical for maintaining normal muscle function and motor control (Almatrafi2023Homozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHRNE gene, which encodes the epsilon subunit of the acetylcholine receptor, are a common cause of congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). These genetic disorders are characterized by impaired neuromuscular transmission, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. CHRNE mutations account for approximately 20-50% of CMS cases, with a high prevalence of autosomal recessive inheritance patterns (Schaaf2014Nicotinic; Abicht2012Congenital; Engel2015Congenital). 

The most frequent mutations in CHRNE result in acetylcholine receptor deficiency, which is the most common type of CMS. These mutations often involve missense, nonsense, or splice site alterations, leading to a reduced number of functional receptors at the neuromuscular junction (Abicht2012Congenital; Engel2015Congenital). A notable mutation, c.1267delG, is prevalent in certain populations, such as those from Southeastern Europe, and is associated with a founder effect (Abicht2012Congenital).

Patients with CHRNE-related CMS typically present with symptoms such as ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, limb weakness, and bulbar symptoms. These symptoms often begin in early childhood and can be exacerbated by exertion or infections (Gül2019Congenital; Yiş2017Genetic). Treatment with acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, and other medications like salbutamol can improve symptoms, although the response may vary (Gül2019Congenital; Engel2015Congenital).

## Interactions
The CHRNE gene encodes the epsilon subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a pentameric protein complex crucial for neuromuscular transmission. This subunit interacts with other nAChR subunits, including alpha (CHRNA1), beta (CHRNB1), and delta (CHRND), to form functional receptors at the neuromuscular junction (Ohno2003A). These interactions are essential for the proper assembly and function of the receptor, which mediates synaptic signaling and muscle contraction.

Mutations in the CHRNE gene can disrupt these interactions, leading to congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). For instance, certain mutations result in the production of mutant CHRNE transcripts that fail to incorporate into cell surface pentamers, significantly reducing the surface expression of acetylcholine receptor binding sites (Ohno2003A). These mutations may compromise the dimerization with the wild-type CHRNA1 subunit, affecting the receptor's assembly and function.

The study of these interactions and the effects of mutations provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying CMS and highlights the importance of the epsilon subunit in maintaining the structural integrity and functionality of the nAChR complex (Ohno2003A).
