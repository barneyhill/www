# TJP2

## Overview
TJP2, or tight junction protein 2, is a gene that encodes a cytosolic adaptor protein crucial for the formation and maintenance of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. These tight junctions are essential for regulating paracellular permeability and maintaining cell polarity, thereby playing a vital role in tissue homeostasis. The protein encoded by TJP2 is involved in linking transmembrane proteins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, which is necessary for the structural integrity of tight junctions (Ko2024Functional; Xu2022ZO2Tjp2). Beyond its structural role, TJP2 is implicated in various cellular signaling pathways, including the Hippo pathway, where it modulates the activity of transcriptional effectors such as Yap and Taz, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (Oka2010Functional; Xu2022ZO2Tjp2). Mutations in the TJP2 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, including Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 4 (PFIC4) and certain forms of hereditary hearing impairment, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease (Lal2024Genotype; Wang2015Identification).

## Function
TJP2, also known as tight junction protein 2, is integral to maintaining the integrity of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. These junctions are crucial for regulating paracellular permeability and maintaining cell polarity. TJP2 acts as a cytosolic adaptor protein, linking transmembrane proteins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the structural integrity of tight junctions (Ko2024Functional; Xu2022ZO2Tjp2). In the liver, TJP2 is vital for maintaining the bile-blood barrier, preventing the diffusion of bile into the bloodstream, and regulating the expression and distribution of bile acid transporters and detoxification enzymes (Xu2019Protective; Xu2022ZO2Tjp2).

TJP2 also plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, including the Hippo pathway, by modulating the localization and activity of transcriptional effectors such as Yap and Taz. It sequesters these proteins in the cytosol, preventing their nuclear localization and subsequent activation, which is crucial for regulating cell proliferation and preventing transdifferentiation (Oka2010Functional; Xu2022ZO2Tjp2). TJP2's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential role in disease when dysregulated (Ko2024Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TJP2 gene are associated with several significant clinical conditions. TJP2 deficiency is a notable cause of genetic intrahepatic cholestasis, specifically Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 4 (PFIC4). This condition is characterized by impaired bile flow, leading to liver damage and potentially requiring liver transplantation. Patients with biallelic protein-truncating mutations (TJP2-C genotype) often experience early infantile cholestasis, poor jaundice clearance, and severe outcomes, including a higher likelihood of liver transplantation or death (Lal2024Genotype; Tang2021Two).

TJP2 mutations are also linked to extrahepatic manifestations such as sensorineural deafness, renal tubular dysfunction, and neurological disorders. In a Chinese family, a specific TJP2 mutation (c.2081G>A) was identified as a cause of autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hereditary hearing impairment, suggesting a role in late-onset hearing loss (Wang2015Identification).

Alterations in TJP2 expression have been implicated in certain cancers, affecting cell adhesion and proliferation. The disruption of TJP2 protein can lead to structural and functional changes in cells, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Tang2021Two). These findings highlight the critical role of TJP2 in maintaining cellular integrity and its impact on various diseases.

## Interactions
TJP2, also known as tight junction protein 2, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. TJP2 interacts with YAP and TAZ, key effectors in the Hippo signaling pathway, by retaining them in the cytosol and preventing their nuclear localization. This interaction is essential for suppressing the transdifferentiation of hepatocytes into cholangiocytes (Xu2022ZO2Tjp2). TJP2 also forms complexes with YAP2 via its first PDZ domain, which is significant for YAP2's nuclear localization and signaling (Oka2010Functional).

In addition to its role in the Hippo pathway, TJP2 interacts with several proteins involved in cell cycle progression and transcriptional regulation. It modulates MMP9 expression, interacts with the transcriptional repressor Bach1, and acts as a negative regulator of STAT-1 expression (Traweger2013Beyond). TJP2 is also involved in the NFκB activation pathway and affects β-catenin-mediated gene transcription, highlighting its role in cellular signaling pathways and gene expression regulation (Traweger2013Beyond). These interactions underscore TJP2's function as a molecular hub in tight junctions and its broader role in cellular signaling.
