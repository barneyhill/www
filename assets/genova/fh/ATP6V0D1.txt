# ATP6V0D1

## Overview
ATP6V0D1 is a gene that encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit d1, a critical component of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This protein is integral to the function of the V-ATPase, a transmembrane enzyme complex responsible for acidifying various intracellular compartments, such as lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus. The acidification process is essential for numerous cellular activities, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. ATP6V0D1 is particularly significant in endothelial cells, where it contributes to the biogenesis of Weibel-Palade bodies, which are involved in blood clotting. The protein's interactions with other V-ATPase subunits and its regulation by the HPS6 gene underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in clinical contexts, such as cancer therapy and drug resistance (Chen2022The; Lu2022HPS6).

## Function
ATP6V0D1 encodes a subunit of the V0 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is essential for acidifying intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. This acidification is crucial for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. The protein is primarily active in lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus.

In endothelial cells, ATP6V0D1 plays a significant role in the biogenesis of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), which are storage granules for von Willebrand factor (vWF), a key protein in blood clotting. The V-ATPase complex, including ATP6V0D1, is necessary for maintaining the acidic environment within WPBs, which is essential for the tubulation of vWF and the formation of mature WPBs. ATP6V0D1 is involved in the assembly of the V-ATPase complex on the WPB membrane, affecting WPB acidification and vWF tubule formation (Lu2022HPS6).

The proper localization and stability of ATP6V0D1 are regulated by the HPS6 gene, which facilitates its trafficking to WPBs. In HPS6-deficient cells, ATP6V0D1 is mislocalized and degraded, primarily through the lysosomal pathway, underscoring the importance of HPS6 in ATP6V0D1 function (Lu2022HPS6).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ATP6V0D1 gene, which encodes a subunit of the V-ATPase complex, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. Upregulation of ATP6V0D1 is associated with the induction of alkaliptosis, a form of pH-dependent and caspase-independent cell death, which is relevant in overcoming drug resistance in cancers such as pancreatic cancer (Chen2022The). The gene's role in promoting JTC801-induced alkaliptosis through interaction with STAT3 suggests its potential as a target for non-apoptotic cell death strategies in tumor treatment (Chen2022The).

ATP6V0D1 is also implicated in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer. The d subunit of V-ATPase, encoded by ATP6V0D1, positively regulates yes-associated protein (YAP) expression, contributing to paclitaxel resistance in epithelial ovarian cancer. Inhibiting this subunit can improve drug sensitivity and limit the acidic tumor microenvironment, which is a hallmark of cancer cells (Chen2022The).

Additionally, ATP6V0D1 is involved in the regulation of immune responses through pathways such as NF-κB and the DNA sensor pathway mediated by AGER and STING1, highlighting its broader clinical significance in cancer therapy (Chen2022The).

## Interactions
ATP6V0D1, a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function. It interacts with other V-ATPase subunits, such as ATP6V1A and ATP6V0C, forming a network related to energy metabolism (Liu2018Quantitative). ATP6V0D1 also interacts with the Ragulator complex, which is essential for anchoring the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1) to the lysosome, highlighting its role in amino acid sensing and autophagy (Kissing2017Disruption). 

In endothelial cells, ATP6V0D1 is trafficked to Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) by HPS6, where it is involved in the assembly of the V-ATPase complex, maintaining the acidic pH necessary for WPB biogenesis and maturation (Lu2022HPS6). The interaction between ATP6V0D1 and HPS6 is demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation analysis, suggesting that ATP6V0D1 is transported as a cargo of HPS6 or BLOC-2 (Lu2022HPS6). 

Additionally, ATP6V0D1 is part of a protein-protein interaction network involving ATP6V1F, ATP6V1A, and other V-ATPase subunits, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes (Hu2023ATP6V1F). These interactions underscore ATP6V0D1's role in cellular acidification and energy metabolism.
