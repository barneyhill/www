# SLC44A2

## Overview
SLC44A2 is a gene that encodes the choline transporter-like protein 2 (CTL2), a member of the solute carrier family 44. This transmembrane protein is characterized by its role in choline transport, which is essential for various cellular processes, including mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism (Nair2004Identification; Kommareddi2007Cochlin). CTL2 is involved in the transport of choline into mitochondria, facilitating the production of ATP and reactive oxygen species, which are crucial for platelet activation and other physiological functions (Bennett2020The). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as von Willebrand factor and cochlin, underscore its significance in processes like thrombosis and inner ear homeostasis (Bayat2015Choline; Kommareddi2007Cochlin). Mutations in SLC44A2 have been linked to clinical conditions, including hearing loss and venous thromboembolism, highlighting its importance in human health (Kommareddi2015Hair; Germain2015Metaanalysis).

## Structure
The SLC44A2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein known as choline transporter-like protein 2 (CTL2), which is part of the solute carrier family. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, including 10-11 predicted transmembrane domains, which suggest its role as a transporter protein (Nair2004Identification; Kommareddi2007Cochlin). The primary structure of CTL2 includes amino acid sequences that form these transmembrane helices, contributing to its function in choline transport (Kommareddi2010Isoforms).

The protein undergoes significant post-translational modifications, particularly N-linked glycosylation, which affects its molecular mass and function. Glycosylation is confirmed by the presence of N-linked carbohydrate moieties, with specific asparagine residues being modified (Traiffort2013The; Nair2004Identification). These modifications are crucial for the protein's interaction with antibodies and its role in autoimmune hearing loss (Traiffort2013The).

SLC44A2 has multiple isoforms, including CTL2-P1 and CTL2-P2, which arise from alternative splicing and differ in their amino acid sequences and glycosylation patterns. These isoforms exhibit tissue-specific expression and functional differences, with CTL2-P2 showing detectable choline transport activity (Kommareddi2010Isoforms). The structural diversity of these isoforms highlights the complexity and adaptability of the SLC44A2 protein in various physiological contexts.

## Function
The SLC44A2 gene encodes a choline transporter protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. It facilitates the transport of choline into mitochondria, where it is metabolized into substrates for oxidative metabolism, leading to ATP production. This process is essential for platelet activation and thrombosis, as ATP is necessary for maximal platelet function (Bennett2020The). In the absence of SLC44A2, there is impaired mitochondrial respiration, reduced ATP content, and diminished platelet activation, which can be partially rescued by exogenous ADP (Bennett2020The).

SLC44A2 is also involved in the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are important for platelet activation (Bennett2020The). Beyond its role in platelets, SLC44A2 is expressed in various tissues, including the inner ear, where it is implicated in choline transport necessary for acetylcholine biosynthesis and membrane synthesis during scar formation (Traiffort2013The; Nair2004Identification). The protein's activity in the cell membrane and mitochondria influences immune responses and auditory function, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Traiffort2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC44A2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. A targeted deletion of exons 3-10 in the Slc44a2 gene in mice leads to progressive sensorineural hearing loss, hair cell death, and spiral ganglion degeneration, indicating its critical role in auditory function (Kommareddi2015Hair). In humans, a complete deficiency of CTL2, due to a large homozygous deletion in SLC44A2, results in progressive hearing impairment, recurrent arterial aneurysms, and epilepsy, although these individuals do not exhibit hematological disorders (Koehl2022Lack).

SLC44A2 is also implicated in venous thromboembolism (VTE). The rs2288904-G allele of SLC44A2 is associated with an increased risk of VTE, with studies showing a relative risk of 1.21 for carriers of this allele (Germain2015Metaanalysis). This gene is further linked to transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), as antibodies targeting CTL2 can lead to leukocyte activation and aggregation, potentially causing severe complications (Germain2015Metaanalysis).

Alterations in SLC44A2 expression are also associated with vascular abnormalities, such as aortic aneurysms. Overexpression of SLC44A2 in vascular smooth muscle cells has been shown to reduce the incidence of aortic aneurysms in mice, suggesting a protective role against vascular diseases (Song2024SLC44A2).

## Interactions
SLC44A2, also known as choline transporter-like protein 2 (CTL2), is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in physiological processes. It interacts with the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and CD11b/CD18 integrin, forming a trimolecular complex that is crucial for neutrophil activation and agglutination, particularly in the context of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) (Bayat2015Choline). 

SLC44A2 also mediates interactions between neutrophils and activated αIIbβ3 integrin on platelets. This interaction is significant in the process of NETosis, where neutrophils release extracellular traps, contributing to thrombosis. The binding of SLC44A2 to activated αIIbβ3 is influenced by genetic variations, such as the rs2288904 SNP, which affects the interaction strength and is associated with a reduced risk of venous thrombosis (ConstantinescuBercu2020Activated).

In the inner ear, SLC44A2 interacts with cochlin, a protein involved in the extracellular matrix. This interaction suggests a functional complex that may play a role in maintaining inner ear homeostasis (Kommareddi2007Cochlin). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of SLC44A2 in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
