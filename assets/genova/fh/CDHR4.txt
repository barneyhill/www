# CDHR4

## Overview
CDHR4, or cadherin-related family member 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cadherin superfamily, which is known for its role in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The protein encoded by CDHR4 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, featuring six extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats that are essential for its adhesive properties (Sotomayor2014Sorting). These repeats facilitate the protein's structural integrity through calcium ion coordination, a characteristic feature of cadherins (Sotomayor2014Sorting). CDHR4 is part of the Cr-3 subfamily and is hypothesized to interact with other cadherin-related proteins, potentially influencing cellular adhesion and signaling pathways. The gene's expression and regulation, including interactions with specific microRNAs, have been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, such as kidney damage mechanisms (Adiga2023Integrated). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the functional roles and clinical significance of CDHR4 and its encoded protein.

## Structure
CDHR4, also known as CDH29, is a member of the cadherin superfamily, characterized by its role in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The protein is part of the Cr-3 subfamily of cadherin-related proteins and features six extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, which are crucial for its adhesive function (Sotomayor2014Sorting). These EC repeats typically consist of approximately 100 amino acids forming a 'Greek-key' motif with seven beta strands, linked by regions that coordinate calcium ions, essential for maintaining structural integrity (Sotomayor2014Sorting).

CDHR4 is grouped with other cadherin-related proteins such as CDHR3, CDHR5, CDH16, CDH17, FAT1, FAT2, and FAT3, suggesting potential for heterotypic interactions with members of different subtrees, like CDH23 from the Cr-2 subtree (Sotomayor2014Sorting). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CDHR4 are not provided, the protein is likely to have a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail, common features in cadherins. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, which is typical in cadherins, potentially affecting its function or localization. Splice variants may result in different isoforms, although specific variants for CDHR4 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Interactions
CDHR4, a member of the cadherin superfamily, is involved in potential interactions within and across subtrees of this family. It is grouped in the Cr-3 subtree with other cadherins such as CDHR3, CDHR5, CDH16, CDH17, FAT1, FAT2, and FAT3. CDHR4 may engage in heterotypic interactions with members of the Cr-2 subtree, including CDH23 and CDHR1. These interactions are hypothesized to occur due to shared structural features that facilitate handshake-like interactions, such as long N termini and specific calcium-binding sites (Sotomayor2014Sorting).

CDHR4 is also implicated in the pathophysiology of hyperoxaluria, with miRNA interactions playing a crucial role in its regulation. Specifically, miRNAs hsa-miR-6884-5p and hsa-miR-4653-5p have been identified as significant regulators of CDHR4, highlighting the importance of miRNA-gene interactions in understanding kidney damage mechanisms (Adiga2023Integrated).

Despite these insights, specific physical interactions of CDHR4 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature, indicating a need for further research to elucidate its precise interaction partners and mechanisms (Zheng2023Prognostic; Sotomayor2014Sorting).
