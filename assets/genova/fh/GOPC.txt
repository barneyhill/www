# GOPC

## Overview
GOPC, or Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein, also known as PIST, FIG, and CAL, is characterized by its PDZ domain and coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate interactions with a wide range of proteins, including those involved in vesicular trafficking, signal transduction, and synaptic targeting. GOPC is ubiquitously expressed across tissues, indicating its role as a housekeeping gene essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is particularly significant in the regulation of tight junction proteins, synaptic plasticity, and insulin secretion, as well as in spermatogenesis. Alterations in GOPC expression and function have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and diabetes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2006Solution; Wilhelmi2021The; Klüssendorf2021The).

## Structure
The GOPC protein, also known as PIST, is characterized by its domain structure, which includes two N-terminal coiled-coil domains and a C-terminal PDZ domain. The PDZ domain is a canonical class I PDZ domain, consisting of two alpha-helices and six beta-strands, forming a shell-shaped structure with a deep binding groove for substrates (Li2006Solution). This domain facilitates interactions with various proteins, such as neuroligin and Wnt receptors like Frizzled 8 (Li2006Solution). The coiled-coil domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, such as binding to Rab6a, Syntaxin6, and the GTPase Tc10, which are crucial for Golgi localization and vesicular trafficking (Wilhelmi2021The; Hicks2005Isoformspecific).

GOPC is involved in multiple cellular processes, including vesicle transport and signal transduction, and is expressed in all tissues analyzed in mice and humans, suggesting a housekeeping role (Li2006Solution). The protein's interaction with golgin-160 indicates its participation in golgin-160-dependent trafficking (Hicks2005Isoformspecific). GOPC also plays a role in synaptic targeting of receptors in neurons, such as mGlu5, and is involved in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (Wilhelmi2021The; Klüssendorf2021The). Multiple splice variants of GOPC exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functional roles.

## Function
The GOPC protein, also known as PIST, FIG, and CAL, is a PDZ-domain scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in the trafficking and regulation of various proteins within cells. It is involved in the regulation of tight junction proteins, such as claudin-1 and claudin-2, in epithelial cells, affecting ion permeability and transepithelial resistance (Lu2015Scaffolding). GOPC is localized to the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) and endosomal compartments, where it influences the trafficking of ion channels, receptors, and mucins, and is implicated in endocytic down-regulation, endosomal sorting, and recycling of membrane proteins (Lu2015Scaffolding).

In neurons, GOPC is essential for the synaptic targeting of mGluR5, a type of glutamate receptor, affecting synaptic plasticity and long-term depression (LTD) (Klüssendorf2021The). It is also involved in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells by regulating the plasma membrane localization of SNAP25, a SNARE protein crucial for insulin granule fusion and release (Wilhelmi2021The).

GOPC's role extends to spermatogenesis, where it is critical for acrosome formation in sperm cells, a process essential for fertilization (Yao2002Lack). The protein's involvement in these diverse cellular processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function across different tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GOPC gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In colorectal cancer, low expression of GOPC is associated with poor prognosis, including higher rates of venous invasion and reduced overall and recurrence-free survival. This suggests that GOPC expression levels could serve as a prognostic marker in colorectal cancer (Ohara2017Low).

GOPC is also involved in oncogenic fusions, such as the GOPC-ROS1 fusion, which has been identified in several cancers, including oral mucosal melanoma, gliomas, and lung adenocarcinomas. These fusions act as oncogenic drivers and are potential targets for tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which have shown efficacy in treating cancers with these fusions (East2018Targetable; Suehara2012Identification; Davare2018Rare).

In pancreatic β-cells, GOPC plays a role in insulin secretion. Disruption of GOPC interactions can lead to impaired insulin secretion, which may affect glucose metabolism and contribute to conditions like diabetes. This is due to its role in maintaining the stability and localization of proteins involved in insulin granule fusion (Wilhelmi2021The).

## Interactions
GOPC, a Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein, is involved in various protein interactions critical for cellular processes. It interacts with the Wnt receptors Frizzled 5 and 8 through its PDZ domain, suggesting a role in the Wnt signaling pathway and cell polarity development (Li2006Solution). GOPC also binds to neuroligin, a neural cell-adhesion molecule, via its PDZ domain, forming intercellular junctions with neurexin, which is significant for synapse development (Li2006Solution).

GOPC is part of a protein complex that links the d2 glutamate receptor and autophagy, interacting with Beclin1, a key autophagy regulator, through its coiled-coil region. This interaction can induce autophagy, relevant in neuronal cell death and neurodegenerative diseases (Li2006Solution). GOPC also interacts with golgin-160, indicating its role in golgin-160-dependent trafficking (Li2006Solution).

In the context of vesicular transport, GOPC interacts with syntaxin 6, a plasma membrane protein, suggesting a role in membrane recognition and fusion (Li2006Solution; Yao2002Lack). These interactions highlight GOPC's multifaceted role in intracellular trafficking and signal transduction.
