# SUN5

## Overview
The SUN5 gene encodes the Sad1 and UNC84 domain containing 5 protein, a transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the testes. This protein is integral to the inner nuclear membrane and plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of sperm cells, particularly at the head-to-tail junction. SUN5 is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including a SUN domain that facilitates interactions with other proteins within the perinuclear space. These interactions are essential for the formation of the head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), a structure critical for maintaining the connection between the sperm head and flagellum. The protein's involvement in the LINC complex, through its interaction with Nesprin3, underscores its importance in ensuring the proper localization of the centrosome and preventing the separation of the sperm head and tail. Mutations in the SUN5 gene are linked to acephalic spermatozoa syndrome, a condition leading to male infertility due to disrupted sperm integrity (Shang2018Mechanistic; Zhang2021SUN5; Zhu2016Biallelic).

## Structure
The SUN5 protein is a 379-amino-acid transmembrane protein located in the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and is specifically expressed in the testes. It is composed of several distinct regions: an N-terminal nucleoplasmic region, a transmembrane helix, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal SUN-domain region (Zhu2016Biallelic). The SUN domain, located at the C-terminus, is crucial for interactions with other proteins in the perinuclear space and is involved in the formation of the head-tail junction in sperm (Zhang2021SUN5; Zhu2016Biallelic).

The secondary structure of SUN5 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are essential for its proper folding and function. Mutations in the coiled-coil domain and the SUN domain can lead to structural changes that impair the protein's localization and function, affecting its interaction with other proteins such as DNAJB13 (Shang2018Mechanistic). The tertiary structure of SUN5 is important for its role in the nuclear envelope, where it interacts with Nesprin3 to form the LINC complex, essential for sperm head-to-tail linkage (Zhang2021SUN5).

The quaternary structure involves the assembly of SUN5 with other proteins, such as CENTLEIN and PMFBP1, in the sperm head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), highlighting its role in maintaining sperm integrity (Zhang2021The).

## Function
The SUN5 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for the structural integrity and function of sperm cells, particularly in the head-to-tail junction. In healthy human cells, SUN5 is specifically expressed in the testis and is involved in the formation of the head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), a centrosome-based structure that ensures the tight junction of the sperm head and flagellum (Zhang2021SUN5). SUN5 interacts with Nesprin3 to form the linker of the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, which is vital for the localization of Nesprin3 at the posterior nuclear membrane. This interaction is necessary for maintaining the proximity of the centrosome to the nucleus, thereby preventing the separation of the sperm head and tail (Zhang2021SUN5).

SUN5 also interacts with DNAJB13, a chaperone protein that assists in the proper folding of SUN5 and its binding to other proteins during spermatid elongation. This interaction is essential for the formation of a tight junction between the sperm head and tail (Shang2018Mechanistic). The absence of SUN5 leads to a separation of the coupling apparatus from the sperm nucleus, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity of sperm cells (Shang2018Mechanistic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SUN5 gene are primarily associated with acephalic spermatozoa syndrome, a condition characterized by the absence of sperm heads, leading to severe male infertility. This syndrome is caused by the disruption of the sperm head-tail junction, which is crucial for sperm integrity and motility (Shang2018Mechanistic; Elkhatib2017Homozygous). Various mutations in SUN5, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, have been identified. These mutations often result in truncated proteins and affect the protein's secondary structure, folding, and cellular localization, impairing its function (Mazaheri2021Genetic; Shang2018Mechanistic).

The interaction between SUN5 and other proteins, such as DNAJB13 and Nesprin3, is crucial for maintaining the sperm head-to-tail connection. Mutations in SUN5 can impair these interactions, leading to the detachment of the sperm head from the tail (Shang2018Mechanistic; Zhang2021SUN5). In Sun5 knockout mice, the absence of functional SUN5 results in the mislocalization of Nesprin3 and affects the expression of several proteins involved in spermatogenesis, further contributing to infertility (Zhang2021SUN5). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SUN5 in male reproductive health and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
The SUN5 protein is involved in critical interactions that are essential for sperm head-to-tail linkage. It interacts with Nesprin3, forming a part of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, which is crucial for connecting the sperm head and tail. This interaction is necessary for the proper localization of Nesprin3 at the nuclear membrane, and its disruption leads to the separation of the sperm head and tail, as observed in Sun5 knockout mice (Zhang2021SUN5).

SUN5 also interacts with DNAJB13, a protein that assists in its proper folding and function during spermatid elongation. This interaction is dynamic, and both overly weak and overly strong interactions can negatively impact the structural integrity of sperm. DNAJB13 is necessary for SUN5 to bind to another protein, referred to as 'protein X,' which is essential for anchoring the sperm head to the tail (Shang2018Mechanistic).

Additionally, SUN5 has been shown to interact with ODF1, another protein involved in sperm structure. These interactions suggest a complex network of protein interactions that are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of spermatozoa (Zhang2021Pathogenesis).
