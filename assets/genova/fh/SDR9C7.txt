# SDR9C7

## Overview
SDR9C7 is a gene that encodes the protein short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 7, which is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This protein is primarily involved in the enzymatic processes essential for maintaining the integrity of the skin barrier. It plays a critical role in the dehydrogenation of acylceramides, facilitating the formation of the cornified lipid envelope (CLE) in the stratum corneum, which is vital for skin barrier function (Takeichi2020SDR9C7). The SDR9C7 protein is characterized by a conserved NAD(P)(H)-binding domain and a Rossmann fold, typical of the SDR family, and is predominantly expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis (Takeichi2020SDR9C7; Schmitt2021Personalized). Mutations in the SDR9C7 gene are linked to autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a genetic disorder that results in compromised skin barrier function and various dermatological symptoms (Takeichi2020SDR9C7).

## Structure
SDR9C7 is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, characterized by a conserved NAD(P)(H)-binding domain and a Rossmann fold, which is a structural motif crucial for nucleotide binding (Takeichi2020SDR9C7; Bhatia2015Towards). The protein is a single-domain enzyme with a granular distribution throughout the cell, particularly dense in the perinuclear region and near the cell membrane (Takeichi2020SDR9C7). 

The primary structure of SDR9C7 includes characteristic sequence motifs of the SDR family, such as the cofactor binding motif TGxxxGxG and the active center motif YxxxK, which are essential for its enzymatic function (Takeichi2020SDR9C7). The secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the available context, but the presence of the Rossmann fold suggests a central, twisted parallel beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices, typical of SDR proteins (Bhatia2015Towards).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. Variants of SDR9C7 can arise from alternative splicing, potentially affecting its structure and function (Takeichi2020SDR9C7). The quaternary structure is not described in the available sources.

## Function
The SDR9C7 gene encodes a protein that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, which plays a crucial role in skin barrier function. In healthy human cells, SDR9C7 is involved in the dehydrogenation of acylceramides, specifically the conversion of epoxy-alcohol (EpOH)-CerEOS to epoxy-ketone (Ep-keto)-CerEOS. This process is essential for the formation of the cornified lipid envelope (CLE) in the stratum corneum, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of the skin barrier (Takeichi2020SDR9C7). The enzyme catalyzes the NAD+-dependent dehydrogenation of linoleate derivatives, facilitating the covalent binding of ceramides to proteins on the cornified cell envelope (CCE) (Takeichi2020SDR9C7). This binding is non-enzymatic and does not require additional enzymes like esterase or transglutaminase (Takeichi2020SDR9C7).

SDR9C7 is predominantly expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis, where it contributes to the formation of the skin barrier by facilitating the covalent attachment of oxidized acylceramide to cornified cell envelope proteins (Schmitt2021Personalized). Deficiency in SDR9C7 leads to malformation of the CLE, resulting in skin disorders such as autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) (Takeichi2020SDR9C7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SDR9C7 gene are associated with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), specifically the subtype ARCI-13. This condition is characterized by dry, scaly skin, hyperkeratosis, palmoplantar keratoderma, and erythroderma. The gene plays a crucial role in the formation of the epidermal lipid barrier, and its deficiency leads to impaired skin barrier function, resulting in the ichthyotic phenotype (Youssefian2021Knockdown; Takeichi2020SDR9C7). 

Patients with SDR9C7 mutations often exhibit increased expression of transglutaminase 1 (TGM1), although the functional connection between TGM1 and SDR9C7 remains unclear. These mutations can lead to reduced or abolished expression of the SDR9C7 protein, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Takeichi2020SDR9C7). 

Individuals with SDR9C7 mutations frequently experience dermatophytic infections, possibly due to impaired skin barrier and immune functions. The down-regulation of IRF4, a transcription factor important for immune responses, has been observed in Sdr9c7-deficient mice, suggesting a potential link to increased susceptibility to infections (Takeichi2020SDR9C7). 

The clinical manifestations of ARCI due to SDR9C7 mutations are highly variable, with no clear genotype-phenotype correlation. This variability suggests that other factors like modifier genes, epigenetic changes, and environmental influences may also play a role in the phenotypic expression of the disease (Youssefian2021Knockdown).

## Interactions
SDR9C7, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, plays a crucial role in skin barrier function by participating in the dehydrogenation of acylceramide, which is essential for the covalent attachment of ceramides to proteins in the cornified cell envelope (CCE) of the skin. This process is vital for the formation of the corneocyte lipid envelope (CLE), a key component of the skin barrier. The epoxy-enone produced by SDR9C7 is known to covalently bind to proteins on the extracellular surface of the CCE, completing a previously missing part of the mechanism involved in skin barrier formation (Takeichi2020SDR9C7).

Mutations in SDR9C7 have been associated with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a severe genetic skin disorder. These mutations lead to inactive enzymes, resulting in abnormal ceramide accumulation and a reduction in covalently bound ceramides, which compromises the skin barrier (Takeichi2020SDR9C7). Although there is evidence of increased expression of transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) in patients with SDR9C7 mutations, suggesting a potential functional connection, no direct evidence of interaction between SDR9C7 and TGM1 has been published (Takeichi2020SDR9C7). Further research is needed to clarify the interactions and mechanisms involving SDR9C7.
