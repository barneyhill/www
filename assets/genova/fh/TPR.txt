# TPR

## Overview
The TPR gene encodes the translocated promoter region, nuclear basket protein, a nucleoporin that is a vital component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). This protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions through a helix-turn-helix structure. As a nucleoporin, TPR plays a crucial role in the nuclear export of mRNAs and lncRNAs, particularly those from short and intron-poor genes, by facilitating their passage through the nuclear pore complex (Lee2020TPR; Aksenova2020Nucleoporin). Additionally, TPR is involved in maintaining genomic integrity and protecting cells from RNA-mediated replication stress (Kosar2021The). The protein's interactions within the NPC, particularly with Nup153, are essential for its proper localization and function (Hase2003Direct). Clinically, alterations in the TPR gene have been linked to various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathology (Malik2023Tpr; Aksenova2020Nucleoporin).

## Structure
The TPR (translocated promoter region, nuclear basket protein) gene encodes a large coiled-coil protein that is a component of the nuclear pore complex. The protein's structure is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are 34-amino-acid sequences forming a helix-turn-helix structure. These motifs are arranged in tandem arrays, contributing to the protein's ability to mediate protein-protein interactions (PerezRiba2019The; Blatch1999The). The TPR motifs form a solenoid structure with a concave groove that can bind peptides, and the binding surface area increases with the number of TPR repeats, allowing interactions with longer peptides (PerezRiba2019The).

The TPR protein is involved in various cellular processes, including nuclear transport and mitotic spindle assembly, facilitated by its coiled-coil domains that enable dimerization and interaction with other nuclear pore components. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Blatch1999The). The structural flexibility and ability to form different binding interfaces highlight the versatility of TPR motifs in molecular recognition (PerezRiba2019The).

## Function
The TPR gene encodes a nucleoporin that is a critical component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), playing a significant role in the nuclear export of mRNAs and lncRNAs, particularly those from short and intron-poor genes. TPR is involved in the late stages of the mRNA export pathway, facilitating the docking of mRNAs with the nuclear pore, allowing them to exit the nucleus. It acts downstream of the recruitment of the nuclear transport receptor Nxf1, helping mRNAs leave nuclear speckles and pass through the nuclear pore (Lee2020TPR).

TPR is also integral to the TREX-2 mRNA export pathway, tethering the TREX-2 complex to the NPC, which is essential for the proper export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This tethering is necessary for the functioning of the TREX-2 complex, which bridges transcription and export machineries (Aksenova2020Nucleoporin).

In addition to its role in mRNA export, TPR is involved in maintaining genomic integrity by protecting cells from RNA-mediated replication stress. It interacts with proteins involved in RNA processing and DNA damage responses, contributing to the prevention of replication stress and DNA damage (Kosar2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TPR gene have been implicated in various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance. TPR is associated with the regulation of neural progenitor cell (NPC) counts and differentiation, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Misregulation of TPR expression in mouse models of AD correlates with changes in NPC architecture and impaired neurogenesis. In human AD patients, TPR expression levels in the hippocampal subgranular zone are lower compared to healthy controls, suggesting a role in NPC integrity loss and differentiation issues (Malik2023Tpr).

TPR is also crucial for efficient mRNA export and maintaining cell proliferation. Depletion of TPR in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells leads to growth arrest and rapid changes in mRNA abundance, affecting the export of poly(A) RNA. This suggests that TPR is essential for cell viability and its dysfunction could contribute to diseases related to mRNA export defects or cell growth abnormalities (Aksenova2020Nucleoporin).

The TPR motif's role in protein-protein interactions is underscored by its association with human diseases such as Leber congenital amaurosis, chronic granulomatous disease, and Down syndrome, where mutations in TPR-containing proteins can disrupt protein folding and function (D’Andrea2003TPR).

## Interactions
The TPR protein is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly within the nuclear pore complex (NPC). TPR directly interacts with the nucleoporin Nup153, which is crucial for its localization at the nuclear periphery. This interaction is mediated through TPR's nuclear binding domain (NBD), and specific amino acid residues are essential for binding. Mutations in these residues can disrupt the interaction, leading to mislocalization of TPR within the nucleus (Hase2003Direct). 

TPR also forms homodimers that bind to the NPC, and its interaction with Nup153 is stoichiometric, indicating a precise binding relationship. The depletion of Nup153 results in the mislocalization of TPR, highlighting the dependency of TPR on Nup153 for proper NPC association (Hase2003Direct).

In addition to its role in the NPC, TPR interacts with proteins involved in RNA processing, such as MATR3 and GANP. These interactions are significant for maintaining genome integrity and responding to replication stress. The depletion of TPR or its interactors leads to replication stress sensitivity, suggesting a functional interplay in RNA processing pathways (Kosar2021The).
