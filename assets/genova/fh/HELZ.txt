# HELZ

## Overview
HELZ is a gene that encodes the helicase with zinc finger (HELZ) protein, which is a putative SF1 helicase involved in RNA metabolism. The HELZ protein is characterized by its structural features, including a CCCH-type zinc finger motif and a DEAA helicase domain, which facilitate its role in transcription, translation, and mRNA stability. As a member of the helicase family, HELZ interacts with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and cytoplasmic polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABPC1), playing a crucial role in mRNA decay and translational repression. The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and protein synthesis through the mTOR signaling pathway (Hasgall2011The; Hanet2019HELZ).

## Structure
The HELZ protein, encoded by the human HELZ gene, is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its function in RNA metabolism. It contains a Cys3His (CCCH)-type zinc finger (ZnF) motif at the N-terminus, which is common in RNA-binding proteins and aids in recruiting the CCR4-NOT complex (Hanet2019HELZ). The protein also includes a DEAA helicase domain, which is crucial for its helicase activity, and a polyadenosine (poly[A])-binding protein (PABP) interacting motif 2 (PAM2) that facilitates interaction with PABPC1 (Hasgall2011The; Hanet2019HELZ).

HELZ features two conserved LxxLAP motifs, one overlapping with the PAM2 motif at the N-terminal and another at the C-terminal, which are conserved in mammals and may have oxygen-independent functions (Hasgall2011The). The C-terminal region of HELZ is largely unstructured and contains multiple binding sites for the CCR4-NOT complex, mediated by short linear motifs (SLiMs) (Hanet2019HELZ). The protein's abundance and subcellular localization are not significantly affected by oxygen levels (Hasgall2011The).

HELZ does not have reported post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context (Hasgall2011The; Hanet2019HELZ).

## Function
The HELZ gene encodes a putative SF1 helicase involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including transcription, translation, and mRNA stability. HELZ interacts with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, a major player in mRNA decay, through its C-terminal low-complexity regions. This interaction is crucial for HELZ to mediate translational repression and decapping-dependent mRNA decay (Hanet2019HELZ). HELZ also interacts with cytoplasmic polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABPC1), influencing mRNA stability and translation efficiency, although its role in translation appears to be independent of PABPC1 (Hasgall2011The; Hanet2019HELZ).

HELZ promotes cell proliferation, translation initiation, and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation, linking it to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which regulates growth and protein synthesis (Hasgall2011The). It is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, with enhanced perinuclear staining, and does not change localization during cell cycle progression (Hasgall2011The). HELZ's function in RNA metabolism, particularly in translation, is linked to its ability to enhance global protein translation and cell proliferation (Hasgall2011The).

## Interactions
HELZ, a putative RNA helicase, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in mRNA decay and translation regulation. HELZ interacts with several components of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, including NOT1, NOT2, and NOT3, through its C-terminal region, which contains multiple binding sites (Hanet2019HELZ). This interaction facilitates the decay of bound mRNAs by promoting deadenylation and decapping (Hanet2019HELZ).

HELZ also interacts with mRNA decay factors such as EDC4, PatL1, and PAN3, but not with DDX6 in human HEK293T cells (Hanet2019HELZ). In Drosophila S2 cells, HELZ interacts with proteins like HPat and PAN3, indicating its role in the 5' to 3' decay of mRNAs (Hanet2019HELZ).

The protein also binds to the cytoplasmic polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABPC1) via its PAM2 motif, which is crucial for mRNA stability and translation efficiency (Hasgall2011The; Hanet2019HELZ). HELZ's interaction with PABPC1 is independent of proline hydroxylation, and the phenylalanine residue in the PAM2 motif is critical for this binding (Hasgall2011The). These interactions suggest that HELZ plays a complex role in mRNA decay and translational repression through multiple protein and RNA interactions.
