# IFITM10

## Overview
The IFITM10 gene encodes the interferon-induced transmembrane protein 10, which is part of the IFITM family known for their roles in immune response and antiviral defense. As a transmembrane protein, IFITM10 is involved in various cellular processes, including modulation of immune signaling pathways. Although the specific functions of IFITM10 are not fully elucidated, it has been implicated in the regulation of tumor immunity and cancer progression, particularly in gastric cancer. The gene's expression levels have been associated with clinical outcomes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis in cancer (Liu2021Highly).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The IFITM10 gene has been implicated in gastric cancer (GC) due to its altered expression levels. Studies have shown that IFITM10 is significantly overexpressed in gastric tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its potential role in cancer development (Liu2021Highly). This overexpression is particularly notable in early-stage gastric cancer (T1 and T2), indicating that IFITM10 may serve as an early diagnostic marker for the disease (Liu2021Highly). The gene's expression is also associated with longer survival rates in patients, highlighting its potential prognostic value (Liu2021Highly).

In addition to its role in gastric cancer, IFITM10 has been studied for its involvement in immune-related pathways. The gene is linked to several signaling pathways related to tumor immunity, such as the Notch and toll-like receptor pathways, which may influence its role in cancer and immune response (Liu2021Highly). While the exact mechanisms by which IFITM10 contributes to these conditions are not fully understood, its expression patterns and associations with clinical features suggest it could be a valuable biomarker for early detection and prognosis in gastric cancer. Further research is needed to confirm its impact on prognosis and its potential role in immunotherapy (Liu2021Highly).
