# VAMP7

## Overview
VAMP7, or vesicle-associated membrane protein 7, is a gene that encodes a SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) protein involved in the regulation of vesicle fusion and intracellular trafficking. The protein product of VAMP7, also known as TI-VAMP, is characterized by a conserved longin domain, a SNARE motif, and a transmembrane domain, which are essential for its function in membrane fusion processes (Vivona2010The; Daste2015Structure). VAMP7 plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including the exocytosis of proteins, endocytosis, and the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. It is predominantly located in the Golgi apparatus, late endosomes, and lysosomes, reflecting its involvement in trafficking to and from these organelles (Chaineau2009Multiple). The protein is also implicated in neuronal functions, such as neurite outgrowth and synaptic vesicle regulation, and is involved in the release of exosomes and lysosomal secretion (Fader2009TIVAMPVAMP7; Chaineau2009Multiple). Alterations in the VAMP7 gene have been linked to congenital disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (TannourLouet2014Increased; Vats2022Role).

## Structure
VAMP7, also known as TI-VAMP, is a member of the SNARE protein family involved in vesicle fusion. It is characterized by a conserved N-terminal longin domain (LD), a SNARE motif, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (Vivona2010The; Daste2015Structure). The longin domain adopts a closed conformation, consisting of a globular fold with five antiparallel β-strands and three α-helices, forming a β1β2α1β3β4β5α2α3 topology (Vivona2010The). This closed conformation is stabilized by interactions between the longin and SNARE core domains, involving specific residues such as Leu-43 and Tyr-45 (Vivona2010The; Daste2015Structure).

The closed conformation of VAMP7 is crucial for its regulatory function, as it inhibits SNARE complex formation, thereby controlling membrane fusion processes (Vivona2010The; Schäfer2012The). VAMP7 can interact with various partners, such as Varp, which traps it in a closed, fusogenically inactive conformation (Schäfer2012The). Alternative splicing of the SYBL1 gene, which encodes VAMP7, results in multiple isoforms with distinct domain architectures and subcellular localizations, affecting its function in vesicle trafficking (Vacca2011Alternative). These isoforms may include or exclude the longin domain and SNARE motif, contributing to the diversity of VAMP7's roles in cellular processes (Vacca2011Alternative).

## Function
VAMP7, also known as TI-VAMP, is a SNARE protein involved in various intracellular trafficking processes, playing a crucial role in vesicle fusion with target membranes. It is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, late endosomes, and lysosomes, indicating its involvement in trafficking to and from these organelles (Chaineau2009Multiple). VAMP7 is essential for the exocytosis of proteins from the Golgi to the cell surface and is involved in the endocytic pathway, mediating the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (Chaineau2009Multiple).

In neuronal cells, VAMP7 is critical for neurite outgrowth and synaptic vesicle regulation, affecting both basal and evoked neurotransmitter release (Chaineau2009Multiple). It operates with syntaxin 3 and synaptotagmin VII in this pathway, and its Longin domain plays a regulatory role (Chaineau2009Multiple). VAMP7 is also involved in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, completing the autophagic pathway, and participates in the fusion between multivesicular bodies and the plasma membrane to release exosomes (Fader2009TIVAMPVAMP7).

In epithelial cells, VAMP7 is involved in the direct apical delivery of proteins and is regulated by Cdc42 and actin dynamics (Chaineau2009Multiple). It is also implicated in lysosomal secretion in fibroblasts and astrocytes (Vats2022Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the VAMP7 gene, including increased gene dosage, have been associated with several congenital disorders, particularly affecting male urogenital development. Studies have shown that increased VAMP7 expression can lead to conditions such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and micropenis. These conditions are linked to disruptions in androgen receptor function and enhanced estrogen receptor activity, which can result in feminized phenotypes in male reproductive development (TannourLouet2014Increased).

Increased VAMP7 gene dosage has also been associated with virilization defects in infants, including bilateral and unilateral cryptorchidism and glandular hypospadias. These defects are often accompanied by speech delays, suggesting a potential role of VAMP7 in neuritic growth and language development (ChávezLópez2020A).

In the context of cancer, VAMP7 is implicated in the exosomal release of molecules that contribute to tumor progression, such as miR-375 in glioblastoma and matrix metalloproteases in sarcoma (Vats2022Role). Additionally, VAMP7's role in unconventional secretion is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, where it mediates the release of protein aggregates associated with conditions like Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases (Vats2022Role).

## Interactions
VAMP7, a SNARE protein, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in vesicle fusion and trafficking. It interacts with the clathrin adaptor protein Hrb, which facilitates its sorting into endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles. This interaction is mediated by the longin domain of VAMP7, which binds to the unstructured C-terminal tail of Hrb. Disruption of this interaction leads to VAMP7 accumulation on the cell surface, indicating its importance in endocytosis (Pryor2008Molecular).

VAMP7 also interacts with Rab GTPases, such as Rab11 and Rab8, through its longin domain. These interactions are part of a complex that includes Rabin8 and VARP, which is involved in ciliary membrane targeting and neurite outgrowth (Kandachar2018An). The SNARE domain of VAMP7 interacts with Rabin8, even in the presence of mutations that affect other interactions (Kandachar2018An).

In the context of lysosomal membrane protein transport, VAMP7 works alongside hVps41 in the fusion of LAMP carriers with endosomes, highlighting its role in endo-lysosome fusion processes (Pols2013hVps41).
