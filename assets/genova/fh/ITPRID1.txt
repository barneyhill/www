# ITPRID1

## Overview
The ITPRID1 gene encodes the protein ITPR interacting domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its ability to interact with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), which play a crucial role in calcium signaling pathways. The ITPRID1 protein is categorized as an interacting domain protein, which suggests its involvement in modulating the activity of other proteins through direct interactions. Research has highlighted the gene's potential clinical significance, particularly in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD), where specific polymorphisms in ITPRID1 have been associated with the disease's genetic pathogenesis (Li2023Deciphering). Further studies are required to elucidate the precise biological functions and mechanisms of ITPRID1 in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
The ITPRID1 gene has been implicated in congenital heart disease (CHD) through its association with recurrent FBI polymorphisms and complex breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) events. Studies have shown that approximately 28% of CHD probands exhibit these genetic alterations involving ITPRID1, compared to a lower frequency in their relatives and even lower in healthy controls from the 1000 Genome Project. This suggests a significant enrichment of these polymorphisms in individuals with CHD, indicating a potential role in the genetic pathogenesis of the disease (Li2023Deciphering).

The presence of FBI or complex BFB polymorphisms in ITPRID1 has been statistically linked to CHD, with a p-value of less than 1e-5, underscoring its potential clinical significance in this condition (Li2023Deciphering). These findings suggest that alterations in the ITPRID1 gene may contribute to the development of CHD, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to understand the broader implications of ITPRID1 mutations and their impact on other diseases or conditions.
