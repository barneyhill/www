# ZFHX4

## Overview
ZFHX4 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger homeobox 4 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its homeodomain and zinc finger motifs. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in neural and muscle differentiation. The ZFHX4 protein, with its complex structure comprising four homeodomains and 22 zinc finger domains, facilitates specific DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, which are essential for the development of neural and muscle tissues (Hemmi2006A; Nakamura2021Zfhx4). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, liver, and muscle, with significant expression during developmental stages. Mutations in ZFHX4 have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as both a developmental regulator and a potential biomarker in oncology (Fontana2021A; Qing2017Somatic).

## Structure
The ZFHX4 protein is a large transcription factor with a molecular weight of approximately 397 kDa, consisting of 3,599 amino acids (Hemmi2006A). Its primary structure includes four homeodomains and 22 zinc finger domains, which are critical for its function in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Hemmi2006A; Nakamura2021Zfhx4). The homeodomains and zinc fingers are encoded within the gene's 11th exon, which is notably 3.2 kb in length (Hemmi2006A).

The protein's secondary and tertiary structures are not explicitly detailed in the available context, but the presence of zinc finger and homeodomain motifs suggests a complex folding pattern typical of transcription factors, facilitating interactions with DNA and other proteins. The zinc fingers likely contribute to the protein's ability to bind specific DNA sequences, while the homeodomains may play a role in recognizing and binding to specific regulatory regions of target genes.

ZFHX4 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. The gene may also produce splice variant isoforms, potentially affecting its function and regulatory roles (Zhang2021Ablation).

## Function
The ZFHX4 gene encodes a homeodomain-zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in neural and muscle differentiation. This protein is involved in transcriptional regulation, facilitated by its structure, which includes four homeodomains and 22 zinc fingers, allowing it to bind DNA and regulate gene expression (Hemmi2006A). ZFHX4 is expressed in adult human brain, liver, and muscle tissues, with prominent expression in developing brain and muscle, indicating its involvement in the development of these tissues (Hemmi2006A).

In the context of neural differentiation, ZFHX4 is expressed in a manner that supports neuronal differentiation while being suppressed during muscle differentiation (Hemmi2006A). This suggests that ZFHX4 may influence cell fate decisions by modulating the expression of genes critical for neural development. The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors binding to conserved CpG islands in its 5' flanking region, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism shared with its mouse homolog (Hemmi2006A).

Overall, ZFHX4 functions as a transcription factor that is crucial for the differentiation and development of neural and muscle tissues, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZFHX4 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include intellectual disability, developmental delay, and autism spectrum disorder. Patients often exhibit distinctive facial features such as a tall and wide forehead, epicanthus, narrow palpebral fissures, ptosis, and low-set ears. Skeletal abnormalities like syndactyly and brachydactyly are also observed (Fontana2021A). The gene is implicated in the 8q21.11 microdeletion syndrome, which presents with neuropsychological, skeletal, and ocular findings (Fontana2021A).

ZFHX4 mutations are linked to congenital bilateral isolated ptosis, characterized by drooping of the upper eyelids (Hemmi2006A). In cancer biology, ZFHX4 serves as a prognostic biomarker in glioblastoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. Somatic mutations in ZFHX4 are associated with poor overall survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients (Qing2017Somatic).

Loss-of-function variants in ZFHX4 lead to craniofacial and brain development issues, as demonstrated in zebrafish and mouse models. These variants are associated with syndromic intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities (Pérez2024Lossoffunction). The gene's involvement in chromatin remodeling and histone modifications further underscores its role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Pérez2024Lossoffunction).
