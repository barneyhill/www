# ZNF24

## Overview
ZNF24 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 24, a member of the Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factor family. This protein is characterized by its C2H2 zinc finger motifs and a SCAN domain, which facilitate its role as a transcriptional regulator. Zinc finger protein 24 is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis, by acting primarily as a transcriptional repressor. It is ubiquitously expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues, indicating its essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein's ability to bind specific DNA sequences and interact with other proteins underscores its significance in developmental processes and disease states, particularly in cancer biology, where it has been implicated in tumor growth and angiogenesis (Jia2014The; Li2010The; Harper2007Repression).

## Structure
ZNF24, also known as KOX17 or ZNF191, is a zinc finger transcription factor characterized by its structural domains, which include four continuous C2H2 zinc finger motifs located in its C-terminus and a SCAN domain in its N-terminus (Li2010The). The C2H2 zinc finger motifs are typical DNA-binding domains, allowing ZNF24 to interact with specific DNA sequences, while the SCAN domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and oligomerization (Li2010The). 

The SCAN domain is known to have a suppressive effect on transcription in certain cell lines, indicating its role in transcriptional repression (Li2010The). ZNF24 is involved in the negative regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-b), functioning as a transcriptional repressor (Li2010The). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may influence the activity and stability of ZNF24, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its functional properties, but specific isoforms are not described in the context. The molecular structure of ZNF24, particularly its zinc finger and SCAN domains, is crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor (Li2010The).

## Function
ZNF24, also known as zinc finger protein 24, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is a member of the Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factor family and is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development and in adult tissues, indicating its essential role across different cell types (Jia2014The).

ZNF24 is involved in key cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and invasion. In neural progenitor cells, ZNF24 overexpression maintains proliferation and inhibits differentiation, highlighting its role in cell cycle regulation (Jia2014The). In endothelial cells, ZNF24 modulates angiogenic potential by regulating proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of ZNF24 in microvascular endothelial cells results in decreased cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, impaired VEGFR2 signaling, and reduced MMP-2 levels, which are essential for angiogenesis (Jia2014The).

ZNF24 also acts as a transcriptional repressor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key factor in angiogenesis. It binds directly to the VEGF promoter, leading to decreased VEGF expression, which suggests a role in the negative regulation of tumor growth and angiogenesis (Harper2007Repression; Jia2013Transcriptional). These functions underscore ZNF24's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in developmental processes and disease states.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF24 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating angiogenesis and cell proliferation. In breast cancer, ZNF24 acts as a transcriptional repressor of VEGF, a key factor in angiogenesis. Its overexpression leads to reduced VEGF levels and inhibited tumor angiogenesis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for inhibiting tumor growth (Jia2013Transcriptional; Harper2007Repression). In prostate cancer, ZNF24 is upregulated and facilitates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis. This indicates its role in cancer progression and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Huang2020ZNF24).

In pancreatic cancer, ZNF24 is downregulated, and its expression is associated with tumor suppression. It inhibits VEGFA expression, thereby reducing angiogenesis and tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2021LncRNA). In thyroid carcinoma, ZNF24 functions as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting tumorigenesis and invasion by regulating the Wnt signaling pathway (Xiong2021The). In KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma, ZNF24 promotes tumor progression by upregulating SLC7A5, suggesting its role in tumor metabolism and immune evasion (Jia2022ZNF24). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZNF24 in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
ZNF24, a zinc finger protein, is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. One of its key interactions is with the histone variant H2A.Z. This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed by GST pull-down assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy, which demonstrated co-localization of ZNF24 and H2A.Z in the nucleus of HEK293 cells (Li2012A). The interaction suggests a role in transcriptional regulation, potentially affecting the transcription of genes like BRCA1 (Li2012A).

ZNF24 also interacts with the promoter region of the VEGF gene, where it acts as a transcriptional repressor. It binds specifically to an 11 bp fragment within the proximal promoter region of VEGF, repressing its transcription. This interaction was demonstrated using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) (Jia2013Transcriptional). The binding of ZNF24 to the VEGF promoter is a novel finding, as this site was not previously known to interact with any transcriptional regulators of VEGF (Jia2013Transcriptional). These interactions highlight ZNF24's role in regulating gene expression and its potential impact on processes like angiogenesis and oncogenesis.
