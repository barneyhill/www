# EXOC3L4

## Overview
EXOC3L4 is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 3 like 4, which is involved in the exocyst complex, a key player in vesicle trafficking. This protein is implicated in processes such as glucose uptake and autophagy, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The exocyst complex is crucial for the targeted delivery of vesicles to specific sites on the plasma membrane, a process vital for various cellular functions, including neuronal activity. Variants in the EXOC3L4 gene, particularly those affecting splicing, have been associated with alterations in brain glucose metabolism, suggesting a potential link to Alzheimer's disease (Miller2018Rare). Further research into EXOC3L4 may provide insights into its role in neurodegenerative diseases and its broader implications in cellular transport mechanisms.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The EXOC3L4 gene has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its association with brain glucose metabolism. A study identified rare variants in the splicing regulatory elements (SREs) of EXOC3L4 that are significantly associated with global cortical glucose metabolism, as measured by FDG PET scans. These variants may affect splicing mechanisms, potentially altering vesicle transport, which is crucial for neuronal function and could contribute to AD-related phenotypes (Miller2018Rare). The exocyst complex, to which EXOC3L4 is related, plays a role in vesicle trafficking, glucose uptake, and autophagy, processes relevant to AD pathology (Miller2018Rare).

The study suggests that rare variants in EXOC3L4, particularly those affecting splicing, could impact the phenotype through mechanisms involving alternative splicing, highlighting the gene's potential clinical significance in AD research (Miller2018Rare). However, further research is needed to establish a causal link between EXOC3L4 variants and AD, and larger sample sizes may reveal more genes with rare variants in SRE loci important for exocytosis and autophagy (Miller2018Rare).
