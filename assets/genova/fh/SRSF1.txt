# SRSF1

## Overview
SRSF1, or serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing and other critical cellular processes. The protein, also known as ASF/SF2, is a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, characterized by its RNA recognition motifs and a C-terminal RS domain. These structural features enable SRSF1 to bind RNA and interact with other proteins, facilitating its role in spliceosome assembly and alternative splicing (Xiang2013Phosphorylation; Cléry2021Structure). Beyond its splicing functions, SRSF1 is implicated in mRNA export, translation, and stability, and it plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and mitosis (Maslon2014The; Howard2014The). Dysregulation of SRSF1 expression is associated with various cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability and its potential as a therapeutic target (Anczuków2016Splicingfactor; Du2021Splicing).

## Structure
SRSF1, also known as ASF/SF2, is a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor characterized by its distinct molecular structure. The protein contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal RS domain. The RRMs are responsible for binding RNA, with RRM1 showing a strong preference for cytosine-rich sequences and adopting a canonical β1α1β2β3α2β4 fold (Cléry2021Structure). The RS domain, rich in arginine and serine residues, is crucial for protein-protein interactions and undergoes extensive phosphorylation, which induces a conformational switch from a disordered state to a partially rigidified, arch-like structure (Xiang2013Phosphorylation).

Phosphorylation of the RS domain by SRPK1 results in a structural transition that stabilizes the domain and influences its interactions, such as enhancing the interaction with U1-70K proteins during spliceosome assembly (Xiang2013Phosphorylation). This post-translational modification decreases the conformational entropy of the RS domain, affecting both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions (Xiang2013Phosphorylation). The RS domain's phosphorylation also leads to electrostatic repulsion with RNA, impacting molecular recognition (Xiang2013Phosphorylation).

SRSF1 can form dimers, contributing to its quaternary structure, which is significant for its function in mRNA splicing (Xiang2013Phosphorylation).

## Function
SRSF1 (serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It is primarily known for its role in pre-mRNA splicing, where it binds to exonic splicing enhancers to regulate splice site selection, ensuring the correct assembly of mRNA transcripts (Long2008The). SRSF1 also participates in alternative splicing, contributing to the generation of diverse mRNA isoforms, which is essential for the development of specific cell lineages and tissues (Haward2020Nucleocytoplasmic).

Beyond splicing, SRSF1 is involved in mRNA export, translation, and stability. It shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing both nuclear and cytoplasmic gene expression processes (Haward2020Nucleocytoplasmic). In the cytoplasm, SRSF1 enhances mRNA translation by associating with polyribosomes and interacting with the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle progression and mitosis (Maslon2014The; Howard2014The). It promotes the translation of mRNAs encoding proteins necessary for centrosome function, chromosome segregation, and mitotic spindle formation (Maslon2014The).

SRSF1's activity is essential for normal mitotic progression, and its depletion can lead to cell cycle aberrations, such as metaphase arrest and spindle defects (Maslon2014The). The protein's role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating chromatin function underscores its importance in healthy cellular function (Maslon2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRSF1 gene are implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of SRSF1 is linked to oncogenesis, as it promotes the production of anti-apoptotic isoforms and enhances cell proliferation by affecting translation activators and repressors (Anczuków2016Splicingfactor). In breast cancer, SRSF1 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, particularly in hormone receptor-positive patients. It promotes tumorigenesis through the regulation of alternative splicing events, such as the oncogenic splice switching of PTPMT1 (Du2021Splicing). In lung cancer, SRSF1 overexpression is linked to worse prognosis and metastasis, affecting pathways like mTORC1 and chemoresistance mechanisms (Lo2022The).

In prostate cancer, SRSF1 expression is higher in cancerous tissues and is associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis, particularly in enzalutamide-resistant cases (Lo2022The). In glioblastoma multiforme, SRSF1 influences alternative splicing events that enhance tumorigenic potential, contributing to poor prognosis (Zhou2019Splicing). SRSF1 also plays a role in osteosarcoma progression by promoting proliferation and migration while inhibiting apoptosis, with its expression linked to various cancer-related pathways (Li2024High). These findings underscore the potential of SRSF1 as a target for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

## Interactions
SRSF1, a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in mRNA splicing, translation, and gene expression regulation. It interacts with the mTOR signaling pathway, specifically by suppressing 4E-BP, a competitive inhibitor of cap-dependent translation, thereby enhancing translation (Maslon2014The). SRSF1 also associates with the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, facilitating the recruitment of the positive elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to release paused RNA polymerase II during transcription elongation (Paz2021The).

In the immune system, SRSF1 regulates key immunomodulators such as interleukin 2 (IL-2) and CD3ζ, which are critical for T-cell function. It also interacts with chromatin-associated proteins like Psip1/Ledgf, influencing transcription regulation (Paz2021The). SRSF1's role in alternative splicing involves binding to specific RNA motifs, affecting splice site selection and modulating the activity of other RNA binding proteins (Paz2021The).

SRSF1 is involved in phase separation within cells, with its interactions modulated by peptides that mimic RS repeats. These interactions rely on electrostatic and stacking interactions, which are conserved across the SR protein family (Fargason2023Peptides).
