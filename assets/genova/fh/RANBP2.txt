# RANBP2

## Overview
RANBP2, also known as Ran binding protein 2 or Nup358, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional nucleoporin protein involved in several critical cellular processes. The RAN binding protein 2 is a large and complex protein characterized by its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, where it facilitates the movement of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm. It is distinguished by its multimodular structure, which includes domains such as leucine-rich regions, RanBP1-related domains, a cyclophilin homology region, and zinc fingers, enabling diverse functional roles (Saitoh1997RanBP2; Aslanukov2006RanBP2). The protein also exhibits SUMO1 E3 ligase activity, contributing to post-translational modifications that affect protein interactions and stability (Pichler2002The; Sakin2015Sumoylation). RANBP2 is implicated in various cellular functions, including mitosis, energy metabolism, and antiviral responses, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in disease pathogenesis (Aslanukov2006RanBP2; Hashizume2013Downmodulation).

## Structure
RANBP2, also known as Ran binding protein 2, is a large and complex nucleoporin involved in various cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport. The protein is characterized by a multimodular structure with several distinct domains. It contains a leucine-rich domain, four RanBP1-related domains, a cyclophilin homology region, and eight zinc fingers, which contribute to its diverse functional roles (Saitoh1997RanBP2; Aslanukov2006RanBP2).

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RANBP2 exhibits a cyclophilin-like fold, consisting of an 8-stranded β-barrel flanked by α-helices, forming a globular domain approximately 30 Å in diameter. This domain includes a surface groove used for substrate binding and catalysis, similar to other cyclophilins (Lin2013Structural). The CTD also shows peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, albeit with lower efficiency compared to Cyclophilin A (Lin2013Structural).

RANBP2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and exhibits SUMO1 E3 ligase activity, linking it to SUMO-1 substrate modification and relocation (Aslanukov2006RanBP2). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Aslanukov2006RanBP2). These structural features and modifications enable RANBP2 to interact with a wide range of molecular partners, reflecting its pleiotropic role in cell function.

## Function
RANBP2, also known as RAN binding protein 2, is a multifunctional nucleoporin involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in nucleocytoplasmic transport by interacting with importin-β and RanGTPase, facilitating the transport of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Aslanukov2006RanBP2; Hashizume2013Downmodulation). RANBP2 also exhibits SUMO1 E3 ligase activity, which is crucial for the posttranslational modification of proteins, affecting their interactions, localization, and stability (Pichler2002The; Sakin2015Sumoylation).

During mitosis, RANBP2 relocates to kinetochores and mitotic spindle microtubules, where it is essential for chromosomal alignment and segregation. Its interaction with importin b1 and Ran GTPase is vital for maintaining spindle bipolarity and preventing mitotic errors, such as metaphase catastrophe and aneuploidy (Hashizume2013Downmodulation).

RANBP2 also influences energy metabolism, particularly in the central nervous system, by modulating the activities of proteins like Cox11 and hexokinase I. This modulation is crucial for maintaining ATP levels and proper neuronal function (Aslanukov2006RanBP2). The protein's diverse roles underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the RANBP2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 (ANE1) is a rare pediatric neurological disorder associated with specific missense mutations in RANBP2, such as c.1754C>T: p.Thr585Met. These mutations are linked to a cytokine storm following viral infections, leading to severe symptoms like seizures and coma, with high mortality rates. The penetrance of these mutations is about 40%, and the condition can be recurrent, affecting young children predominantly in North America, Europe, and Asia (Jiang2022Roles; Neilson2009InfectionTriggered).

In cancer, RANBP2 is involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through its role in O-GlcNAcylation processes. It downregulates OGA, leading to increased O-GlcNAcylation, which is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. RANBP2 also affects the transcriptional regulation of CEBPα, a tumor suppressor, through SUMOylation and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, impacting its stability and activity (Liu2021RANBP2).

RANBP2 is also upregulated in multiple myeloma, where its expression is linked to early disease development and poor prognosis, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Felix2009SAGE). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RANBP2 in various diseases.

## Interactions
RANBP2, also known as Nup358, is a nucleoporin that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and other cellular processes. It forms a complex with RanGAP1 and Ubc9, where RanGAP1 is modified by SUMO-1, facilitating its stable interaction with RANBP2 at the nuclear pore complex (Mahajan1997A). This complex is essential for nuclear import processes, as it regulates the recycling of Ran-GDP at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore (Mahajan1997A).

RANBP2 also interacts with Argonaute proteins, such as AGO1, influencing their sumoylation and subsequent association with mRNA, particularly IL6 mRNA. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the Argonaute-IL6 complex post-nuclear export, affecting mRNA silencing (Shen2021RanBP2Nup358). In the context of viral infections, RANBP2 interacts with adenoviral proteins, such as the minor coat protein pIIIa, facilitating its nuclear import and playing a role in viral replication and assembly (Ismail2022RANBP2).

Additionally, RANBP2 is involved in the sumoylation and phosphorylation of STAT1, impacting interferon signaling by modulating the interaction between STAT1 and JAK1, thereby influencing antiviral responses (Li2023RanBP2Nup358). These interactions highlight RANBP2's multifaceted role in cellular and viral processes.
