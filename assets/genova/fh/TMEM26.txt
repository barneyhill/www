# TMEM26

## Overview
TMEM26, or transmembrane protein 26, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains. This protein is primarily associated with the plasma membrane and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and membrane transport. TMEM26 is notably recognized for its role in adipocyte differentiation and energy metabolism, serving as a marker for beige adipocytes, which are crucial in the conversion of white adipose tissue to a more metabolically active form capable of thermogenesis (Finlin2018Human). Beyond its metabolic functions, TMEM26 is implicated in immune function due to its expression in immune-related organs (Town2011Tmem26). Additionally, TMEM26 has been linked to cancer progression, particularly in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer, where it influences epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis (Han2023The; Iuliano2018Combining). The protein's diverse roles in metabolism, immune response, and cancer highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Structure
The TMEM26 protein is predicted to consist of 368 amino acid residues in humans, with an estimated molecular mass of 41.6 kDa (Town2011Tmem26). Bioinformatic predictions suggest that TMEM26 contains between 5 and 8 transmembrane domains, with 7 being the most commonly predicted number. These predictions vary based on the presence or absence of a leader sequence and the number of domains in the C-terminal region (Town2011Tmem26). The protein does not have any recognizable structural domains, but several hydrophobic regions are predicted to act as transmembrane domains (Town2011Tmem26).

In terms of post-translational modifications, the context does not provide specific details. However, the presence of transmembrane domains suggests potential roles in cellular signaling or transport, which could involve modifications like phosphorylation or glycosylation, though these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Several splice variants of TMEM26 exist in humans, often resulting in truncated proteins (Town2011Tmem26). These variants may lead to different functional forms of the protein, although specific functional implications are not detailed in the context.

## Function
TMEM26 is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and membrane transport. It is associated with the plasma membrane and plays a significant role in adipocyte differentiation and energy metabolism. In human cells, TMEM26 is a marker of beige adipocytes, which are involved in the process of adipose tissue beiging. This process is characterized by the conversion of white adipose tissue into a more metabolically active form, which is capable of thermogenesis, a heat-producing process that contributes to energy expenditure (Finlin2018Human).

TMEM26 expression is upregulated in response to cold exposure, indicating its role in the sympathetic nervous system-mediated induction of beige adipocytes. This response is observed in both lean and obese individuals, although the extent of TMEM26 induction can vary (Finlin2018Human). The protein's expression is also associated with the presence of brown-like adipocytes in adipose tissue, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic processes (Rockstroh2015Direct).

In addition to its role in adipose tissue, TMEM26 is expressed at low levels across a wide range of tissues, with higher expression in immune-related organs, suggesting a potential role in immune function (Town2011Tmem26).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM26 has been implicated in several cancers due to its role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), TMEM26 is highly expressed and contributes to cancer progression by disrupting tight junctions and activating NF-κB signaling, which facilitates EMT and metastasis, particularly to the liver (Han2023The). 

In breast cancer, TMEM26 expression levels are significant for patients undergoing aromatase inhibitor treatment, with low expression associated with a higher risk of recurrence. It also negatively regulates integrin β1, a factor in endocrine resistance, suggesting its role in breast cancer prognosis and treatment outcomes (Iuliano2018Combining).

TMEM26 is also part of a macrophage-related gene signature in gliomas, where it is associated with drug response and prognosis. This signature highlights the importance of tumor microenvironment interactions, particularly with macrophages, in cancer progression and resistance to therapies (Sun2019Multicellular).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), higher expression of TMEM26 correlates with poor survival, indicating its potential oncogenic role (Haider2014A). These findings suggest that TMEM26 could serve as a therapeutic target across various cancer types.

## Interactions
TMEM26 is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), TMEM26 plays a role in disrupting tight junctions and activating NF-κB signaling, which are crucial for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. TMEM26 overexpression in ESCC cells leads to increased phosphorylation of NF-κB components p65 and IκBα, indicating activation of the NF-κB pathway. Conversely, TMEM26 knockdown results in decreased phosphorylation, suggesting inhibited NF-κB signaling (Han2023The). TMEM26 also affects tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 by reducing their expression at the plasma membrane, thereby disrupting tight junction assembly (Han2023The).

In the context of developmental disorders, TMEM26 interacts with the TBX1 gene, which is associated with several partner proteins. These interactions are crucial for understanding the molecular pathways related to TBX1, particularly in the context of developmental disorders like DiGeorge syndrome (Almakhari2024Insilico).

TMEM26 is also mentioned as a beige-specific gene upregulated in the process of fat browning induced by FAM107A deficiency, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Manigandan2021Loss).
