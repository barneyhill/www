# STC1

## Overview
STC1 is a gene that encodes the protein stanniocalcin 1, a glycoprotein hormone involved in various physiological processes, including calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The STC1 gene is highly conserved across vertebrates, reflecting its essential biological functions. The protein stanniocalcin 1 is characterized by its ability to form dimers or multimers and is known for its role as a proteinase inhibitor, particularly targeting the metalloproteinase pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A). This interaction modulates insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, which is crucial for growth and metabolism. Additionally, stanniocalcin 1 is involved in regulating calcium transport and bone metabolism, influencing both osteoclast and osteoblast activities. It also plays a role in oxidative stress responses and energy metabolism within mitochondria. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as calreticulin and the insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor, further underscore its involvement in immune response modulation and inflammation regulation. Clinically, stanniocalcin 1 is associated with various cancers, where its expression levels can serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kløverpris2015Stanniocalcin1; Lin2021Stanniocalcin; Hou2021Molecular; Kim2024Stanniocalcin).

## Structure
The human stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) protein is a glycoprotein hormone involved in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. It is composed of 247 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 27 kDa, and forms dimers or multimers, resulting in higher molecular weight forms ranging from 56 to 135 kDa (Trindade2009Lowresolution). The primary structure of STC1 is highly conserved among vertebrates, particularly at the N-terminus, which includes a conserved N-linked glycosylation site (Trindade2009Lowresolution).

The secondary structure of STC1 is characterized by a high alpha-helical content, comprising approximately 52% of its structure, along with 19% beta-sheets, 11% turns, and 18% unordered structures (Trindade2009Lowresolution). The tertiary structure is stabilized by five intramolecular disulfide bridges, with a dimerization site at Cys202 (Trindade2009Lowresolution). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a dimer with a slightly elongated shape, as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data (Trindade2009Lowresolution).

Post-translational modifications of STC1 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, with phosphorylation occurring on serine residues mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) (JELLINEK2000Stanniocalcin). The C-terminal region is less conserved and contains the Cys disulfide-mediated dimerization region (Trindade2009Lowresolution).

## Function
Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) is a glycoprotein hormone involved in various molecular processes in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a proteinase inhibitor, specifically targeting the metalloproteinase pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A). STC1 inhibits PAPP-A through high-affinity noncovalent interactions, which modulates insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling by affecting the proteolytic cleavage of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) (Kløverpris2015Stanniocalcin1). This regulation of IGF signaling is significant for processes such as growth and metabolism (Kløverpris2015Stanniocalcin1).

STC1 is also involved in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. It negatively regulates calcium transport in intestinal epithelial cells by modulating the expression of calcium channels TRPV5 and TRPV6, which are crucial for calcium influx (Xiang2016Regulation). In bone metabolism, STC1 interacts with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to regulate osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization, influencing both osteoclast and osteoblast activities (Kim2024Stanniocalcin).

STC1 is active in various cellular locations, including mitochondria, where it influences oxidative stress responses and energy metabolism (Wagner2006The). Its role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels serving as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers. In breast cancer, STC1 overexpression is associated with advanced disease stages, increased tumor proliferation, and poor survival outcomes. It facilitates homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair, potentially contributing to treatment resistance (Hou2021Molecular). In gliomas, high STC1 expression correlates with higher tumor grades and poorer clinical outcomes, particularly in IDH1 wild-type and mesenchymal subtypes known for their invasiveness and chemotherapy resistance (Luo2020Stanniocalcin).

STC1 is also linked to poor prognosis in ovarian cancer, where it promotes metastasis and chemoresistance to cisplatin through the FOXC2/ITGB6 signaling axis (Lin2022Stanniocalcin). In glioblastoma, STC1 is associated with metastasis and poor survival, with its expression regulated by microRNAs such as miR-29b and miR-34a (Sakata2019MicroRNA). Across various cancers, including gastric and esophageal cancers, elevated STC1 expression is linked to larger tumor sizes, invasion, and metastasis, indicating its role as a tumor promoter (Zhao2020Expression). STC1's involvement in cancer-related pathways, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and immune checkpoint regulation, suggests its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Gan2023Systematic).

## Interactions
Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with calreticulin (CRT), where STC1 traps CRT in the mitochondria, reducing its presence on the cell membrane. This interaction impairs the phagocytosis process by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), affecting antigen presentation and T cell activation, and contributes to tumor immune resistance (Lin2021Stanniocalcin).

STC1 also interacts with the insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R), identified as a high-affinity binding partner. This interaction is involved in reducing the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β in macrophages, suggesting a role in inflammation regulation (Wan2022Identification).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), STC1 binds to Notch1 receptors, activating the Notch1 signaling pathway. This interaction promotes the stemness of HCC cells and is associated with poor prognosis in patients, indicating its potential as a biomarker for HCC (Bai2023The).
