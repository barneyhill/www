# THOC2

## Overview
The THOC2 gene encodes the THO complex subunit 2 protein, a critical component of the THO complex, which is part of the larger transcription-export (TREX) complex involved in mRNA processing and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The THOC2 protein is characterized by its extended helical repeat structure and is integral to the assembly and stability of the THO-UAP56 complex, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as THOC1, THOC3, THOC5, THOC7, and the UAP56 helicase. These interactions are essential for the binding and export of mRNA, playing a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating stem cell functions, particularly during early embryonic development (Bhattacharjee2024Compromised; Pühringer2020Structure). Dysfunction of the THOC2 gene is linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and gene expression (Bhattacharjee2024Compromised).

## Structure
The THOC2 protein is a core component of the human THO-UAP56 complex, which is part of the larger TREX complex involved in mRNA processing and export. Structurally, THOC2 is characterized by an extended helical repeat and consists of five distinct domains: 'anchor', 'bow', 'MIF4G', 'stern', and a disordered 'charged domain' (CD) (Pühringer2020Structure). The N-terminal anchor helices of THOC2 bind to the α-helices of THOC5 and THOC7, connecting through a disordered linker to the bow domain. The bow domain is sandwiched by the helical THOC1 'dock' domain, and the MIF4G domain interacts with the THOC3 β-propeller and the UAP56 helicase (Pühringer2020Structure).

The THO-UAP56 complex forms a 28-subunit tetramer consisting of two asymmetric dimers, each containing two seven-subunit monomers (PachecoFiallos2023mRNA). THOC2's interactions within this complex are crucial for its stability and function, as it plays a central role in the structure of these monomers (Pühringer2020Structure). The THOC2 protein's structure and interactions are essential for the function of the THO-UAP56 complex, which is involved in mRNA processing and export (Pühringer2020Structure).

## Function
The THOC2 gene encodes a critical component of the THO complex, which is part of the larger TREX complex involved in mRNA processing and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In healthy human cells, THOC2 plays a central role in the assembly and stability of the THO-UAP56 complex, which is essential for mRNA export processes. The THOC2 protein interacts with other subunits such as THOC1, THOC3, THOC5, THOC7, and UAP56 helicase, facilitating the binding and export of mRNA (Pühringer2020Structure).

THOC2 is involved in maintaining genomic stability and regulating stem cell functions, particularly during early embryonic development. It is crucial for the proper function of neural stem cells and is highly abundant during embryonic brain stages, indicating its significance in brain development (Bhattacharjee2024Compromised). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to efficient gene expression and cellular homeostasis by preventing DNA damage and ensuring proper transcription and mRNA export (Bhattacharjee2024Compromised).

THOC2's role extends to transcription regulation, genomic stability, and stem cell maintenance, with its dysfunction linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Bhattacharjee2024Compromised).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the THOC2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and neurodegenerative conditions. THOC2 syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, is characterized by intellectual disability, speech delay, hypotonia, and microcephaly. This condition is linked to mutations in the THOC2 gene, which lead to compromised function of the TREX complex, resulting in R-loop accumulation, DNA damage, and cell death, particularly affecting brain development (Bhattacharjee2024Compromised).

Variations in THOC2, including missense and splicing-defective variants, can lead to diverse clinical presentations such as intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism, and cerebral palsy. These variants often result in reduced protein stability, affecting the function of the TREX complex and leading to nuclear mRNA retention, which impacts cellular functions like chromosome alignment and genomic stability (Kumar2020Expanding).

In some cases, THOC2 gene alterations are linked to severe phenotypes, including severe hypotonia, respiratory abnormalities, and congenital anomalies. These conditions highlight the gene's role in multi-organ development and function (Kumar2020Expanding). Additionally, a genetic translocation creating a fusion between PTK2 and THOC2 has been associated with psychomotor retardation and congenital cerebellar hypoplasia, further illustrating the impact of THOC2 disruptions on neurological development (Di2013Ade).

## Interactions
THOC2, a component of the THO complex, is involved in various protein interactions essential for mRNA processing and export. It is part of the core transcription-export (TREX) complex, interacting with other THO subunits such as THOC1, THOC3, and UAP56. These interactions facilitate the binding of export factors like NXF1-NXT1, crucial for mRNA export from the nucleus (Pühringer2020Structure).

THOC2 also interacts with the septin complex, which includes proteins like SEPT2 and SEPT7. These interactions were identified through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses, suggesting a link between the THOC and septin complexes in RNA processing (BarreiroAlonso2021HMGB1).

In cancer models, THOC2 is part of the THOC complex that interacts with the HMGB1 protein, indicating a role in RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. This interaction is significant in the context of prostate and ovarian cancer, where the THOC complex is enriched in nuclear interactomes (BarreiroAlonso2021HMGB1).

THOC2's interactions are not limited to protein complexes; it also plays a role in maintaining R-loop homeostasis, which is crucial for genomic stability and transcriptional regulation (Bhattacharjee2024Compromised).
