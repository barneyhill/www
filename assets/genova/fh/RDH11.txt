# RDH11

## Overview
RDH11 is a gene that encodes the enzyme retinol dehydrogenase 11, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This enzyme is integral to the metabolism of retinoids, which are derivatives of vitamin A, and plays a pivotal role in the visual cycle by catalyzing the reduction of retinaldehyde to retinol. This process is essential for the regeneration of the visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal, crucial for rhodopsin function in the retina (Sahu2016Retinol; Xie2014New). RDH11 is expressed in various tissues, including the retinal pigment epithelium and rod photoreceptor inner segments, and is involved in the metabolism of both cis- and trans-retinoids (Sahu2016Retinol). Beyond its ocular functions, RDH11 is active in extraocular tissues, contributing to retinol homeostasis, particularly under vitamin A deficiency conditions (Wu2019Retinyl). The enzyme's activity is modulated by interactions with proteins such as selenoprotein F, which can influence its role in vitamin A metabolism (Tian2018The). Mutations in the RDH11 gene have been associated with a syndrome characterized by retinitis pigmentosa and other systemic features, highlighting its clinical significance (Xie2014New). Additionally, RDH11 expression levels have been linked to breast cancer prognosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (Ajwad2021Identification).

## Structure
RDH11 (retinol dehydrogenase 11) is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, characterized by a conserved Rossmann-fold structure, which includes 6-7 β-strands and 3-4 α-helices (Sahu2016Retinol). This structure is typical of SDRs and is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The protein contains a conserved N-terminal glycine-rich motif for nucleotide binding and a C-terminal catalytic tetrad (N-S-Y-K) that constitutes the active site (Sahu2016Retinol). RDH11 is anchored in microsomes, with an N-terminal hydrophobic segment that secures the N-terminal domain to the membrane, while the rest of the polypeptide faces the cytosolic side (Sahu2016Retinol). It is also localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Sahu2016Retinol).

RDH11 lacks glycosylation, which supports its cytosolic orientation (Napoli2012Physiological). The enzyme is involved in the reduction of retinaldehydes and exhibits dual substrate specificity towards both cis- and trans-retinoids (Sahu2016Retinol). RDH11 can catalyze both oxidation and reduction reactions, with NADPH as a preferred cofactor, and it reduces retinal about 50 times more efficiently than it oxidizes retinol in vitro (Sahu2016Retinol). The protein's structure and function are integral to its role in retinoid metabolism and visual function.

## Function
RDH11 (retinol dehydrogenase 11) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of retinoids, which are derivatives of vitamin A. It is primarily involved in the visual cycle, where it catalyzes the reduction of retinaldehyde to retinol, a key step in the regeneration of the visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal from all-trans-retinal. This process is essential for the function of rhodopsin, a light-sensitive receptor protein in the retina, and is critical for maintaining continuous vision (Sahu2016Retinol; Xie2014New).

RDH11 is expressed in various tissues, including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the rod photoreceptor inner segment, where it assists in the regeneration of visual pigments, particularly in the absence of RDH5 (Sahu2016Retinol). It is also involved in the metabolism of both cis- and trans-retinoids, with NADPH as a preferred cofactor (Sahu2016Retinol).

In addition to its role in the visual cycle, RDH11 is active in extraocular tissues, where it contributes to maintaining retinol levels, particularly under conditions of vitamin A deficiency (Wu2019Retinyl). It is part of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) superfamily and is involved in the biosynthesis of all-trans-retinoic acid, a metabolite that regulates gene expression important for development and other physiological processes (Gallego2006Comparative; Wu2019Retinyl).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RDH11 gene have been linked to a new syndrome characterized by retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative eye disease that leads to severe vision impairment. This syndrome also includes systemic features such as facial dysmorphologies, psychomotor developmental delays, learning disabilities, and short stature. The condition is caused by nonsense mutations in RDH11, which result in a non-functional protein, affecting both vision and other developmental aspects (Xie2014New).

RDH11 is also implicated in the visual cycle, particularly in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, a crucial component for vision. In mice lacking RDH11, there is a delay in dark adaptation, indicating its role in visual function. This suggests that RDH11 is important not only for the vitamin A cycle but also for retina protection (Sahu2016Retinol; Xie2014New).

Alterations in RDH11 expression have been associated with breast cancer. Studies have shown that RDH11, along with other retinol dehydrogenases, is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues, and higher expression levels are linked to worse survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for breast cancer prognosis (Ajwad2021Identification).

## Interactions
Retinol dehydrogenase 11 (RDH11) is known to interact with selenoprotein F (SELENOF), suggesting a role in vitamin A metabolism. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid system and further validated through Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analysis, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and pull-down assays. These methods demonstrated a specific association between HA-tagged SELENOF and GFP-tagged RDH11 in mammalian cells, indicating a close proximity and interaction between the two proteins. The interaction is specific, as control experiments with other proteins did not show significant interaction (Tian2018The).

The interaction between SELENOF and RDH11 affects the enzymatic activity of RDH11, specifically its reductive activity towards all-trans-retinaldehyde. Overexpression of SELENOF in HEK293T cells was found to inhibit RDH11's enzyme activity, leading to decreased retinol production and increased retinaldehyde levels. This suggests that SELENOF may block RDH11's activity, impacting retinol metabolism (Tian2018The). These findings highlight the potential regulatory role of SELENOF in modulating RDH11 activity and its implications for vitamin A metabolism.
