# ZNF506

## Overview
ZNF506 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 506, a crucial component of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. This protein is characterized by its zinc-finger domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins involved in DNA repair processes. ZNF506 plays a pivotal role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, one of the most severe forms of DNA damage, by recruiting and interacting with key proteins such as EYA1 and MDC1. These interactions are essential for the dephosphorylation of H2AX, a critical step in the DNA repair signaling cascade. Mutations in ZNF506, particularly those affecting its zinc-finger domains, can lead to genomic instability and have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic integrity and its potential as a therapeutic target (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent).

## Function
ZNF506 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, which are among the most lethal forms of DNA damage. Upon DNA damage, ZNF506 is phosphorylated by the protein kinase ATM, which facilitates its localization to DNA damage sites through interaction with the mediator protein MDC1 (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent). ZNF506 is essential for recruiting the protein phosphatase EYA1 to these sites, promoting the dephosphorylation of H2AX at the Y142 residue. This dephosphorylation is critical for the recruitment of MDC1 and other downstream repair factors, amplifying the DNA repair signal (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent).

The zinc-finger domains of ZNF506 are vital for its interaction with EYA1, and mutations in these domains can disrupt this interaction, leading to genomic instability (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent). ZNF506 is also involved in class switch recombination, and its downregulation reduces recombination efficiency (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent). In healthy human cells, ZNF506 plays a protective role by ensuring efficient DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability, as its absence or mutation increases sensitivity to radiation and DNA-damaging agents (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF506 gene have been linked to various malignancies, including leukemia and lung adenocarcinoma. These mutations, particularly those affecting the zinc-finger domain, disrupt the interaction between ZNF506 and EYA1, impairing the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and leading to genomic instability. This instability is evidenced by increased micronuclei formation and reduced class switch recombination, making cells with ZNF506 mutations hypersensitive to radiation (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent).

ZNF506 is often dysregulated in cancers such as lung and breast cancer, where its mRNA levels correlate with lower survival probability and worse prognosis. This suggests a significant role for ZNF506 in tumor suppression and maintaining genomic stability (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent). In T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), mutations in ZNF506 result in increased sensitivity to radiation and DNA-damaging agents, indicating potential therapeutic targets in cancers where this pathway is disrupted (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent).

High expression of ZNF506 is associated with better survival outcomes in lung and breast cancers, suggesting its potential prognostic significance in these malignancies (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent).

## Interactions
ZNF506 is a zinc finger protein involved in the DNA damage response, particularly through its interactions with other proteins. It contains a Kr√ºppel-associated box (KRAB) and eight zinc-finger domains, which are crucial for its function. ZNF506 interacts with EYA1, a phosphatase, to facilitate the dephosphorylation of H2AX at the Y142 residue, a critical step for DNA repair. This interaction is disrupted when the zinc-finger domains of ZNF506 are deleted, leading to defects in DNA damage-mediated H2AX dephosphorylation (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent).

ZNF506 also interacts with MDC1, a mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein, through its phosphorylation at the T140 residue by ATM. This phosphorylation is essential for ZNF506's recruitment to DNA double-strand break sites and for the formation of radiation-induced foci, indicating its role in DNA repair. The interaction between ZNF506 and MDC1 is necessary for the recruitment of EYA1 to DNA damage sites, forming a positive feedback loop that enhances the DNA damage response (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent).

Mutations in ZNF506, particularly in its zinc-finger domains, disrupt its interaction with EYA1, affecting DNA repair processes and leading to genomic instability (Nowsheen2018ZNF506dependent).
