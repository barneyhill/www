# FAH

## Overview
The FAH gene encodes the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, a critical component of the tyrosine catabolic pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a hydrolase and is responsible for catalyzing the hydrolysis of fumarylacetoacetate into fumarate and acetoacetate, the final step in the degradation of the amino acid tyrosine. The FAH protein functions as a cytosolic homodimer, with its structure comprising distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains that facilitate its enzymatic activity and regulatory interactions. The proper functioning of FAH is essential for preventing the accumulation of toxic intermediates, which can lead to cellular damage, particularly in the liver and kidneys. Mutations in the FAH gene can result in hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1), a severe metabolic disorder characterized by liver and kidney dysfunction (Grompe1993Loss; Kelsey1993Rescue). The regulation of FAH involves interactions with the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C Cdh1, which modulates its stability through polyubiquitination (Kaushal2020E3).

## Structure
The fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) protein is a cytosolic homodimer, with each subunit having a molecular weight of 46 kDa. The primary structure of FAH consists of a 120-residue N-terminal domain and a 300-residue C-terminal domain (Dreumont2001A). The N-terminal domain has an SH3-like fold and plays a regulatory role, while the C-terminal domain features a novel β-sandwich roll structure involved in metal ion binding and catalysis (Kaushal2020E3). The tertiary structure involves the interaction of these subunits through their C-terminal domains, with the active site located near the dimer interface (Dreumont2001A). The quaternary structure is characterized by the dimerization of the subunits, which is essential for its function in the tyrosine catabolic pathway (Dreumont2001A).

FAH undergoes post-translational modifications, including polyubiquitination, which is regulated by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-Cdh1 (APC/C) Cdh1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, affecting its stability and degradation (Kaushal2020E3). Alternative splicing of the FAH gene results in minor transcripts such as del100, which lacks exon 8 and produces a protein with a different C-terminal end (Dreumont2005AminoralternativetranscriptofthefumarylacetoacetatehydrolasegeneproducesaproteindespitebeinglikelysubjectedtononsensemediatedmRNAdecay).

## Function
The FAH gene encodes the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, which plays a critical role in the catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of fumarylacetoacetate (FAA) into fumarate and acetoacetate, the final step in the tyrosine degradation pathway. This process is essential for preventing the accumulation of toxic intermediates that can lead to cellular damage (Azuma2007Robust; Grompe1993Loss).

In healthy human cells, FAH is primarily active in the liver and kidneys, where it helps maintain metabolic balance by ensuring the complete breakdown of tyrosine. This function is crucial for preventing the buildup of harmful compounds such as succinylacetone, which is a diagnostic marker for FAH deficiency and is not found in healthy individuals (Grompe1993Loss; Kelsey1993Rescue).

The proper function of FAH is vital for normal liver and kidney function, as its deficiency can lead to hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1), a severe metabolic disorder characterized by liver failure and renal dysfunction (Grompe1993Loss; Kelsey1993Rescue). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the integrity of hepatocytes and preventing intracellular damage (Kelsey1993Rescue).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAH gene lead to hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), a severe metabolic disorder characterized by liver and kidney dysfunction. This condition results from a deficiency in the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, which is crucial for the breakdown of tyrosine. The deficiency causes the accumulation of toxic metabolites, such as fumarylacetoacetate and succinylacetone, leading to liver damage, renal tubular dysfunction, and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (Stoner1984Biochemical; Tanguay2009Hepatorenal).

HT1 presents in both acute and chronic forms. The acute form is marked by early-onset liver failure and cirrhosis, while the chronic form involves progressive renal issues, including proximal tubulopathy and Fanconi syndrome (Tanguay2009Hepatorenal). The disease follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, with a variable incidence worldwide. Certain mutations, such as the IVS12 + 5 g → a splicing defect, are more prevalent in specific populations due to founder effects (Tanguay2009Hepatorenal).

Treatment options include NTBC, which inhibits the tyrosine degradation pathway, and liver transplantation. However, long-term NTBC use does not fully prevent liver cancer, and some patients may require combined liver-kidney transplantation (Tanguay2009Hepatorenal).

## Interactions
The FAH protein, or fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, is involved in several interactions that regulate its stability and function. One significant interaction is with the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C Cdh1, which promotes the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of FAH. This interaction is crucial for regulating FAH protein levels, as demonstrated by experiments showing that overexpression of Cdh1 leads to increased polyubiquitination and decreased FAH stability. Conversely, knocking out Cdh1 results in elevated FAH protein levels, confirming the role of Cdh1 in FAH regulation (Kaushal2020E3).

FAH and Cdh1 co-localize in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, predominantly in the nucleus, and interact at both exogenous and endogenous levels. This physical interaction has been validated through co-immunoprecipitation assays, where Myc-tagged FAH and Flag-tagged Cdh1 were co-transfected into cells, and their interaction was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting techniques (Kaushal2020E3).

These interactions highlight the regulatory mechanisms controlling FAH protein stability, which are essential for maintaining metabolic balance and preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites associated with conditions like hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1) (Kaushal2020E3).
