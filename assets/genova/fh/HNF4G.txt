# HNF4G

## Overview
HNF4G (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 gamma) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression, particularly in the liver and other tissues, by binding to specific DNA sequences to modulate transcription. As a transcription factor, HNF4G is involved in critical biological processes, including glucose and lipid metabolism, cellular differentiation, and proliferation. It is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy balance. HNF4G's regulatory functions extend to maintaining the integrity of cell junctions, influencing physiological processes such as nutrient absorption and barrier function in epithelial tissues. Its involvement in various cancers, such as glioma, bladder cancer, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, underscores its clinical significance, with potential implications for therapeutic interventions (Ding2021Pseudogene; Che2023HNF4G; Wang2020Metformin).

## Function
HNF4G (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 gamma) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, particularly in the liver and other tissues. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate transcription. HNF4G is involved in various molecular processes, including the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy balance. This transcription factor influences cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation, contributing to the proper functioning of cells and tissues.

In healthy human cells, HNF4G is known to regulate the expression of genes involved in maintaining the integrity of cell junctions, which are essential for tissue structure and function. For instance, in the context of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB), HNF4G directly binds to the promoters of tight junction proteins like ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5, promoting their transcription and thus influencing BTB permeability (Ding2021Pseudogene). This regulatory role highlights HNF4G's importance in maintaining cell barrier integrity and its potential impact on physiological processes such as nutrient absorption and barrier function in epithelial tissues.

## Clinical Significance
HNF4G (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 gamma) is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role as a transcription factor. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), HNF4G acts as an oncogene, promoting cancer invasiveness and metastasis, particularly in the context of SMAD4 deficiency. SMAD4, a tumor suppressor gene, negatively regulates HNF4G expression. When SMAD4 is deficient, HNF4G is overexpressed, leading to poor prognosis in PDAC patients (Wang2020Metformin). Metformin, a diabetes medication, has been shown to inhibit HNF4G activity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent in SMAD4-deficient PDAC (Wang2020Metformin).

HNF4G is also associated with pancreatic cancer risk through common germline variations. It is part of a transcriptional network crucial for pancreatic development and homeostasis, and its variants have been linked to body mass index in genome-wide association studies (Li2012Pathway). Although the role of HNF4G in other diseases is less clear, its involvement in metabolic pathways suggests potential links to metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and liver diseases, due to its regulatory functions in glucose and lipid metabolism (S.2013Network).

## Interactions
HNF4G (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 gamma) is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and cellular processes. In glioma, HNF4G interacts with the neuropilin-1 (NRP1) gene by binding to its promoter region, thereby enhancing NRP1 transcription. This interaction promotes glioma cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, highlighting HNF4G's role in glioma progression (Che2023HNF4G).

In bladder cancer, HNF4G regulates the expression of the hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) gene. It binds to the promoter/enhancer region of HAS2, activating its transcription. This interaction is crucial for the growth and invasion of bladder cancer cells, as HAS2 expression contributes to a tumor-promoting environment (Okegawa2013Orphan).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), HNF4G is involved in the cell-cell junction pathway, which is essential for maintaining cell junction integrity and influencing cancer metastasis. HNF4G's activity in this pathway is modulated by Metformin, which induces its degradation through an AMPK-dependent mechanism, thereby reducing PDAC progression (Wang2020Metformin).

HNF4G also interacts with YBX2, a protein that stabilizes HNF4G mRNA by binding to its 3'UTR. This interaction affects blood-tumor barrier permeability, as YBX2 enhances HNF4G mRNA stability, influencing the expression of tight junction proteins (Ding2021Pseudogene).
