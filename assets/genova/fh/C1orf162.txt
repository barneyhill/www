# C1orf162

## Overview
C1orf162 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 162. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are still being elucidated. Current research suggests that the C1orf162 protein may play a role in pathways related to neurodegeneration, extracellular matrix organization, and inflammatory responses, indicating its potential involvement in a range of diseases (Wang2023Bioinformatics; Rahman2019Identification). The gene has been implicated in conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, heart failure, lung cancer, and maternal obesity, highlighting its significance in both neurological and systemic pathologies (Liu2024A; Laird2021Personalized). Further studies are required to fully understand the functional mechanisms of C1orf162 and its encoded protein, as well as their implications in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
C1orf162 has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels, although its specific clinical significance remains under investigation. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), C1orf162 was identified as a commonly perturbed gene in personalized perturbation profiles, suggesting a potential role in ASD etiology (Laird2021Personalized). In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), C1orf162 was found to be differentially expressed in both blood cells and brain tissues, indicating its involvement in neurodegeneration-related pathways and its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis (Rahman2019Identification).

C1orf162 has also been associated with the co-occurrence of heart failure and lung cancer, where it is involved in pathways related to extracellular matrix organization and inflammatory responses (Wang2023Bioinformatics). In the context of maternal obesity, C1orf162 was identified as a signature gene with increased expression in the placenta, potentially affecting fetal programming (Liu2024A). Additionally, C1orf162 was listed among hub genes for early detection of bone metastasis in breast cancer, although its expression differences were not statistically significant (Zhao2022Identification). These findings suggest that C1orf162 may play a role in various pathological conditions, warranting further research to elucidate its clinical implications.
