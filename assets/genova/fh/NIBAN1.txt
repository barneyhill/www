# NIBAN1

## Overview
NIBAN1 is a gene that encodes the protein niban apoptosis regulator 1, which plays a critical role in regulating apoptosis and maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly under stress conditions. The protein is characterized by the presence of a dnaJ domain, which is commonly found in heat shock proteins, indicating its involvement in stress response mechanisms. Niban apoptosis regulator 1 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and prostate, with particularly high expression in smooth muscle, urinary bladder, and salivary gland. It is active in multiple cellular compartments, such as the cytoplasm, membrane, and nucleus, and can relocate to the nucleus under stress conditions like heat shock or oxidative stress. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which is thought to be mediated by the AKT pathway. NIBAN1 is implicated in several cellular stress responses, including the unfolded protein response, mitochondrial stress responses, and autophagy, and it influences the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway to promote autophagy in normal thyroid cells under stress (Diana2022NIBAN1).

## Function
The NIBAN1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating apoptosis and maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly under stress conditions. In healthy human cells, NIBAN1 is involved in the decision-making process between cell survival and death, participating in cellular mechanisms that aim to minimize damage to cellular homeostasis (Diana2022NIBAN1). It is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and prostate, and is highly expressed in smooth muscle, urinary bladder, and salivary gland (Diana2022NIBAN1).

NIBAN1 is active in several cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm, membrane, and nucleus. Under stress conditions, such as heat shock or oxidative stress, it can relocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Diana2022NIBAN1). The protein contains a dnaJ domain, common in heat shock proteins, suggesting a role in stress response. NIBAN1 undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which is thought to be mediated by AKT (Diana2022NIBAN1).

NIBAN1 is implicated in various cellular stress responses, including the unfolded protein response, mitochondrial stress responses, and autophagy, helping cells adapt to changes in the microenvironment and maintain homeostasis (Diana2022NIBAN1). It also influences autophagy by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, promoting autophagy in normal thyroid cells under stress (Diana2022NIBAN1).

## Clinical Significance
The NIBAN1 gene is significantly implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In renal cell carcinoma, NIBAN1 is overexpressed in early carcinogenesis stages, suggesting its role in tumor development (Diana2022NIBAN1). It is also linked to mutations in Tsc1/Tsc2 and the mTOR pathway, indicating its involvement in endoplasmic reticulum stress responses (Diana2022NIBAN1). In thyroid cancer, NIBAN1 is overexpressed in several subtypes and is associated with altered mitochondrial functions and early carcinogenesis (Diana2022NIBAN1). Its expression is also noted in prostate, colon, and lung cancers, where it influences cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy (Diana2022NIBAN1).

NIBAN1's role extends to the immune microenvironment, where it is part of a gene signature associated with immune infiltration in colorectal cancer (Diana2022NIBAN1). It is involved in regulating cell death and survival through the MDM2/p53/Bcl2/Bax pathway, affecting apoptosis and autophagy in various cancers (Diana2022NIBAN1). These findings suggest that NIBAN1 may serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target in oncology.

## Interactions
NIBAN1, also known as niban apoptosis regulator 1, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular stress responses and apoptosis regulation. One of the key interactions of NIBAN1 is with nucleophosmin (NPM) and MDM2. Upon phosphorylation by AKT at serine 602, NIBAN1 enhances its binding to NPM, which disrupts the NPM-MDM2 complex. This disruption allows MDM2 to interact more freely with p53, leading to p53 degradation and providing an antiapoptotic effect (Ji2012AKT‐dependent; Ji2014AKT‐dependent).

NIBAN1 also interacts with the mTOR pathway, which is significant for regulating apoptosis and autophagy. In the context of phenformin treatment in oral squamous cell carcinoma, NIBAN1, along with DDIT4, influences the expression of autophagy markers by modulating the mTOR pathway (Zhuang2024Phenformin).

Additionally, NIBAN1 is involved in the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factors, such as eIF2α, and the regulation of protein translation machinery, which is crucial during endoplasmic reticulum stress (Sun2007The). These interactions highlight NIBAN1's role in modulating cellular responses to stress and its potential impact on cancer cell survival.
