# MAPK8IP3

## Overview
MAPK8IP3, also known as JIP3, is a gene that encodes the mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 interacting protein 3, a scaffold protein integral to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by its ability to interact with various motor proteins, such as kinesin and dynein, through its structural domains, including a coiled-coil domain and a leucine zipper. These interactions are crucial for its role in axonal transport and endocytosis, particularly in neurons, where it facilitates the transport of lysosomes and endosomes. The protein's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its significance in neuronal function and development, with implications in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as certain cancers (Snead2022Loss; Kelkar2005Role).

## Structure
MAPK8IP3, also known as JIP3, is a scaffold protein involved in the JNK signaling pathway. The protein is characterized by several structural domains that facilitate its function. It contains a coiled-coil domain and a leucine zipper, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with kinesin light chain (Snead2022Loss; Kelkar2005Role). These domains enable JIP3 to interact with motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin, playing a role in axonal lysosome transport and endocytosis in neurons (Snead2022Loss).

JIP3 also features a JNK binding domain and a JNK phosphorylation domain, indicating its role in the JNK signaling cascade (Kelkar2005Role). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may affect its interactions and functions (Snead2022Loss).

The gene encoding MAPK8IP3 may produce splice variant isoforms, which could lead to proteins with distinct functions, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context (Snead2022Loss). The protein's ability to form complexes with other proteins suggests a quaternary structure, although specific details on this aspect are not provided in the context.

## Function
MAPK8IP3, also known as JIP3, is a scaffold protein that plays a significant role in neuronal function and development. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is essential for axonal transport, acting as an adaptor between lysosomes and motor proteins to facilitate axonal lysosome transport (Snead2022Loss). In neurons, MAPK8IP3 is involved in endocytosis, particularly in regulating macropinocytosis and endosomal recycling through its interaction with the small GTPase ARF6. The loss of MAPK8IP3 in neurons leads to a decrease in the uptake of fluorescently tagged Dextran and BSA, indicating its role in endocytic uptake (Snead2022Loss).

MAPK8IP3 is also implicated in the formation of macropinosomes by coupling the dynein motor to the growing structure, a process observed in cultured cancer cell lines (Snead2022Loss). The protein's involvement in axonal transport of endo-lysosomes suggests its importance in maintaining proper endocytic uptake and transport in neurons (Snead2022Loss). Variants of MAPK8IP3 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the importance of understanding its role in neuronal processes (Snead2022Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAPK8IP3 gene have been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders. De novo variants in MAPK8IP3 are associated with neurodevelopmental diseases characterized by intellectual disability and brain anomalies, such as perisylvian polymicrogyria and cerebral or cerebellar atrophy (Zanella2023Editorial:; Snead2022Loss). These variants often affect the leucine zipper domain, crucial for interaction with ARF6, impacting neuronal endocytosis and macropinocytosis (Snead2022Loss).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, rare loss-of-function variants in MAPK8IP3 have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, with studies suggesting that reduced protein levels may increase the risk of neurodegeneration (Silvaieh2023Comprehensive). Additionally, MAPK8IP3 mutations have been associated with early-onset dementia, although the specific role of these variants requires further investigation (Silvaieh2023Comprehensive).

MAPK8IP3 is also implicated in cancer, particularly in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and pancreatic cancer. In CRPC, high expression levels of MAPK8IP3 correlate with worse pathological stages and increased tumorigenicity (Cheng2020Identification). In pancreatic cancer, MAPK8IP3 overexpression contributes to excessive cell proliferation and cancer progression (Yuan2015Mining).

## Interactions
MAPK8IP3, also known as JIP3, is a scaffold protein that interacts with various cytoskeletal motors and proteins, playing a crucial role in intracellular transport and signaling pathways. The N-terminal part of JIP3 contains an RH1 domain and a Leucine Zipper I (LZI) coiled coil, which serve as binding sites for microtubule-based motors such as kinesin1-KHC and dynein-DLIC, as well as the actin-based motor myosin 5a (Vilela2019Structural). JIP3 interacts with kinesin1-KHC and kinesin1-KLC independently at the RH1-LZI and LZII binding sites, respectively, and with the dynein/dynactin complex at both sites (Vilela2019Structural).

The RH1 domain of JIP3 is a versatile structural motor-binding motif, interacting with kinesin1-KHC, myosin 5a, and the p150 glued subunit of the dynactin complex (Vilela2019Structural). JIP3 also interacts with Arf6, a small GTPase, through its leucine zipper motif, which is crucial for the recruitment of JIP3 to the plasma membrane and influences motor activity (Williamson2019Arf6). This interaction is essential for processes like macropinocytosis, where JIP3 facilitates the recruitment of dynein motors (Williamson2019Arf6). Additionally, JIP3 is involved in lysosome transport and the regulation of the axonal cytoskeleton, interacting with components like spectrin, F-actin, and myosin II (Rafiq2022JIP3).
