# GNB3

## Overview
The GNB3 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 3, a critical component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction. This protein belongs to the superfamily of propeller proteins, characterized by a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, which plays a pivotal role in the modulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways (Rosskopf2000G). The GNB3 protein is integral to various cellular processes, including immune response modulation and chemotaxis, particularly in T cells and neutrophils (Lindemann2001The). The gene is notable for its polymorphisms, such as the C825T variant, which is associated with enhanced signal transduction and linked to several clinical conditions, including hypertension and obesity (Benjafield1998GProtein; Virchow1998Enhanced). The multifunctionality and clinical significance of GNB3 underscore its importance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Structure
The GNB3 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 3, which is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction. The protein is part of the superfamily of propeller proteins, characterized by seven WD repeats that form a torus-like structure (Rosskopf2000G). These WD domains are not directly correlated with the exon structure of the gene. For example, exon 6 codes for only one β-strand of a WD domain, while exons 9 and 10 each define seven individual β-strands (Rosskopf2000G).

The GNB3 protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in the Gβ3s isoform, which lacks one entire WD domain. This splice variant is associated with the C825T polymorphism, linked to conditions such as hypertension and obesity (Rosskopf2000G). The GNB3 G814A polymorphism results in a glycine to serine substitution at position 272, affecting a conserved amino acid motif within the 'propeller' blade structure of the protein (Rosskopf2000G).

The promoter region of the GNB3 gene lacks a TATA box but contains GC-rich regions, and its activity has been confirmed through reporter gene assays (Rosskopf2000G). The gene's structure and function are further influenced by several identified polymorphisms (Rosskopf2000G).

## Function
The GNB3 gene encodes the G protein β3 subunit, which is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction. These proteins play a crucial role in transmitting signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and some receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity to intracellular effectors, influencing various cellular processes (Lindemann2001The). The GNB3 protein is active in the cell membrane and is involved in modulating immune responses, particularly in T cells and neutrophils. It affects chemotaxis, antigen-specific cellular immune response, and IL-2-induced proliferation, indicating a central role in signal transduction in CD4 T cells (Lindemann2001The).

The GNB3 gene has a known polymorphism, C825T, which results in a splice variant (Gβ3-s) with enhanced activity. This variant is associated with altered signal transduction through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, leading to increased chemotaxis in neutrophils and lymphocytes (Benjafield1998GProtein; Virchow1998Enhanced). The presence of the 825T allele is linked to enhanced T cell responses and increased proliferation of T lymphocytes after stimulation with recall antigens, suggesting a more effective immune response (Lindemann2001The).

## Clinical Significance
The GNB3 gene, encoding the G protein subunit beta 3, is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in signal transduction. The c.825C > T polymorphism in GNB3 is associated with various cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. This polymorphism leads to the formation of a truncated Gβ3-s protein, which enhances G protein-induced signaling pathways. Carriers of the TT genotype are linked to essential hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and increased cardiovascular morbidity (Birkner2023SingleNucleotide). The TT genotype is also associated with a higher need for antihypertensive therapy in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy, particularly among women (Birkner2023SingleNucleotide).

In hypertensive individuals, the TT genotype is linked to microalbuminuria in women and cardiovascular disease in men, suggesting sex-specific pathophysiological mechanisms (Romundstad2010The). The C825T polymorphism is also associated with lower plasma renin levels and elevated diastolic blood pressure, contributing to hypertension (Schunkert1998Association).

In rge chickens, a d153del mutation in GNB3 results in tissue-specific signaling defects and renal abnormalities, highlighting the gene's role in renal and visual pathologies (Tummala2011The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GNB3 in various diseases.

## Interactions
The G protein subunit beta 3 (GNB3) is a component of the Gβγ functional subunit, which forms a tightly associated heterodimer with the Gγ subunit. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the Gβγ subunit, a key player in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. The Gβ subunit, including GNB3, is characterized by a β-propeller structure with 7 blades, each consisting of four-stranded β-sheets. The N-terminally located α-helical segment of Gβ is involved in forming a coiled-coil structure with the Gγ subunit, highlighting the dynamic nature of GNB3's interactions within the Gβγ complex (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

GNB3, as part of the Gβγ subunit, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of actin filament formation, cell junctions, and other macromolecular complexes (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The Gβγ subunit is involved in a large combinatorial network of interactions, as it can interact with over 850 different GPCRs and approximately 40 G protein effectors, modulators, and scaffold proteins known as regulators of G signaling (RGS) proteins (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). These interactions underscore the complexity and multifunctionality of GNB3 in cellular signaling.
