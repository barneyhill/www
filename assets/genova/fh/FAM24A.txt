# FAM24A

## Overview
FAM24A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 24 member A. This protein is part of a broader family characterized by shared sequence motifs, although its specific biological role and functional mechanisms remain largely unexplored. The gene has been studied in various contexts, including its potential involvement in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) and testis-selective gene expression, as well as its possible association with asthma in certain populations. Despite these associations, the precise function of the FAM24A protein and its implications in human health and disease are not yet fully understood, necessitating further research to elucidate its role (Torgerson2012Casecontrol; Wang2010Microarray; Lussier2018DNA).

## Clinical Significance
FAM24A has been implicated in several conditions, although its clinical significance is not fully understood. In the context of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), a study identified differential DNA methylation patterns in children with FASD compared to typically developing controls. Specifically, two CpG sites in the FAM24A gene were found to be upmethylated in individuals with FASD, suggesting a potential epigenetic association with the disorder (Lussier2018DNA). However, the clinical implications of these findings remain unclear.

In another study, FAM24A was identified as one of the top candidates for testis-selective gene expression, although its expression and function in the testis have not been well documented. The study suggested that FAM24A might have high expression levels in the testis, but due to the limited sample size, it is uncertain whether it truly represents a testis-selective gene (Wang2010Microarray).

Additionally, FAM24A was mentioned in a case-control admixture mapping study investigating asthma-associated genes in Latino populations. While FAM24A was listed among several genes potentially linked to asthma, the study did not provide specific details on its clinical significance or functional role in asthma (Torgerson2012Casecontrol).
