# SPRN

## Overview
The SPRN gene encodes the Shadoo (Sho) protein, a glycoprotein primarily expressed in the central nervous system. Sho is a membrane-associated protein, anchored to the cell surface via a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and is involved in neuroprotection and cellular stress responses. Structurally, Sho shares several features with the prion protein (PrP), including a central hydrophobic domain and charged N-terminal repeats, although it lacks the 3-helix bundle structure characteristic of PrP. Sho's ability to bind RNA and nucleic acids suggests a role in neural plasticity and RNA transport. It interacts with various proteins, including PrP and mitochondrial chaperones, and is implicated in the cellular response to prion accumulation. Genetic variations in SPRN have been linked to susceptibility to prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Corley2008Identification; Westaway2011The; Beck2008Association).

## Structure
The Shadoo (Sho) protein, encoded by the SPRN gene, exhibits several structural features that are similar to the prion protein (PrP). Sho contains charged tandem N-terminal repeats, a central hydrophobic domain (HD), and a distinct C-terminal region. The N-terminal repeats of Sho include 'RGG' boxes, which are associated with RNA binding, differing from the histidine-containing, copper-binding octarepeats found in PrP (Westaway2011The). The central hydrophobic domain of Sho consists of five tandem repeats of a four amino acid sequence with 'GxxxG' motifs, unlike the palindromic sequence in PrP (Westaway2011The). The C-terminal region of Sho lacks the 3-helix bundle structure found in PrP and includes a conserved NXT glycosylation motif (Ciric2015Biochemical).

Sho is presented on the cell surface via a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, similar to PrP (Ciric2015Biochemical; Westaway2011The). The protein can refold into an amyloid-like form and shares some protein partners with PrP (Westaway2011The). Genetic variations in the Sho hydrophobic domain, such as deletion and insertion variants, are more common in sheep and bovine species and rare in humans (Westaway2011The).

## Function
The SPRN gene encodes the Shadoo (Sho) protein, which is primarily expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and plays a role in neuroprotection and cellular stress responses. Sho is structurally distinct from the prion protein (PrP) but shares a conserved hydrophobic domain crucial for protein-protein interactions (Dondapati2021Membrane). It contains arginine-rich tetra-repeat segments that enable RNA and nucleic acid binding, contributing to its nuclear localization and potential role in neural plasticity by shuttling RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Corley2008Identification).

Sho is suggested to have neuroprotective actions similar to wild-type PrP, providing protection against neurotoxic insults in neuronal cultures (Westaway2011The). It may act as a receptor for ligands at the cell surface, engaging in signaling functions at the plasma membrane (Corley2008Identification). Sho can also induce spontaneous ionic currents in cultured cells, a function linked to its physiological role in modulating ion channel activities (Nyeste2016The).

In prion-infected models, Sho levels decrease, similar to PrP depletion during prion disease, but it does not protect against infection or influence prion replication (Dondapati2021Membrane). Sho's expression is brain-specific, suggesting its involvement in CNS function (Watts2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the SPRN gene have been associated with susceptibility to prion diseases, such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). A frameshift mutation in the SPRN gene, leading to a potential null allele, was identified in two vCJD patients, suggesting a possible link to the disease (Beck2008Association). Additionally, two linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SPRN were associated with an increased risk of sCJD (Beck2008Association).

The SPRN gene's role in prion diseases is further supported by the down-regulation of its encoded protein, Shadoo (Sho), during prion infections. This down-regulation occurs before the onset of clinical symptoms and is inversely related to the accumulation of misfolded prion proteins (PrPSc) (Westaway2011DownRegulation). Different prion strains have varying effects on Sho levels, indicating that Sho down-regulation is a pre-clinical event in prion diseases (Westaway2011DownRegulation).

In goats, a specific indel polymorphism in the SPRN gene was associated with scrapie susceptibility, highlighting the gene's potential role in prion disease pathogenesis across different species (Kim2019Scrapie).

## Interactions
The SPRN gene encodes the Shadoo (Sho) protein, which is involved in various protein interactions that may influence prion diseases. Sho is known to interact with the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1, which regulates its localization between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. TRAP1 overexpression decreases Sho's mitochondrial targeting, suggesting that TRAP1 prevents aberrant Sho translocation to mitochondria by binding it at the ER (Pepe2017Regulation).

Sho also interacts with prion protein (PrP) and its disease-associated isoform PrPSc. In prion-infected brains, Sho levels are inversely correlated with PrPSc levels, indicating that Sho may be targeted for degradation by binding to aggregated PrPSc. This interaction suggests a potential role for Sho in the cellular response to prion accumulation (Watts2011ProteaseResistant).

Sho's interaction with lipid rafts and ER chaperones, such as Calreticulin (CRT), suggests that these interactions may influence its folding and maturation. Sho shows partial resistance to proteinase K, which increases with cholesterol depletion, indicating that lipid rafts play a role in its structural stability (Pepe2017Regulation). These interactions highlight Sho's involvement in cellular processes related to prion protein biology.
