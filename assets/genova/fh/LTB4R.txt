# LTB4R

## Overview
The LTB4R gene encodes the leukotriene B4 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in mediating inflammatory responses. This receptor, also known as BLT1, is characterized by its seven-transmembrane helix structure, typical of class A GPCRs, and is primarily involved in binding leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent pro-inflammatory lipid mediator. The interaction between LTB4 and its receptor facilitates various intracellular signaling pathways, including the mobilization of calcium ions and the modulation of cyclic AMP levels, which are crucial for immune cell recruitment and activation. LTB4R is expressed in a variety of immune cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases and cancers, including asthma, atherosclerosis, and colorectal cancer. The receptor's activity and expression are regulated through complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions in inflammatory and cancerous conditions (Bäck2011International; Wilson2014Humanspecific; Tang2024Leukotriene).

## Structure
The leukotriene B4 receptor (LTB4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane helix structure, typical of class A GPCRs (Hirakata2020Leukotriene). This structure facilitates its role in signal transduction by coupling with Gq and Gi proteins, leading to the activation of intracellular signaling pathways such as phospholipase C and the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Hirakata2020Leukotriene). The primary structure of LTB4R includes specific amino acid sequences that are crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation. 

LTB4R is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and function. The receptor also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may alter its function or expression in different tissues (Tulah2012Leukotriene). These isoforms result from complex mRNA arrangements and multiple promoter regions, indicating additional levels of regulation (Tulah2012Leukotriene). The receptor's structure and its variations play a significant role in its function as a mediator of inflammatory responses, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in inflammatory diseases (Yokomizo2014Two).

## Function
The LTB4R gene encodes the BLT1 receptor, a high-affinity G-protein-coupled receptor for leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent inflammatory mediator. This receptor is primarily involved in the binding of LTB4, facilitating the mobilization of intracellular calcium and inhibiting cAMP formation, which are crucial for mediating inflammatory responses (Bäck2011International). The BLT1 receptor is expressed in various cell types, including phagocytic leukocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells, playing a significant role in immune cell recruitment and activation (Bäck2011International; Yokomizo2014Two).

In healthy human cells, the LTB4R gene is highly expressed in blood cell types, particularly in the myeloid lineage, such as neutrophils and monocytes. It plays a crucial role in linking early immune activation, neutrophil auto-signaling, and early effector T-cell recruitment, acting as a potent nonchemokine pathway for cytotoxic effector cell traffic (Wilson2014Humanspecific). The receptor's activity is modulated by various ligands, including LTB4 and its metabolites, and is involved in the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor that regulates immune and inflammatory responses (Bäck2011International). The LTB4-LTB4R axis is essential for the immune system, influencing the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases (Wilson2014Humanspecific).

## Clinical Significance
The LTB4R gene, encoding the leukotriene B4 receptor, is implicated in several inflammatory diseases due to alterations in its expression and function. Human-specific epigenetic variations in LTB4R, such as hypomethylation in the promoter region and increased methylation in the gene body, are associated with heightened immune responses. These changes are linked to diseases like asthma, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, obesity-related inflammation, and inflammatory bowel disease (Wilson2014Humanspecific). 

In asthma, polymorphisms in the LTB4R gene have been studied, although no direct link to asthma susceptibility or severity was found. However, the LTB4-LTB4R interaction is crucial in recruiting neutrophils and eosinophils, suggesting that blocking this pathway could mitigate inflammatory responses in asthmatic airways (Tulah2012Leukotriene). 

In colorectal cancer (CRC), LTB4R is highly expressed and influences prognosis. Knockdown of LTB4R in CRC cells reduces viability, migration, and invasion, and increases apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor progression. This suggests LTB4R as a potential therapeutic target in CRC (Tang2024Leukotriene). 

Overall, alterations in LTB4R expression and interactions contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and cancerous conditions.

## Interactions
The leukotriene B4 receptor (LTB4R), also known as BLT1, is a G protein-coupled receptor that primarily interacts with leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a pro-inflammatory lipid mediator. LTB4R forms complexes with G proteins, specifically Gq and Gi, which influence intracellular signaling pathways. The interaction with Gq leads to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) β, resulting in the accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. The interaction with Gi results in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and a decrease in cAMP levels (Sasaki2019The; Hirakata2020Leukotriene).

LTB4R is expressed in various leukocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and differentiated CD4+ T cells. It plays a role in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and immunological responses. The receptor's transcription is regulated by the transcription factor Sp1 and the methylation of CpG islands in its promoter. Runx1 enhances LTB4R expression by binding to an enhancer element downstream of the transcription start site (Sasaki2019The).

In colorectal cancer, LTB4R is involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, affecting cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis (Tang2024Leukotriene).
