# ASB8

## Overview
The ASB8 gene encodes the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 8 protein, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes, functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular processes such as signal transduction and protein degradation, particularly within the context of the interferon signaling pathway. ASB8 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and testis, indicating its potential involvement in spermatogenesis and muscle function. The protein's interactions with key signaling molecules, such as the TBK1/IKKi complex, underscore its importance in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Alterations in ASB8 expression and function have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Liu2003Molecular; Anasa2018Multifaceted; Guo2020E3).

## Structure
The ASB8 protein is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing protein family. It is encoded by a cDNA sequence that is 2545 base pairs long, resulting in a polypeptide of 288 amino acids (Liu2003Molecular). The protein structure includes four ankyrin repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, and a SOCS box located at the C-terminus (Liu2003Molecular; Anasa2018Multifaceted). The ankyrin repeats are characterized by 30-34 amino acid residues forming two antiparallel α-helices and a β-hairpin, creating an elongated structure with a hydrophobic core (Anasa2018Multifaceted). The SOCS box domain is involved in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling and interacts with components of the ECS complex (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

ASB8 contains potential phosphorylation sites, including five protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, five casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and six N-myristoylation sites, which may influence its function (Liu2003Molecular). The protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of transfected cancer cells (Liu2003Molecular). The ASB8 protein can interact with the Elongin B-C complex, and a truncated mutant lacking the SOCS box can suppress the growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells (Liu2003Molecular).

## Function
The ASB8 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing protein family, which plays a role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes. In healthy human cells, ASB8 is prominently expressed in skeletal muscle and testis, particularly in spermatocytes and spermatids, suggesting its involvement in spermatogenesis and muscle function (Anasa2018Multifaceted). The protein is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and is involved in cellular processes such as signal transduction and protein degradation (Liu2003Molecular).

ASB8 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulating the interferon signaling pathway by interacting with the TBK1/IKKi complex. This interaction influences the phosphorylation of IRF3, a key component in the innate immune response, thereby modulating the production of type I interferons (Guo2020E3). The protein's role in ubiquitination involves marking proteins for degradation, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating immune responses (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

The ASB8 protein's activity in these molecular processes highlights its importance in both normal cellular functions and potential pathological conditions, such as cancer and immune regulation (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

## Clinical Significance
ASB8 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In lung carcinoma, ASB8 is upregulated in cancer cell lines such as SPC-A1, A549, and NCI-H446, despite being absent in normal lung tissues. This suggests a role in promoting cancer cell growth. A mutant form of ASB8 lacking the SOCS box domain acts as a dominant negative regulator, inhibiting cancer growth, indicating that alterations in ASB8 can influence cancer progression and treatment outcomes (Liu2003Molecular; Anasa2018Multifaceted).

In colorectal cancer, ASB8 expression is downregulated by microRNA 452 (MIR452), which is upregulated in cancerous tissues. This downregulation of ASB8 by MIR452 suggests a potential role in early colorectal carcinogenesis, highlighting the significance of ASB8 expression levels in cancer development (Mo2021MicroRNA).

Mutations or deletions affecting the SOCS box domain of ASB8 disrupt its interaction with the Elongin B and C complex, which is crucial for its function. Such disruptions can significantly affect cell proliferation, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting that these mutations may alter cell growth dynamics relevant to cancer biology (Liu2003Molecular).

## Interactions
ASB8 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in the regulation of the interferon signaling pathway. It binds to the kinase domains of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit epsilon (IKKi), which are crucial components of the IRF3 signaling pathway. This interaction was confirmed through co-transfection experiments in HEK293 T cells and further validated by immunoprecipitation and indirect immunofluorescence experiments (Guo2020E3). ASB8 does not interact with MDA5, MAVS, or IRF3, indicating specificity in its binding partners (Guo2020E3).

ASB8 also mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of TBK1 and IKKi through K48-linked ubiquitination, negatively regulating the interferon signaling pathway (Guo2020E3). The protein LRRC10B has been identified as a facilitator of the interaction between ASB8 and the TBK1/IKKi complex, suggesting a role in modulating these interactions (Guo2020E3).

In addition to its role in the interferon pathway, ASB8 interacts with the Elongin B-C complex, a common feature of SOCS box-containing proteins, which recruit interacting partners to a core ubiquitination complex (Liu2003Molecular).
