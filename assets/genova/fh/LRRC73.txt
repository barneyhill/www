# LRRC73

## Overview
The LRRC73 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat containing 73 protein, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. These domains are integral to the protein's role in mediating protein-protein interactions, often forming a horseshoe-shaped structure that facilitates these interactions. The protein's structure, including its primary, secondary, and tertiary configurations, is essential for its functional capabilities within the cell. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination further regulate its activity and cellular localization. Additionally, alternative splicing of the LRRC73 gene can produce different isoforms of the protein, potentially leading to diverse functional roles in various cellular processes. The specific biological functions and clinical significance of LRRC73 remain areas of active research (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
LRRC73 encodes a protein characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These LRR domains typically form a horseshoe-shaped structure, contributing to the protein's ability to interact with other molecules. The primary structure of LRRC73 consists of a sequence of amino acids that define its unique characteristics. The secondary structure may include elements such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are common in proteins with LRR domains. The tertiary structure of LRRC73 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is crucial for its function and interaction with other proteins. While the quaternary structure involves the assembly of multiple protein subunits, it is not specified whether LRRC73 forms such complexes.

Post-translational modifications of LRRC73 can include phosphorylation, glycosylation, or ubiquitination, which can influence the protein's function and localization within the cell. These modifications are essential for regulating the protein's activity and interactions. Additionally, splice variants of LRRC73 may result in different isoforms, each potentially having distinct functions. These variations can lead to differences in the protein's structure and role in cellular processes.
