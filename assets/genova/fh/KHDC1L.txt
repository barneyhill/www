# KHDC1L

## Overview
KHDC1L is a gene that encodes the protein KH domain containing 1 like, which is part of the KH domain-containing protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a KH domain, a conserved RNA-binding motif that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism and regulation. The KHDC1L protein is implicated in several biological functions, although its specific roles and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Research into KHDC1L is ongoing, with studies exploring its potential involvement in cellular pathways and its significance in health and disease contexts.
