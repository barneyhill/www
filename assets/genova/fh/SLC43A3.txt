# SLC43A3

## Overview
SLC43A3 is a gene that encodes the protein equilibrative nucleobase transporter 1 (ENBT1), a member of the solute carrier family 43. This protein functions as a purine-selective nucleobase transporter, facilitating the uptake of purine nucleobases such as adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine across the plasma membrane through a mechanism of facilitated diffusion (Furukawa2015Functional; Inoue2017Molecular). ENBT1 is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains, which are typical of the solute carrier family, and is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, lung, and heart (Furukawa2015Functional; Inoue2017Molecular). The protein plays a crucial role in the purine salvage pathway, contributing to nucleotide homeostasis and cellular proliferation (Furukawa2015Functional). SLC43A3 has been implicated in several cancers, including glioma and angiosarcoma, where its expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Li2022SLC43A3; Inoue2017Molecular).

## Structure
The SLC43A3 gene encodes a protein known as equilibrative nucleobase transporter 1 (ENBT1), which is a member of the solute carrier family 43. The protein consists of 491 amino acid residues and features 12 predicted transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of its primary structure (Furukawa2015Functional). The transmembrane topology of SLC43A3 is similar to other members of the SLC43A family, such as LAT3 and LAT4, and includes an extracellular loop between the first and second transmembrane domains with a putative N-glycosylation site, as well as large intracellular loops between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains (Inoue2017Molecular). This structural arrangement suggests a common mechanism of facilitated diffusion among SLC43A family members.

The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, lung, and heart, and is localized on the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes and the basolateral membrane of kidney epithelial cells (Inoue2017Molecular). While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of multiple transmembrane domains indicates a complex folding pattern necessary for its function as a transporter. The regulatory mechanism of its intracellular trafficking and potential post-translational modifications remain unclear (Inoue2017Molecular).

## Function
SLC43A3, also known as equilibrative nucleobase transporter 1 (ENBT1), is a purine-selective nucleobase transporter involved in the uptake of purine nucleobases such as adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine in mammalian cells (Furukawa2015Functional; Inoue2017Molecular). This transporter operates through facilitated diffusion, independent of sodium, chloride, or hydrogen ion gradients, allowing nucleobases to equilibrate across the plasma membrane (Furukawa2015Functional; Inoue2017Molecular). SLC43A3 is highly expressed in the liver, particularly on the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes, where it plays a significant role in hepatic nucleobase transport (Takenaka2020Functional; Inoue2017Molecular).

In healthy human cells, SLC43A3 is crucial for the purine salvage pathway, facilitating the cellular uptake of extracellular purine nucleobases, which are then converted into nucleotides by salvage enzymes (Furukawa2015Functional). This process is essential for maintaining intracellular nucleotide homeostasis, supporting nucleotide production, and contributing to cellular proliferation and tissue development (Furukawa2015Functional; Inoue2017Molecular). SLC43A3's activity is particularly important in tissues with high demands for nucleotide synthesis, such as the liver and lung, where it may also facilitate the systemic distribution of nucleobases (Furukawa2015Functional; Inoue2017Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC43A3 gene has been implicated in various cancers, particularly glioma, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. High levels of SLC43A3 expression in glioma patients correlate with reduced overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival, making it a potential prognostic marker (Li2022SLC43A3). The gene's expression is linked to increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and decreased apoptosis, suggesting a role in promoting oncogenesis (Li2022SLC43A3). 

SLC43A3 is also involved in the tumor immune microenvironment, potentially facilitating immune escape and contributing to tumor progression (Li2022SLC43A3). Its expression is positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, which may affect the immune response in glioma patients (Li2022SLC43A3). 

In addition to glioma, SLC43A3 has been identified as a fusion oncogene in angiosarcoma, indicating a role in angiogenesis and cellular proliferation (Inoue2017Molecular). Alterations in SLC43A3 expression have been observed in inflammatory conditions and thyroid carcinomas, suggesting its involvement in various pathophysiological processes (Furukawa2015Functional). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLC43A3 in cancer and other diseases.

## Interactions
The SLC43A3 gene encodes the equilibrative nucleobase transporter 1 (ENBT1), which is involved in the transport of purine nucleobases. ENBT1 interacts with salvage enzymes such as adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT1) to facilitate the conversion of nucleobases into nucleotides. This interaction suggests the formation of a potential multiprotein complex, akin to a transport metabolon, which enhances both transport and catalytic flux (Furukawa2015Functional; Inoue2017Molecular).

Experiments have demonstrated that the introduction of human ENBT1 and APRT into mouse fibroblast-derived A9 cells significantly increases adenine uptake, indicating a cooperative interaction between these proteins. Similarly, guanine uptake is enhanced by HPRT1 and further increased with ENBT1, suggesting that HPRT1 is necessary for guanine uptake in cooperation with ENBT1 (Furukawa2015Functional).

In addition to these interactions, SLC43A3 has been implicated in the formation of a fusion oncogene with NUP160 in angiosarcoma, which affects angiogenesis-related gene expression (Inoue2017Molecular). The precise nature of these interactions and their regulatory mechanisms remain areas for further research.
