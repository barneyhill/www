# SULT4A1

## Overview
SULT4A1 is a gene that encodes the protein sulfotransferase family 4A member 1, a cytosolic enzyme predominantly expressed in the brain. This protein is part of the sulfotransferase family, which is involved in the transfer of sulfate groups to various substrates, although SULT4A1 itself has unique structural features that differentiate it from other family members (AllaliHassani2007Structural). Unlike typical sulfotransferases, SULT4A1 does not bind the cofactor PAPS under standard conditions, suggesting a distinct regulatory role rather than a catalytic one (AllaliHassani2007Structural). The protein is highly conserved across species and plays a critical role in neuronal development and function, particularly in synaptic development and mitochondrial integrity (Coughtrie2016Function; Brettrager2022Sulfotransferase). SULT4A1's interactions with other proteins, such as Pin1, underscore its importance in maintaining synaptic balance and its potential implications in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (Culotta2020SULT4A1).

## Structure
SULT4A1 is a member of the human cytosolic sulfotransferase family, characterized by a unique molecular structure that distinguishes it from other sulfotransferases. The protein's structure includes a central four-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices and loops, a common fold among sulfotransferases (AllaliHassani2007Structural). However, SULT4A1 exhibits significant structural differences, such as a smaller PAPS binding pocket due to the replacement of a conserved tryptophan with leucine and a shorter PAP binding loop lacking a conserved lysine residue (AllaliHassani2007Structural).

SULT4A1 does not bind to the cofactor PAPS under typical conditions, which is attributed to these structural variations (AllaliHassani2007Structural). Despite this, SULT4A1 can bind to certain compounds like 2-hydroxylestradiol and thyroid hormone T4, suggesting a potential regulatory role in modulating their bioactivity (AllaliHassani2007Structural). The protein is highly conserved across species, with at least 83% amino acid sequence identity from fish to humans, and is predominantly expressed in the brain (Coughtrie2016Function). SULT4A1 has two major transcripts due to differential splicing, one coding for the full-length protein and another producing a shortened, unstable version (Coughtrie2016Function).

## Function
Sulfotransferase 4A1 (SULT4A1) is a cytosolic enzyme predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in neuronal development and function. Although its specific substrates remain unidentified, SULT4A1 is involved in modulating synaptic development by promoting the formation of the PSD-95/NMDAR complex, which is essential for synaptic transmission and dendritic spine formation (Culotta2020SULT4A1). SULT4A1 negatively regulates the catalytic activity of Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, thereby facilitating NMDAR synaptic expression and function (Culotta2020SULT4A1).

SULT4A1 is also associated with mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis, providing protection against oxidative stress. It is localized in the cytosol and mitochondria, where it supports mitochondrial integrity and function, crucial for neurons due to their high energy demands (Hossain2019SULT4A1; Brettrager2022Sulfotransferase). The enzyme's activity is sulfate-dependent, suggesting a role in cellular protection mechanisms (Brettrager2022Sulfotransferase). In knockout models, the absence of SULT4A1 leads to severe neurological defects, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal development and function (Culotta2020SULT4A1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SULT4A1 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. SULT4A1 is implicated in Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), where approximately 30% of patients have deletions encompassing this gene, leading to lower developmental quotients and neurological symptoms (Culotta2020SULT4A1). The gene is also linked to schizophrenia, with polymorphisms in its 5'-UTR associated with susceptibility to the disorder (Brettrager2022Sulfotransferase). Although no mutations in the coding region of SULT4A1 have been found in schizophrenia patients, genetic analyses suggest that mutations in untranslated regions may contribute to the condition (Lewis2009Lack; Kurogi2021SULT).

SULT4A1's role in synaptic development and function is crucial, as its knockdown leads to decreased glutamatergic and increased GABAergic activity, which may contribute to neurological conditions (Culotta2020SULT4A1). The gene's interaction with Pin1, a regulator of synaptic plasticity, affects synaptic transmission and dendritic spine stability, with potential clinical significance in rescuing synaptic deficits (Culotta2020SULT4A1). These findings highlight the importance of SULT4A1 in maintaining synaptic balance and its potential impact on neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
SULT4A1 interacts with the protein Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for modulating synaptic development and function. SULT4A1 prevents Pin1 from interacting with PSD-95, thereby promoting the formation of the PSD-95/NMDAR complex, which is essential for synaptic transmission and dendritic spine maturation (Culotta2020SULT4A1). The interaction between SULT4A1 and Pin1 is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at specific threonine residues, which may influence the stability and degradation of SULT4A1 (Coughtrie2016Function; culotta2018deciphering).

SULT4A1's interaction with Pin1 also affects the synaptic levels of Pin1, which in turn influences the expression of NMDAR subunits like GluN1 and GluN2B. In the absence of SULT4A1, increased Pin1 levels at synapses lead to reduced NMDAR-mediated currents, highlighting the importance of SULT4A1 in maintaining proper synaptic function (Culotta2020SULT4A1; culotta2018deciphering). This interaction underscores SULT4A1's role in neurodevelopmental processes and its potential implications in neurological disorders.
