# RFPL4A

## Overview
RFPL4A is a human gene that encodes the protein ret finger protein-like 4A, which is categorized as a RING-type E3 ligase. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination and degradation, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. RFPL4A is involved in interactions with key proteins such as DUX4, influencing conditions like Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) through its regulatory effects on transcription factors (Slavin2023The). Additionally, RFPL4A has been implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and viral life cycles, highlighting its significance in both cancer biology and virology (Rong2024The; Frey2020Nascent). The gene's expression and interactions have been associated with various diseases, including cancer and viral infections, making it a subject of interest for further research into its potential clinical applications (Waaje2024Network; Kumar2024Deciphering).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The RFPL4A gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections, RFPL4A is identified as a significant downregulated gene shared across lung cancer, tuberculosis, and COVID-19, suggesting its potential role in these diseases (Waaje2024Network). The gene is also involved in processes such as "Modulation By Symbiont of Entry into Host" and "Regulation Of Viral Life Cycle," indicating its relevance in viral infections (Waaje2024Network).

In cervical cancer research, RFPL4A was found to be significantly downregulated in 3D cultures compared to 2D cultures, highlighting its potential involvement in the tumor microenvironment and response to hypoxic conditions (Kumar2024Deciphering). Additionally, in gastric cancer patients from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, RFPL4A was noted as a unique mutant gene associated with stage II tumors, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Yuan2022The).

While RFPL4A is listed in a study on asthma-related genetic factors, its specific role in asthma pathogenesis remains unclear (Cha2023Gene–Smoking). Overall, RFPL4A's altered expression and interactions are linked to various diseases, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.

## Interactions
RFPL4A, a RING-type E3 ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the DUX4 protein, a transcription factor implicated in Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD). This interaction is localized to the first 342 residues of DUX4, which are identical in DUX4c, and is centered around a pair of DUX4 residues, Ala 256 and Pro 257, forming hydrophobic interactions within the SPRY domain of RFPL4A. Mutational analysis has shown that a mutation at Pro 257 significantly reduces the ability of DUX4 to pull down RFPL4A, indicating the importance of these residues for the interaction (Slavin2023The).

The interaction between DUX4 and RFPL4A suggests a feedback loop that may inhibit DUX4 activity through ubiquitination and degradation, potentially explaining the pulse-like expression of DUX4 observed in certain conditions (Slavin2023The). RFPL4A is also implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle in colorectal cancer (CRC), where it induces G1-phase retention, thereby decreasing sensitivity to chemotherapy. However, the specific mechanism of this effect remains to be elucidated (Rong2024The). Additionally, RFPL4A has been identified as a prolytic factor in the activation of the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) lytic cycle (Frey2020Nascent).
