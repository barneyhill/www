# OR7C2

## Overview
The OR7C2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 7 subfamily C member 2, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral to the olfactory system, playing a crucial role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals. The OR7C2 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitates its function in signal transduction across cell membranes (cvicek2015structure). Expressed in the olfactory epithelium, OR7C2 binds specific odorant molecules, initiating a cascade of intracellular events that culminate in the perception of smell (Olender2013An). Genetic variations, such as a 3-bp insertion identified in the Korean population, may influence the receptor's sensitivity and function, highlighting the gene's potential impact on olfactory perception and its broader implications in host-pathogen interactions and cancer biology (KIM2012Analysis; Zhang2024Global).

## Structure
The OR7C2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in odor detection. These receptors typically have a seven-transmembrane domain structure, characteristic of GPCRs, which facilitates their role in signal transduction across cell membranes (cvicek2015structure). The primary structure of OR7C2 consists of amino acid sequences that form the basis for its secondary and tertiary structures. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices, which are common in GPCRs and contribute to the formation of the transmembrane domains (cvicek2015structure).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices to create a functional receptor capable of binding odorant molecules. This folding is crucial for the receptor's ability to interact with G proteins and initiate intracellular signaling pathways (cvicek2015structure). While specific post-translational modifications for OR7C2 are not detailed in the context, GPCRs often undergo modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can affect receptor function and stability (cvicek2015structure). The OR7C2 protein's structure and function may also be influenced by genetic variations, such as the 3-bp insertion identified in the Korean population, which could impact odorant sensitivity (KIM2012Analysis).

## Function
OR7C2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR7C2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Olender2013An).

The function of OR7C2 in healthy human cells involves its role in olfactory signal transduction. When an odorant binds to OR7C2, it activates the associated G-protein, which then triggers a cascade of intracellular events leading to the generation of an electrical signal. This signal is transmitted to the brain, where it is interpreted as a specific smell. The ability of OR7C2 to bind different odorants can vary among individuals due to genetic variations, which may affect odorant sensitivity and perception (Olender2013An).

In addition to its role in olfaction, variations in the OR7C2 gene have been studied in different populations, such as the Korean population, where a specific 3-bp insertion was identified. This genetic variation may influence the functional structure of the OR7C2 protein, potentially affecting its role in olfactory perception (KIM2012Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
The OR7C2 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, has been studied for its potential clinical significance, particularly in relation to olfactory dysfunction. A study analyzing indel variations in the OR7C2 gene within a Korean population identified a 3-bp insertion with an allele frequency of 100%, indicating that this insertion is present in homozygosity across the population (KIM2012Analysis). This genetic variation may influence olfactory function, potentially leading to a biased preference for certain smells among Korean individuals, which could be linked to olfactory dysfunction (KIM2012Analysis).

While specific diseases directly associated with OR7C2 mutations or expression alterations are not detailed, the study suggests that indel polymorphisms in this gene could affect the formation of functional protein structures, thereby impacting its role in odor detection (KIM2012Analysis). The research highlights the importance of understanding these genetic variations as they may contribute to genetic susceptibility to diseases and could serve as potential therapeutic targets for genetic conditions in individuals with homozygous genotypes for these indels (KIM2012Analysis).

## Interactions
The OR7C2 gene, a member of the olfactory receptor family, has been identified to interact with multiple Ece1 peptides secreted by Candida albicans. A study using high-throughput enhanced yeast two-hybrid (HT-eY2H) screening revealed that OR7C2 consistently interacts with several Ece1 peptides, including Ece1-I, Ece1-II, Ece1-III, Ece1-IV, and Ece1-V. This suggests that OR7C2 may play a significant role in host-pathogen interactions, potentially influencing the biological roles of these peptides (Zhang2024Global).

In the context of cancer, OR7C2 is associated with hypomethylation, which is linked to cancer progression. The gene interacts with guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, which are involved in cell signaling pathways that may contribute to cancer cell survival and metastasis (Fessahaye2021Breast). These interactions highlight the potential role of OR7C2 in tumorigenesis and suggest that its interactions with other genes could be significant in cancer development.

While the specific protein interactions of OR7C2 in olfactory signaling are not detailed, it is known to be part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which typically interacts with G proteins to transduce signals (Fessahaye2021Breast).
