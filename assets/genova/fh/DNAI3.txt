# DNAI3

## Overview
DNAI3, or dynein axonemal intermediate chain 3, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the axonemal dynein complex, which is crucial for the motility of cilia and flagella in human cells. The protein encoded by DNAI3 is categorized as an intermediate chain within the dynein motor protein complex, playing a pivotal role in the sliding mechanism of microtubules within the axoneme, the structural core of cilia and flagella. This function is essential for various physiological processes, such as mucus clearance in the respiratory tract and sperm motility, which are vital for respiratory health and fertility, respectively (Rao2024Structure). DNAI3 interacts with other components of the dynein complex, including outer-arm and inner-arm dyneins, contributing to the structural integrity and functional capacity of these complexes (Wu2023DNALI1). Defects in the DNAI3 gene can lead to impaired ciliary and flagellar motility, with significant implications for human health.

## Function
DNAI3 (dynein axonemal intermediate chain 3) is a component of the axonemal dynein complex, which is essential for the motility of cilia and flagella in human cells. This protein plays a critical role in the sliding of microtubules within the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, facilitating their movement. This movement is vital for various physiological processes, including the clearance of mucus in the respiratory tract and the motility of sperm, which is crucial for fertility (Rao2024Structure).

In humans, DNAI3 interacts with other components of the axonemal dynein complex, such as the outer-arm dyneins (OADs) and inner-arm dyneins (IADs), contributing to the structural integrity and function of these complexes. Specifically, DNAI3 is noted for its interaction with the OAD's light chain Tctex heterodimer and the IADf's DNAI3 (IC140) and heavy chain tail, suggesting its role in maintaining the structural integrity necessary for effective ciliary and flagellar motility (Rao2024Structure).

The proper function of DNAI3 is crucial for the effective movement of cilia and flagella, and defects in this gene can lead to impaired motility, affecting processes like respiratory function and sperm motility (Wu2023DNALI1).

## Interactions
DNAI3, also known as dynein axonemal intermediate chain 3, is a component of the dynein motor protein complex involved in the structural organization and function of motile cilia. DNAI3 interacts with the outer-arm dynein's light chain Tctex heterodimer and the inner-arm dynein's DNAI3 (IC140) and heavy chain (HC) tail. These interactions suggest that DNAI3 plays a role in the structural organization and interaction of dynein complexes within the axoneme, although specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed (Rao2024Structure).

The outer-arm dyneins (OADs) and inner-arm dyneins (IADs) in the axoneme of motile cilia are diverse, forming single-headed, double-headed, or triple-headed complexes. In humans, the OADs are double-headed, while in organisms like Chlamydomonas and Tetrahymena, they are triple-headed. The innermost two heavy chains of the triple-headed OADs and the double-headed HCs are bound by heterodimeric intermediate chains and a substantial number of light chains, indicating a complex network of interactions that DNAI3 is part of (Rao2024Structure). However, specific details about DNAI3's physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively covered in the available literature.
