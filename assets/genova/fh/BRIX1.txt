# BRIX1

## Overview
BRIX1 (biogenesis of ribosomes BRX1) is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, a critical component of the ribosome responsible for protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The BRIX1 protein is categorized within the ribosome synthesis superfamily and is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it facilitates the binding of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) during ribosome assembly (Ge2020Expression; Jiang2024BRIX1). This process is essential for maintaining cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as responding to physiological demands. Dysregulation of BRIX1 has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Wang2020Integrated; Jiang2024BRIX1).

## Structure


## Function
BRIX1 (biogenesis of ribosomes BRX1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes, specifically in the synthesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit. This process is crucial for protein synthesis in cells, as ribosomes are responsible for translating mRNA into proteins. In healthy human cells, BRIX1 is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it participates in the assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, ensuring the proper function and maintenance of cellular activities (Ge2020Expression).

The ribosome synthesis process, in which BRIX1 plays a significant role, is dynamic and precisely regulated to meet the varying needs of cellular activities. This regulation is essential for maintaining normal cell proliferation and differentiation (Jiang2024BRIX1). The BRIX1 protein is part of the ribosome synthesis superfamily, which is involved in rRNA binding, a critical step in ribosome assembly (Ge2020Expression).

In normal cells, the orderly synthesis of ribosomes facilitated by BRIX1 is vital for cellular growth and proliferation, supporting the organism's overall health and function. The precise regulation of ribosome biogenesis ensures that cells can respond to different physiological demands efficiently (Jiang2024BRIX1).

## Clinical Significance
BRIX1 is implicated in several cancers due to its role in ribosome biogenesis and metabolic reprogramming. In colorectal cancer (CRC), BRIX1 is overexpressed, leading to increased ribosome synthesis and enhanced glycolysis through the selective translation of GLUT1, a key glucose transporter. This overexpression is associated with larger tumor sizes, advanced cancer stages, and poorer prognosis in CRC patients. Knockdown of BRIX1 in CRC cell lines results in decreased rRNA levels and reduced glycolytic activity, indicating its tumor-promoting role (Jiang2024BRIX1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), BRIX1 is one of the RNA-binding proteins identified as a prognostic marker. Its overexpression correlates with advanced tumor grades and stages, suggesting its potential as a target for HCC prognosis and treatment (Wang2020Integrated).

BRIX1 is also noted for its prognostic significance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in tongue cancer, where it is associated with survival outcomes in patients with perineural invasion (Reddy2019Molecular). These findings highlight BRIX1's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
BRIX1 is involved in ribosome biogenesis and participates in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is a crucial component in the synthesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit and is associated with increased levels of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and cells (Jiang2024BRIX1). Although specific physical interactions of BRIX1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context, BRIX1 is known to be part of the PeBoW complex, which includes PES1 and WDR12, essential for the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. This complex is involved in pre-rRNA processing, indicating that BRIX1 interacts with pre-rRNA during ribosome assembly.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, BRX1-2, a homolog of BRIX1, interacts with the OLI2 protein, a nucleolar methyltransferase necessary for ribosomal RNA maturation. This interaction was confirmed using split-GFP-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis, suggesting a similar interaction mechanism might exist in other organisms (Maekawa2021Ribosome). However, specific details on BRIX1's interactions in humans are not provided in the context. The role of BRIX1 in ribosome biogenesis and its potential interactions highlight its importance in cellular processes and disease states.
