# ZNF76

## Overview
ZNF76 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 76, a transcriptional regulator involved in modulating gene expression in human cells. The protein is characterized by its C2-H2 type zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Myslinski1998ZNF76). Zinc finger protein 76 functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to inhibit transcriptional activity, although it can also act as a transcriptional activator under certain conditions (Myslinski1998ZNF76; Zheng2004ZNF76). The protein's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications such as acetylation and sumoylation, which influence its interaction with other proteins and its role in transcriptional repression (Zheng2006Acetylation; Zheng2004ZNF76). ZNF76 has been implicated in various cellular processes and is associated with clinical conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease (Qi2021The).

## Structure
ZNF76 is a zinc finger protein characterized by its C2-H2 type zinc finger domains, which are centrally located and crucial for its DNA-binding and transcriptional regulation functions (Myslinski1998ZNF76). The protein contains seven tandemly repeated zinc fingers, similar to the transcriptional activator Staf, with which it shares significant homology (Myslinski1998ZNF76). The zinc finger domains facilitate the protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate transcription (Myslinski1998ZNF76).

The primary structure of ZNF76 includes a complete open reading frame of 515 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 56.3 kDa (Myslinski1998ZNF76). Alternative splicing results in two isoforms, with the longer form consisting of 570 amino acids, which has a stronger interaction with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and acts as a more effective repressor of p53-mediated transcriptional activation (Zheng2006Acetylation).

Post-translational modifications such as acetylation and sumoylation play significant roles in modulating ZNF76's function. Acetylation by p300 enhances its transactivation ability, while sumoylation at lysine 411 inhibits it (Zheng2006Acetylation; Zheng2004ZNF76). These modifications affect the protein's interaction with TBP and its transcriptional repression activity (Zheng2004ZNF76).

## Function
ZNF76 functions as a transcriptional repressor in human cells, primarily by interacting with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to inhibit transcriptional activity. It modulates the activity of several transcription factors, including p53, Stat1, and Smad3, by preventing TBP from binding to target promoters, such as the p21 promoter, thereby repressing gene expression (Zheng2004ZNF76). ZNF76's repressive activity is regulated by sumoylation, a post-translational modification mediated by PIAS1, which sumoylates ZNF76 at lysine 411. This modification affects ZNF76's interaction with TBP and its ability to repress transcription (Zheng2004ZNF76).

ZNF76 is also a human homolog of the transcriptional activator Staf, involved in regulating genes encoding selenocysteine tRNA and small nuclear RNA (Myslinski1998ZNF76). Despite its repressive role, ZNF76 can also act as a transcriptional activator in certain contexts, binding to Staf responsive elements and activating transcription from snRNA-type and mRNA promoters (Myslinski1998ZNF76). This dual functionality highlights ZNF76's complex role in transcriptional regulation, impacting various cellular processes in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The ZNF76 gene has been implicated in the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), particularly in Chinese populations. A specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within this gene, rs10947540, has been associated with an increased risk of developing SLE. This SNP is linked to higher serum creatinine levels in carriers of the risk C allele, suggesting a potential impact on kidney function, which is a common complication in SLE patients (Qi2021The). The rs10947540 SNP is an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) that correlates with decreased expression of ZNF76 and other genes, such as DEF6, in whole blood, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE (Qi2021The).

Alterations in ZNF76 expression have also been observed in other contexts. For instance, miR-373 has been shown to up-regulate ZNF76 expression in certain cell lines, indicating that microRNA interactions can modulate its expression levels (Xun2019Purification). While the clinical significance of these interactions is not fully understood, they highlight the potential for ZNF76 expression changes to influence disease processes. Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of clinical implications associated with ZNF76 gene alterations.

## Interactions
ZNF76 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It is known to interact with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a key component of the transcription machinery. This interaction occurs through both the N terminus and a glutamic acid-rich domain (GARD) in the C terminus of ZNF76, targeting the core domain of TBP responsible for recognizing the TATA box (Zheng2004ZNF76). ZNF76 acts as a transcriptional repressor by inhibiting TBP's function, which can be reversed by ectopic expression of TBP (Zheng2004ZNF76).

ZNF76 is also sumoylated by PIAS1, an E3 ligase, at lysine 411. This post-translational modification modulates its interaction with TBP, reducing its repressive activity on p53-mediated transactivation (Zheng2004ZNF76). The interaction between ZNF76 and PIAS1 is zinc-dependent, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Zheng2004ZNF76).

Additionally, ZNF76 interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), which deacetylates ZNF76, affecting its transcriptional activity. Acetylation by p300 competes with sumoylation, altering ZNF76's interaction with TBP and its transcriptional repression capabilities (Zheng2006Acetylation). These interactions highlight ZNF76's role as a modulator of transcription through complex regulatory mechanisms.
