# GSTK1

## Overview
GSTK1, or glutathione S-transferase kappa 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which is involved in detoxification processes. The GSTK1 protein is primarily localized in peroxisomes and mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in maintaining redox homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress. Unlike other GSTs, GSTK1 exhibits a unique structural configuration, characterized by a thioredoxin fold within a glutaredoxin framework, and functions as a homodimer. It is involved in glutathione metabolism, particularly in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species and the conjugation of glutathione to various substrates, which is crucial for cellular defense mechanisms (ROBINSON2004Modelling; Costa2023Functional). The protein's activity is essential for the recovery of the peroxisomal glutathione redox state, and its deficiency has been linked to conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and obesity-induced inflammation (Costa2023Functional).

## Structure
The human GSTK1 protein is composed of 226 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 25.5 kDa (ROBINSON2004Modelling). Its primary structure includes specific amino acid substitutions compared to previous sequences: leucine instead of valine at position 97, leucine instead of glutamine at position 183, and histidine instead of tyrosine at position 208 (ROBINSON2004Modelling). The secondary structure of GSTK1 features a thioredoxin fold within a glutaredoxin framework, with an additional helical domain forming a βαβαxββα motif (ROBINSON2004Modelling). This helical domain consists of 142 residues configured into eight helices (ROBINSON2004Modelling).

The tertiary structure of GSTK1 is characterized by a unique configuration compared to other soluble cytosolic GSTs, with a polyhelical domain embedded between β-strands, suggesting a novel structural and evolutionary history distinct from other GST classes (ROBINSON2004Modelling). GSTK1 predominantly exists as a homodimer in solution, representing its quaternary structure, with a molecular mass of approximately 49-51 kDa (ROBINSON2004Modelling). Despite its mitochondrial localization, GSTK1 lacks identifiable targeting signals, indicating a potential role for the hsp60 chaperonin in its translocation (ROBINSON2004Modelling). The protein also exhibits glutaredoxin-like activity, despite lacking a cysteine in its active center (Costa2023Functional).

## Function
GSTK1 (glutathione S-transferase kappa 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining redox homeostasis within peroxisomes, cellular organelles involved in lipid metabolism and redox regulation. It is the only known enzyme in the peroxisomal proteome involved in glutathione metabolism, where it exhibits GSH-dependent disulfide bond oxidoreductase activity. This activity is essential for maintaining the redox balance within peroxisomes, particularly after oxidative stress, by facilitating thiol-disulfide exchanges and protecting peroxisomal proteins from oxidative damage (Costa2023Functional).

GSTK1 is also implicated in the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and other reactive oxygen species, contributing to antioxidant protection against lipid peroxides. It is involved in the conjugation of glutathione to various compounds, which aids in cellular defense mechanisms (Costa2023Functional). The enzyme is localized in both peroxisomes and mitochondria, suggesting a dual role in these organelles, although its precise functions in mitochondria are less well-defined (Costa2023Functional).

GSTK1's activity is critical for the recovery of the peroxisomal glutathione redox state, and its deficiency is linked to several health issues, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and obesity-induced inflammation (Costa2023Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GSTK1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), downregulation of GSTK1 is a common mechanism identified across multiple models of the disease. This downregulation is associated with increased oxidative stress, a key pathophysiological factor in HCM. Knockout studies in zebrafish have shown that loss of GSTK1 leads to increased expression of sarcomeric genes and impaired cardiac function, suggesting its role in the disease's progression (Sasagawa2016Downregulation).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), low GSTK1 expression correlates with higher tumor stage, smoking, and alcohol intake. This reduced expression is linked to poor prognosis and is considered an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. The gene's expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration and DNA methylation, indicating its involvement in the tumor immune response and epigenetic regulation (Feng2023Prognostic).

In luminal B breast cancer, GSTK1 expression is associated with patient survival. Its expression levels, along with those of related genes, are linked to better outcomes, potentially through the regulation of mitosis and counteracting reactive oxygen species (Luthra2018Expression).
