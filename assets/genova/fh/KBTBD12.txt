# KBTBD12

## Overview
KBTBD12 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch repeat and BTB domain containing 12, which is involved in various cellular processes through its structural domains. The protein is characterized by the presence of kelch repeats and a BTB domain, both of which are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions. These interactions suggest a potential role in cellular mechanisms such as ubiquitination and other post-translational modifications. The kelch repeats typically form beta-propeller structures, facilitating these interactions, while the BTB domain further supports the protein's involvement in complex cellular pathways. Alternative splicing of the KBTBD12 gene may result in different isoforms, which could lead to variations in the protein's function and interactions. This highlights the gene's potential significance in cellular regulation and its possible implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
KBTBD12 encodes a protein characterized by the presence of kelch repeats and a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-Ã -brac) domain. The kelch repeats are typically involved in forming beta-propeller structures, which are known for their role in facilitating protein-protein interactions. The BTB domain also contributes to protein-protein interactions, suggesting that KBTBD12 may play a role in cellular processes such as ubiquitination. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. Alternative splicing of the KBTBD12 gene could result in different isoforms, potentially leading to variations in its structural and functional properties. These structural features and modifications indicate that KBTBD12 is involved in complex cellular mechanisms, possibly through its interactions with other proteins and its role in post-translational modification processes.
