# HS3ST4

## Overview
HS3ST4, or heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 4, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the modification of heparan sulfate (HS), a key polysaccharide in cellular communication and signaling. The enzyme, categorized as a sulfotransferase, specifically catalyzes the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues within HS chains, a critical modification that influences the interaction of HS with various growth factors and morphogens. This enzymatic activity is essential for the formation of specific HS structures that modulate cell signaling pathways, impacting processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and neural development (FernándezVega2013Specific; Patel2014Hs3st3Modified). HS3ST4 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, suggesting its significant role in neural function and development (FernándezVega2013Specific). The gene's expression and activity have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Denys2019The; SepulvedaDiaz2015HS3ST2).

## Structure


## Function
HS3ST4 (heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 4) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a complex polysaccharide involved in various cellular processes. This enzyme is responsible for the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues in HS chains, a modification that influences the structure and function of HS. The 3-O-sulfation by HS3ST4 is important for the formation of specific HS epitopes that can modulate interactions with growth factors and morphogens, thereby affecting cell signaling pathways (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified).

In healthy human cells, HS3ST4 is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, suggesting a role in neural development or function (FernándezVega2013Specific). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to glucosamine residues, contributing to the fine-tuning of growth factor signaling. This activity is crucial for processes such as progenitor cell expansion and differentiation, which are essential for normal development and tissue homeostasis (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified). The specific roles of HS3ST4 in other tissues and its broader implications in human physiology remain areas of ongoing research.

## Clinical Significance
HS3ST4 is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and interactions. In cancer, HS3ST4 is associated with promoting tumor growth and resistance to apoptosis by activating signaling pathways such as Src, Akt, and NF-κB, which are crucial for cancer cell invasiveness and survival (Denys2019The). Its expression is upregulated by TRF2, a protein involved in telomere protection, leading to increased tumor growth in xenografted mice, suggesting a pro-oncogenic role (Denys2019The). HS3ST4 may also contribute to immune escape mechanisms in cancer by inhibiting natural killer (NK) cell activation and recruitment, allowing cancer cells to evade immune detection (Denys2019The).

In Alzheimer's disease, HS3ST4 is significantly overexpressed in the hippocampus, indicating its potential involvement in the disease's pathology (SepulvedaDiaz2015HS3ST2). Although no pathogenic variants of HS3ST4 have been reported, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene are associated with risks of reading disability and language impairment, highlighting its role in neurological responses (Ouidja2022Variability). These findings suggest that HS3ST4 plays a significant role in disease progression and resistance to immune surveillance.
