# SHH

## Overview
The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) gene encodes a critical signaling protein that plays a pivotal role in embryonic development and tissue regeneration. The protein, known as the Sonic Hedgehog signaling molecule, is a ligand that interacts with the Patched (PTC) receptor to activate the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is essential for the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning (Zheng2019Sonic). The SHH protein undergoes significant post-translational modifications, including palmitoylation and cholesterol attachment, which are crucial for its signaling efficacy and distribution (Zheng2019Sonic). Dysregulation of SHH signaling is implicated in various developmental disorders, such as holoprosencephaly, and is associated with several cancers, including basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma (Menyhárt2019Principles; Dubourg2007Holoprosencephaly). The SHH pathway's intricate regulatory mechanisms underscore its importance in both normal development and disease states (Beachy2010Interactions).

## Structure
The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) protein is a crucial signaling molecule involved in embryonic development. Its primary structure is encoded by the SHH gene and consists of a polypeptide chain that undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage, resulting in an N-terminal signaling domain known as Shh-N (Roessler2009The). This domain is responsible for binding to the Patched (Ptc) receptor, a critical step in the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Fuse1999Sonic).

The secondary structure of SHH includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its metalloprotease-like fold, although it functions as a ligand rather than an enzyme (Maun2010Hedgehog). The protein's tertiary structure features a pseudo-active site groove, which is a key interaction site for various binding partners, including the 5E1 antibody and Hedgehog-interacting protein (Hhip) (Bosanac2009The; Maun2010Hedgehog).

Post-translational modifications of SHH include the attachment of cholesterol and palmitate to the N-terminal domain, enhancing its signaling capability and spatial distribution within tissues (Roessler2009The; Fuse1999Sonic). The SHH protein can form multimeric complexes, indicating a quaternary structure that is important for its long-range signaling functions (Maun2010Hedgehog).

## Function
The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) gene encodes a signaling protein that plays a crucial role in various developmental processes in healthy human cells. SHH is a key component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is vital for embryonic development and tissue regeneration. It is involved in the development of epithelial tissues and appendages, such as hair follicles, sebaceous glands, mammary glands, teeth, and nails (Zheng2019Sonic). SHH signaling is essential for the formation of hair follicles and sweat glands, with its activity determining the formation of these structures (Zheng2019Sonic).

At the molecular level, SHH functions as a ligand for the Patched (PTC) receptor, releasing its inhibition on the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. This activation leads to the transcription of GLI target genes, promoting cell proliferation and differentiation (Zheng2019Sonic). The SHH protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation and cholesterol modification, which are essential for its signaling activity (Zheng2019Sonic).

In the cerebellum, SHH is secreted by Purkinje cells and promotes the proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors, influencing the final size and shape of the cerebellum (Vaillant2009SHH). SHH signaling is also involved in the development of the neural tube and the regulation of epithelial-stromal interactions in various tissues (Zheng2019Sonic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SHH gene are significantly associated with holoprosencephaly (HPE), a developmental disorder characterized by the failure of the forebrain to divide into two hemispheres, leading to midline cerebral and facial defects. SHH mutations account for a substantial proportion of nonchromosomal HPE cases, with a wide range of phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance observed in affected families (Dubourg2007Holoprosencephaly; de2021New). The SHH gene is one of the most common nonchromosomal causes of HPE, with variants often linked to less severe forms of the condition compared to mutations in other genes like SIX3 and ZIC2 (de2021New; Dubourg2018Recent).

Alterations in SHH expression or signaling are also implicated in various cancers, including basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. Dysregulation of the SHH pathway can lead to tumorigenesis, with mutations in pathway components such as PTCH1, SMO, and SUFU contributing to the activation of oncogenic signaling targets (Menyhárt2019Principles; Villavicencio2000The). Additionally, SHH signaling plays a role in neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder, where altered SHH expression can affect neuronal survival and function (Li2020The).

## Interactions
The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) protein interacts with several key proteins to regulate the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. SHH binds to the Patched1 (PTCH1) receptor, a critical interaction for activating the pathway. This binding is facilitated by the N-terminal domain of SHH (SHH-N), which engages PTCH1 through a palmitate-dominated interface and a calcium-mediated interface, forming a 2:1 complex with PTCH1 molecules (Qi2018Two). The palmitate moiety of SHH-N inserts into a cavity in PTCH1, blocking potential ligand access and affecting signaling (Qi2018Two).

SHH also interacts with co-receptors such as CDO and BOC, which are essential for Hh-mediated cell proliferation. These interactions are mediated by a calcium-dependent interface on SHH-N (Beachy2010Interactions). The monoclonal antibody 5E1 can bind to this interface, blocking Hh signaling by overlapping with the PTCH1 binding site (Qi2018Two).

Additionally, Hedgehog-interacting protein (HHIP) acts as a negative regulator by binding to the same calcium-mediated interface on SHH-N, competing with PTCH1 and inhibiting the pathway (Beachy2010Interactions). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of SHH in the Hh signaling pathway.
