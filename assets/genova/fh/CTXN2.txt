# CTXN2

## Overview
The CTXN2 gene encodes the protein cortexin 2, which is a member of the cortexin family. Cortexin 2 is primarily involved in neural development and function, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of neural networks. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, which suggests its involvement in the structural organization of neurons. The expression of CTXN2 is predominantly observed in the central nervous system, indicating its significance in brain physiology and potentially in neurodevelopmental disorders. Research into CTXN2 and cortexin 2 continues to uncover their roles in cellular processes and their implications in various neurological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
