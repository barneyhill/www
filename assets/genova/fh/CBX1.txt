# CBX1

## Overview
CBX1 is a gene that encodes the chromobox protein homolog 1 (CBX1), a member of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin organization and gene silencing. The CBX1 protein is characterized by its chromodomain and chromoshadow domain, which facilitate binding to methylated histone H3 and interactions with other nuclear proteins, respectively. This protein is integral to the maintenance of chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression, particularly through its involvement in the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and its role in recruiting repressive marks to chromatin. CBX1 is crucial for various biological processes, including stem cell pluripotency and neurogenesis, and its dysfunction is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Kuroda2020Dominantnegative; van2021Biological; Lomberk2006Theheterochromatinprotein1family).

## Structure
CBX1 encodes a protein that is part of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family, characterized by two main domains: the chromodomain and the chromoshadow domain. The chromodomain, located in the amino-terminal half, binds to methylated lysine 9 of histone H3, leading to transcriptional repression. It has a globular conformation with an antiparallel three-stranded β sheet and an α helix, forming a hydrophobic groove for protein interaction (Lomberk2006Theheterochromatinprotein1family). The chromoshadow domain, found in the carboxy-terminal half, enables dimerization and serves as a docking site for various nuclear proteins, facilitating interactions with proteins containing the PXVXL motif (Lomberk2006Theheterochromatinprotein1family).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, affect the localization and function of HP1 proteins, including CBX1 (Lomberk2006Theheterochromatinprotein1family). The genomic structure of CBX1 is conserved, typically comprising five exons separated by four introns, with the chromodomain encoded by exons 2 and 3, and the chromoshadow domain by exons 4 and 5 (Lomberk2006Theheterochromatinprotein1family). CBX1 also has multiple splice variants, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
CBX1, a member of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family, plays a crucial role in chromatin organization and gene silencing in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to methylated histone H3, particularly recognizing H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 marks, which are associated with gene repression and chromatin compaction (van2021Biological). This binding facilitates the recruitment of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) to target genes, maintaining gene silencing across cell divisions (van2021Biological).

CBX1 is essential for maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by preventing premature differentiation, thus supporting stem cell self-renewal (van2021Biological). Its function is influenced by its subcellular localization, interaction with other proteins, and association with chromatin during different stages of differentiation (van2021Biological).

In the context of development, CBX1 is involved in neurogenesis and brain development, as evidenced by perinatal lethality in mice with a null mutation of the CBX1 gene (van2021Biological). This highlights its critical role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation during brain development (van2021Biological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CBX1 gene, which encodes heterochromatin protein 1β (HP1β), are associated with a novel syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder. These mutations, specifically dominant-negative variants such as p.N57D, p.W52L, and p.T51P, lead to developmental delay, hypotonia, autistic features, and variable dysmorphic features in affected individuals (Kuroda2020Dominantnegative). The mutations disrupt the interaction between HP1β and methylated histones, impairing the protein's localization within the nucleus and its ability to bind to chromatin (Kuroda2020Dominantnegative). This disruption affects neurocognitive development by reducing the binding of mutant HP1β to heterochromatin, while the majority of HP1β-interacting proteins remain unchanged (Kuroda2020Dominantnegative).

The study also suggests that these mutations impair HP1β's interaction with other protein complexes involved in chromatin organization, such as GLP/G9a and PRC1.6, potentially leading to neurocognitive impairments (Kuroda2020Dominantnegative). The research indicates a shared molecular pathogenesis between CBX1 mutations and other neurodevelopmental disorders, including Kleefstra syndrome and Weiss-Kruszka syndrome, which are characterized by developmental delay and intellectual disability (Kuroda2020Dominantnegative).

## Interactions
CBX1, also known as chromobox 1, is a member of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family and plays a significant role in chromatin organization and gene silencing. It interacts with histone H3 when methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), a mark associated with transcriptional repression. This interaction is crucial for the gene-silencing function of HP1 proteins, including CBX1 (Lomberk2006Theheterochromatinprotein1family).

CBX1 is part of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and interacts with other proteins within this complex to mediate gene repression. It binds to H3K9me3 marks and forms complexes with the H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1, which helps spread repressive marks and induce chromatin compaction (van2021Biological). The chromoshadow domain of CBX1 allows for dimerization and serves as a docking site for various nuclear proteins, indicating potential interactions with other proteins involved in transcription and nuclear architecture (Lomberk2006Theheterochromatinprotein1family).

In cancer, CBX1 has been noted to promote cell growth by activating the canonical Wnt/β-Catenin pathway through interactions with the chromatin binding protein HMGA2 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (van2021Biological). These interactions highlight CBX1's role in both maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression.
