# SLAMF9

## Overview
SLAMF9 is a gene that encodes the SLAM family member 9 protein, a transmembrane receptor belonging to the CD2/SLAM family of leukocyte surface proteins. This protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including an N-terminal immunoglobulin V-type domain and a C2-type immunoglobulin superfamily domain, but notably lacks the typical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) found in other SLAM family members (Sever2019SLAMF9; Wilson2020Signalling). SLAM family member 9 is heavily glycosylated, which influences its function and stability, and is primarily expressed on specific antigen-presenting cells such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells and certain macrophages (Sever2019SLAMF9; Wilson2020Signalling). Functionally, it plays a significant role in modulating immune responses, particularly in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases (zhao2024The; Wilson2020Signalling). Despite its involvement in immune processes, SLAMF9 remains an orphan receptor with undefined receptor/ligand interactions, marking it as a subject of ongoing research (Wilson2020Signalling).

## Structure
SLAMF9 is a member of the CD2/SLAM family of leukocyte surface proteins, characterized by its structural components, including an N-terminal immunoglobulin V-type domain and a C2-type immunoglobulin superfamily domain, along with a transmembrane domain (Volkova2014Development; Wilson2020Signalling). Unlike other SLAM family receptors, SLAMF9 has a short cytoplasmic tail that is rich in lysine and arginine but lacks the typical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) found in other family members (Sever2019SLAMF9; Wilson2020Signalling).

The protein is heavily glycosylated, with six potential N-linked glycosylation sites in its extracellular domains, which affects its migration on SDS-PAGE gels, appearing as a heterogeneous species with a higher molecular weight than predicted by its peptide sequence (Wilson2020Signalling). This glycosylation is a prominent post-translational modification that influences the protein's function and stability.

SLAMF9 does not form homotypic interactions and remains an orphan receptor within the CD2/SLAM family, suggesting that its receptor/ligand interactions are yet to be identified and are likely outside the CD2 family (Wilson2020Signalling). The protein's tertiary and quaternary structures have not been detailed in the available literature.

## Function
SLAMF9, a member of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family, is involved in various immune functions, particularly in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. It is expressed on specific subsets of antigen-presenting cells, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and certain macrophages, but not on circulating B cells, natural killer cells, or T cells (Sever2019SLAMF9; Wilson2020Signalling). SLAMF9 enhances the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, indicating its role in promoting inflammation (Wilson2020Signalling).

In healthy human cells, SLAMF9 is upregulated during monocyte differentiation into macrophages and is involved in the production of cytokines like granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Wilson2020Signalling). Despite lacking an intracellular signaling motif, SLAMF9 influences immune responses by modulating cytokine production and potentially interacting with other cell surface proteins (Wilson2020Signalling). Its expression in pDCs is crucial for their homeostasis and function, affecting their maturation and cytokine production, which are essential for bridging innate and adaptive immune responses (Sever2019SLAMF9).

## Clinical Significance
SLAMF9 (SLAM family member 9) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of cancer, SLAMF9 expression is significantly upregulated in several tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC), where it is associated with lower patient survival and increased tumor aggressiveness. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltrates and immune checkpoint inhibitors, suggesting a role in tumor-immune interactions (zhao2024The). In melanoma, SLAMF9 is expressed in tumor-associated macrophages and influences pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, potentially affecting tumor progression and serving as a therapeutic target (Dollt2018The).

SLAMF9 also plays a role in immune responses, particularly in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Its deficiency leads to altered pDC homeostasis and function, impacting cytokine production and immune regulation. This has implications for autoimmune diseases, as SLAMF9-deficient mice exhibit altered immune responses and disease progression in models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Sever2019SLAMF9). Additionally, SLAMF9 is crucial for resistance to bacterial infections, such as Salmonella, where its absence impairs the clearance of the pathogen (Wilson2020Signalling). These findings highlight SLAMF9's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
SLAMF9, a member of the SLAM family, is characterized by its lack of known intracellular signaling motifs, which distinguishes it from other SLAM family receptors that typically contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) for downstream signaling. Despite this, SLAMF9 is involved in immune responses, particularly in macrophages and dendritic cells, but its specific interactions with other proteins remain largely undefined (Dollt2018The; Sever2019SLAMF9).

Studies have suggested that SLAMF9 does not engage in homophilic interactions, as no reproducible interactions with other CD2 family members were observed using techniques like surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and SEC-MALS (Wilson2020Signalling). This suggests that SLAMF9 might interact with other proteins on the cell surface or within the serum, potentially serving as a ligand for another receptor or signaling through adapter molecules (Wilson2020Signalling).

In the context of immune responses, SLAMF9 has been implicated in stabilizing TLR4 expression on macrophages, which is crucial for macrophage activation and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This role suggests a potential interaction with TLR4, although SLAMF9 does not directly bind to it (Zeng2018Combined). The exact nature of SLAMF9's interactions and signaling pathways remains an area of active research.
