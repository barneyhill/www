# CD274

## Overview
The CD274 gene encodes the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in immune regulation. PD-L1 is primarily involved in the immune checkpoint pathway, where it interacts with the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells, leading to the inhibition of T cell activation and proliferation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity by delivering inhibitory signals that regulate T cell function (Chen2010A; Fabrizio2018Gene). The PD-L1 protein is characterized by its immunoglobulin V-like and C-like domains, which are essential for its function in immune modulation (Fabrizio2018Gene). The expression of CD274 is tightly regulated and can be influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as inflammatory stimuli (Huang2013NFκB). In the context of cancer, PD-L1 expression is often upregulated, contributing to immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy, making it a significant target for cancer treatment strategies (Kelly2021Pancancer; Fabrizio2018Gene).

## Structure
The CD274 gene encodes the PD-L1 protein, a type I transmembrane protein consisting of 290 amino acids. The protein structure includes a large extracellular region with immunoglobulin V-like (IgV-like) and immunoglobulin C-like (IgC-like) domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic tail (Fabrizio2018Gene). The IgV-like domain is encoded by exon 2, while the IgC-like domain is encoded by exon 3 (Fabrizio2018Gene). PD-L1's extracellular domains are involved in immune regulation by interacting with the PD-1 receptor, delivering inhibitory signals that regulate T cell function (Chen2010A).

The protein can form dimers, characterized by interactions through eight hydrogen bonds, suggesting a potential dimeric state in solution (Chen2010A). The dimeric structure is stabilized by a hinge angle between the IgV and IgC domains, influenced by polar contacts and hydrophobic residues (Chen2010A). PD-L1 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may affect its spatial conformation (Zak2017Structural).

Alternative splicing of the CD274 gene results in a shorter PD-L1 isoform lacking the IgV-like domain due to the absence of the third exon (Fabrizio2018Gene). This splicing variation contributes to the diversity of PD-L1's functional roles in immune regulation.

## Function
The CD274 gene, also known as PD-L1, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in immune checkpoint mechanisms. In healthy human cells, PD-L1 interacts with the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells to regulate immune responses, forming part of a self-tolerance pathway that prevents the immune system from attacking the body's own cells (Fabrizio2018Gene). This interaction inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation, maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity (Fabrizio2018Gene).

PD-L1 is expressed in various tissues, particularly in activated T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and monocytes (Fabrizio2018Gene). It acts as a co-stimulatory ligand for PD-1, negatively co-stimulating T cell functions, which includes inhibiting cytokine secretion, facilitating apoptosis of activated T cells, and inducing T cell anergy (Huang2013NFκB). This regulatory function is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Huang2013NFκB).

The expression of CD274 is regulated at both genetic and epigenetic levels, with structural variations and CpG methylation sites influencing its activity (Fabrizio2018Gene). The gene's expression can be upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, mediated by the activation of NF-kB (Huang2013NFκB).

## Clinical Significance
The CD274 gene, also known as PD-L1, plays a significant role in cancer progression and immune evasion. Its genetic deregulation is linked to various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and gastric cancer. In NSCLC, PD-L1 expression is often upregulated due to mutations in genes like EGFR and ALK, which activate pathways such as PIK3/AKT/mTOR and JAK/STAT, contributing to resistance against certain immunotherapies (Fabrizio2018Gene). In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative cases, strong PD-L1 expression correlates with CD274 gene copy number gain, suggesting a link with reduced mortality (Fabrizio2018Gene).

Structural variations in the 3′-UTR of CD274 are recurrent in cancers like adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma and stomach adenocarcinoma, enabling immune evasion by stabilizing PD-L1 transcripts and increasing expression (Fabrizio2018Gene). These variations can affect the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibodies and influence the choice of immune checkpoint blockade therapy (Zhang2023Noninvasive).

CD274 rearrangements are associated with higher tumor mutational burden and increased PD-L1 expression, particularly in non-small cell lung, colorectal, and gastric cancers. These rearrangements may confer benefits to patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (Kelly2021Pancancer).

## Interactions
CD274, also known as PD-L1, is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that regulate immune responses. It interacts with the PD-1 receptor on T cells, leading to the recruitment of phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, which downregulate immune responses by inhibiting T cell activation (Yang2018Immunomodulators). This interaction is characterized by a two-state reaction model that requires a conformational change for efficient binding (Yang2018Immunomodulators).

CD274 also interacts with B7-1 (CD80), although this interaction is weaker compared to its interaction with PD-1 (Yang2018Immunomodulators). The PD-1/PD-L1 complex formation involves specific residues and hydrophobic interactions, which are crucial for the stability and function of the complex (Lin2008The).

In addition to its role in immune modulation, CD274 has been shown to interact directly with the JNK signaling pathway in leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). It enhances JNK phosphorylation, which increases Cyclin D2 levels, promoting cell cycle entry and proliferation of LICs (Fang2016CD274). This interaction suggests that CD274 may recruit kinases to phosphorylate JNK substrates, although the specific kinases involved have not been identified (Fang2016CD274).
