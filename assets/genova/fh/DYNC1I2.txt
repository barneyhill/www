# DYNC1I2

## Overview
The DYNC1I2 gene encodes the dynein cytoplasmic 1 intermediate chain 2 protein, a critical component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, which functions as a motor protein facilitating retrograde transport along microtubules in eukaryotic cells. This protein is integral to intracellular transport processes, including the movement of organelles, vesicles, and protein complexes, and plays a significant role in mitotic spindle organization, which is essential for cell division (Kuta2010Mouse; Bartl2022The). The DYNC1I2 protein is characterized by its intermediate chain domain, with a coiled-coil structure at the N-terminus and WD40 repeats at the C-terminus, allowing it to interact with various components of the dynein complex, such as the p150 subunit of dynactin and dynein heavy chains (Kuta2010Mouse). The gene is expressed in multiple splice isoforms, which are tissue- and development-specific, indicating its diverse roles in different cellular contexts, particularly in the nervous system (Kuta2010Mouse). Alterations in DYNC1I2 expression or function have been implicated in cancer and potentially in neurological disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Tey2016Mutation; Bartl2022The).

## Structure
The DYNC1I2 protein is a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, which is crucial for intracellular transport processes. The primary structure of DYNC1I2 includes regions that form specific domains, such as the intermediate chain domain. The N-terminal region of DYNC1I2 forms a coiled-coil structure that interacts with the p150 subunit of dynactin, while the C-terminal region contains seven WD40 repeats. These repeats are thought to form a beta-propeller structure, which is responsible for interaction with the dynein heavy chain (Kuta2010Mouse).

DYNC1I2 can form homo- or heterodimers and interacts with dynein light chains and the p150 subunit of dynactin at the N-terminus, while the C-terminus interacts with heavy chains through the WD40 repeats (Kuta2010Mouse). The protein is expressed in multiple splice isoforms, with alternative splicing affecting the region downstream of the N-terminal coiled-coil region and upstream of the region binding to DYNLT and DYNLL light chains. This splicing may generate novel phosphorylation sites, suggesting a role in specific dynein regulation (Kuta2010Mouse). The DYNC1I2 gene produces 11 different isoforms, indicating a complex structure with multiple variants (Kuta2010Mouse).

## Function
DYNC1I2 encodes a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, which is a motor protein responsible for retrograde transport along microtubules in eukaryotic cells. This protein plays a crucial role in intracellular transport, facilitating the movement of various cargoes such as organelles, vesicles, and protein complexes within the cell (Kuta2010Mouse). The intermediate chains, including DYNC1I2, are involved in cargo binding and specificity, interacting with other proteins and complexes like dynactin to modulate these interactions (Kuta2010Mouse).

DYNC1I2 is expressed in multiple splice isoforms, which are tissue- and development-specific, indicating its role in different cellular contexts (Kuta2010Mouse). In the nervous system, the complexity of alternative splicing of DYNC1I2 suggests its involvement in specific cargo transport, such as TrkA signaling endosomes, which is crucial for neuronal signaling (Kuta2010Mouse). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the movement of vesicles, organelles, and other cellular components, impacting cellular organization and function (Kuta2010Mouse).

DYNC1I2 also plays a role in mitotic spindle organization, which is essential for proper cell division. Disruption of DYNC1I2 can lead to increased DNA damage in mitotic cells, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability during cell division (Bartl2022The).

## Clinical Significance
DYNC1I2, a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, plays a significant role in intracellular transport and mitotic spindle organization. Alterations in its expression or interactions can contribute to various diseases. In the context of cancer, particularly Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-driven tumors such as medulloblastoma, the long non-coding RNA HHIP-AS1 stabilizes DYNC1I2 mRNA, preventing its degradation by microRNA hsa-miR-425-5p. This stabilization is crucial for maintaining proper mitotic spindle organization and cell proliferation. Disruption of this interaction leads to increased DNA damage and reduced tumor cell viability, highlighting its role in tumorigenesis (Bartl2022The).

While the direct association of DYNC1I2 mutations with specific neurodegenerative disorders is not well-documented, the gene is part of the dynein complex, which is implicated in neurological conditions. Mutations in related dynein components, such as DYNC1H1, have been linked to disorders like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and intellectual disabilities, suggesting that DYNC1I2 may also play a role in similar conditions (Tey2016Mutation). However, specific mutations in DYNC1I2 have not been conclusively associated with hereditary peripheral neuropathies (Tey2016Mutation).

## Interactions
DYNC1I2, a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It binds directly to β-catenin, a junctional protein, facilitating the tethering of microtubules at adherens junctions in epithelial cells. This interaction is crucial for maintaining microtubule organization and is supported by immunoprecipitation and affinity column assays (Ligon2001Dynein).

DYNC1I2 also interacts with the p150 subunit of dynactin through its N-terminal coiled-coil structure, which is essential for dynein's cargo binding and specificity (Kuta2010Mouse). The C-terminal region of DYNC1I2 contains WD40 repeats that interact with the dynein heavy chain, while proximal regions bind dynein light chains (Williams2018Structural).

In SHH-driven tumors, the long non-coding RNA HHIP-AS1 binds to DYNC1I2 mRNA, stabilizing it and promoting its expression. This interaction is crucial for maintaining DYNC1I2 levels, which supports proper mitotic spindle organization and cell proliferation (Bartl2022The). Additionally, DYNC1I2 interacts with sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2), as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation, indicating a role in the subcellular localization of SK2 (Neubauer2018Cytoplasmic).
