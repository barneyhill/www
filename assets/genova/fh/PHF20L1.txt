# PHF20L1

## Overview
PHF20L1 is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 20 like 1, a protein involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. The protein is characterized by its multiple structural domains, such as the MBT, Tudor, and PHD domains, which enable it to function as a methyllysine reader. This allows PHF20L1 to interact with methylated lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining DNA methylation and genomic stability (Estève2014Methyllysine). The Tudor domain, in particular, is essential for recognizing methylated lysine residues, contributing to the protein's involvement in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control (Carr2017Tudordomain). PHF20L1's interactions with proteins such as DNMT1 and pRb highlight its significance in epigenetic inheritance and cell cycle progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Lv2020Conformational; Carr2017Tudordomain).

## Structure
The PHF20L1 protein contains a Tudor domain, specifically the first Tudor domain (Tudor1), which is crucial for recognizing methylated lysine residues on both histone and non-histone proteins. This domain exhibits a canonical Tudor fold characterized by four-stranded anti-parallel β sheets, forming part of the Royal superfamily. The aromatic cage of PHF20L1 Tudor1, essential for ligand recognition, is composed of residues Y24, Y29, Y54, and F47, with W50 forming a π-π interaction with F47, effectively blocking the cage in its closed conformation (Lv2020Conformational).

PHF20L1 Tudor1 can switch between closed and open conformations, with the open form potentially recognizing mono-methylated substrates. This conformational flexibility is crucial for its interaction with ligands such as the lysine 142 methylated DNMT1 (Lv2020Conformational). Mutations in key residues of the aromatic cage, such as Y24 and W50, can alter the structure and dynamics, affecting the protein's ability to bind ligands (Lv2020Conformational).

The protein's structure is further characterized by its ability to undergo conformational selection, a mechanism that allows it to recognize ligands by shifting between different conformations (Lv2020Conformational). This dynamic nature of PHF20L1 Tudor1 highlights its potential as a target for small molecule inhibitors, which could exploit its conformational flexibility for therapeutic purposes (Lv2020Conformational).

## Function
PHF20L1 (PHD finger protein 20 like 1) plays a crucial role in maintaining DNA methylation and genomic stability in healthy human cells. It functions as a methyllysine reader, interacting with DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to prevent its proteasomal degradation. This interaction is particularly important during cell division, as PHF20L1 stabilizes DNMT1, ensuring proper DNA methylation patterns are maintained, which is essential for epigenetic inheritance (Estève2014Methyllysine).

PHF20L1 contains multiple structural domains, including MBT, Tudor, and PHD domains, which are involved in reading lysine methylation on histones and non-histone proteins like DNMT1. This ability to recognize methylation marks allows PHF20L1 to play a role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation (Estève2014Methyllysine).

In addition to its role in DNA methylation, PHF20L1 is involved in cell cycle regulation. It interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) at the mono-methylated lysine 810, recruiting the MOF acetyltransferase complex to E2F-responsive genes. This interaction is crucial for the integrity of the G1-S-phase checkpoint, influencing cell cycle progression and transcriptional regulation (Carr2017Tudordomain).

## Clinical Significance
PHF20L1 is implicated in several cancers, notably breast and ovarian cancer, due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In breast cancer, PHF20L1 is identified as a candidate oncogene, with high mRNA levels significantly associated with shorter survival in patients. Its amplification and overexpression are particularly prevalent in aggressive subtypes such as basal-like and Luminal B, contributing to poor prognosis and promoting cell proliferation (Jiang2015An). The gene's expression is negatively correlated with DNA methylation, suggesting that methylation may regulate its expression, and it is associated with distant metastasis-free survival (SierraRamirez2021An).

In ovarian cancer, PHF20L1 is overexpressed in cancer tissues compared to healthy ovaries, correlating with shorter progression-free and overall survival. The tumor microenvironment, particularly the ascites microenvironment, can modulate the expression of PHF20L1 isoforms, indicating its regulation by external factors (AlbertoAguilar2022PHD). The gene's role as a histone methylation reader and its interaction with epigenetic factors like DNMT1 further underscore its significance in cancer progression, making it a potential therapeutic target (Lv2020Conformational; Margasyuk2023RNA).

## Interactions
PHF20L1 is a protein that engages in several significant interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) by specifically binding to the mono-methylated lysine residue K810. This interaction is crucial for recruiting the MOF acetyltransferase to chromatin-bound pRb, thereby influencing transcriptional regulation at E2F-responsive promoters (Carr2017Tudordomain). The first Tudor domain of PHF20L1 is essential for this interaction, as mutations in this domain disrupt binding (Carr2017Tudordomain).

PHF20L1 also interacts with the SOX2 protein, protecting it from ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is mediated through the MBT domain of PHF20L1, which recognizes methylated lysine residues on SOX2, specifically Lys-42 and Lys-117. This binding prevents the demethylation of these residues by the LSD1 enzyme, thereby stabilizing SOX2 and maintaining its function in stem cell pluripotency and self-renewal (Zhang2018LSD1; Wang2018PHF20L1).

Additionally, PHF20L1 interacts with DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), preventing its degradation. This interaction involves the first Tudor domain of PHF20L1, which recognizes methylated DNMT1, highlighting its role in maintaining DNA methylation patterns (Lv2020Conformational).
