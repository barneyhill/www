# PDZD4

## Overview
PDZD4 is a gene that encodes the PDZ domain containing 4 protein, which is part of the PDZ domain-containing protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of PDZ domains, which are modular protein interaction domains that play a crucial role in signaling pathways by facilitating protein-protein interactions. The PDZ domain containing 4 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and the organization of protein complexes at cellular membranes. Although the specific functions of PDZD4 are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in the regulation of cellular pathways and may have potential roles in disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
