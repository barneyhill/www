# GREM2

## Overview
GREM2 is a gene that encodes the protein gremlin 2, a member of the DAN family of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists. Gremlin 2 is characterized by its growth-factor-like structure, which includes a central cysteine-rich domain and a distinctive cystine knot motif. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating BMP signaling pathways, which are essential for various developmental processes and tissue homeostasis. By binding to BMPs, gremlin 2 inhibits their interaction with receptors, thereby influencing cellular activities such as differentiation, growth, and apoptosis. The gene and its encoded protein are implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including dental and cardiac development, adipogenesis, and ovarian function. Mutations in GREM2 have been associated with clinical conditions such as primary ovarian insufficiency, dental anomalies, and bone density disorders, underscoring its significance in human health (Rydze2021Deletion; Kantaputra2015GREMLIN; KawagishiHotta2019Increase).

## Structure
The GREM2 protein, a member of the DAN family, exhibits a growth-factor-like fold characterized by a central cysteine-rich domain (CRD) known as the DAN domain. This domain is structured into pairs of long antiparallel beta strands, referred to as finger 1 (F1) and finger 2 (F2), connected by a wrist region (W) (Nolan2016Structure). The primary structure of GREM2 includes a series of lysine residues that contribute to its strong basic character, with an apparent isoelectric point (pI) of 9.3 (Kattamuri2017Analysis).

The tertiary structure of GREM2 is stabilized by a central cystine knot formed by disulfide bonds, which is a common feature among growth factor-like proteins (Kattamuri2017Analysis). GREM2 forms a stable noncovalent dimer, reinforced by an extensive hydrogen-bonding network between opposing monomers (Kattamuri2017Analysis). This dimerization is distinct from other proteins in the DAN family, such as noggin, which dimerize head-to-head (Nolan2013Structure).

GREM2 also undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which can affect its function and stability. The protein's structure allows it to interact with heparin/heparan sulfate, with specific lysine clusters located at the N-terminus, wrist region, and finger 2 being crucial for binding (Kattamuri2017Analysis).

## Function
The GREM2 gene encodes Gremlin 2, a protein that functions as an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which is crucial for various developmental processes and tissue homeostasis. Gremlin 2 binds to BMPs, such as BMP-2 and BMP-4, preventing them from interacting with their receptors and thereby modulating cellular processes like differentiation, growth, and apoptosis (KawagishiHotta2019Increase).

In the context of dental development, Gremlin 2 plays a significant role by antagonizing BMP4, which is essential for tooth formation and patterning. Mutations in GREM2 can lead to dental anomalies, suggesting its critical role in normal odontogenesis (Kantaputra2015GREMLIN).

Gremlin 2 is also involved in cardiac development. It is expressed during the differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells and promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation by inhibiting BMP signaling and activating the JNK pathway. This dual regulation is essential for optimizing the growth and differentiation of cardiac cells (Tanwar2014Gremlin; Bylund2017Coordinated).

In adipose-derived stromal/stem cells, GREM2 expression increases with age and negatively correlates with adipogenic potential, indicating its role in inhibiting adipogenesis through the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (KawagishiHotta2019Increase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GREM2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In female fertility, GREM2 plays a crucial role, and its disruption can lead to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). In Grem2 knockout mice, disruptions in the estrous cycle and reduced fertility are observed, associated with decreased anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) production, which is crucial for ovarian reserve (Rydze2021Deletion). A rare variant, c.C356T:p.S119F, was identified in a patient with POI, affecting the interaction domain of GREM2 and its function as a BMP antagonist (Rydze2021Deletion).

GREM2 mutations are also associated with dental anomalies. Variants such as p.Ala13Val and p.Gln76Glu can lead to conditions like hypodontia, taurodontism, and microdontia. These mutations affect protein interactions and stability, potentially altering BMP binding and signaling (Kantaputra2015GREMLIN; Mostowska2017GREM2). The p.Gln76Glu mutation has been linked to atrial fibrillation, indicating a broader impact on cardiac health (Mostowska2017GREM2).

GREM2 is also implicated in bone health, with genetic variants associated with decreased bone mineral density, suggesting a potential role in osteoporosis susceptibility (Kantaputra2015GREMLIN). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of GREM2 mutations and alterations.

## Interactions
GREM2, or gremlin 2, is known to physically interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of ovarian follicle development and diabetic nephropathy. It binds to bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions suggest that GREM2 modulates the biological activities of BMP4 and AMH, potentially influencing the transition of ovarian primordial follicles to primary follicles (Nilsson2014Roles). 

GREM2 acts as an antagonist to BMPs by interfering with their ligand-receptor interactions, particularly at type I and type II receptor-binding epitopes. The protein forms an asymmetric homodimer, with its BMP-binding epitope located at the dimer interface within the central part of the DAN domain (Kantaputra2015GREMLIN). 

In the context of diabetic nephropathy, GREM2 has been shown to increase podocyte apoptosis by affecting Smad signaling pathways. It enhances the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and decreases Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, indicating its role in modulating these pathways under high glucose conditions (Wen2019Grem2). These interactions highlight GREM2's involvement in various signaling networks and its potential impact on cellular processes.
