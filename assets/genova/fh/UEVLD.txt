# UEVLD

## Overview
The UEVLD gene encodes a protein that contains UEV (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant) and lactate/malate dehydrogenase domains, which are involved in various cellular processes. The UEV domain is known for its role in ubiquitin-related pathways, although it lacks the catalytic activity typical of E2 enzymes, and instead functions in ubiquitin signaling and protein interactions. The lactate/malate dehydrogenase domain suggests a potential role in metabolic processes, although the specific functions of this domain within the UEVLD-encoded protein remain to be fully elucidated. The dual-domain structure of the protein suggests a multifunctional role, potentially linking metabolic pathways with ubiquitin-mediated signaling (Qiu2020aarFDC).
