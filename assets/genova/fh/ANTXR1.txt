# ANTXR1

## Overview
ANTXR1, or Anthrax Toxin Receptor 1, is a gene that encodes the ANTXR cell adhesion molecule 1, a type I transmembrane protein. This protein is primarily recognized for its role as a receptor for the anthrax toxin, specifically binding to the protective antigen component through its von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain (Ramey2010Anthrax). Beyond its interaction with anthrax toxin, ANTXR1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions, which are crucial for maintaining vascular and connective tissue homeostasis (Besschetnova2015Regulatory). The protein's ability to bind to the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen underscores its function as an adhesion molecule, influencing cell spreading and angiogenesis (Garlick2009Direct; Werner2006Anthrax). ANTXR1 is also implicated in several clinical conditions, including GAPO syndrome and tumor progression, highlighting its significance in both genetic disorders and cancer biology (Jiang2020Antxr1; Przyklenk2024ANTXR1).

## Structure
ANTXR1, also known as ANTXR cell adhesion molecule 1, is a type I transmembrane protein that serves as a receptor for anthrax toxin. The protein includes a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain, also referred to as an integrin-inserted (I) domain, which is crucial for binding the protective antigen (PA) component of the anthrax toxin. This domain contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) that coordinates a divalent cation, facilitating ligand binding (Ramey2010Anthrax; Go2009The).

ANTXR1 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with three known variants: ANTXR1-sv1, ANTXR1-sv2, and ANTXR1-sv3. ANTXR1-sv1 and ANTXR1-sv2 have identical extracellular domains but differ in their cytoplasmic tails, with ANTXR1-sv1 having a longer tail of 221 amino acids and ANTXR1-sv2 having a shorter tail of 25 amino acids. ANTXR1-sv3 lacks a transmembrane domain and does not function as an anthrax toxin receptor (Go2009The).

The cytoplasmic domain of ANTXR1 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, and this interaction influences its ability to bind PA. Mutations in the cytoplasmic domain can affect PA binding affinity, suggesting that cytoplasmic signals may regulate the affinity states of ANTXR1 (Garlick2012Binding; Go2009The). The protein's structure is characterized by its ability to form complexes with other proteins, contributing to its role in cellular processes.

## Function
ANTXR1, also known as Tumor Endothelial Marker 8 (TEM8), is a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular and connective tissue homeostasis. It is involved in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, which are essential for normal angiogenesis and fibrotic processes (Besschetnova2015Regulatory). ANTXR1 regulates the synthesis of major matrix components and controls signaling pathways involving growth factors and chemokines, influencing both matrix synthesis and degradation (Besschetnova2015Regulatory).

In endothelial cells, ANTXR1 is associated with the regulation of VEGF receptor signaling, particularly influencing VEGFR2 signaling and VEGFR1 expression, which is essential for normal vascular function (Besschetnova2015Regulatory). The protein also mediates the coupling of extracellular ligands to the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for actin assembly and maintaining proper cell-adhesion properties (Stránecký2013Mutations). This interaction facilitates cell spreading by linking extracellular ligands such as collagen I to the actin cytoskeleton, acting as an adhesion molecule (Werner2006Anthrax).

ANTXR1 is most highly produced in tumor endothelial cells and other tumor stromal cells, including pericytes and fibroblasts, suggesting its significant role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular functions (Stránecký2013Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANTXR1 gene are associated with GAPO syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth retardation, alopecia, pseudoanodontia, and optic atrophy. This syndrome is considered a progeroid disorder due to its features resembling accelerated aging. Patients with GAPO syndrome often experience additional complications such as cardiovascular, skeletal, pulmonary, and nervous system abnormalities, including fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, mental retardation, atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy, hearing loss, and various ocular defects (Stránecký2013Mutations; Hu2017Cell; Przyklenk2024ANTXR1).

ANTXR1 mutations also contribute to dental anomalies, including tooth agenesis and pseudoanodontia. A specific homozygous missense variant in ANTXR1 has been linked to oligodontia, a condition marked by the congenital absence of multiple teeth (Dinckan2018A).

In addition to its role in genetic disorders, ANTXR1 is implicated in tumor progression and angiogenesis. It is highly expressed in tumor endothelial cells and influences processes such as chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis, which are critical in skeletal development and cancer growth (Jiang2020Antxr1). The gene's involvement in extracellular matrix homeostasis and cell adhesion further underscores its clinical significance in both genetic and acquired conditions (Besschetnova2015Regulatory).

## Interactions
ANTXR1, also known as ANTXR cell adhesion molecule 1, participates in several interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. It directly interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for its function as an adhesion molecule. This interaction is mediated by a specific segment in its cytoplasmic domain, which binds directly to β-actin, facilitating cell spreading and adhesion (Garlick2009Direct; Werner2006Anthrax). ANTXR1 also interacts with the protective antigen (PA) component of the anthrax toxin, and this binding is modulated by its association with actin. The interaction with actin reduces PA binding, suggesting an inverse relationship between actin binding and PA association (Garlick2012Binding).

ANTXR1 binds to extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen I and VI, which are involved in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix homeostasis (Garlick2012Binding; Werner2006Anthrax). The interaction with collagen α3(VI) is particularly significant in tumor angiogenesis, as both ANTXR1 and collagen α3(VI) are expressed in tumor endothelium (Nanda2004TEM8). These interactions highlight ANTXR1's role in linking extracellular ligands to the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating cell spreading and adhesion.
