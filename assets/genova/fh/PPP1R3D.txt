# PPP1R3D

## Overview
The PPP1R3D gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3D, commonly referred to as R6, which is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). This protein plays a pivotal role in glycogen metabolism by modulating the activity of PP1, a critical enzyme involved in the regulation of glycogen synthesis and breakdown. R6 is characterized by specific motifs that facilitate its interaction with PP1 and other proteins, such as glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, thereby influencing glycogen storage and mobilization. Additionally, R6 interacts with metabolic sensors like the AMPK complex, particularly in pancreatic beta cells and muscle tissues, impacting insulin secretion and energy homeostasis. The protein's stability and function are further regulated through interactions with 14-3-3 proteins and the laforin-malin complex, which mediate its degradation and prevent excessive glycogen accumulation. Mutations in PPP1R3D have been linked to metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as Lafora disease and potentially type 2 diabetes (Israelian2020Ppp1r3d; RubioVillena2015StructureFunction; GarciaHaro2010The).

## Structure
The PPP1R3D protein, also known as R6, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) involved in glycogen metabolism. Its primary structure includes several key motifs and domains essential for its function. Notably, it contains a conserved RVXF motif (R^102VRF) at the N-terminus, which is crucial for binding to PP1 (RubioVillena2015StructureFunction). The C-terminal region features a W^267DNND motif, important for binding to glycogenic substrates (RubioVillena2015StructureFunction). 

The protein also has a regulatory site, RARS^74LP, which interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, influencing its glycogenic activity and stability (RubioVillena2015StructureFunction). Mutation studies have shown that altering specific residues, such as Ser^74, can significantly impact its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and its subsequent glycogenic properties (RubioVillena2015StructureFunction).

The tertiary structure of PPP1R3D has been modeled using homology modeling techniques, with the SWISS-MODEL Workspace based on the template of PPP1R3B. The quality of this model was assessed using QMEAN4 and Ramachandran plot evaluation, providing insights into its molecular interactions and structural features crucial for its function in glycogen metabolism (RubioVillena2015StructureFunction). The quaternary structure involves its interaction with PP1 and other proteins, such as laforin and 14-3-3ε, which are essential for its regulatory roles (RubioVillena2015StructureFunction).

## Function
PPP1R3D encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), known as R6, which plays a crucial role in glycogen metabolism. In healthy human cells, R6 is involved in the regulation of glycogen synthesis by targeting PP1 to glycogen, influencing the activity of key enzymes such as glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase (Israelian2020Ppp1r3d; RubioVillena2015StructureFunction). R6 interacts with the catalytic subunit of the AMPK complex, a key metabolic sensor, particularly in pancreatic beta cells, where it regulates the phosphorylation status and activity of AMPK, impacting insulin secretion (GarciaHaro2010The).

R6 also interacts with AMPKβ subunits, with a stronger affinity for AMPKβ2, suggesting a role in the regulation of AMPK complexes, particularly in muscle tissues (Oligschlaeger2016The). The protein is ubiquitinated by the laforin-malin complex, leading to its autophagic degradation, which is crucial for maintaining glycogen synthase in its phosphorylated inactive state, preventing excessive glycogen accumulation in neurons (RubioVillena2013Glycogenic). The interaction with 14-3-3 proteins further regulates its glycogenic properties and stability, with binding preventing rapid degradation via the lysosomal pathway (RubioVillena2015StructureFunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PPP1R3D gene, which encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those related to glycogen metabolism. In the context of Lafora disease, a fatal neurodegenerative epilepsy, PPP1R3D deficiency has been shown to significantly reduce the formation of Lafora bodies in neurons and cardiomyocytes. This suggests that PPP1R3D plays a role in the pathogenesis of this disease by influencing glycogen metabolism and the accumulation of insoluble glycogen aggregates (Israelian2020Ppp1r3d).

The gene's interaction with other proteins, such as 14-3-3 proteins, is crucial for its glycogenic properties. Mutations that disrupt these interactions can impair glycogen accumulation, which may have implications for glycogen storage diseases (RubioVillena2015StructureFunction). The R6-S74A mutation, for example, increases glycogen accumulation by preventing binding to 14-3-3 proteins, indicating that such interactions regulate the stability and function of PPP1R3D (RubioVillena2015StructureFunction).

While the clinical significance of PPP1R3D mutations in other diseases is not fully detailed, its role in glycogen metabolism suggests potential implications for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. However, specific associations with these conditions require further investigation.

## Interactions
PPP1R3D, also known as R6, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a significant role in glycogen metabolism through its interactions with various proteins. It contains RVXF motifs that are crucial for binding to the catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1c), facilitating its role in glycogen synthesis and breakdown (Casamayor2020Controlling; RubioVillena2015StructureFunction).

PPP1R3D interacts with glycogenic substrates such as glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP), which are essential for glycogen metabolism (RubioVillena2015StructureFunction). It also binds to 14-3-3 proteins, specifically through a motif involving Ser74, which regulates its glycogenic activity and stability. The binding of 14-3-3 proteins negatively regulates PPP1R3D's activity by stabilizing it and preventing lysosomal degradation (RubioVillena2015StructureFunction).

Additionally, PPP1R3D interacts with laforin, a glucan phosphatase, which allows for its ubiquitination by the E3-ubiquitin ligase malin, targeting PPP1R3D for degradation and reducing its glycogenic activity in neuronal cells (Casamayor2020Controlling). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network in which PPP1R3D is involved, influencing glycogen metabolism and homeostasis.
