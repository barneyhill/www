# JPH4

## Overview
JPH4 is a gene that encodes the protein junctophilin 4, which is a member of the junctophilin family involved in the formation of junctional membrane complexes. These complexes are crucial for the communication between the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), particularly in neurons. Junctophilin 4 is characterized as a transmembrane protein, featuring multiple membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN) motifs that facilitate its binding to the plasma membrane, as well as a transmembrane domain that anchors it to the ER. This structural configuration allows JPH4 to play a significant role in calcium signaling, which is essential for neuronal excitability and function. The protein is predominantly expressed in sensory neurons, such as those in the dorsal root ganglia, where it is involved in processes like store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and the regulation of afterhyperpolarization currents. These functions underscore its importance in maintaining calcium homeostasis and proper neuronal signaling, with implications for inflammatory pain and other neurological processes (Sahu2019Junctophilin; Hogea2019Junctophilin4; Piggott2021Junctophilins:).

## Structure
Junctophilin 4 (JPH4) is a member of the junctophilin family, characterized by its role in forming junctional membrane complexes. The protein structure includes eight N-terminal MORN (membrane occupation and recognition nexus) motifs, which are essential for binding to the plasma membrane. These motifs interact with phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol phosphate species, facilitating the protein's membrane association (Perni2022The; Takeshima2015Ca2+). The MORN motifs are followed by a predicted α-helical domain, which acts as a flexible linker, and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain at the C-terminus that anchors JPH4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Piggott2021Junctophilins:).

JPH4's structure allows it to tether the plasma membrane to the ER, playing a crucial role in calcium signaling in neurons. The protein is involved in forming complexes with other proteins, such as Cav1.3, RyR2, and KCa3.1, which are important for neuronal excitability and calcium signaling (Sahu2019Junctophilin). The specific post-translational modifications and splice variants of JPH4 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
Junctophilin-4 (JPH4) is a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of junctional membrane complexes, which are essential for communication between the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in neurons. JPH4 is predominantly expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, where it is involved in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a process crucial for refilling ER calcium stores following depletion (Hogea2019Junctophilin4). JPH4 facilitates the interaction between STIM1 and Orai1, proteins that are key components of the SOCE complex, thereby maintaining calcium signaling pathways necessary for sensory neuron function (Hogea2019Junctophilin4).

In addition to its role in calcium signaling, JPH4 is involved in the production of afterhyperpolarization (AHP) currents in neurons, which are important for regulating the frequency of action potentials. This function is achieved through the coupling of NMDA receptors, ryanodine receptors (RyRs), and small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels (Piggott2021Junctophilins:). JPH4's activity is crucial for maintaining proper neuronal excitability and function, particularly in response to inflammatory stimuli, and it plays a role in sustaining inflammatory pain signaling (Hogea2019Junctophilin4).

## Clinical Significance
Junctophilin-4 (JPH4) plays a critical role in calcium signaling at plasma membrane-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions in sensory neurons, particularly in the context of inflammatory pain. Alterations in JPH4 expression can impact inflammatory pain mechanisms by disrupting calcium signaling pathways. Knockdown of JPH4 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons has been shown to shorten the duration of inflammatory nociception, indicating its importance in sustaining inflammatory pain through the maintenance of ER calcium stores (Hogea2019Junctophilin4).

While specific diseases directly linked to JPH4 mutations are not extensively documented, the gene's role in calcium signaling suggests potential implications for neurological functions. Previous studies have indicated that JPH3/JPH4 double knockout mice exhibit neurological deficits, such as reduced memory and impaired motor coordination, suggesting that JPH4 may have a role in maintaining neuronal calcium signaling and function (Landstrom2014The).

The disruption of JPH4's normal interactions, particularly with proteins like STIM1 and Orai1, can impair store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which is crucial for calcium replenishment in the ER. This impairment can lead to reduced capacity for sustained calcium signaling, affecting nociceptive signaling and potentially contributing to neurological dysfunctions (Hogea2019Junctophilin4).

## Interactions
Junctophilin 4 (JPH4) is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in cellular signaling. In hippocampal neurons, JPH4 is part of a tripartite complex with Cav1.3 calcium channels, RyR2, and KCa3.1 potassium channels. This complex is essential for regulating neuronal excitability and the generation of slow afterhyperpolarizations (sAHP) in CA1 pyramidal cells. JPH4, along with JPH3, tethers these channels at the junctions between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM), ensuring their functional coupling (Sahu2019Junctophilin).

In sensory neurons, particularly dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, JPH4 interacts with STIM1 and Orai1, proteins involved in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). JPH4 facilitates the clustering of these proteins at ER-PM junctions, which is crucial for calcium signaling. Knockdown of JPH4 disrupts this clustering, impairing SOCE and affecting calcium homeostasis in these neurons (Hogea2019Junctophilin4).

JPH4's interactions are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of junctional membrane complexes, which are necessary for proper neural function and calcium signaling pathways (Moriguchi2006Functional; Takeshima2015Ca2+).
