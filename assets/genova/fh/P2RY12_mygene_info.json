This family has several receptor subtypes with different pharmacological selectivity, which overlaps in some cases, for various adenosine and uridine nucleotides. This receptor is involved in platelet aggregation, and is a potential target for the treatment of thromboembolisms and other clotting disorders. Mutations in this gene are implicated in bleeding disorder, platelet type 8 (BDPLT8). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants of this gene.
