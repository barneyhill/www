# TMEM19

## Overview
TMEM19 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 19, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and maintaining cellular structure. The specific functions of transmembrane protein 19 remain to be fully elucidated, but it is believed to be involved in cellular communication and molecular transport across the membrane. Understanding the role of TMEM19 and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
