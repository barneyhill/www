# IGFBP4

## Overview
The IGFBP4 gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4, a member of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) family. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating the activity and bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) by binding to them with high affinity, thereby regulating their interaction with IGF receptors. IGFBP4 is characterized by its structure, which includes an N-terminal domain, a flexible linker region, and a C-terminal domain, and it undergoes various post-translational modifications that influence its function (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4; Forbes2012Insulin-Like). Functionally, IGFBP4 acts primarily as an inhibitor of IGF actions, impacting processes such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and metabolic regulation. It also exhibits IGF-independent roles, such as influencing apoptosis and cardiomyocyte differentiation (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4). The protein's activity is modulated through proteolytic cleavage by pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), which enhances IGF signaling by reducing IGFBP4's binding affinity (Lawrence1999The). IGFBP4's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, underscores its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2019Gene; Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4).

## Structure
IGFBP4 is a protein that consists of 237 amino acids and is encoded by the human IGFBP4 gene located on chromosome 17 (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4). The protein is structured into three domains: an N-terminal domain, a flexible linker region, and a C-terminal domain (Forbes2012Insulin-Like). The N-terminal domain is a rigid globular structure with a short two-stranded β-sheet, containing 12 conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4; Forbes2012Insulin-Like). The C-terminal domain adopts a thyroglobulin type-1 fold and contains six cysteine residues, also forming disulfide bonds (Mazerbourg2004Up; Forbes2012Insulin-Like).

IGFBP4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at Asn104 in the N-terminal domain, which does not affect its IGF binding affinity (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4). The protein exists in both glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms, with molecular weights of approximately 28 kDa and 25.9 kDa, respectively (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4). The linker region is the site of post-translational modifications and is believed to be flexible, contributing to the protein's structural diversity (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4; Forbes2012Insulin-Like). The quaternary structure of IGFBP4 includes the potential to form dimers, although specific details on splice variant isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
IGFBP4, encoded by the human IGFBP4 gene, is a critical regulator of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system. It binds IGF-I and IGF-II with high affinity, modulating their bioavailability and activity in various tissues, including smooth muscles, lungs, breasts, and kidneys (Mazerbourg2004Up; Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4). IGFBP4 primarily functions as an inhibitor of IGF actions by sequestering IGFs, thereby preventing their interaction with IGF receptors and prolonging their half-life in circulation (Mazerbourg2004Up; Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4).

In healthy human cells, IGFBP4 plays a role in maintaining the balance of IGF bioavailability and signaling, which is essential for normal cellular proliferation, differentiation, and metabolic effects (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4). It is involved in regulating IGF-I bioavailability, particularly in vascular growth, and is necessary for optimal IGF-mediated growth during fetal development (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4). IGFBP4 also has IGF-independent functions, such as inhibiting apoptosis in breast cancer cells and enhancing cardiomyocyte differentiation through inhibition of Wnt signaling (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4).

The proteolytic cleavage of IGFBP4 by pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) reduces its binding affinity, allowing IGFs to be released and active, which is crucial for stimulating IGF-mediated growth (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4; Lawrence1999The). This regulatory mechanism enhances IGF activity, impacting processes such as bone remodeling and reproductive functions (Lawrence1999The).

## Clinical Significance
IGFBP4 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in modulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF) activity. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high mRNA levels of IGFBP4 are associated with poor overall survival, particularly in patients with adenocarcinoma and those who have never smoked (Wang2019Gene). This association is significant in early-stage NSCLC, with a hazard ratio indicating a strong correlation with poorer survival outcomes (Wang2019Gene). 

In cardiovascular diseases, IGFBP4 is involved in the regulation of IGF bioavailability through its interaction with pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A). PAPP-A cleaves IGFBP4, increasing IGF bioavailability, which is crucial in conditions like acute coronary syndrome and heart failure (Adasheva2023PAPPASpecific; Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4). IGFBP4 fragments have shown stronger prognostic power for cardiovascular mortality than PAPP-A alone (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4).

In cancer, IGFBP4 is known to inhibit IGF actions, displaying anti-angiogenic effects and being epigenetically silenced in some adenocarcinoma cells (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4). The IGFBP4/PAPP-A/STC axis is considered a potential target for therapeutic intervention in IGF-driven tumors (Hjortebjerg2018IGFBP4).

## Interactions
IGFBP4 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in modulating signaling pathways. It is known to bind to insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II), affecting their bioavailability and activity (Mazerbourg2004Up). IGFBP4 also interacts with the apoptosis inhibitor of macrophages (AIM), which inhibits IGFBP4-mediated apoptosis by increasing the binding of IGF-I to its receptors, thereby promoting cell survival (YOU2015Interaction).

IGFBP4 is involved in the inhibition of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, crucial for cardiomyocyte differentiation. It interacts with cell-surface receptors such as LRP5/6 and Frizzled, acting as a competitive inhibitor of Wnt3A binding. This interaction is essential for its role in promoting cardiogenesis by antagonizing the Wnt pathway (Zhu2008IGFBP4).

IGFBP4 is subject to proteolytic degradation by pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), which cleaves IGFBP4, influencing IGF signaling pathways. The degradation process is enhanced by IGFs, which induce a conformational change in IGFBP4, making it more susceptible to proteolysis (Mazerbourg2004Up). IGFBP-3 can inhibit the proteolysis of IGFBP4, suggesting a regulatory mechanism in various biological fluids and cell systems (Fowlkes1995Insulinlike).
