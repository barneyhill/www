# CASR

## Overview
The CASR gene encodes the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is pivotal in regulating calcium homeostasis in the human body. This receptor is primarily expressed in tissues such as the parathyroid glands, kidneys, bone, and gastrointestinal tract, where it detects changes in extracellular calcium concentrations and modulates physiological responses accordingly. The CaSR protein is characterized by its complex structure, including an extracellular domain with a Venus flytrap motif, a seven-transmembrane domain, and an intracellular C-terminal tail, which are essential for its function as a homodimer. Through its interactions with various proteins, CaSR influences processes such as parathyroid hormone secretion, renal calcium excretion, and bone metabolism. Mutations in the CASR gene can lead to disorders like familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, highlighting its clinical significance in calcium-related pathologies (Hannan2013Calciumsensing; DiezFraile2013The; Hendy2013The).

## Structure
The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis. The CaSR protein is composed of 1078 amino acids and includes several distinct structural domains. It begins with an N-terminal signal peptide of 19 amino acids, which is cleaved upon entry into the endoplasmic reticulum (Hendy2013The).

The extracellular domain (ECD) of CaSR is approximately 600 amino acids long and features a bi-lobed Venus flytrap (VFT) domain, which is structurally similar to bacterial periplasmic binding proteins. This domain contains multiple calcium-binding sites and undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding, which are crucial for receptor activation (Geng2016Structural; Hendy2013The). The VFT domain is connected to a cysteine-rich region, which links to the seven-transmembrane domain (TMD) typical of GPCRs (Ling2021Structural).

The CaSR functions as a homodimer, with both covalent and noncovalent interactions between the VFT domains of each monomer. Dimerization is essential for its functional tertiary structure, involving intermolecular disulfide bonds (Geng2016Structural; Hendy2013The). The receptor's intracellular C-terminal tail consists of 216 amino acids (Hendy2013The).

Post-translational modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation at several asparagine residues in the ECD, are critical for normal cell surface expression (Hendy2013The). The CaSR gene also features alternative splicing, resulting in different splice variant isoforms (Hendy2013The).

## Function
The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor encoded by the CASR gene, playing a crucial role in maintaining systemic calcium homeostasis. It is primarily expressed in the parathyroid glands, kidneys, bone, and gastrointestinal tract, where it senses changes in extracellular calcium levels and modulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion accordingly (Hendy2016CalciumSensing; DiezFraile2013The). In the parathyroid gland, CaSR activation suppresses PTH secretion when extracellular calcium levels are high, leading to increased renal calcium excretion and decreased bone resorption (DiezFraile2013The). In the kidneys, CaSR enhances urinary calcium excretion by inhibiting distal tubular calcium reabsorption (DiezFraile2013The).

CaSR is also involved in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, influencing various physiological processes (DiezFraile2013The). In bone tissue, CaSR promotes osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, contributing to bone health (DiezFraile2013The). In the cardiovascular system, CaSR is expressed in cardiac myocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells, where it regulates intracellular calcium levels, affecting cardiac activity, muscle contractility, and vascular tone (Sundararaman2021CalciumSensing). The receptor's activation in endothelial cells is involved in nitric oxide production, crucial for vascular health (Sundararaman2021CalciumSensing). Overall, CaSR plays a multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function across various tissues (DiezFraile2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CASR gene, which encodes the calcium-sensing receptor, are associated with several disorders affecting calcium homeostasis. Loss-of-function mutations in CASR can lead to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), characterized by mild to moderate hypercalcemia and relative hypocalciuria. FHH is typically asymptomatic and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (Hendy2000Mutations; Hannan2013Calciumsensing). Neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) is a more severe condition resulting from homozygous inactivating mutations, leading to life-threatening hypercalcemia in infants (Vahe2017Diseases; Egbuna2008Hypercalcaemic).

Gain-of-function mutations in CASR result in autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH), which is characterized by hypocalcemia, low serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and hypercalciuria. This condition can lead to neuromuscular symptoms and an increased risk of nephrocalcinosis (Hannan2013Calciumsensing; Egbuna2008Hypercalcaemic). Bartter syndrome type V, another disorder linked to activating CASR mutations, presents with renal salt wasting and hypokalemic alkalosis (Hannan2013Calciumsensing).

Autoimmune conditions involving CASR include autoimmune hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autoimmune hypoparathyroidism, where antibodies against the receptor alter its function, leading to abnormal calcium and PTH levels (Vahe2017Diseases).

## Interactions
The calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) interacts with various proteins that regulate its function and trafficking. CASR interacts with β-arrestins, particularly β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2, which are involved in receptor desensitization and internalization. These interactions are enhanced by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), such as GRK2 and GRK4, which facilitate β-arrestin translocation to CASR, promoting desensitization (Pi2005βArrestin).

CASR also interacts with the heterotetrameric adaptor protein-2 (AP2) through a dileucine motif in its C-terminus, which is crucial for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Gorvin2018Insights). Additionally, CASR binds to caveolin-1, facilitating its clustering at the plasma membrane and enhancing signaling (Gorvin2018Insights). Filamin, an actin-binding protein, interacts with CASR to prevent its proteosomal degradation and increase MAPK signaling (Gorvin2018Insights).

The receptor also forms complexes with proteins like 14-3-3, which bind to an Arg-rich site within the C-terminus, affecting its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and regulating cell surface expression (Gorvin2018Insights). These interactions are essential for CASR's role in calcium homeostasis and signaling.
