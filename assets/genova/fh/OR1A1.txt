# OR1A1

## Overview
The OR1A1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily A member 1, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that contribute to the sense of smell (Ahmed2018Molecular). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR1A1 is expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the liver, where it participates in lipid metabolism by modulating intracellular signaling pathways (Wu2015Activation). The receptor's structure is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain, typical of GPCRs, and it can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, which may influence its signaling capabilities (Belloir2017Biophysical). The diverse roles of OR1A1 in physiological processes, including its potential implications in disease states, underscore its significance as a subject of ongoing research (Jabeen2021Machine).

## Structure
The OR1A1 protein is a member of the olfactory receptor family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Ahmed2018Molecular). The primary structure of OR1A1 includes specific amino acid residues critical for its function, such as Tyr258, Tyr251, Ile205, Phe206, Ile105, and Tyr113, which are involved in the binding of musk-smelling compounds (Ahmed2018Molecular). The secondary structure of OR1A1 is composed of approximately 44% alpha-helix and 19% beta-sheet, as confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Belloir2017Biophysical).

The tertiary structure of OR1A1 includes a binding site near the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), with the odorant binding at the periphery of the receptor (Ahmed2018Molecular). The receptor's quaternary structure allows it to form monomeric and dimeric forms, which may have implications for receptor signaling and function (Belloir2017Biophysical). The protein is expressed with a FLAG-rho1D4 tag for purification purposes, and its structural integrity is maintained during expression and purification processes (Belloir2017Biophysical).

## Function
The OR1A1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, traditionally associated with odor detection. However, OR1A1 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the liver, where it plays a significant role in lipid metabolism. In hepatocytes, OR1A1 activation by the ligand (-)-carvone leads to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which activates protein kinase A (PKA). This activation results in the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and the upregulation of the CREB-responsive gene HES-1. HES-1 acts as a corepressor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), reducing the expression of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, a key enzyme in triglyceride synthesis. Consequently, this pathway decreases intracellular triglyceride levels and lipid accumulation in liver cells (Wu2015Activation).

In addition to its role in the liver, OR1A1 is involved in the olfactory system, where it binds specific odorants, such as carvone and limonene, with enantioselectivity. This binding initiates a signal transduction pathway that contributes to the perception of smell (Ben2021Statistical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the OR1A1 gene have been implicated in various disease conditions. Recurrent mutations in OR1A1 have been identified in lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting a potential link to cancer development (Jabeen2021Machine). The gene is also expressed in gut enterochromaffin cells, where it is associated with serotonin release, indicating a possible role in gastrointestinal disorders (Jabeen2021Machine). In the liver, OR1A1 is expressed in HepG2 cells and is involved in hepatic triglyceride metabolism. Activation of OR1A1 by the aromatic ligand (-)-carvone stimulates the PKA signaling pathway, leading to decreased intracellular triglyceride concentrations, which suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions like hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Lee2018Therapeutic).

Despite these associations, the clinical significance of OR1A1 gene mutations in specific diseases remains under investigation. The role of OR1A1 in odor perception, such as its association with caproic acid, has not been consistently replicated in studies, indicating that its function in olfactory perception may be influenced by non-genetic factors (Li2021From). Overall, OR1A1's involvement in various physiological processes highlights its potential as a therapeutic target, though further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications.

## Interactions
The human olfactory receptor OR1A1 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in detecting odorant molecules. It participates in various interactions that are crucial for its function. OR1A1 undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding, which indicates its functional activity in signal transduction pathways (Belloir2017Biophysical). The receptor is known to exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with dimerization potentially affecting its signaling capabilities (Belloir2017Biophysical).

In HepG2 cells, OR1A1 is involved in the PKA-CREB signaling axis. Activation of OR1A1 by the ligand (-)-carvone increases intracellular cAMP levels and stimulates the PKA-CREB signaling pathway, leading to CREB phosphorylation. This activation is associated with a reduction in intracellular triglyceride levels, mediated through the downregulation of PPAR-γ, a lipogenic transcription factor, via the activation of HES-1, a repressor (Wu2015Activation).

The receptor's interactions with various odorant molecules have been studied using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, identifying dihydrojasmone as a potent ligand with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 554 ± 9 nM (Belloir2017Biophysical). These interactions highlight the importance of OR1A1 in olfactory signaling and its potential role in broader physiological processes.
