# SASH1

## Overview
SASH1, or SAM and SH3 domain containing 1, is a gene located on chromosome 6q24.3 that encodes a signaling adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes. The SASH1 protein is characterized by the presence of SAM (Sterile Alpha Motif) and SH3 (Src Homology 3) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a SLY domain, which is significant for skin pigmentation regulation. As a scaffold protein, SASH1 plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial cell adhesion and integrity by stabilizing adherens junctions and interacting with key signaling molecules such as CRKL. It is expressed in multiple tissues, including the breast, lung, and spleen, and is implicated in regulating apoptotic pathways. Clinically, mutations in the SASH1 gene are associated with pigmentation disorders and various cancers, where it functions as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is linked to poor prognosis in conditions such as colon cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its importance in cellular dynamics and disease (Xu2020Mutated; Ilnitskaya2020Involvement; Burgess2020SASH1).

## Structure
The SASH1 protein is a signaling adaptor protein composed of 1,247 amino acids, located on chromosome 6q24.3. It contains several key domains: two SAM (Sterile Alpha Motif) domains, an SH3 (Src Homology 3) domain, and a SLY domain, which is proposed to be renamed as the SLy Proteins Associated Disordered Region (SPIDER) (Clements2023Solution; Xu2020Mutated). The SAM domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and are typically organized into a five-helix bundle, although the SAM1 domain in SASH1 is mostly disordered with some helical propensity (Clements2023The). The SH3 domain suggests potential interactions with proteins like CRKL, which may activate signaling pathways such as SRC/FAK (Ilnitskaya2020Involvement).

The SLY domain, spanning amino acids 401-555, is significant for skin pigmentation regulation and may be a mutational hotspot (Xu2020Mutated). SASH1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Xu2020Mutated). The protein's structure allows it to function as a scaffold, participating in signaling and interacting with membrane proteins (Ilnitskaya2020Involvement).

## Function
The SASH1 gene encodes a protein that functions as an adapter and signaling molecule, containing SH3 and SAM domains which facilitate protein-protein interactions. In healthy human cells, SASH1 is involved in maintaining stable cell-cell adhesion, particularly in epithelial cells. It co-localizes with circumferential actin bundles and linear adherens junctions (AJs), suggesting its role in stabilizing cell-cell contacts (Ilnitskaya2020Involvement). SASH1 is expressed in various tissues, including the breast, lung, thymus, thyroid, and spleen (Yu2023Drug).

SASH1 plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial characteristics by preventing the destruction of stable AJs and inhibiting the transition to a mesenchymal phenotype. Its overexpression strengthens cell-extracellular matrix adhesion and increases E-cadherin levels, which are essential for maintaining epithelial integrity (Ilnitskaya2020Involvement). The protein is also involved in signaling pathways, interacting with molecules such as CRKL and potentially affecting SRC/FAK signaling, highlighting its broader role in cellular dynamics and adhesion processes (Ilnitskaya2020Involvement).

In addition to its role in cell adhesion, SASH1 is implicated in regulating apoptotic pathways and is cleaved by Caspase-3 during UVC-induced apoptosis (Burgess2020SASH1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SASH1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. SASH1 mutations have been linked to Generalized Lentiginosis (GL), a rare autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by widespread pigmented lesions. These mutations inhibit the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, leading to abnormal melanocyte morphology and pigment deposition (Du2024Uncovering). SASH1 is also implicated in dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH), a condition marked by mottled hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules. Mutations in SASH1, such as the novel heterozygous missense mutation p.Q518P, contribute to the distinct clinical phenotype of DUH (Wu2020Identification).

In cancer, SASH1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis in colon cancer, particularly in advanced stages and metastases (Rimkus2006Prognostic). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), low SASH1 expression correlates with poor survival outcomes, especially in lung adenocarcinoma (Burgess2020SASH1). SASH1's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis, with its expression levels influencing tumor cell survival and chemotherapeutic resistance (Burgess2020SASH1).

## Interactions
SASH1 (SAM and SH3 domain containing 1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One of its key interactions is with Tankyrase 2 (TNKS2), a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family. SASH1 binds to TNKS2 through Tankyrase-binding motifs (TBMs), with nine potential TBMs identified. This interaction is crucial for maintaining human melanocyte stem cell characteristics and is implicated in pigmentation disorders. The S519N variant of SASH1 affects the binding dynamics and affinity with TNKS2, altering cell division processes and contributing to pigmentation disorders (Lambert2023SASH1).

SASH1 also interacts with the signal adaptor protein CRKL, which is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in colorectal cancer. The interaction is mediated by the CRKL SH3N domain binding to a specific motif in SASH1. This binding inhibits CRKL-mediated signaling pathways, which are essential for EMT and metastasis. Loss of SASH1 leads to increased migration and invasion of cancer cells, highlighting its role as a negative regulator of EMT. The interaction between SASH1 and CRKL is crucial for maintaining epithelial characteristics and inhibiting cancer progression (Franke2019The).
