# PEX5

## Overview
The PEX5 gene encodes the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5, a crucial receptor protein involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. This protein plays a significant role in peroxisomal biogenesis by recognizing and binding peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1)-containing proteins in the cytosol and facilitating their transport into peroxisomes. Structurally, PEX5 is characterized by an N-terminal domain that is natively unfolded and a C-terminal domain containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are essential for protein-protein interactions and the recognition of PTS1 signals. PEX5 functions as a shuttle receptor, interacting with docking proteins such as PEX13 and PEX14 at the peroxisomal membrane, and is involved in the ATP-dependent recycling process necessary for continuous protein import. Mutations in the PEX5 gene are linked to peroxisome biogenesis disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, highlighting its critical role in cellular homeostasis and metabolic pathways (Pedrosa2018Peroxisomal; Dodt1996Multiple; Braverman1998An).

## Structure
The PEX5 protein is a key component in peroxisomal biogenesis, primarily functioning as a receptor for peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1). Structurally, PEX5 is composed of an N-terminal and a C-terminal half, each with distinct characteristics and functions. The N-terminal half of PEX5 is natively unfolded, characterized as a pre-molten globule-like domain, which facilitates interactions with peroxisomal membrane proteins such as Pex14p and Pex13p (Carvalho2006The). This region is also involved in oligomerization, forming homotetramers, and contains multiple WXXX(F/Y) motifs crucial for binding Pex14p (Schliebs1999Recombinant; Saidowsky2001The).

The C-terminal half of PEX5 contains seven tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are essential for binding PTS1-containing proteins. This region is more structured, with a significant alpha-helical content, and is involved in protein-protein interactions (Gatto2000A; Carvalho2006The). The TPR domains facilitate the recognition and binding of the PTS1 signal, a C-terminal tripeptide, allowing for the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes (Gatto2000A).

PEX5 exists in multiple isoforms, including PEX5L and PEX5S, which differ in their structural and functional properties (Schliebs1999Recombinant). These isoforms contribute to the functional diversity of PEX5 in peroxisomal protein import.

## Function
The PEX5 gene encodes a protein that functions as a receptor for peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1), playing a crucial role in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins in healthy human cells. PEX5 operates as a shuttle receptor, recognizing and binding PTS1-containing proteins in the cytosol and facilitating their transport into peroxisomes (Freitas2011PEX5; Dodt1996Multiple). This process is essential for peroxisome biogenesis and function, impacting various metabolic pathways, including fatty acid β-oxidation and detoxification processes (Pedrosa2018Peroxisomal).

PEX5 interacts with docking proteins such as PEX13 and PEX14 at the peroxisomal membrane, enabling the translocation of cargo proteins into the peroxisomal matrix (Freitas2011PEX5; Wang2017Role). After delivering its cargo, PEX5 is monoubiquitinated and extracted from the membrane in an ATP-dependent manner, allowing it to be recycled for further rounds of protein import (Pedrosa2018Peroxisomal; Skowyra2022Mechanism). This recycling is crucial for maintaining peroxisome dynamics and homeostasis, as it prevents the accumulation of non-functional PEX5 and supports continuous protein import (Wang2017Role). The proper functioning of PEX5 is vital for cellular homeostasis and the prevention of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (Dodt1996Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX5 gene are associated with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), particularly those within the Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSDs), which include Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease. These conditions are characterized by defective import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, leading to severe clinical phenotypes such as developmental delays and neurological abnormalities (Waterham2016Human; Braverman1998An; Wanders2023The).

PEX5 mutations can result in deficiencies in both PTS1 and PTS2-mediated protein import, a phenotype not observed in yeast PEX5 mutants, which are only defective in PTS1 import. This highlights the broader impact of PEX5 mutations on peroxisomal function in humans (Braverman1998An). Specifically, the loss of the PEX5 long isoform (PEX5L) due to mutations can lead to rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 5 (RCDP5), characterized by a selective defect in the import of PTS2-tagged proteins, resulting in peroxisomal dysfunction and clinical features such as congenital cataracts and severe intellectual disability (Barøy2015A).

In PBDs, biallelic pathogenic variants in PEX5 affect the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, leading to peroxisomal membrane vesicles that lack matrix proteins but contain most of the peroxisomal membrane proteins (Wanders2023The).

## Interactions
PEX5, a peroxisomal targeting signal receptor, is involved in several critical interactions essential for peroxisomal protein import. It interacts with Pex14p, forming a docking complex that facilitates the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes. This interaction is mediated by specific motifs in PEX5, such as the LVXEF motif, which is crucial for binding to Pex14p. The binding affinity between PEX5 and Pex14p is high, with a dissociation constant of 157 nM, indicating a strong interaction (Neuhaus2014A).

PEX5 also interacts with Pex13p, another component of the peroxisomal import machinery. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PEX5 binds to the SH3 domain of Pex13p in a non-traditional manner, as it lacks the classical SH3-binding motif PXXP. Instead, specific residues in PEX5, such as F208, E212, and E214, are important for this interaction (Bottger2000Saccharomyces). Mutations in these residues can impair the interaction with Pex13p, affecting the import of PTS1 proteins (Bottger2000Saccharomyces).

Additionally, PEX5 interacts with monomeric catalase, inhibiting its tetramerization. This interaction is disrupted by the N-terminal domain of Pex14p, which plays a role in the cargo release step during peroxisomal protein import (Freitas2011PEX5).
