# EFCAB14

## Overview
EFCAB14 is a gene that encodes the EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 protein, which is involved in calcium ion binding and signaling pathways. The EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 protein is characterized by its EF-hand motif, a helix-loop-helix structural domain that is commonly found in calcium-binding proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by modulating calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Although the specific functions and interactions of EFCAB14 are still under investigation, it is believed to be involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels and may have implications in certain physiological and pathological conditions. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the biological significance and potential clinical relevance of EFCAB14 and its encoded protein.
