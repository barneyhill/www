# RFT1

## Overview
The RFT1 gene encodes the RFT1 homolog, a multi-spanning transmembrane protein integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is pivotal in the N-glycosylation pathway, facilitating the translocation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) across the ER membrane, a crucial step for the proper assembly of N-glycan precursors. These precursors are essential for protein folding and stability in eukaryotic cells (Chen2024Rft1; Haeuptle2008Human). The RFT1 protein is characterized by 11 transmembrane domains and several hydrophilic domains oriented towards the ER lumen, which are critical for its function in the dolichol cycle (Vleugels2009RFT1; Helenius2002Translocation). Mutations in the RFT1 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, underscoring its essential role in cellular processes (Vleugels2009RFT1; Jaeken2009RFT1‐CDG:).

## Structure
The RFT1 protein is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, playing a crucial role in the translocation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides, specifically Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, across the ER membrane. The protein is characterized by having 11 transmembrane domains, which facilitate its function in the ER (Vleugels2009RFT1; Helenius2002Translocation). These transmembrane domains are essential for the protein's role in the N-glycosylation pathway, a critical process for protein folding and stability (Helenius2002Translocation).

The RFT1 protein also contains several hydrophilic domains oriented towards the ER lumen, with specific mutations identified in these luminal loops. Notably, the p.R67C mutation is located in the first luminal loop, the p.K152E mutation in the second luminally oriented hydrophilic stretch, and the p.E298K mutation in the largest luminal loop (Vleugels2009RFT1). Additionally, there is a potential N-glycosylation site at position p.N227, indicating post-translational modification that may influence the protein's function (Vleugels2009RFT1).

The protein's structure does not include ATP-binding domains, suggesting a unique mechanism for translocating polar and bulky substrates across the membrane (Helenius2002Translocation). The absence of such domains differentiates RFT1 from other known transport proteins.

## Function
The RFT1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the N-glycosylation pathway, a posttranslational modification essential for protein folding, stability, and function in eukaryotic cells. The RFT1 protein is involved in the translocation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This process is critical for the proper assembly of the N-glycan precursor, which is subsequently transferred to nascent proteins (Chen2024Rft1; Haeuptle2008Human).

In healthy human cells, RFT1 facilitates the movement of the Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol intermediate from the cytosolic face to the lumen of the ER membrane. This translocation is essential for the continuation of the dolichol cycle and the eventual transfer of the fully assembled oligosaccharide precursor onto polypeptide chains by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex (Vleugels2009RFT1). The protein is a multi-spanning membrane protein located in the ER, with its N and C-termini facing the cytoplasm (Hirata2024Molecular).

RFT1's function is conserved across species, as evidenced by its ability to complement the growth defect of yeast strains lacking RFT1, indicating its essential role in maintaining proper glycosylation (Chen2024Rft1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RFT1 gene are associated with a congenital disorder of glycosylation known as RFT1-CDG. This disorder is characterized by severe N-glycosylation defects, leading to a range of clinical symptoms including developmental delay, neurological abnormalities, sensorineural deafness, and epilepsy (Paprocka2021Congenital; Vleugels2009RFT1; Jaeken2009RFT1‐CDG:). Patients with RFT1-CDG often exhibit a type 1 pattern of serum sialotransferrins, indicative of glycosylation disorders (Vleugels2009RFT1).

Specific mutations such as p.R67C, p.K152E, and p.E298K have been identified in patients, leading to the accumulation of Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and impaired glycosylation processes (Vleugels2009RFT1; Haeuptle2008Human). These mutations are located in conserved regions of the RFT1 protein, underscoring their importance for its function (Haeuptle2008Human; Hirata2024Molecular).

The clinical phenotype of RFT1-CDG includes typical CDG symptoms such as developmental delay and hypotonia, as well as unique features like sensorineural deafness, which is rarely reported in other CDG types (Vleugels2009RFT1; Jaeken2009RFT1‐CDG:). The identification of these mutations and their effects on glycosylation processes highlights the critical role of RFT1 in maintaining normal cellular function.
