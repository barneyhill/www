# SDR39U1

## Overview
SDR39U1 is a gene that encodes the protein short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 39U member 1, which is part of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) superfamily. This protein family is characterized by its role in catalyzing oxidation-reduction reactions, which are crucial for various metabolic processes. The SDR39U1 protein is involved in the metabolism of a wide range of substrates, including steroids, prostaglandins, and retinoids, due to its enzymatic activity (Qiu2020aarFDC). As a member of the SDR family, SDR39U1 plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes. Understanding the function and regulation of SDR39U1 is essential for elucidating its potential impact on human health and disease.
