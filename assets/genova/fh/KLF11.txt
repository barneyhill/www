# KLF11

## Overview
KLF11, or Krüppel-like factor 11, is a gene that encodes the KLF transcription factor 11, a member of the Krüppel-like factor family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its three C-terminal Cys2-His2 zinc finger domains, which are essential for binding to GC-rich promoter elements and regulating gene expression (FernandezZapico2003An; Spittau2011Klf10). KLF11 functions as a transcriptional regulator involved in various cellular processes, including tumor suppression, cellular senescence, apoptosis, and proliferation. It interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes and other proteins to modulate gene networks, playing a significant role in metabolic regulation and epigenetic control (Lomberk2008KLF11; Calvo2014Single). Alterations in the KLF11 gene have been linked to several diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Ushijima2019KLF11; Lin2023KLF11).

## Structure
KLF11 is a member of the Krüppel-like factor family, characterized by three C-terminal Cys2-His2 zinc finger domains that facilitate DNA binding (FernandezZapico2003An; Spittau2011Klf10). These zinc finger motifs are crucial for the protein's ability to bind to GC-rich promoter elements, playing a significant role in its function as a transcription factor (Spittau2011Klf10). The primary structure of KLF11 includes a sequence rich in proline and serine residues, which are common in transcription factors for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Lomberk2013Krüppellike).

The secondary structure of KLF11 typically involves alpha helices and beta sheets, stabilized by the zinc finger motifs (Spittau2011Klf10). The tertiary structure is further supported by these motifs, which are essential for the protein's DNA-binding capability (Spittau2011Klf10).

KLF11 contains several functional domains, including a Mad1-like mSin3A interacting domain (SID) that is crucial for its transcriptional repression activity (FernandezZapico2003An). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation can influence KLF11's transcriptional activity, as seen in its regulation of the cPLA2α promoter (Buttar2010Distinct). The protein also has splice variants that result in isoforms with different functional properties (Lomberk2013Krüppellike).

## Function
Krüppel-like factor 11 (KLF11) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is involved in tumor suppression and cellular senescence by interacting with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). KLF11 recruits HP1 to specific promoter regions, such as the CXCR4 promoter, which is crucial for mediating gene repression through chromatin remodeling. This interaction leads to the deposition of the H3K9me3 histone mark, associated with gene silencing, thereby maintaining appropriate gene expression levels and preventing promoter dysregulation (Lomberk2012Sequencespecific).

KLF11 also influences cellular processes such as apoptosis and proliferation. It increases apoptosis by recruiting HP1, which is necessary for the repression of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation. The disruption of KLF11-HP1 interaction results in increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, highlighting its role as a tumor suppressor (Lomberk2012Sequencespecific).

In neuronal cells, KLF11 regulates the transcription of neurotransmitter receptors, such as the dopamine D2 receptor (Drd2), by interacting with chromatin remodeling pathways. It acts as a transcriptional activator by recruiting histone acetyltransferase p300, while HP1 limits this activation to maintain appropriate Drd2 expression levels (Seo2012Krüppellike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KLF11 gene are associated with several diseases. KLF11 is linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young 7 (MODY7) and early-onset type 2 diabetes. A novel variant, p.His418Gln, has been associated with early childhood-onset type 1B diabetes, characterized by non-autoimmune β-cell destruction and insulin deficiency. This variant exhibits a dominant-negative effect, disrupting KLF11's regulatory role on insulin gene expression (Ushijima2019KLF11).

In breast cancer, KLF11 is identified as a negative prognostic factor. High expression levels are associated with highly proliferative tumors and shorter disease-free and distant metastasis-free survival. KLF11 promotes cell viability and proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis in certain breast cancer cell lines, suggesting its role in tumor growth (Lin2023KLF11).

KLF11 also plays a role in inflammatory vascular diseases. It suppresses endothelial cell activation by interacting with the NF-κB signaling pathway, reducing the expression of adhesion molecules crucial for leukocyte adhesion. KLF11 deficiency leads to increased leukocyte adhesion, exacerbating inflammatory responses (Fan2012KrüppelLike).

In the context of fibrosis, KLF11 inactivation enhances mesenchymal cell activity, leading to increased fibrogenic responses, particularly in the liver (Mathison2013Role).

## Interactions
KLF11 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It forms complexes with chromatin remodeling machines, including the Sin3-histone deacetylase system, WD40-domain containing proteins, and the HP1-histone methyltransferase system, to modulate gene networks involved in metabolism and growth (Calvo2014Single). KLF11 also interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to mediate tumor suppressor activities, highlighting its role in epigenetic regulation (Lomberk2008KLF11).

In the context of metabolic regulation, KLF11 interacts with the guanine nucleotide-binding protein β2 (Gβ2), which is crucial for its function in insulin promoter activity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The A347S variant of KLF11 disrupts this interaction, affecting insulin secretion and metabolic gene regulation (Lomberk2013Krüppellike). KLF11 also binds to proteins containing SH3 or WW domains, as identified through solid phase binding assays (Lomberk2013Krüppellike).

KLF11 plays a role in suppressing tissue factor (TF) gene expression by interacting with the Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) transcription factor. This interaction is significant in the context of venous thrombosis, where KLF11 inhibits EGR1-induced TF gene transcription, thereby reducing thrombus formation (Liang2021KLF11).
