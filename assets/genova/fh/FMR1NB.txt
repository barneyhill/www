# FMR1NB

## Overview
The FMR1NB gene encodes the FMR1 neighbor protein, which is involved in various neurological and behavioral processes. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its potential role in modulating neurotransmitter pathways, particularly those involving serotonin and dopamine (Hu2021Discovery). The FMR1 neighbor protein is implicated in the regulation of sexual behavior and orientation, as evidenced by studies in animal models and genetic association studies in humans (Hu2021Discovery). Additionally, FMR1NB has been explored as a candidate gene in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders such as dyslexia, although its precise role remains to be fully elucidated (HucChabrolle2013Xq27).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The FMR1NB gene has been implicated in several neurological and behavioral conditions. Studies using CRISPR-mediated FMR1NB knockout mice have shown that the absence of the FMR1NB protein may influence sexual behavior, as male knockout mice exhibited increased male-male mounting behavior and did not show a significant preference for females over males. This suggests a potential role for FMR1NB in regulating sexual orientation and behavior, possibly through its involvement in serotonin and dopamine metabolic processes (Hu2021Discovery).

The gene has also been associated with male sexual orientation in humans. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within an intron of FMR1NB, rs17320865, was found to be significantly associated with male sexual orientation, indicating a possible genetic influence on this trait (Hu2021Discovery).

In the context of dyslexia, FMR1NB has been suggested as a potential candidate gene due to its role in brain development. However, studies have not found a significant association between FMR1NB mutations and dyslexia, despite some linkage evidence (HucChabrolle2013Xq27). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance of FMR1NB and its potential contributions to these conditions.
