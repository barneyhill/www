# GBA2

## Overview
The GBA2 gene encodes the enzyme glucosylceramidase beta 2, a non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase that plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide. This enzyme is categorized as a hydrolase and is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis within cells. It is predominantly expressed in the liver, brain, and testis, and is localized to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes. Beyond its hydrolytic function, glucosylceramidase beta 2 also exhibits transglucosylation activity, contributing to the synthesis and regulation of glycosphingolipids, which are vital for cellular signaling and membrane structure. The enzyme's activity is particularly significant in neuronal development and function, influencing axon and dendritic growth. Mutations in the GBA2 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders, including hereditary spastic paraplegia type 46 and Marinesco-Sjögren-like syndrome, as well as impaired male fertility due to glycolipid accumulation (Haugarvoll2017GBA2; Sorli2012The; Woeste2017The).

## Function
The GBA2 gene encodes a non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in healthy human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of GlcCer to glucose and ceramide, a process essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis. GBA2 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels found in the liver, brain, and testis, and is located at the cytoplasmic site of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membrane (Woeste2017The).

GBA2 also exhibits transglucosylation activity, transferring glucose to cholesterol to form glucocholesterol (GlcChol), and can reverse this process to synthesize GlcCer. This regulation of GlcCer levels is crucial for cellular signaling, as glycosphingolipids, including GlcCer, are important structural components of cellular membranes and play a key role in controlling cellular signaling (Woeste2017The).

In the context of neuronal function, GBA2 expression increases during neuronal differentiation, suggesting a role in neuronal development. Glycosphingolipids metabolized by GBA2 are crucial for neuronal function, affecting axon and dendritic growth (Woeste2017The). The enzyme's activity is linked to the generation of ceramide, a bioactive lipid that can modulate cell signaling pathways, including those related to cell growth, apoptosis, and response to stress (Sorli2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GBA2 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably hereditary spastic paraplegia type 46 (SPG46) and a Marinesco-Sjögren-like syndrome (MSSL). SPG46 is characterized by early-onset spastic paraparesis, cerebellar dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, distal amyotrophy, cognitive impairment, scoliosis, and cataracts. This condition is linked to biallelic mutations in GBA2, leading to altered enzymatic activity and increased glucosylceramide levels, although the exact mechanism of neurodegeneration remains unclear (Cioffi2024Hereditary).

In MSSL, GBA2 mutations result in symptoms such as autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, cataracts, and mental retardation. A specific 2 bp homozygous deletion in the GBA2 gene has been identified, causing reduced GBA2 activity and elevated glucosylceramide levels, similar to Gaucher disease. This mutation leads to a phenotype involving spasticity, ataxia, and peripheral nerve involvement, with some cases also showing cataracts and gonadal dysfunction (Haugarvoll2017GBA2).

Additionally, GBA2 mutations have been linked to impaired male fertility in mice, characterized by globozoospermia and abnormal sperm morphology. This is due to glycolipid accumulation in the testes, affecting sperm development and function (Yildiz2006Mutation).
