# CPSF2

## Overview
CPSF2, or cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is crucial for the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. The CPSF2 protein is part of the metallo-β-lactamase family and contains a β-CASP domain, although it is catalytically inactive due to the absence of key zinc-binding residues. Despite this, CPSF2 plays a vital structural role in the CPSF complex, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as CPSF160, WDR33, and CPSF73, which are essential for mRNA maturation processes, including endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation (Liu2024Modulation). Additionally, CPSF2 is involved in alternative polyadenylation, influencing gene expression by modulating mRNA isoform diversity and stability (Nilubol2014Loss). Alterations in CPSF2 expression have been linked to clinical outcomes in certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Ivković2022Prognostic; Nilubol2014Loss).

## Function
CPSF2, also known as CPSF100, is a subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is essential for the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA in human cells. This complex is responsible for recognizing the polyadenylation signal sequence, performing endonucleolytic cleavage, and recruiting poly(A) polymerase to add a poly(A) tail to the pre-mRNA. This process is crucial for mRNA stability, export from the nucleus, and translation efficiency (Liu2024Modulation).

CPSF2 is part of the metallo-β-lactamase protein family and contains a β-CASP domain, which is typically associated with RNA/DNA processing. However, CPSF2 is catalytically inactive due to the absence of conserved amino acids necessary for binding catalytic zinc ions. Despite this, CPSF2 is required for the cleavage of histone mRNAs, which do not contain a polyadenylation signal and are not polyadenylated (Liu2024Modulation).

CPSF2 plays a role in alternative polyadenylation (APA), a mechanism that regulates gene expression by producing different protein isoforms or controlling the length of the 3' UTR, which often contains microRNA binding sites. This regulation can alter the amount of protein generated by mRNA, impacting various cellular processes (Nilubol2014Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CPSF2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Reduced expression of CPSF2 is associated with increased cellular invasion and a higher population of cancer stem cells, contributing to more aggressive disease and higher mortality rates in PTC patients (Nilubol2014Loss). Studies have shown that CPSF2 knockdown leads to increased cellular invasion and elevated markers of thyroid cancer stem cells, such as CD44 and CD133, indicating its role in the aggressiveness of thyroid cancer (Nilubol2014Loss).

CPSF2 expression levels are also linked to clinical outcomes in PTC. Negative CPSF2 expression is associated with a higher incidence of cervical lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis, as well as a higher recurrence rate during follow-up (Sung2015Negative). Lower CPSF2 expression is correlated with shorter disease-free survival and higher rates of tumor recurrence and mortality, independent of the BRAF V600E mutation status (Nilubol2014Loss).

The prognostic significance of CPSF2 is further highlighted by its potential as a predictive marker for poor clinical outcomes in PTC, especially when combined with the BRAF V600E mutation (Ivković2022Prognostic). These findings suggest that CPSF2 expression levels could aid in risk stratification and management of PTC patients.

## Interactions
CPSF2, also known as CPSF100, is a subunit of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) complex, which is essential for the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA. CPSF2 interacts with several other proteins within the CPSF complex to facilitate mRNA processing. It forms interactions with CPSF160 and WDR33 through a segment called the polyadenylation specificity factor interaction motif (PIM) located near its C-terminus. This interaction is crucial for bridging the cleavage subunits with the polyadenylation signal (PAS)-recognizing subunits, suggesting a structural role in the assembly and function of the CPSF complex (Liu2024Modulation).

CPSF2 also interacts with CPSF73, another component of the CPSF complex, which is involved in the endonucleolytic cleavage of pre-mRNA. This interaction is part of the cleavage factor (CF) subcomplex, which includes CPSF73, CPSF100, and Symplekin, responsible for the endonucleolytic cleavage necessary for mRNA maturation (Liu2024Modulation). These interactions highlight CPSF2's role in ensuring the proper positioning and function of other subunits within the CPSF complex, facilitating effective mRNA processing.
