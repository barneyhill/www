# SFMBT1

## Overview
Scm like with four mbt domains 1 (SFMBT1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. The protein, also referred to as SFMBT1, is characterized by the presence of multiple malignant brain tumor (MBT) domains, which facilitate its role in chromatin regulation by binding to histone tails. SFMBT1 forms part of the SLC complex with LSD1 and CoREST, contributing to chromatin compaction and the repression of gene expression. This protein is particularly significant in the regulation of replication-dependent histone genes and is dynamically regulated throughout the cell cycle. SFMBT1's involvement in chromatin structure and gene transcription is crucial for maintaining cellular identity and function. It has been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where it plays a role in tumor progression and drug resistance (Pan2022SFMBT1; Zhang2013SFMBT1).

## Structure
SFMBT1 is a protein characterized by the presence of multiple MBT (malignant brain tumor) domains, which are crucial for its function in chromatin regulation. These domains are known for binding to histone tails, although SFMBT1 does not associate with specific histone lysine modifications in vitro (Zhang2013SFMBT1). The protein contains four MBT domains at the N terminus and an SPM domain at the C terminus, sharing domain architecture with its Drosophila counterpart (Zhang2013SFMBT1). The MBT domains of SFMBT1 serve as docking modules, potentially binding to H3K4me2, to tether the SLC complex to genomic targets (Zhang2013SFMBT1).

SFMBT1 forms a stable complex with LSD1 and CoREST, known as the SLC complex, which is involved in chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression (Zhang2013SFMBT1). The protein's repressive function is linked to changes in chromatin accessibility, as demonstrated by nuclease digestion assays (Zhang2013SFMBT1). SFMBT1 is also associated with other proteins, such as CASZ1, reminiscent of the Drosophila PhoRC complex (Zhang2013SFMBT1). The specific molecular structure of SFMBT1 is not detailed in the context, but its functional associations and roles in chromatin regulation are emphasized.

## Function
SFMBT1 is a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression in healthy human cells. It forms a stable complex with LSD1 and CoREST, known as the SLC complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by influencing chromatin structure. SFMBT1 contains MBT domains that bind to histone tails, facilitating chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression, particularly of replication-dependent histone genes (Zhang2013SFMBT1). This complex is dynamically regulated during the cell cycle, with its activity correlating with the loss of RNA polymerase II at target promoters during G2, M, and G1 phases, ensuring timely transcriptional control of histone genes (Zhang2013SFMBT1).

SFMBT1 is also expressed in mouse germ cells, associating with meiotic chromosomes during spermatogenesis, indicating a stage-specific function in chromatin regulation (Zhang2013SFMBT1). The protein's role in chromatin structure and gene transcription is essential for maintaining cellular identity and function, as it modulates the recruitment of LSD1 and CoREST to chromatin, contributing to the formation of a repressive chromatin configuration (Zhang2013SFMBT1).

## Clinical Significance
SFMBT1 has been implicated in several cancers due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SFMBT1 is up-regulated in tumor tissues and cells, contributing to drug resistance and metastasis. It interacts with HMG20A, promoting CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is associated with resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Pan2022SFMBT1). 

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), SFMBT1 acts as an oncogenic driver, particularly in cases with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) loss. It is upregulated in ccRCC tumors, promoting tumor growth and proliferation. SFMBT1 regulates gene expression by binding to active gene promoters and is involved in a distinct regulatory pathway independent of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) (Liu2020Genomewide). 

SFMBT1 has also been identified as a susceptibility gene for CRC through multi-omics analysis, with higher expression levels linked to poorer prognosis. It is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, contributing to cancer metastasis (Yuan2021Multiomics). 

Additionally, SFMBT1 has been associated with hypertension, although its role in this condition is not fully understood (Yang2012Identification).

## Interactions
SFMBT1 is known to form a stable complex with LSD1 and CoREST, referred to as the SLC complex. This complex is involved in chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression, targeting genes including those encoding replication-dependent histones. The interaction between SFMBT1, LSD1, and CoREST is crucial for the regulation of histone genes and chromatin-related factors, with SFMBT1 playing a key role in recruiting LSD1 to specific genomic loci (Zhang2013SFMBT1).

SFMBT1 also interacts with histone tails, and its MBT domains are essential for binding to these tails and recruiting LSD1. Mutations in these domains can impair its ability to bind histone tails and recruit LSD1, affecting its role in transcriptional repression (Zhang2013SFMBT1).

In colorectal cancer, SFMBT1 interacts with HMG20A, forming a complex that promotes drug resistance and tumorigenesis. This interaction is significant in the context of resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Pan2022SFMBT1).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, SFMBT1 is regulated by prolyl hydroxylation, which affects its interaction with the von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) protein. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of SFMBT1, impacting its stability and function in cancer progression (Liu2020Genomewide).
