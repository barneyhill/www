# EOLA2

## Overview
EOLA2, or endothelium and lymphocyte associated ASCH domain 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly within the endothelium and lymphocytes. The protein is categorized as a regulatory protein, playing a significant role in cell signaling and regulation, which may impact immune responses and vascular functions. Notably, EOLA2 has been identified as a gene that can variably escape X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), a process that typically silences one of the two X chromosomes in females. This escape from XCI suggests that EOLA2 may contribute to sex-specific differences in gene expression, potentially influencing the development and progression of sex-biased diseases (Sauteraud2021Inferring). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Function
EOLA2, or endothelium and lymphocyte associated ASCH domain 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes related to the endothelium and lymphocytes. The protein is associated with molecular activities such as cell signaling and regulation, potentially influencing immune responses and vascular functions. It plays a role in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis by being active in specific cellular compartments. The study by Sauteraud et al. identified EOLA2 as one of the genes that variably escape X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), which was previously classified as strictly X-inactivated. This suggests that EOLA2 may have a role in differential gene expression between sexes, contributing to the understanding of sex-biased diseases (Sauteraud2021Inferring). The ability of EOLA2 to variably escape XCI indicates its potential involvement in inter-individual variability in X-linked gene expression, which could have implications for its function in healthy human cells (Sauteraud2021Inferring). However, specific details about the molecular processes and cellular locations where EOLA2 is active in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed in the available literature.
