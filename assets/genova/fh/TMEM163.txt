# TMEM163

## Overview
TMEM163 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 163, a zinc efflux transporter involved in maintaining zinc homeostasis within human cells. This protein is categorized as a member of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family and is part of the solute carrier 30 (SLC30) family, specifically designated as ZnT11. TMEM163 is characterized by its six transmembrane domains and is known to form functional homodimers. It is primarily localized in the plasma membrane, lysosomes, and other vesicular compartments, where it facilitates the extrusion of zinc and other divalent cations such as nickel and copper. The protein's role in zinc transport is crucial for various cellular functions, including enzyme activity, protein structural integrity, and cell signaling pathways. TMEM163 is expressed in multiple human tissues, with significant levels in the lungs, brain, and testis, underscoring its importance in diverse physiological processes (Sanchez2019Transmembrane; Styrpejko2021Transmembrane).

## Structure
TMEM163 is a zinc efflux transporter protein with a molecular weight of 31.5 kDa, also known as synaptic vesicle 31 (SV31). It is predicted to have six transmembrane domains (TMDs) with intracellular amino and carboxyl termini, forming a functional homodimer (Kiselyov2017The; Styrpejko2021Transmembrane). The protein's structure includes a DXXXD motif on its predicted TMD2, which is critical for zinc binding (Styrpejko2021Transmembrane). TMEM163 shares structural homology with other zinc transporters, such as ZnT3, and is suggested to belong to the SLC30 family of zinc efflux transporters (Salm2020TMEM163; Sanchez2019Transmembrane).

The protein contains several histidine residues proposed to mediate zinc binding and transport, although it lacks a histidine-rich region common to the ZnT protein family (Styrpejko2021Transmembrane). TMEM163 also has a putative di-Leucine motif at its N-terminus, which is similar to motifs found in other zinc transport proteins and is involved in membrane trafficking (Kiselyov2017The). Specific non-synonymous SNPs, such as S61R, S95C, S193P, and E286K, have been identified, which significantly reduce its zinc efflux activity (Sanchez2019Transmembrane). These SNPs may affect the protein's structure and function, with S193P showing mis-localization due to a proline substitution affecting the protein's alpha-helical structure (Sanchez2019Transmembrane).

## Function
TMEM163 is a transmembrane protein that functions as a zinc efflux transporter, playing a crucial role in maintaining zinc homeostasis in human cells. It is primarily localized in the plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, and other vesicular compartments, where it facilitates the extrusion of zinc from cells (Sanchez2019Transmembrane; Styrpejko2021Transmembrane). TMEM163 is a member of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family and is proposed to be part of the mammalian solute carrier 30 (SLC30) family, specifically designated as ZnT11 (Sanchez2019Transmembrane; Styrpejko2021Transmembrane).

The protein binds divalent cations such as zinc, nickel, and copper, with a stronger affinity for zinc and nickel, and forms functional homodimers (Styrpejko2021Transmembrane). TMEM163's role in zinc transport is essential for various cellular functions, including enzyme activity, protein structural integrity, and cell signaling pathways (Styrpejko2021Transmembrane). It is expressed in multiple human tissues, with high levels in the lungs, brain, and testis, indicating its importance in diverse physiological processes (Styrpejko2021Transmembrane). Understanding TMEM163's function is vital for maintaining cellular zinc levels and preventing zinc toxicity, which can lead to cellular dysfunction and disease (Sanchez2019Transmembrane).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM163 gene have been linked to several human diseases. Variants in TMEM163 are associated with hypomyelination leukodystrophy (HLD), a neurological disorder characterized by myelin deficits. Specific mutations, such as L76R and L76P, have been identified in patients with HLD, affecting zinc efflux and disrupting zinc homeostasis, which is crucial for myelination (Yan2022Functional).

TMEM163 has also been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have identified rare missense variants in TMEM163, such as p.33P>R, which are significantly associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) in certain populations. These findings suggest that TMEM163 may be a risk factor for PD, although a direct causal relationship has not been established (Li2021Mutation).

In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), TMEM163 is associated with zinc-regulated insulin storage and secretion. Variants in TMEM163 have been linked to altered insulin dynamics and glucose metabolism, potentially contributing to T2D pathophysiology. Knockdown studies in pancreatic beta cell models have shown that reduced TMEM163 expression leads to increased intracellular zinc and impaired insulin secretion (Chakraborty2020Role). These associations highlight the clinical significance of TMEM163 in various diseases.

## Interactions
TMEM163, a zinc efflux transporter, is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with TRPML1, a nonselective cation channel located in lysosomes. This interaction is crucial for maintaining zinc homeostasis and is particularly relevant in the context of Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by zinc accumulation in lysosomes (Kiselyov2017The; Styrpejko2021Transmembrane).

TMEM163 also modulates the activity of ATP-gated P2X receptors, specifically P2X3 and P2X4 receptors. It enhances ATP-evoked currents and calcium responses in cells expressing these receptors, suggesting a role in pain signaling pathways. This modulation appears to be independent of its zinc transporter activity, as co-injection with ZnT3 does not enhance ATP-evoked currents (Salm2020TMEM163).

Additionally, TMEM163 interacts with ZnT4, another zinc transporter, suggesting a role in zinc homeostasis through potential heterodimer formation. This interaction may lead to distinct functions compared to their homodimers, although further research is needed to fully understand these interactions (Kiselyov2017The).
