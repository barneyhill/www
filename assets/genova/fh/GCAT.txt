# GCAT

## Overview
The GCAT gene encodes the enzyme glycine C-acetyltransferase, a mitochondrial enzyme that is pivotal in the glycine cleavage system. This enzyme is classified as a transferase, specifically involved in the catabolism of glycine, where it facilitates the conversion of glycine into acetyl-CoA and ammonia. These products are crucial for cellular energy production and metabolic processes. The activity of GCAT is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis, with its expression levels influencing mitochondrial respiration and translation. Notably, the regulation of GCAT is linked to age-related changes in mitochondrial function, highlighting its importance in cellular aging and metabolic regulation (Hashizume2015Epigenetic).

## Function
The GCAT gene encodes the enzyme glycine C-acetyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function by participating in the glycine cleavage system. This enzyme is involved in the catabolism of glycine, converting it into acetyl-CoA and ammonia, which are essential for energy production and metabolic processes within the cell. In healthy human cells, GCAT is primarily active in the mitochondria, contributing to cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Hashizume2015Epigenetic).

GCAT is integral to mitochondrial respiration, as it is involved in glycine production, which is necessary for maintaining proper mitochondrial function and respiration. The gene's activity is linked to mitochondrial translation and respiration, with its downregulation associated with age-related defects in these processes. In fetal fibroblast cells, downregulation of GCAT leads to reduced mitochondrial respiratory function, while upregulation in elderly fibroblast cells can restore this function. This suggests that GCAT is vital for sustaining mitochondrial health and that its epigenetic regulation plays a significant role in age-associated mitochondrial respiration defects (Hashizume2015Epigenetic).
