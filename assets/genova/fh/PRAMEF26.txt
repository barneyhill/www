# PRAMEF26

## Overview
PRAMEF26, or Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma Family Member 26, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and immune response modulation. The PRAMEF26 protein is implicated in the regulation of gene expression and may play a role in oncogenic pathways, although its specific functions and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Research into PRAMEF26 is ongoing, with studies focusing on its potential involvement in cancer biology and its utility as a biomarker for certain malignancies (Qiu2020aarFDC).
