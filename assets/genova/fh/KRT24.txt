# KRT24

## Overview
KRT24 is a gene that encodes keratin 24, a type I intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in epithelial cells. Keratin 24 is integral to the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues, particularly in the epidermis and corneal epithelium. As a member of the keratin family, it forms heterodimers with type II keratins, contributing to the formation of intermediate filaments that support cellular architecture. The protein is involved in cellular processes such as differentiation, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, with its expression being crucial for the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. KRT24 has also been studied for its potential implications in colorectal cancer predisposition, although its role in cancer remains to be fully elucidated (Quintana2022Potential; Ehrlich2019Comparative; Min2017Role).

## Structure
Keratin 24 (KRT24) is a type I intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in epithelial cells. Its primary structure consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This configuration is typical of keratin proteins, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil motifs that are characteristic of its secondary structure. These motifs enable the protein to assemble into a filamentous network, contributing to the cytoskeletal framework of epithelial cells (Min2017Role).

The tertiary structure of KRT24 involves the organization of these coiled-coil motifs into a stable filamentous network, which is essential for maintaining cell integrity and resilience. In terms of quaternary structure, KRT24 forms heterodimers with type II keratins, a common feature among keratin proteins that allows for the formation of intermediate filaments (Ehrlich2019Comparative).

Post-translational modifications of KRT24, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, may influence its filament assembly and functional properties, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively documented in the provided context. These modifications are known to play roles in regulating the dynamics and interactions of keratin filaments within the cell (Min2017Role).

## Function
Keratin 24 (KRT24) is a type I keratin protein that plays a significant role in the differentiation and function of human epidermal keratinocytes. It is primarily localized in the upper stratum spinosum of the epidermis and is essential for terminal differentiation, particularly upon calcium-induced differentiation. Overexpression of KRT24 in keratinocytes leads to changes in differentiation, inhibits cell survival by causing G1/S phase cell cycle arrest, and induces senescence, autophagy, and apoptosis. KRT24 also activates the PKCδ signaling pathway, which is involved in cellular survival (Min2017Role).

KRT24 is predominantly expressed in the corneal epithelium, particularly in terminally differentiated cells on the surface. It contributes to the cytoskeleton of stratified squamous epithelia that do not form a cornified layer. Although KRT24 is not indispensable for cytoskeleton formation in corneal epithelial cells, its expression suggests it may add new components to the cytoskeleton in terminally differentiating cells, modifying its properties (Ehrlich2019Comparative).

In the epidermis, KRT24 overexpression results in a differentiated keratinocyte phenotype, characterized by reduced proliferation and adhesion, low expression of K14, and increased expression of differentiation markers like K1, loricrin, and involucrin (Min2017Role).

## Clinical Significance
The KRT24 gene has been investigated for its potential role in genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer (CRC). Several variants of KRT24 have been identified in patients with CRC and other cancers. Notably, a stop-gain variant, c.130C>T (p.R44*), was found in a patient with CRC who had a family history of various tumors. Additionally, predicted-pathogenic missense variants, such as c.449G>A (p.R150H) and c.1096C>T (p.R366C), have been identified in patients with CRC and other cancers, including ovarian and endometrial cancer (Quintana2022Potential).

The study by Quintana et al. found that disruptive variants in KRT24 were enriched in CRC patients compared to controls, although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Overexpression of KRT24 has been observed in the normal mucosa of early-onset MMR-proficient CRC patients, suggesting a potential role in CRC predisposition (Quintana2022Potential). However, no direct association with cancer predisposition has been conclusively established, and further validation is needed to confirm its clinical significance (Quintana2022Potential).

Overall, while KRT24 may not have a direct tumor suppressor or oncogenic role, its expression changes could be relevant in the context of CRC, particularly in early-onset cases (Quintana2022Potential).
