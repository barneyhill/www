# VN1R4

## Overview
VN1R4 is a gene that encodes the vomeronasal 1 receptor 4, a type of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the detection of specific volatile compounds. This receptor is part of the vomeronasal type-1 receptor family, which is primarily associated with pheromone detection in many vertebrates. However, in humans, the vomeronasal organ is largely considered vestigial, and the role of VN1R4 is not fully understood. The protein encoded by VN1R4 is expressed in various tissues, including the testis and cervix, and is involved in olfactory signaling pathways, particularly through the activation of cAMP signaling via G proteins Gαolf and Gαs (Shirokova2007The; precone2020pheromone). Despite its unclear biological significance in humans, VN1R4 shares functional similarities with olfactory receptors, suggesting a potential role in odorant detection rather than pheromone signaling (Shirokova2007The).

## Function
VN1R4, a member of the vomeronasal type-1 receptor family, is involved in the detection of volatile compounds, particularly long-chain aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols. These receptors are expressed in HeLa/Olf cells, a model system for studying olfactory signaling, and are activated by specific odorants such as α-hexyl-cinnamic aldehyde and methyl cinnamate (Shirokova2007The). VN1R4 activates cAMP signaling pathways via G proteins αolf/αs, which is distinct from the signaling pathways observed in mouse vomeronasal receptors that typically involve Gαi proteins (Shirokova2007The).

The biological significance of VN1R4 in humans remains unclear, as no definitive human pheromones have been identified, and the vomeronasal organ is considered vestigial in humans (Shirokova2007The). Despite this, VN1R4 shares functional characteristics with olfactory receptors, suggesting a potential role in olfactory signaling rather than pheromone detection (Shirokova2007The). VN1R4 is expressed in various tissues, including the testis and cervix, indicating possible non-olfactory functions (precone2020pheromone). However, the specific function of VN1R4 in healthy human cells is not well-documented, and it may represent a relic of pseudogenization (Shirokova2007The).

## Interactions
VN1R4, a human vomeronasal type-1 receptor, is involved in specific signaling pathways through its interactions with G proteins. When expressed in HeLa/Olf cells, VN1R4 activates the cAMP signaling pathway via G proteins Gαolf and Gαs. This activation is evidenced by odorant-induced [35S]GTPγS binding and cAMP production, which are PTX-insensitive, indicating a specific coupling with these G proteins (Shirokova2007The). VN1R4 responds differentially to a limited set of volatiles, particularly aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols, suggesting a role in combinatorial odorant detection similar to olfactory receptors (Shirokova2007The).

The receptor's interaction with the cAMP signaling pathway involves components such as adenylyl cyclase type-III (AC-III) and the Ca2+-permeable cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 2 (CNGA2), which are crucial for transducing odorant signals (Shirokova2007The). These interactions highlight VN1R4's potential role in odorant signal transduction, although its physiological significance in humans remains unclear due to the lack of functional TRPC2 and the low number of VN1R genes, suggesting possible pseudogenisation (Shirokova2007The).
