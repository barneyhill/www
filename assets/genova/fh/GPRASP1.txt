# GPRASP1

## Overview
GPRASP1, or G protein-coupled receptor associated sorting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The protein, also referred to as GASP-1, is a member of the GPRASP/ARMCX family and plays a crucial role in the post-endocytic sorting and lysosomal degradation of GPCRs, thereby modulating receptor availability and cellular signaling pathways. Structurally, GASP-1 is characterized by the presence of armadillo-like repeats and GASP motifs, which facilitate its interaction with the cytoplasmic tails of various GPCRs, such as the delta-opioid receptor (Kaeffer2021GPRASPARMCX; Simonin2004Identification). These interactions are essential for the protein's function in mediating receptor trafficking and degradation, impacting processes such as neurotransmission and cellular response to external stimuli (ZederLutz2023Characterization; Du2024The). GPRASP1 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Kang2021Genetic; Du2024The).

## Structure
GPRASP1 is a protein that is part of the GPRASP/ARMCX family, characterized by its involvement in the sorting and regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The primary structure of GPRASP1 consists of 1395 amino acids, divided into three main regions: the amino-terminal (N-ter) residues 1-379, the middle region (GASP1-middle) residues 380-1073, and the carboxyl-terminal (C-ter) residues 1074-1395 (Kaeffer2021GPRASPARMCX). The C-ter domain contains armadillo-like repeats, which are involved in cellular processes such as vesicular transport and molecular signaling (Kaeffer2021GPRASPARMCX).

The central region of GPRASP1 is rich in GASP motifs, which are sequences of 21 residues with a hydrophobic core surrounded by acidic residues. These motifs are crucial for the protein's interaction with GPCRs (ZederLutz2023Characterization). GPRASP1 contains 22 GASP motifs, which are essential for its function in mediating interactions with GPCRs (Bornert2013Identification).

GPRASP1 is known to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of various GPCRs, including the delta-opioid receptor (DOR), through its C-terminal domain (Simonin2004Identification). The protein also interacts with other proteins involved in GPCR sorting, such as Beclin2, indicating its role in post-endocytic sorting (Kaeffer2021GPRASPARMCX).

## Function
GPRASP1 encodes the G-protein coupled receptor-associated sorting protein 1 (GASP-1), which plays a critical role in the regulation and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) within cells. GASP-1 is involved in the lysosomal sorting and functional down-regulation of various GPCRs, regulating their sorting process after endocytosis. This process involves the activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways through the G protein pathway. After GPCRs receive external stimulation, they are phosphorylated and uncoupled from the G protein, then transmitted to sorted endosomes for endocytosis. GPCRs can either be recycled to the cell membrane to function again or enter the degradation pathway through phosphorylation or ubiquitination by GASP-1. This protein mediates the degradation of receptors into lysosomes and regulates the number of functional GPCRs, thus controlling external signals that activate intracellular signaling pathways (Du2024The).

GASP-1 contains GASP motifs, which are necessary for its interaction with several GPCRs. These motifs are located in the central part of the protein, which is considered an intrinsically disordered region. The central domain of GPRASP1, containing 19 GASP motifs, plays a significant role in mediating these interactions (ZederLutz2023Characterization). In healthy cells, GASP-1 is crucial for maintaining the balance of GPCR activity and ensuring proper signal transduction (Du2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPRASP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, GPRASP1 is associated with tumorigenesis, as its overexpression has been detected in several cancers, including breast, brain, and pancreatic cancers. It is considered a potential tumor marker due to its high expression levels in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues (Du2024The). In papillary thyroid cancer, mutations in GPRASP1 have been identified, suggesting a role in the disease's progression and as potential therapeutic targets (Fang2018The).

GPRASP1 is also linked to neurological and psychiatric conditions. It regulates GPCRs involved in cholinergic neurotransmission, which is crucial for learning and memory, and its dysfunction is implicated in neurological diseases (Du2024The). Genetic variants in GPRASP1 have been associated with depressive disorders, particularly those with an earlier age at onset, indicating its role in mood regulation and cognitive function (Kang2021Genetic).

Additionally, GPRASP1 mutations may contribute to the pathogenesis of arteriovenous malformations, a congenital vascular disease, by affecting angiogenic factors and cellular functions related to angiogenesis (Du2024The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GPRASP1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
GPRASP1, or G protein-coupled receptor associated sorting protein 1, is involved in the regulation and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It interacts with various GPCRs, including delta-opioid, muscarinic M1, and beta-adrenergic ADRB1 receptors, through its GASP motifs, which are crucial for these interactions (ZederLutz2023Characterization). The central domain of GPRASP1, containing 19 GASP motifs, has been shown to interact with the C-tails of these receptors, indicating the importance of these motifs in protein-protein interactions (ZederLutz2023Characterization).

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) measurements have demonstrated that the central domain of GPRASP1 interacts with full-length ADRB2 and cannabinoid type 2 CNR2 receptors with an apparent affinity of 10 to 100 nM (ZederLutz2023Characterization). The interaction between GPRASP1 and these receptors can be inhibited by a small peptide encoding a GASP motif from GPRASP2, highlighting the specificity of these interactions (ZederLutz2023Characterization).

GPRASP1 also plays a role in the endolysosomal degradation of GPCRs. It associates with early endosomes containing internalized GPCRs, facilitating the recruitment of the ATG14-containing BECN2-mediated PtdIns3K complex, which promotes trafficking to lysosomes for degradation (Qiu2023The). The BECN2-ATG14 interaction is selectively critical for the degradation of GPRASP1-associated GPCRs, such as DRD2 (Qiu2023The).
