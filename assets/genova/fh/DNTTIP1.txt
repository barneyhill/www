# DNTTIP1

## Overview
DNTTIP1, or deoxynucleotidyltransferase terminal interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions primarily as a scaffolding protein within the mitotic deacetylase complex (MiDAC). This protein plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling by facilitating the assembly and recruitment of the MiDAC complex to nucleosomes, thereby regulating histone acetylation marks such as H4K20ac and H3K27ac. These modifications are crucial for gene expression regulation, impacting processes like neurodevelopment, cell cycle progression, and chromosomal alignment during mitosis (Turnbull2020The; Mondal2020The). DNTTIP1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic stability and influencing transcriptional repression (Wilhelm2023Mitotic). Its interactions with other proteins, such as MIDEAS and NAT10, further underscore its role in complex cellular processes, including HIV transcription and tumorigenesis (Zhu2022DNTTIP1; Wilhelm2024Mitotic).

## Structure


## Function
DNTTIP1 is a component of the MiDAC complex, a histone deacetylase complex that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by modulating histone acetylation marks such as H4K20ac and H3K27ac. This regulation is essential for processes like neurodevelopment and cell cycle progression (Mondal2020The). DNTTIP1 acts as a scaffolding protein within the MiDAC complex, facilitating its assembly and recruitment to nucleosomes, which is vital for the complex's function in deacetylating histones and regulating chromatin structure (Turnbull2020The; Mondal2020The).

In healthy cells, DNTTIP1 is involved in cell cycle regulation and chromosomal alignment, particularly during mitosis. It is co-dependent with MIDEAS, another component of the MiDAC complex, for proper chromosomal alignment and cell division (Turnbull2020The). The absence of DNTTIP1 leads to increased histone acetylation and altered gene expression, indicating its role as a transcriptional repressor (Wang2022The; Turnbull2020The).

DNTTIP1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and maintains genomic stability, contributing to essential developmental processes and cellular functions (Turnbull2020The; Wilhelm2023Mitotic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interactions of the DNTTIP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, DNTTIP1 is considered oncogenic in various types, including oral cancer and non-small cell lung cancers. Its role in the MiDAC complex, which is crucial for chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, suggests that disruptions in DNTTIP1 function can contribute to tumorigenesis (Turnbull2020The).

DNTTIP1 is also involved in the regulation of HIV transcription. It interacts with the HIV core promoter, influencing both basal and Tat-activated transcription. Mutations or alterations in DNTTIP1 expression can significantly impact HIV gene expression and latency, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at controlling HIV transcription and reactivation (Wilhelm2024Mitotic).

In embryonic development, the absence of DNTTIP1 leads to severe phenotypes, such as heart malformation and hematopoietic failure, resulting in embryonic death. This highlights its essential role in developmental processes, where its dysfunction can lead to critical developmental defects (Turnbull2020The). Additionally, DNTTIP1 has been suggested as a gene of interest in Alzheimer's disease pathways, particularly in individuals carrying the APOE ɛ2 allele, although its specific role in this context requires further investigation (Jun2020Protein).

## Interactions
DNTTIP1 is a component of the mitotic deacetylase complex (MiDAC), where it plays a crucial role in interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It directly binds to the HIV core promoter, specifically recognizing the TASHET DNA sequence, which is essential for HIV transcription. This interaction is mediated through its AT-hook and helix-turn-helix (HTH) domains, allowing DNTTIP1 to bind to AT-rich motifs and specific sequences like 5'-GNTGCATG-3' (Wilhelm2024Mitotic).

DNTTIP1 interacts with other MiDAC components, such as MIDEAS and NAT10. The interaction with MIDEAS is facilitated by the ELM/SANT domain of MIDEAS, while DNTTIP1 recruits NAT10 to the HIV core promoter, where NAT10 can bind to HIV Tat to activate transcription (Wilhelm2024Mitotic). DNTTIP1 also forms part of a complex with HDAC1 and HDAC2, contributing to the structural integrity and function of MiDAC (Turnbull2020The).

In addition to its role in HIV transcription, DNTTIP1 is involved in the regulation of gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma by interacting with HDAC1 to control the acetylation status of p53, influencing cell cycle arrest and tumor cell migration (Zhu2022DNTTIP1).
