# TRIM37

## Overview
The TRIM37 gene encodes the tripartite motif containing 37 protein, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal RING finger domain, a B-box domain, and an α-helical coiled-coil region, which are essential for its role in protein-protein interactions and the ubiquitination process (Wang2017TRIM37; Hämäläinen2004Novel). TRIM37 is primarily localized to peroxisomes, where it plays a critical role in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins by monoubiquitylating the peroxisomal targeting signal receptor PEX5 (Wang2017TRIM37). Beyond its peroxisomal functions, TRIM37 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of centrosomal protein interactions and the modulation of tumor suppressor gene expression through histone ubiquitination (Bellaart2024TRIM37; Bhatnagar2014TRIM37). Mutations in the TRIM37 gene are linked to Mulibrey nanism, a disorder characterized by growth failure and organ anomalies, and have implications in reproductive health and cancer risk (Karlberg2011Testicular; Gu2023The).

## Structure
The TRIM37 protein is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It contains an N-terminal RING finger domain, a B-box domain, and an α-helical coiled-coil region, collectively forming the tripartite motif (TRIM or RBCC domain) (Hämäläinen2004Novel). These domains are crucial for protein-protein interactions and the ubiquitination process. The RING finger domain is particularly important for its E3 ligase activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins (Wang2017TRIM37).

TRIM37 also includes an internal TRAF domain and two DES (aspartate-glutamate-serine) rich sequences, which have weak homologies to transcriptional regulators (Hämäläinen2004Novel). The protein localizes to peroxisomes, and mutations affecting its domains can alter its subcellular localization and function (Hämäläinen2004Novel). The protein's role in ubiquitination is further highlighted by its ability to monoubiquitylate PEX5, a process dependent on the integrity of its RING domain (Wang2017TRIM37).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of TRIM37 are not provided, its structural motifs and domains are integral to its function in cellular processes such as protein degradation and gene expression regulation.

## Function
The TRIM37 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins in human cells. It is involved in the ubiquitylation of PEX5, a peroxisomal targeting signal receptor necessary for the import of proteins into peroxisomes. TRIM37 specifically monoubiquitylates PEX5 at lysine 464, which stabilizes PEX5 and enhances its ability to bind cargo proteins, thereby promoting the import of peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS) proteins. This process is essential for maintaining functional peroxisomes, which are important for various metabolic pathways, including the β-oxidation of fatty acids and the management of reactive oxygen species (Wang2017TRIM37).

TRIM37 is localized to peroxisomal membranes and is resistant to alkaline carbonate extraction, indicating its role as an integral membrane protein. It is partially localized to peroxisomes, with about 40% of it present in the peroxisome fraction. Protease protection assays have confirmed that TRIM37 is a peroxisomal membrane protein with both N and C termini facing the cytosol (Wang2017TRIM37). In healthy human cells, TRIM37's role in stabilizing PEX5 and facilitating PTS protein import is crucial for normal cellular function and protection against oxidative stress (Wang2017TRIM37).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRIM37 gene are primarily associated with Mulibrey nanism, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe growth failure, dysmorphic facial features, and organ anomalies such as constrictive pericarditis and cardiomyopathy. Patients with Mulibrey nanism often experience severe respiratory infections due to impaired immune responses, as TRIM37 mutations disrupt the differentiation of follicular helper T (T_FH) cells, which are crucial for high-affinity antibody production (Gazzin2023Mulibrey; Gu2023The).

TRIM37 mutations also lead to reproductive issues, including testicular failure and male infertility, characterized by small testes and hormonal imbalances in males, and primary ovarian failure in females (Karlberg2011Testicular). The gene's role in ubiquitination processes is linked to various cellular dysfunctions, contributing to conditions such as insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and increased cancer risk, particularly gynecological tumors (Brigant2018TRIMming).

Alterations in TRIM37 expression are associated with immune system dysfunctions, including hypogammaglobulinemia and impaired antibody responses, leading to increased susceptibility to infections (Gazzin2023Mulibrey). The gene's interaction with the NF-κB signaling pathway and mTOR suggests its involvement in inflammation and autophagy, impacting conditions like obesity and asthma (Brigant2018TRIMming).

## Interactions
TRIM37 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It interacts with the centrosomal protein centrobin through its unique TRAF domain, recognizing specific peptide motifs within centrobin. This interaction is essential for preventing the formation of centrobin condensates, which could lead to ectopic spindle pole assembly (Bellaart2024TRIM37). TRIM37 also forms oligomers through its RING-RING interface, which is crucial for its function as a ubiquitin ligase (Bellaart2024TRIM37).

In breast cancer, TRIM37 interacts with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), specifically with subunits EZH2 and SUZ12, contributing to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes through histone H2A ubiquitination (Bhatnagar2014TRIM37). It also interacts with PEX5, a peroxisomal import receptor, ubiquitylating it to facilitate peroxisomal matrix protein import (Wang2017TRIM37).

TRIM37's interaction with TGF-β1 signaling in renal cell carcinoma involves histone H2A ubiquitination, affecting the transcriptional activity of tumor suppressor genes like PTEN and TP53 (Miao2021TRIM37). These interactions highlight TRIM37's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its implications in disease contexts.
