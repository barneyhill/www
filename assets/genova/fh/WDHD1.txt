# WDHD1

## Overview
WDHD1, or WD repeat and HMG-box DNA binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA replication, cell proliferation, and genomic integrity maintenance. The protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 and high mobility group box (HMG) domains, which facilitate its role in chromatin assembly and interaction with other proteins within the replisome progression complex (RPC) (Cui2023Integrative). WDHD1 is essential for the proper initiation and progression of DNA replication, as it stabilizes DNA polymerase α and aids in the assembly of the MCM2-7 complex at replication origins (Cui2023Integrative). Beyond its fundamental role in normal cellular function, WDHD1 is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression and interactions contribute to tumor progression and resistance to therapies (Zhang2023WD). As such, WDHD1 is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in oncology.

## Function
The WDHD1 gene encodes a DNA-binding protein that is integral to DNA replication and cell proliferation in healthy human cells. It is a component of the replisome progression complex (RPC) and interacts with DNA polymerase α, which is crucial for initiating DNA replication. WDHD1 contains several functional domains, including the WD40 domain, which is important for cell proliferation and genome integrity, and the high mobility group box (HMB) domain, which is involved in chromatin assembly and DNA replication (Cui2023Integrative).

WDHD1 plays a significant role in maintaining genomic integrity by modulating DNA damage repair and telomere replication. Its depletion can impede cell proliferation by causing delays in cell cycle progression, particularly from the late S phase to G2. WDHD1 is also involved in G1 checkpoint control, highlighting its essential role in normal cellular processes (Cui2023Integrative).

In the context of DNA replication, WDHD1 is crucial for the assembly of the MCM2-7 complex at the replication region during late mitosis and the early G1 phase. It maintains the stability of polymerase α and facilitates its loading at replication origins, ensuring accurate DNA replication and precise cell division (Cui2023Integrative).

## Clinical Significance
The WDHD1 gene is significantly implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression and interactions contributing to disease progression. Increased expression of WDHD1 is observed in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, esophageal carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and more, where it influences tumor occurrence and survival through pathways such as PI3K/AKT (Zhang2023WD). In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, WDHD1 is associated with a 10% amplification mutation frequency, promoting DNA replication and repair, which contributes to chemotherapy resistance (Zhang2023WD). In cervical cancer, WDHD1 expression is linked to HPV E7-induced cancer initiation and lymph node metastasis (Zhang2023WD).

WDHD1 also plays a role in cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinoma and ovarian cancer, where its phosphorylation by ATR enhances therapeutic outcomes in platinum-resistant cases (Zhang2023WD). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), inhibition of WDHD1 affects leukemic cell proliferation and survival, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2023WD). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, WDHD1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for poor outcomes, correlating with shorter tumor-specific survival (Sato2010Activation). High WDHD1 expression is also associated with poor survival outcomes in non-small-cell lung cancer and breast cancer (Cui2023Integrative).

## Interactions
WDHD1, also known as WD repeat and HMG-box DNA binding protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with MAPRE2, a microtubule-associated protein, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which contributes to cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cells (Gong2020WDHD1). This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays, indicating that WDHD1 and MAPRE2 interact in the nucleus (Gong2020WDHD1).

WDHD1 also associates with Dicer, a protein involved in RNA processing, and this interaction is crucial for the stable association of Dicer with centromeric RNA transcripts. This interaction is independent of RNA, suggesting a direct protein-protein interaction (Hsieh2011WDHD1). WDHD1's role in centromeric silencing is further supported by its interaction with centromeric RNA and its involvement in maintaining centromeric epigenetic markers (Hsieh2011WDHD1).

In the context of HPV E7 expressing cells, WDHD1 interacts with GCN5, a histone acetyltransferase, inhibiting its degradation and promoting cell cycle progression by activating Akt (Zhou2020WDHD1). These interactions highlight WDHD1's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
