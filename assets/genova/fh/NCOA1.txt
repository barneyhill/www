# NCOA1

## Overview
NCOA1, or nuclear receptor coactivator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a transcriptional coactivator. This protein is a member of the p160 steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family and is characterized by its ability to interact with nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors to enhance gene expression. NCOA1 contains several structural domains, including a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain and a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and transcriptional activation (Lodrini2008p160SRCNCoA; McInerney1998Determinants). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, such as metabolism, development, and reproduction, by modulating the transcriptional activity of steroid hormone receptors and other transcription factors (Spencer1997Steroid; Litterst2001Transcriptional). NCOA1's clinical significance is highlighted by its involvement in conditions such as obesity, mood disorders, and cancer, where alterations in its expression or function can have profound effects (Huang2016Novel; Sun2020Nuclear).

## Structure
NCOA1, also known as nuclear receptor coactivator 1, is a protein characterized by several distinct structural domains that facilitate its role in transcriptional activation. The protein contains a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain and a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, both of which are conserved regions involved in protein-protein interactions and dimerization (Lodrini2008p160SRCNCoA). The PAS-B domain of NCOA1 is particularly important for recognizing LXXLL motifs, which are crucial for interactions with nuclear receptors and other coactivators (Lodrini2008p160SRCNCoA).

The NCOA1 protein also includes multiple LXXLL motifs, which are helical domains that interact with nuclear receptors to facilitate gene transcription (McInerney1998Determinants). These motifs are essential for ligand-dependent activation of nuclear receptors, such as the estrogen receptor and retinoic acid receptor (Torchia1997The).

NCOA1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its activity and interactions. The protein also exists in different splice variant isoforms, which can result in distinct functional properties (Russo2017Insight). The structural analysis of NCOA1, particularly its PAS-B domain, has provided insights into its interaction with other proteins, such as STAT6, highlighting the importance of specific hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions in its function (Razeto2004Structure).

## Function
NCOA1, also known as Steroid Receptor Coactivator-1 (SRC-1), functions as a transcriptional coactivator for steroid hormone receptors, playing a crucial role in gene expression regulation. It possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which allows it to acetylate histones H3 and H4, facilitating chromatin remodeling and making DNA more accessible for transcription factors (Spencer1997Steroid). This activity is localized to its carboxy-terminal region and is essential for the transcriptional activation of genes regulated by steroid hormone receptors (Spencer1997Steroid).

NCOA1 interacts with other coactivators, such as p300/CBP and PCAF, to enhance the formation of a stable preinitiation complex, thereby increasing transcription from repressed chromatin templates (Spencer1997Steroid). It acts as a general coactivator for various steroid receptors, including the progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor, thyroid receptor, and retinoid X receptor, enhancing their transcriptional activity in the presence of their respective ligands (Oñate1995Sequence).

NCOA1 also plays a significant role in mediating transcriptional activation through its interaction with transcription factors like STAT6 and STAT5, which are involved in immune responses and milk production, respectively (Litterst2003NCoA1SRC1; Litterst2001Transcriptional). These interactions highlight NCOA1's importance in various cellular processes, including metabolism, development, and reproduction.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NCOA1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of energy homeostasis, NCOA1 is crucial for the antiobesogenic effects of 17β-estradiol. Studies on NCOA1 knockout mice have shown increased food intake and susceptibility to obesity due to impaired leptin signaling, highlighting its role in obesity (Sun2020Nuclear). NCOA1 also plays a significant role in mood regulation, with knockout mice displaying reduced anxiety-like behaviors and altered glucocorticoid signaling, which can lead to anxiety disorders (Sun2020Nuclear).

NCOA1 is involved in thyroid hormone signaling, and its knockout can result in elevated levels of TSH, T4, and T3, indicating potential thyroid dysfunction (Sun2020Nuclear). In cancer, NCOA1 is implicated in various sarcomas and neoplasms through gene fusions. For instance, the PAX3-NCOA1 fusion is associated with biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma and certain rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes, suggesting a role in tumor pathogenesis (Huang2016Novel; Wachtel2004Gene). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NCOA1 in metabolic, mood, and cancer-related disorders.

## Interactions
NCOA1, also known as nuclear receptor coactivator 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role as a transcriptional coactivator. NCOA1 interacts directly with the transactivation domain of STAT6, a transcription factor activated by interleukin-4 (IL-4). This interaction is essential for STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation, as NCOA1 recruits other coactivators like CBP and p300 to enhance transcription (Litterst2001Transcriptional). The PAS-B domain of NCOA1 specifically binds to the LXXLL motif of the STAT6 transactivation domain, a critical interaction for IL-4-induced transcriptional activation (Razeto2004Structure).

NCOA1 also forms complexes with other members of the p160 coactivator family, such as NCOA2 and NCOA3, through interactions involving the PAS-B domain and the CID/AD1 domain, which contains LXXLL motifs (Lodrini2008p160SRCNCoA). These interactions facilitate the formation of multiprotein coactivator complexes that are important for transcriptional regulation. NCOA1's interactions are not limited to STAT6, as it also interacts with various nuclear hormone receptors and transcription factors, including the progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor α, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression related to cancer progression (Singh2019Association).
