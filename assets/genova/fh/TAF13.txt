# TAF13

## Overview
TAF13 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 13, which is a crucial component of the TFIID complex involved in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The protein is characterized by its histone fold domains (HFDs) and a highly conserved C-terminal domain, which facilitate its interaction with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and the formation of a dimer with TAF11. This interaction is essential for the regulatory functions of the TFIID complex, influencing transcription initiation and cell growth by modulating TBP's binding to DNA (Gupta2017Architecture). TAF13's role extends to various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, cell growth, and differentiation, with significant implications in neurodevelopment and cancer pathogenesis (Di2008Involvement; Wong2022Mutations).

## Structure
TAF13 is a component of the TFIID complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. The primary structure of TAF13 includes a highly conserved C-terminal domain essential for its interaction with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) (Gupta2017Architecture). This domain is critical for the formation of the TAF11/TAF13/TBP complex and is conserved from yeast to humans, indicating its importance in maintaining cell viability (Gupta2017Architecture).

The secondary structure of TAF13 involves histone fold domains (HFDs), which form a dimer with TAF11. This dimerization is crucial for the interaction with TBP and the displacement of TATA-box containing DNA from the TBP/DNA complex (Gupta2017Architecture). The tertiary structure of TAF13, as part of the TAF11/TAF13 dimer, spans the concave DNA-binding groove of TBP, similar to the binding of TATA-box DNA (Gupta2017Architecture).

In terms of quaternary structure, TAF13 forms a ternary complex with TAF11 and TBP, which is essential for the regulatory functions of TFIID. This complex competes with TATA-box DNA and TAF1-TAND for TBP binding, suggesting a regulatory role in transcription (Gupta2017Architecture).

## Function
TAF13 is a component of the TFIID complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. Within the TFIID complex, TAF13 forms a dimeric complex with TAF11, which interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to regulate transcription initiation. This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the TFIID complex, as TAF13 helps modulate TBP's binding to DNA, thereby influencing transcription initiation and cell growth (Gupta2017Architecture).

TAF13 contains a highly conserved C-terminal domain that is essential for its interaction with TBP. This domain is critical for maintaining the integrity of the TAF11/TAF13/TBP complex and supporting cell viability. Mutations in this domain can impair the formation of the complex, affecting cell growth, particularly under non-permissive conditions (Gupta2017Architecture).

In human cells, TAF13 is involved in the assembly and function of the TFIID complex, which is active in the nucleus. It plays a role in regulating gene expression, impacting various cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation (Gupta2017Architecture).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TAF13 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting neurodevelopment. TAF13 mutations have been linked to mild intellectual disability, microcephaly, and severe growth retardation. These mutations disrupt the formation of a histone-like heterodimer with TAF11, leading to deregulation of gene expression, which is particularly detrimental to neuronal tissues (Wong2022Mutations). 

In the context of cancer, TAF13 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (NB). Studies have shown a significant reduction in TAF13 mRNA levels in NB samples compared to normal peripheral blood samples. This reduction is often associated with genomic deletions at the TAF13 locus, present in more than 60% of samples with diminished mRNA levels. These findings suggest that alterations in TAF13 expression may contribute to NB pathogenesis, although the exact clinical significance in other diseases remains to be fully elucidated (Di2008Involvement).

Overall, the clinical significance of TAF13 mutations and expression alterations highlights the gene's critical role in maintaining normal neurodevelopmental processes and its potential involvement in tumorigenesis.

## Interactions
TAF13 is a component of the TFIID complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. TAF13 forms a dimer with TAF11, and this dimer interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form a stable ternary complex. This interaction occurs at the concave DNA-binding surface of TBP, effectively displacing TATA-box containing DNA and suggesting a regulatory role in transcription initiation (Gupta2017Architecture). 

The TAF11/TAF13 dimer competes with TATA-DNA and the TAF1 N-terminal domain (TAND) for binding to TBP, indicating that these interactions are mutually exclusive and may serve as a regulatory mechanism to prevent premature DNA interactions (Gupta2017Architecture). TAF13's interaction with TBP is mediated by a highly conserved C-terminal domain, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the TFIID complex and supporting cell growth (Gupta2017Architecture).

TAF13 also interacts with other TAFs, such as TAF1, where it forms part of a larger assembly within the TFIID complex. The TAF11-TAF13 heterodimer consistently crosslinks with TAF1, highlighting its role in the structural organization of TFIID (Bernardini2023Hierarchical).
