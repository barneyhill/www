# PRIM1

## Overview
PRIM1 is a gene that encodes the DNA primase subunit 1, a critical component of the DNA primase enzyme complex involved in the initiation of DNA replication. The protein encoded by PRIM1, known as the small catalytic subunit of DNA primase, plays a pivotal role in synthesizing short RNA primers necessary for DNA polymerases to commence DNA synthesis. This protein forms a heterodimer with a larger regulatory subunit, PRIM2, to execute its function effectively. Structurally, the PRIM1 protein is characterized by a mixed α/β Prim fold and a zinc-binding motif, which are essential for its catalytic activity and structural integrity (Baranovskiy2015Crystal). The interaction between PRIM1 and PRIM2 is crucial for the stability and functionality of the primase complex, which is integral to the replication of the genome, particularly in the synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand (Kilkenny2013Structures). The clinical significance of PRIM1 is underscored by its association with genetic disorders and its role in cancer, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Parry2020PRIM1; Lee2018DNA).

## Structure
The human PRIM1 gene encodes the DNA primase subunit 1, which is a crucial component of the DNA primase enzyme complex involved in DNA replication. The protein structure of PRIM1 includes a small catalytic subunit known as p49, which forms a heterodimer with a larger regulatory subunit, p58 (Baranovskiy2015Crystal). The primary structure of PRIM1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a mixed α/β Prim fold, similar to archaeal primases, with a shallow cleft harboring the active site (Baranovskiy2015Crystal).

The secondary structure of PRIM1 includes a zinc-binding motif coordinated by four cysteines, which is crucial for the structural organization and positioning relative to the active site (Baranovskiy2015Crystal). The tertiary structure reveals a bulky all-helical extension composed of helices α7-α11, which stabilizes various regions and interacts with the p58 subunit (Baranovskiy2015Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, PRIM1 forms a heterodimeric complex with the p58 subunit, which is essential for its function in primer synthesis. The p58 subunit contains an iron-sulfur cluster important for structural stability and activity (Baranovskiy2015Crystal). The interaction between p49 and p58 involves a hydrophobic interface and several hydrogen bonds, which are conserved across different species (Baranovskiy2015Crystal).

## Function
PRIM1 encodes the small catalytic subunit of DNA primase, a crucial enzyme in DNA replication. In healthy human cells, PRIM1 functions as part of a heterodimer with the large regulatory subunit, PRIM2, to synthesize short RNA primers. These primers are essential for DNA polymerases to initiate DNA synthesis (Mullins2024A; Baranovskiy2016Insight). The catalytic activity of PRIM1 involves binding to the DNA template and two nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), followed by the synthesis of a dinucleotide, which is then extended to form the RNA primer (Baranovskiy2016Insight).

PRIM1 operates within the nucleus during the S phase of the cell cycle, ensuring accurate DNA replication and cell division, which is vital for maintaining genomic stability (Kilkenny2013Structures). The RNA primers synthesized by PRIM1 are optimal for extension by DNA polymerase alpha (Pol α), which is part of the primase-polymerase α (Prim-Polα) complex. This complex is essential for genome replication, as it synthesizes chimeric RNA-DNA primers for replicative DNA polymerases ε and δ (Baranovskiy2016Insight).

The interaction between PRIM1 and the regulatory subunit PRIM2 is crucial for the stability and function of the primase complex, with PRIM2 playing a role in substrate binding and primer length counting (Baranovskiy2015Crystal). This interaction is essential for the continuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand during DNA replication (Kilkenny2013Structures).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRIM1 gene are associated with a distinctive primordial dwarfism syndrome characterized by extreme growth failure, microcephaly, distinct facial features, and significant hematological and immune dysfunction, including hypo/agammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia. Affected individuals often experience chronic respiratory symptoms and hepatic dysfunction, with some dying in early childhood from infections (Parry2020PRIM1). Specific mutations, such as the homozygous intronic variant c.638+36C>G, activate a cryptic splice site, leading to missplicing and reduced PRIM1 protein levels, contributing to the disease phenotype (Parry2020PRIM1). 

In breast cancer, PRIM1 expression is implicated in estrogen-induced tumor formation. Elevated PRIM1 levels are associated with poorly differentiated tumors and are higher in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells. This overexpression correlates with poor survival rates in patients, suggesting that PRIM1 may be a target for therapeutic strategies (Lee2018DNA). The gene's role in the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint and its interaction with estrogen signaling pathways highlight its significance in cancer cell proliferation and viability (Lee2018DNA). 

These findings underscore the clinical importance of PRIM1 in both genetic disorders and cancer, emphasizing the need for further research into its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PRIM1, a subunit of the DNA primase enzyme, is integral to the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex, which is essential for initiating DNA replication. PRIM1 interacts with other subunits of this complex, including POLA1, POLA2, and PRIM2, to synthesize RNA primers necessary for DNA synthesis (He2021Structure). The interaction between PRIM1 and DNA polymerase alpha (Pol α) is facilitated by the PriL subunit of primase, which tethers primase to Pol α through a specific binding motif (Kilkenny2013Structures).

PRIM1 is also involved in the structural and functional dynamics of the human CST-pol-α/primase complex, which plays a role in telomere C-strand synthesis. This complex enhances the affinity of pol-α/primase to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) templates and stimulates its processivity. PRIM1 binds the 3' end of the ssDNA template, orienting its RNA catalytic face towards the template, which is crucial for de novo RNA primer synthesis (He2021Structure).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, PRIM1 interacts with UBE2C, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, to promote P53 ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction contributes to the aggressive behavior of HCC cells, including proliferation and drug resistance (Zhu2021DNA).
