# ZBTB41

## Overview
ZBTB41 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 41 protein, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of cancer biology. The BTB domain facilitates the formation of protein complexes, which are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. ZBTB41 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, such as cervical cancer and atypical meningioma, where it plays a role in tumor cell proliferation and migration. Its interactions with other proteins, such as TAF1A, and its regulation by microRNAs highlight its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Zhou2018Identification; Wang2020TAF1A).

## Clinical Significance
ZBTB41 has been implicated in various cancers, including cervical cancer and atypical meningioma. In cervical cancer, ZBTB41 is identified as a key gene, with its overexpression negatively associated with overall survival in patients. The gene is involved in tumor cell proliferation and migration, and its interaction with TAF1A is influenced by the p53 signaling pathway. Knockdown of ZBTB41 in HeLa cells has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cervical cancer (Wang2020TAF1A). 

In atypical meningioma, ZBTB41 is one of the significant genes identified with mutations, indicating its role in the genomic evolution of this type of tumor. The study highlights the complexity of meningioma development, with ZBTB41 being part of the divergent pathway network relations in atypical meningioma (Chowdhury2018Genomic).

Additionally, ZBTB41 is upregulated in cord blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells compared to peripheral blood-derived cells, suggesting a role in the distinct biological features of these cells, although the clinical significance of this finding is not detailed (Wang2020Identification).

## Interactions
ZBTB41 is involved in significant protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of cancer biology. It interacts with TAF1A, a relationship that is crucial in cervical cancer progression. This interaction is mediated through the BTB domain of ZBTB41, which facilitates the formation of a complex with TAF1A via hydrogen bonds and other interactions. The interaction between ZBTB41 and TAF1A is negatively associated with overall survival in cervical cancer patients and is influenced by the p53 signaling pathway. The presence of Pifithrin-α, a p53 pathway inhibitor, can weaken this interaction, suggesting a regulatory mechanism involving p53 (Wang2020TAF1A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, ZBTB41 is a target of several microRNAs, indicating its involvement in post-transcriptional regulation. It is upregulated in cancer tissues, suggesting a role in cancer cell proliferation and migration (Zhou2018Identification). These interactions highlight ZBTB41's potential as a marker for cancer pathogenesis and a target for therapeutic intervention.
