# RBP2

## Overview
Retinol-binding protein 2 (RBP2) is a gene that encodes a cytosolic protein belonging to the lipocalin superfamily, primarily expressed in the absorptive cells of the proximal small intestine. The protein, also referred to as RBP2, plays a critical role in the metabolism of dietary retinoids and monoacylglycerols (MAGs), including the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). It facilitates the uptake and conversion of retinoids into retinyl esters, which are essential for their incorporation into chylomicrons and subsequent absorption into the circulation (Napoli2020Retinoid; Blaner2020Retinolbinding). Additionally, RBP2's ability to bind MAGs influences gut endocrine signaling and systemic energy balance (Lee2020Retinolbinding). Beyond its metabolic functions, RBP2, also known as KDM5A, is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a histone demethylase, affecting tumorigenesis and metastasis (Cao2014Histone). This dual functionality underscores RBP2's importance in both physiological and pathological contexts.

## Structure
Retinol-binding protein 2 (RBP2) is a cytosolic protein primarily expressed in the absorptive cells of the proximal small intestine. It is a member of the lipocalin superfamily, characterized by its ability to bind small hydrophobic molecules. The primary structure of RBP2 consists of a polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 16 kDa, comprising 134 amino acids (Blaner2020Retinolbinding).

The secondary structure of RBP2 includes 8 to 10 antiparallel beta-strands that form a beta-barrel, a common motif in lipocalins. This beta-barrel creates a central hydrophobic cavity that serves as a versatile lipid-binding site (Blaner2020Retinolbinding). The tertiary structure is further defined by two short alpha-helices and hairpin turns that contribute to the portal region, facilitating ligand entry (Blaner2020Retinolbinding).

RBP2's binding pocket accommodates retinol and other ligands, with specific interactions involving hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Key residues such as Lys40 and Glu108 are involved in the binding of all-trans-retinol (Blaner2020Retinolbinding). The protein can also bind nonretinoid ligands like monoacylglycerols, indicating its role in lipid metabolism (Blaner2020Retinolbinding). There is no mention of quaternary structure or post-translational modifications in the provided context.

## Function
Retinol-binding protein 2 (RBP2) is a cytosolic protein primarily located in the absorptive cells of the proximal small intestine. It plays a crucial role in the uptake and metabolism of dietary retinoids, such as retinol and retinaldehyde, facilitating their conversion into retinyl esters for incorporation into chylomicrons, which are then absorbed into the circulation (Blaner2020Retinolbinding). RBP2 binds retinol with high affinity, directing it to the enzyme lecithin: retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) for esterification, which is essential for efficient dietary retinoid uptake (Napoli2020Retinoid).

In addition to its role in retinoid metabolism, RBP2 also binds monoacylglycerols (MAGs) with high affinity, including the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). This binding modulates MAG metabolism and influences gut endocrine signaling and systemic energy balance (Blaner2020Retinolbinding; Lee2020Retinolbinding). The absence of RBP2 leads to elevated levels of certain MAGs in the intestine, affecting enteroendocrine cell release of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which influences lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (Lee2020Retinolbinding).

RBP2's dual function in retinoid and MAG metabolism highlights its significant role in maintaining metabolic health and energy homeostasis in healthy human cells (Silvaroli2021Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
RBP2, also known as KDM5A, is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a histone demethylase. Alterations in RBP2 expression are associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis in several cancer types. In breast cancer, RBP2 is identified as an epigenetic driver of metastasis, particularly to the lungs, and is overexpressed in highly metastatic cell lines. Its expression is linked to increased metastasis in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cao2014Histone). In lung cancer, RBP2 is overexpressed and promotes tumorigenesis by enhancing cell proliferation and metastasis through the regulation of genes like cyclins D1 and E1, and integrin-b1 (ITGB1) (Teng2013Histone). RBP2 also plays a role in gastric cancer by promoting angiogenesis through the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression (Li2014Critical). In chronic myeloid leukemia, RBP2 is involved in the blast crisis phase, influencing leukemia cell differentiation and proliferation through interactions with the BCR-ABL pathway (Yin2019Histone). These findings highlight RBP2's significance in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Retinol-binding protein 2 (RBP2) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in retinoid metabolism. RBP2 binds retinol and retinaldehyde with high affinity, facilitating their absorption and conversion within enterocytes. This binding is essential for the formation of retinyl esters by lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), which are then packaged into chylomicrons for transport (Blaner2020Retinolbinding). 

RBP2 also interacts with monoacylglycerols (MAGs) and endocannabinoids, such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), with high affinity. This interaction is facilitated by a hydrogen bond network within its binding pocket, which contributes to its high affinity for these ligands (Blaner2020Retinolbinding; Lee2020Retinolbinding). The binding of MAGs to RBP2 is significant as it regulates intracellular concentrations of MAGs, potentially affecting their degradation, incorporation into lipids, or trafficking to receptors involved in signal transduction and energy homeostasis (Lee2020Retinolbinding).

RBP2's interactions with these ligands are distinct from other retinol-binding proteins due to its unique ability to bind 2-MAGs, attributed to a threonine residue at position 51, which is replaced by hydrophobic residues in other RBPs (Blaner2020Retinolbinding). These interactions highlight RBP2's role in both retinoid and lipid metabolism.
