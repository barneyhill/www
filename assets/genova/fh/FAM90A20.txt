# FAM90A20

## Overview
FAM90A20 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, member A20. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by shared sequence motifs, which suggests potential functional roles in cellular processes, although the specific biological functions of FAM90A20 remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by FAM90A20 is not currently categorized under well-known protein classes such as kinases, receptors, or transmembrane proteins, indicating that it may have unique or specialized roles within the cell. Research into the FAM90A20 gene and its protein product is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its interactions and potential implications in human health and disease.
