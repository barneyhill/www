# ENAH

## Overview
The ENAH gene encodes the ENAH actin regulator protein, a member of the Ena/VASP family, which is integral to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is characterized by its involvement in actin filament dynamics, including nucleation, cross-linking, and bundling, which are essential for cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance, motility, and adhesion (Scott2006EnaVASP). The ENAH protein contains distinct structural domains, including the EVH1 and EVH2 domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in actin polymerization (AhernDjamali1998Mutations; Hwang2021A). ENAH is active in cellular structures like lamellipodia and filopodia, influencing cell migration and tissue development (Applewhite2007EnaVASP). Clinically, ENAH is significant in cancer metastasis, particularly in breast cancer, where it promotes tumor cell invasion and intravasation, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Hwang2021A).

## Structure
The ENAH protein, part of the Ena/VASP family, is involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and features several key structural domains. It contains an N-terminal EVH1 domain, which is highly conserved and responsible for binding short linear motifs (SLiMs) such as the FP4 motif, forming a polyproline type II (PPII) helix (Hwang2022Native; Hwang2021A). The EVH1 domain's structure includes a unique Pro7 binding pocket that accommodates prolines, enhancing binding affinity through interactions with a hydrophobic patch (Hwang2022Native).

The C-terminal EVH2 domain is crucial for actin binding and polymerization, facilitating multimerization and interaction with other proteins (AhernDjamali1998Mutations). This domain is essential for the protein's localization and function within the cell, particularly in focal adhesions and actin assembly (AhernDjamali1998Mutations).

ENAH undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its activity and interactions. The protein also exists in multiple splice variants, which can affect its function and subcellular localization (Hwang2022Native). These structural features and modifications enable ENAH to play a significant role in cellular processes like axon guidance and cell adhesion.

## Function
The ENAH gene encodes a protein that is part of the Ena/VASP family, which plays a critical role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, a key component in maintaining cell shape, motility, and adhesion. Ena/VASP proteins, including ENAH, are involved in actin filament nucleation, cross-linking, and bundling, which are essential for cell-cell adhesion and morphogenetic processes (Scott2006EnaVASP). These proteins localize at cell-cell contacts and are necessary for F-actin accumulation and assembly, contributing to the formation of actin filament bundles at cadherin-based cell-cell contacts (Scott2006EnaVASP).

ENAH is active in cellular structures such as lamellipodia and filopodia, influencing processes like cell migration and tissue development (Applewhite2007EnaVASP). The protein's EVH2 domain is crucial for actin filament elongation and bundling, as it associates with the barbed end of growing actin filaments, facilitating the transfer of G-actin and delaying capping protein binding (Benz2023Cardiovascular). ENAH also plays a role in receptor internalization and trafficking, particularly in chemotaxis and guidance cue-mediated cell migration (Benz2023Cardiovascular). These functions are vital for maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating cell motility.

## Clinical Significance
The ENAH gene, also known as Mena, plays a significant role in cancer metastasis, particularly in breast cancer. ENAH promotes tumor cell invasion and intravasation, which are critical steps in the metastatic process. Inhibitors targeting ENAH's EVH1-mediated interactions have shown potential in reducing breast cancer cell extravasation, highlighting the gene's involvement in cancer progression (Hwang2021A). The antagonistic roles of ENAH and its paralog EVL in cancer metastasis, where ENAH promotes and EVL suppresses metastasis, underscore the need for paralog-specific inhibitors to minimize side effects in treatment (Hwang2021A).

ENAH is also implicated in the progression of esophageal carcinoma and breast cancer through its interactions with proline-rich motifs. The protein KIAA1522, associated with metastasis in these cancers, binds to ENAH, suggesting a link between ENAH interactions and cancer progression (Hwang2022Native). Additionally, ENAH is highly expressed in invasive cancers and is involved in cellular functions such as axon guidance and cell adhesion, further indicating its role in cancer and potentially other diseases (Hwang2022Native). The gene's dysregulation is linked to various diseases, emphasizing its clinical significance.

## Interactions
The ENAH protein, also known as ENAH actin regulator, is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. ENAH interacts with proteins through its EVH1 domain, which binds to proline-rich motifs, particularly the FP4 motif. This interaction is enhanced by additional prolines and acidic residues flanking the FP4 motif, which can increase binding affinity by interacting with positively charged patches on ENAH (Hwang2022Native).

ENAH has been shown to interact with several proteins, including FHOD1, IFT52, and TJAP1, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. FHOD1 is involved in unbranched actin polymerization, while IFT52 is part of the intraflagellar transport B complex, essential for cilia and flagella assembly. TJAP1 is associated with the trans-Golgi complex and may help maintain Golgi body structure (Hwang2022Native).

The ENAH EVH1 domain can bind to both canonical and noncanonical sites, with mutations such as R47A disrupting interactions, particularly with peptides containing dual FP4 motifs (Hwang2022Native). ENAH also interacts with the ciliary protein PCARE, which binds selectively to ENAH over its paralogs VASP and EVL, affecting cell adhesion and focal adhesion dynamics (Hwang2021A).
