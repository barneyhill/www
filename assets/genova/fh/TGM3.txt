# TGM3

## Overview
TGM3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme transglutaminase 3, which is a member of the transglutaminase family of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through the formation of isopeptide bonds, which are crucial for the structural integrity of various tissues. Transglutaminase 3 plays a significant role in the differentiation and cornification of keratinocytes in the epidermis, contributing to the formation of the cornified cell envelope and the hardening of hair follicles (Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase). Additionally, TGM3 is the predominant transglutaminase isoform in the colon, where it is essential for the cross-linking of mucin-2, a key component of the protective mucus barrier (Sharpen2022Transglutaminase). The gene's expression and activity are implicated in various clinical conditions, including Uncombable Hair Syndrome and several types of cancer, where its dysregulation can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Wu2013TGM3; Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase).

## Function
Transglutaminase 3 (TGM3) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the formation of protein polymers in the epidermis and hair follicles. It is involved in the differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, which transform into cornified cells to form the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis. TGM3 catalyzes the cross-linking of structural proteins and keratin intermediate filaments, essential for the hardening of the hair follicle and hair shaft (Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase). This enzyme is part of a family of transglutaminases that introduce isopeptide bonds between lysine and glutamine residues of target proteins, contributing to the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CCE) in the skin epidermis and strengthening hair fibers (Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase).

In the colon, TGM3 is the predominant transglutaminase isoform, where it cross-links the secreted gel-forming mucus component mucin-2 (MUC2). This cross-linking is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and biochemical properties of the mucus, which serves as a protective barrier against pathogens and supports the commensal flora (Sharpen2022Transglutaminase). TGM3 activity is intrinsic to the colonic mucus and does not require additional calcium for activation, indicating its natural role in mucus homeostasis (Sharpen2022Transglutaminase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TGM3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Uncombable Hair Syndrome (UHS), also known as 'spun glass hair syndrome,' is a rare disorder linked to defects in TGM3 and other proteins involved in hair shaft formation. This condition is characterized by frizzy, wiry, and unmanageable hair and is often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, typically resolving with age (Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase).

In the context of cancer, TGM3 expression is frequently altered. It is downregulated in various carcinomas, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), esophageal, oral, and laryngeal cancers, where its reduced expression is associated with increased tumor invasiveness, poor prognosis, and decreased apoptosis (Wu2013TGM3; Chen2000Transglutaminase3). The downregulation of TGM3 in these cancers is often due to hypermethylation of CpG islands in its promoter region, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Wu2013TGM3; Smirnov2019Transglutaminase).

Conversely, TGM3 is upregulated in certain cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is associated with increased cell survival and metastasis (Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase). These findings highlight the complex role of TGM3 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Transglutaminase 3 (TGM3) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its biological functions. In the epidermis, TGM3 participates in the formation of the cornified cell envelope by cross-linking proteins such as small proline-rich proteins (SPRs) and loricrin. These substrates are initially cross-linked in the cytoplasm and then translocated to the cell periphery, where TGM1 further cross-links them to the existing protein scaffold on the plasma membrane (Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase). TGM3 also interacts with keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) and trichohyalin in hair follicles, stabilizing and hardening the hair shaft, which is essential for hair structure and integrity (Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase).

In the colon, TGM3 is the dominant transglutaminase isozyme and plays a critical role in stabilizing the mucus layer by cross-linking mucin-2 (MUC2). This interaction involves the formation of isopeptide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and protective function of the colonic mucus layer (Sharpen2022Transglutaminase). The absence of TGM3 leads to a more degraded MUC2 network, highlighting the importance of these interactions in protecting the colonic epithelium from microbial invasion (Sharpen2022Transglutaminase).
