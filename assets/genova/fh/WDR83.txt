# WDR83

## Overview
WDR83 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 83 protein, a member of the WD-40 protein family, which is characterized by its involvement in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. The protein encoded by WDR83 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which is crucial for modulating gene expression, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Zambonelli2013SNPs). WDR83 is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues, with differential expression levels observed in various organs, such as the brain, lung, liver, heart, and kidney (Wulf2023Targeted). Functionally, WDR83 is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and protein levels, particularly through its interaction with the Egl nine homolog 3 gene (EGLN3), impacting cellular responses to hypoxia (Zambonelli2013SNPs). The protein's activity in both the cytoplasm and nucleus underscores its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and development (Su2012Bidirectional).

## Function
The WDR83 gene, also known as MORG1, encodes a protein that is a member of the WD-40 protein family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. WDR83 plays a crucial role in regulating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which is important for modulating gene expression, cell growth, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis (Zambonelli2013SNPs). The protein is expressed in almost all human organs and tissue systems, with varying levels of expression. It is weakly expressed in brain glial cells and more strongly in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. In other organs such as the lung, liver, heart, and kidney, it is expressed moderately, while it is weakly expressed in the pancreas (Wulf2023Targeted).

WDR83 is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and protein levels through its interaction with the Egl nine homolog 3 gene (EGLN3), affecting the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A) mRNA under different oxygen conditions (Zambonelli2013SNPs). This regulation is essential for cellular responses to hypoxia, such as angiogenesis and erythropoiesis. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular homeostasis and development (Su2012Bidirectional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WDR83 gene, also known as MORG1, have been implicated in various pathological conditions, particularly in cancer. In gastric cancer, WDR83 and its natural antisense transcript DHPS form an RNA duplex that enhances their stability and expression. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ERK signaling and E2F1 expression, which are often aberrantly activated in cancers. The upregulation of WDR83 and DHPS in gastric cancer tissues correlates with increased cell proliferation, suggesting their role in tumor progression (Su2012Bidirectional).

In embryonic development, the disruption of the MORG1 gene in mice leads to embryonic lethality due to severe developmental defects, including impaired placental vascularization and neural tube development. This highlights the gene's critical role in embryogenesis and suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to developmental abnormalities (Wulf2023Targeted).

The involvement of WDR83 in the MAPK and HIF signaling pathways further underscores its significance in processes like angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. These pathways are often dysregulated in cancer, indicating that alterations in WDR83 expression or function could contribute to oncogenesis and other pathological conditions (Wulf2023Targeted).

## Interactions
WDR83, also known as WD repeat domain 83, is involved in several protein and nucleic acid interactions. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, WDR83 forms a complex with the G-patch protein Gpl1 and the RNA helicase Gih35. This complex is crucial for proper pre-mRNA splicing and is associated with the spliceosome. The deletion of any component of this complex, including WDR83, results in splicing defects, indicating its essential role in RNA processing (Selicky2022Defining; Cipakova2024Dysfunction).

In the context of gastric cancer, WDR83 interacts with DHPS to form an RNA duplex that enhances the stability of both transcripts. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ERK signaling and E2F1 expression, which are important for cell proliferation and cancer progression. The RNA duplex formation at their overlapping 3'UTRs protects the transcripts from degradation and influences their expression levels (Su2012Bidirectional).

WDR83 also interacts with the Egl nine homolog 3 gene (EGLN3), stabilizing its mRNA levels and affecting the degradation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) under normoxic conditions. This interaction is part of the regulation of the ERK pathway, which is involved in various cellular processes (Zambonelli2013SNPs).
