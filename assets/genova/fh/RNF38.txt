# RNF38

## Overview
RNF38 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 38, which is a member of the RING finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by tagging proteins for degradation. The RNF38 protein is characterized by a RING-H2 domain, a zinc-binding motif essential for its enzymatic activity, and a coiled-coil domain that suggests its involvement in protein-protein and DNA interactions (Cham2018Expression; Cham2017RING). RNF38 is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, heart, and liver, and is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Cham2018Expression; Cham2017RING). The protein's interactions and post-translational modifications are crucial for its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity, with implications in both tumor suppression and progression, depending on the cellular context (Lin2022RNF38; RING; Huang2020&lt; p&gt).

## Structure
The RNF38 protein is characterized by a RING finger domain, specifically a RING-H2 domain, which is a type of zinc-binding motif. This domain is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin molecules to target proteins (Cham2017RING; Huang2020&lt; RING; p&gt). The RING-H2 domain includes a conserved sequence of cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate two zinc atoms, following the pattern Cys-X2-Cys-X(9-39)-Cys-X(1-3)-His-X(2-3)-His-X2-Cys-X(4-48)-Cys-X2-Cys (Cham2017RING).

RNF38 also contains a coiled-coil domain, which suggests its involvement in protein-protein and DNA interactions (Cham2018Expression). The presence of these domains indicates a complex tertiary structure that supports its role in various cellular processes, including ubiquitination and signal transduction (RING; Huang2020&lt; p&gt).

Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination are integral to RNF38's function, particularly in the context of tumor suppression and protein degradation (RING; Huang2020&lt; p&gt). The protein's structure and modifications enable it to interact with other proteins, such as the tumor-suppressor protein p53, and mediate their ubiquitination (Cham2017RING). The specific details of RNF38's quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
RNF38, a member of the RING finger protein family, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within cells, influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Cham2018Expression; Cham2017RING). RNF38 is characterized by a zinc-binding motif and a conserved RING-H2 domain, which are critical for its ability to bind and ubiquitinate target proteins, including the tumor-suppressor protein p53 (Cham2017RING).

In healthy human cells, RNF38 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, spleen, placenta, and testis, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological functions (Cham2017RING). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences cellular stress responses and signal transduction pathways (Cham2018Expression). RNF38's role in protein turnover and cellular regulation underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function, although specific details about its activities in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Cham2017RING).

## Clinical Significance
RNF38 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), RNF38 is significantly downregulated compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, as RNF38 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and metastasis through the ubiquitination of ACTN4, which affects the NF-ùõãB and ERK1/2 signaling pathways (Lin2022RNF38). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RNF38 is overexpressed and correlates with poor prognosis. It facilitates cancer progression by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhancing TGF-Œ≤ signaling through the degradation of the AHNAK protein (Peng2019Overexpression). This overexpression is linked to larger tumor size, advanced stage, and higher recurrence rates in HCC patients (Peng2019Overexpression).

In cervical carcinoma, RNF38 expression is inhibited by microRNA-301b, which is upregulated in these cancer cells. This interaction leads to increased cell growth, suggesting that RNF38 downregulation contributes to cervical carcinoma progression (Guo2020Inhibiting). These findings highlight RNF38's dual role as a tumor suppressor in some cancers and a promoter in others, depending on its expression and interaction with other molecular pathways.

## Interactions
RNF38, a member of the RING finger protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), RNF38 interacts with ACTN4, an actin-binding protein, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction results in the suppression of the NF-ùõãB and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, which are crucial for tumor growth and metastasis (Lin2022RNF38). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RNF38 interacts with AHNAK, a protein that inhibits TGF-Œ≤ signaling. RNF38 facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of AHNAK, thereby promoting TGF-Œ≤ signaling and contributing to cancer progression (Peng2019Overexpression). 

RNF38 also interacts with UBC13, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The RING domain of RNF38 can activate UBC13 to synthesize polyubiquitin chains. However, deamidation of UBC13 reduces its affinity for RNF38, affecting the ubiquitination process (Mohanty2019Deamidation). These interactions highlight RNF38's role in modulating protein stability and signaling pathways, impacting cancer cell behavior and progression.
