# PNN

## Overview
The PNN gene encodes the pinin protein, a multifunctional protein primarily involved in RNA processing and cell adhesion. Pinin is categorized as a serine/arginine-rich protein and is predominantly localized in nuclear speckles and desmosomes, where it plays a crucial role in the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing and cell-cell adhesion (Wang2002Modulation; Leu2012Loss). The protein's interactions with various splicing-related proteins and its involvement in mRNA processing underscore its significance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Li2003Nuclear). Additionally, pinin's expression levels have been linked to cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Piccinno2024Identification; Mini2019RNA).

## Function
The PNN gene encodes the protein pinin, which is involved in several critical cellular functions, particularly in RNA processing and cell adhesion. Pinin is a serine/arginine-rich protein that localizes predominantly in nuclear speckles, regions associated with the assembly and storage of splicing factors, and at desmosomes, which are structures involved in cell-cell adhesion (Wang2002Modulation; Leu2012Loss; Li2003Nuclear).

In the nucleus, pinin plays a significant role in the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing, influencing the selection of splice sites and modulating the expression of different protein isoforms in a tissue-specific manner (Wang2002Modulation; Joo2013Transcriptomic). It interacts with several splicing-related proteins, such as SRSF1, and is involved in the splicing of apoptosis-related genes, which is crucial for cell survival and preventing apoptosis (Leu2012Loss).

Pinin also participates in mRNA processing and export, binding preferentially to spliced mRNA and interacting with components of the exon junction complex (Li2003Nuclear). Its role in maintaining epithelial cell integrity is underscored by its involvement in cell adhesion and migration, with its expression affecting cell proliferation and differentiation (Li2003Nuclear; Joo2013Transcriptomic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PNN gene, which encodes the Pinin protein, have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). High PNN expression is associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance in stage III CRC patients. Patients with elevated PNN levels do not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, showing similar disease-free survival (DFS) to untreated patients, suggesting that PNN could serve as a predictive biomarker for chemotherapy response (Mini2019RNA).

In CRC, PNN is overexpressed in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and its expression correlates with disease stage and patient survival. This overexpression is linked to tumor progression and metastasis, potentially through the activation of pathways such as PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK (Piccinno2024Identification). The interaction between PNN and miR-195-5p has been identified as a regulatory mechanism, where miR-195-5p can decrease PNN expression, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in CRC (Piccinno2024Identification).

PNN also plays a role in apoptosis regulation. Its depletion leads to increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes, indicating its importance in cell survival and its potential involvement in cancer-related apoptosis pathways (Leu2012Loss).

## Interactions
PNN (pinin) is a protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins, particularly within the context of mRNA processing and transcription regulation. PNN interacts with serine-arginine (SR) proteins, including SRp75, SRm300, and SRrp130, which are components of the spliceosome machinery. These interactions are facilitated by the C-terminal portion of PNN, which contains SR-repeat motifs, and are crucial for pre-mRNA processing (Zimowska2003PininDRSmemA).

PNN also interacts with the transcriptional corepressor CtBP1, both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction can reverse CtBP1-mediated repression of the E-cadherin promoter, suggesting that PNN may modulate CtBP1's silencing function. The interaction is mediated through the PXDLS motif within the C terminus of PNN (Alpatov2004Nuclear).

Additionally, PNN is associated with transcriptionally active RNA Polymerase II complexes, particularly with initiation and elongation-specific forms, but not with the preinitiation form. This association suggests a role for PNN in modulating transcription and splicing of the E-cadherin gene (Alpatov2008Corepressor).

PNN also binds preferentially to spliced mRNAs, particularly within approximately 60 nucleotides upstream of the 5' splice sites, and interacts with the EJC component RNPS1, indicating its involvement in mRNA processing and export (Li2003Nuclear).
