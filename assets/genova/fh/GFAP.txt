# GFAP

## Overview
The GFAP gene encodes the glial fibrillary acidic protein, a type III intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in astrocytes, which are a type of glial cell in the central nervous system (CNS). This protein is integral to the structural framework of astrocytes, contributing to their mechanical strength and stability. GFAP is involved in various cellular processes, including the maintenance of the cytoskeleton, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmitter regulation, which are essential for normal CNS function (Middeldorp2011GFAP). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as plectin and 14-3-3 proteins, further modulate its role in cell cycle regulation and intermediate filament structure (Middeldorp2011GFAP). Mutations in the GFAP gene are linked to Alexander disease, a rare neurodegenerative disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Brenner2001Mutations).

## Structure
The GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) gene encodes a protein that is a key component of the intermediate filament network in astrocytes. The protein is composed of a head, rod, and tail domain, which are essential for its assembly into 10 nm thick filaments (Hol2017Type). The rod domain is divided into coiled-coil regions and linker regions, contributing to the protein's structural integrity (Hol2017Type). GFAP can form heterodimers with other intermediate filament proteins such as nestin and synemin (Hol2017Type).

Post-translational modifications of GFAP include phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination, which regulate its assembly and function within the cell (Hol2017Type). The protein has a half-life of approximately one month, indicating its stability in the cellular environment (Hol2017Type).

GFAP exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which differ mainly in their carboxy-terminal sequences. These variations affect the protein's ability to form homodimers and integrate into the intermediate filament network. Notable isoforms include GFAPa, the most abundantly expressed form, and GFAPd, which has a unique C-terminal tail that influences its assembly properties (Moeton2016GFAP; Hol2017Type).

## Function
The GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein) gene encodes a type III intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in astrocytes, a type of glial cell in the central nervous system (CNS). GFAP plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical strength of astrocytes, which is essential for their supportive functions in the CNS (Middeldorp2011GFAP). It is involved in the formation of the cytoskeleton, providing structural support and stability to astrocytes (Middeldorp2011GFAP). GFAP interacts with various proteins, such as plectin and 14-3-3 proteins, which are involved in modulating the structure of intermediate filaments and are important for cell cycle regulation (Middeldorp2011GFAP).

GFAP is also involved in modulating neural functions, particularly in synapse formation and plasticity, energetic and redox metabolism, and synaptic homeostasis of neurotransmitters and ions (Middeldorp2011GFAP). It plays a key role in the trafficking and function of glutamate transporters, which are critical for neurotransmitter regulation (Middeldorp2011GFAP). GFAP is essential for maintaining normal CNS functions, including synaptic interactions, neurotransmitter regulation, blood-brain barrier integrity, and myelination (Middeldorp2011GFAP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GFAP gene are primarily associated with Alexander disease, a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of Rosenthal fibers within astrocytes. These mutations often result in dominant gain-of-function effects, leading to the formation of protein aggregates that disrupt normal cellular functions (Brenner2001Mutations; Quinlan2007GFAP). Alexander disease manifests in various forms, including infantile, juvenile, and adult-onset, with symptoms such as megalencephaly, developmental delay, and seizures (Li2002GFAP; Gorospe2002Molecular). 

The majority of GFAP mutations are sporadic, single amino acid heterozygous missense changes that may alter the protein's solubility or structural integrity (Gorospe2002Molecular). These mutations are often located in the rod domain of the GFAP protein, similar to hot spots found in other intermediate filament genes (Brenner2001Mutations). In some cases, elevated levels of normal GFAP protein, possibly due to duplications or promoter mutations, can also contribute to the disease (Brenner2001Mutations).

Altered GFAP expression is linked to gliosis, a response to central nervous system injury, and various gliomas, indicating its broader clinical significance beyond Alexander disease (Middeldorp2011GFAP).

## Interactions
GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) interacts with several proteins, influencing its assembly into intermediate filaments. It binds with high affinity to S100 proteins, specifically S100A1 and S100B, in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction inhibits the assembly of GFAP into intermediate filaments by affecting nucleation and polymer growth, leading to a delay in assembly and an increase in the critical concentration required for assembly (Bianchi1994Mechanism; Garbuglia1998Annexin). The peptide TRTK-12, homologous to a region within the GFAP head domain, can block the S100/GFAP interaction, suggesting a specific binding site within GFAP for S100 proteins (Bianchi1996S100).

Annexin VI also interacts with S100 proteins, blocking their inhibitory effects on GFAP assembly. This interaction is calcium-dependent and involves annexin VI binding to S100A1 and S100B, altering their conformation and preventing them from inhibiting GFAP assembly (Garbuglia1998Annexin).

Synemin interacts with GFAP in the presence of vimentin, acting as an associated protein rather than a copolymerization partner. This interaction is crucial for synemin's incorporation into intermediate filament networks in astrocytes (Jing2007Synemin).
