# KRT71

## Overview
KRT71 is a gene that encodes the keratin 71 protein, a type II keratin, which is integral to the structural framework of hair follicles. The keratin 71 protein is a component of keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs), which are essential for maintaining the mechanical stability and integrity of epithelial cells, particularly within the inner root sheath (IRS) of hair follicles (Fujimoto2012A; Chamcheu2011Keratin). The protein's structure is characterized by an alpha-helical rod domain, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers and subsequent assembly into higher-order structures (Ho2022Update). KRT71 is predominantly expressed in the IRS, where it plays a crucial role in hair shaft growth and differentiation (Fujimoto2012A). Mutations in the KRT71 gene have been linked to hair-related disorders, such as woolly hair and hypotrichosis, highlighting its significance in hair texture and growth across species (RomeroBenavente2023Hypotrichosis; Fujimoto2012A).

## Structure
KRT71 (keratin 71) is a type II keratin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair follicles. The primary structure of KRT71 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming an alpha-helical rod domain, which is characteristic of keratins (Chamcheu2011Keratin). This central rod domain is composed of four helical segments, interrupted by non-helical linkers, and is essential for the formation of keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) (Chamcheu2011Keratin). 

The secondary structure of KRT71 includes alpha-helices, which facilitate the formation of coiled-coil dimers, a common feature in keratin proteins (Chamcheu2011Keratin). These dimers can further assemble into tetramers, contributing to the protein's quaternary structure (Ho2022Update). 

KRT71 is involved in forming heterodimers with type I keratins, which are crucial for the assembly of intermediate filaments that provide mechanical stability to epithelial cells (Jacinto2021A). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions (Chamcheu2011Keratin). 

Splice variants of KRT71 can result in different isoforms, potentially influencing its role in hair and nail formation (Ho2022Update).

## Function
The KRT71 gene encodes the keratin 71 protein, a type II keratin involved in the formation of keratin intermediate filaments (KIF) in human cells. These filaments are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of cells, particularly in the inner root sheath (IRS) of hair follicles (Fujimoto2012A). In healthy cells, the K71 protein forms a KIF network through heterodimerization with type I keratins, such as K14, which is crucial for the structural framework of keratinocytes (Fujimoto2012A). The IRS is composed of several layers, including the Huxley layer, where KRT71 is predominantly expressed, playing a significant role in hair shaft growth (Fujimoto2012A).

KRT71 is expressed in all three layers of the IRS, which may contribute to its critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of hair follicles (Fujimoto2012A). The protein's involvement in the KIF network is vital for proper hair texture and growth, influencing the overall health and appearance of hair (Fujimoto2012A). The KRT71 protein's activity is primarily localized within the IRS of hair follicles, where it contributes to the differentiation and maturation of hair follicles (Fujimoto2012A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT71 gene are associated with several hair-related disorders. In humans, a missense mutation, c.422T>G (p.Phe141Cys), in the KRT71 gene has been linked to autosomal dominant woolly hair and hypotrichosis. This mutation disrupts the keratin intermediate filament network, leading to tightly curled hair and hair growth deficiencies (Fujimoto2012A). The mutation is located within the helix initiation motif of the K71 protein, a region conserved among human type II keratins, and is pathogenic as it was not found in 200 control individuals (Fujimoto2012A).

In animals, mutations in KRT71 have been linked to similar phenotypes. In Hereford cattle, an 8 bp deletion in the KRT71 gene causes hypotrichosis congenita, characterized by sparse, fine, and curly hair (RomeroBenavente2023Hypotrichosis). In mice, mutations in Krt71 result in a wavy pelage and curly vibrissae due to alterations in the intermediate filaments of the inner root sheath of hair follicles (Runkel2006Morphologic). These findings underscore the critical role of KRT71 in maintaining normal hair structure and its involvement in hair disorders across species.
