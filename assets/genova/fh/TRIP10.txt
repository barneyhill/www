# TRIP10

## Overview
TRIP10, also known as Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4), is a gene that encodes the scaffold protein thyroid hormone receptor interactor 10. This protein is characterized by the presence of F-BAR and SH3 domains, which are integral to its role in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, membrane dynamics, and signal transduction. The F-BAR domain is particularly important for membrane binding and curvature, facilitating membrane deformation and tubulation, while the SH3 domain mediates protein-protein interactions (Hsu2011Functional). TRIP10 is involved in various cellular functions, including insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, endocytosis, and cytoskeleton arrangement, with its activity being modulated by alternative splicing and post-translational modifications (Hsu2011Functional; Giudice2016Alternative). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as Cdc42 and huntingtin, underscore its significance in cellular signaling pathways and its potential implications in diseases like cancer and Parkinson's disease (Hsu2011Functional; Lejeune2022A).

## Structure
TRIP10, also known as CIP4, is a scaffold protein that plays a role in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and membrane dynamics. The protein contains an F-BAR domain, which is crucial for membrane binding and curvature, facilitating processes such as membrane deformation and tubulation (Hsu2011Functional). Additionally, TRIP10 has an SH3 domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, allowing it to interact with various signaling partners (Hsu2011Functional). 

The protein is involved in interactions with proteins like Cdc42 and huntingtin, which influence its role in cellular signaling pathways (Hsu2011Functional). Although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TRIP10 are not provided, its functional domains suggest a complex structure that supports its diverse roles in cellular processes. 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate TRIP10's activity and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context (Hsu2011Functional). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functions in various tissues, including skeletal muscle and cancer cells (Hsu2011Functional; Giudice2016Alternative).

## Function
The TRIP10 gene, also known as Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4), encodes a scaffold protein with F-BAR, ERM, and SH3 domains, which facilitate interactions with various signaling partners. In healthy human cells, TRIP10 is involved in multiple cellular processes, including insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, endocytosis, cytoskeleton arrangement, membrane invagination, proliferation, survival, and migration (Hsu2011Functional). The protein's function is tissue-specific and cell lineage-specific. For instance, in adipocytes, TRIP10 enhances glucose uptake by interacting with TC-10 to regulate the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane. Conversely, in muscle cells, TRIP10 inhibits glucose uptake by increasing GLUT4 endocytosis (Hsu2011Functional).

TRIP10 also plays a role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cytotoxicity in natural killer cells by interacting with the WASP protein, facilitating the localization of microtubule organizing centers to immunological synapses (Hsu2011Functional). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in endocytosis and signal transduction pathways, influencing cell shape and motility (Heath2008FBAR). These diverse roles are attributed to splicing variants and interactions with distinct signaling partners in different cell types (Hsu2011Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the TRIP10 gene, also known as CIP4, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, TRIP10 plays a complex role, acting as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on the cancer type. Its expression is epigenetically regulated, with differential methylation patterns observed across different cancer cell lines. For instance, TRIP10 is hypermethylated in brain tumors and breast cancer but hypomethylated in liver cancer. In breast cancer, it is unmethylated in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors but hypermethylated in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) tumors, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Hsu2011Functional).

TRIP10 is also involved in lipid metabolism, with knockout experiments showing increased lipid accumulation, indicating its potential role in obesity and fat distribution (Baya2024Combining). In Parkinson's disease, TRIP10 expression is associated with cognitive functions, being negatively correlated with cognitive performance measures, suggesting a role in cognitive impairment (Lejeune2022A).

Additionally, TRIP10 is involved in the regulation of epithelial junctions and cell invasion, interacting with proteins like VAV2, which are crucial for junction assembly and homeostasis (Erasmus2016Defining). These interactions highlight its significance in oncogenic pathways and diseases involving cell invasion.

## Interactions
TRIP10, also known as CIP4, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Cdc42, a small GTPase, which is significant for its role in cancer cell growth and survival. In IMR-32 cells, TRIP10 overexpression leads to increased colony formation and tumorigenesis, potentially due to strong Cdc42 expression (Hsu2011Functional). TRIP10 also interacts with huntingtin, particularly in CP70 cells, where high huntingtin levels promote apoptosis, reducing tumorigenesis (Hsu2011Functional).

TRIP10 is involved in epithelial junction biogenesis, interacting with VAV2, a Rho GTPase GEF. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of cadherin contacts during junction assembly. TRIP10 and VAV2 form a protein complex, and their interaction is necessary for TRIP10 localization at cell-cell contacts (Erasmus2016Defining). TRIP10 binds to p120 catenin and β-catenin, contributing to the stabilization of cadherin complexes (Erasmus2016Defining).

TRIP10 also contains an SH3 domain, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins, although specific partners are not detailed in the context (Lee1995Two). This domain is known for mediating interactions with proline-rich regions in other proteins.
