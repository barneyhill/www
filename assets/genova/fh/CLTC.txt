# CLTC

## Overview
The CLTC gene encodes the clathrin heavy chain, a pivotal component of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) that plays a fundamental role in intracellular trafficking and endocytosis. The clathrin heavy chain is a structural protein that forms a triskelion shape, which is essential for the assembly of a polyhedral lattice on vesicles, facilitating the transport of molecules within cells. This protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues and is crucial for processes such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, synaptic vesicle recycling, and protein sorting within the trans-Golgi network (Wilbur2010Conformation; Fumagalli2019Genetic). The evolutionary conservation of the CLTC gene underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Brodsky2012Diversity). Pathogenic variants in CLTC are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its critical role in normal cellular function and development (Shijie2021Deregulation; Itai2021Novel).

## Structure
The CLTC gene encodes the clathrin heavy chain, a protein that plays a crucial role in vesicle formation through its triskelion structure. The primary structure of the clathrin heavy chain consists of 1675 amino acids in humans (Mizuta2017Ovarian). The secondary structure is characterized by a series of α-helices, forming a right-handed superhelix with a 'helix-turn-helix-loop' motif, which is essential for the protein's assembly and function (Ybe1999Clathrin). The tertiary structure of clathrin is a triskelion, composed of three heavy chains, each associated with a light chain (Han2021Clathrin). This triskelion structure is crucial for the formation of a polyhedral lattice on vesicles (Ybe1999Clathrin).

The clathrin heavy chain contains several domains, including the N-terminal domain, which is folded into a seven-bladed β propeller and interacts with adaptor proteins (Ybe2014Novel). The protein also features a tandemly repeated superhelix, specifically an α/α-superhelix fold, with seven clathrin heavy-chain repeat (CHCR) motifs (Ybe1999Clathrin). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Tyr 1477 by Src kinase, may regulate clathrin recruitment (Ybe1999Clathrin).

## Function
The CLTC gene encodes the clathrin heavy chain protein, specifically CHC17, which is a critical component of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) involved in intracellular trafficking. In healthy human cells, CHC17 plays a vital role in receptor-mediated endocytosis, synaptic vesicle recycling, and the sorting of proteins within the trans-Golgi network (Fumagalli2019Genetic; Itai2021Novel). Clathrin forms a triskelion structure, consisting of three clathrin heavy chains, which assembles into a basket-like cage to facilitate the transport of molecules into cells (Wilbur2010Conformation).

CHC17 is ubiquitously expressed across all tissues and is essential for maintaining proper cellular trafficking and vesicle formation. It interacts with clathrin light chains (CLCs) to regulate clathrin lattice assembly, which is crucial for the formation of CCVs (Wilbur2010Conformation). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly near the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus, contributing to cellular homeostasis and signaling (Brodsky2012Diversity). The evolutionary conservation of the CLTC gene across vertebrates underscores its essential role in cellular processes (Fumagalli2019Genetic). Pathogenic variants in the CLTC gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function (Itai2021Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the CLTC gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, particularly in neurodevelopmental and oncological contexts. In osteosarcoma, a common malignant bone tumor, CLTC acts as an oncogene. Its expression is regulated by the transcription factor SP1, and it interacts with TFG to activate the TGF-β and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, contributing to tumorigenesis and progression. Downregulation of CLTC inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in osteosarcoma (Shijie2021Deregulation).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, CLTC mutations are linked to intellectual disability, epilepsy, and movement disorders. Specific mutations, such as the p.P890L and p.L1047P variants, are associated with varying severities of developmental delay and brain structural abnormalities. These mutations disrupt clathrin-mediated endocytosis, affecting synaptic transmission and neuronal function (Pannone2023The). Novel CLTC variants have also been identified in individuals with brain and kidney phenotypes, including developmental delays, seizures, and structural defects (Itai2021Novel).

The CLTC gene is highly intolerant to loss-of-function mutations, and its pathogenic variants can lead to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, often with full penetrance (Hamdan2017High; Itai2021Novel).

## Interactions
The CLTC protein, also known as clathrin heavy chain, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. CLTC interacts with TFG in osteosarcoma cells, where it regulates the protein stability of TFG. This interaction is significant for the progression of osteosarcoma, as CLTC promotes TFG protein stabilization, affecting the TGF-β and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways (Shijie2021Deregulation).

In the context of mitosis, CLTC is a core component of a multiprotein complex that includes TACC3, chTOG, and GTSE1. This complex is essential for mitotic spindle stability. The interaction between CLTC and TACC3 is regulated by the phosphorylation of TACC3, which is crucial for the complex's microtubule-binding ability (Ryan2020Defining; Hubner2010Quantitative).

CLTC also plays a role in endocytosis, interacting with proteins such as AP2A1 and AP2B1, which are involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. This interaction is important for the internalization of proteins like hTAC, demonstrating CLTC's role in receptor-mediated endocytosis (Zhu2018hTAC).
