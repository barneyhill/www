# RSF1

## Overview
RSF1, or Remodeling and Spacing Factor 1, is a gene that encodes a chromatin-remodeling protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, DNA repair, and mitosis. The RSF1 protein is a key component of the RSF chromatin-remodeling complex, which also includes the SNF2h ATPase. This complex plays a critical role in repositioning nucleosomes, thereby regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. RSF1 is essential for the proper response to DNA damage, particularly in facilitating p53-dependent gene expression and DNA double-strand break repair. Additionally, RSF1 is involved in mitotic processes, where it interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) to ensure accurate chromosome alignment and segregation. Due to its significant role in chromatin dynamics and cell cycle regulation, RSF1 has been implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is often associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Min2018Chromatinremodeling; Lee2015The; Pessina2014The).

## Structure


## Function
The RSF1 gene encodes a chromatin-remodeling factor that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell function in healthy human cells. RSF1 is part of the RSF complex, which includes the SNF2h ATPase, and is involved in repositioning nucleosomes to regulate transcription. It is essential for p53-dependent gene expression in response to DNA strand breaks, facilitating the binding of the p53/p300 complex to target gene promoters, which is necessary for the transcription of genes involved in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (Min2018Chromatinremodeling).

RSF1 is also critical in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through both end-joining and homology-directed repair pathways. It interacts with ATM kinase and facilitates the recruitment of centromeric proteins and Fanconi anemia proteins to DSB sites, contributing to chromatin reorganization necessary for DNA repair (Pessina2014The).

In mitosis, RSF1 is essential for the recruitment and function of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) at mitotic kinetochores, which is crucial for chromosome alignment and segregation. RSF1 interacts with PLK1 through phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms, ensuring stable kinetochore-microtubule interactions and proper cell division (Lee2015The).

## Clinical Significance
RSF1 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In myxofibrosarcomas, RSF1 overexpression is linked to increased angiogenesis and tumor aggressiveness, making it a potential therapeutic target. RSF1 interacts with CEBP/β and hSNF2H to promote IL-1β-mediated angiogenesis, which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. Its overexpression is associated with higher tumor grades and stages, and it independently predicts shorter disease-specific survival (Li2021RSF1).

In ovarian cancer, RSF1, also known as Rsf-1 or HBXAP, is located within the 11q13.5 amplicon and is associated with paclitaxel resistance. Its amplification and overexpression correlate with shorter overall survival and chemotherapeutic resistance. RSF1 interacts with hSNF2H to form a chromatin remodeling complex, contributing to drug resistance. Knockdown of RSF1 sensitizes tumor cells to paclitaxel, suggesting that targeting the RSF1/hSNF2H complex could be a therapeutic strategy (Shih2005Amplification; Choi2009Functional).

RSF1 also plays a role in DNA damage response and repair. It interacts with ATM and SNF2H, influencing DNA repair processes and maintaining genomic stability. RSF1 overexpression is linked to tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in cancers with TP53 mutations (Cai2021RSF1; Min2018Chromatinremodeling).

## Interactions
RSF1 interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and mitotic processes. It is part of the RSF chromatin-remodeling complex, which includes SNF2H/SMARCA5 as a catalytic subunit. RSF1 interacts with ATM kinase, a central regulator of the cellular response to DSBs, and this interaction is dependent on both DSBs and ATM kinase activity. RSF1 is phosphorylated by ATM, facilitating its role in DNA repair by recruiting centromeric proteins CENPS/MHF1 and CENPX/MHF2 to DSB sites. These proteins are involved in the recruitment and mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI, which are essential for effective DNA repair (Pessina2014The).

In mitosis, RSF1 interacts with PLK1, a key player in mitotic processes. RSF1 is phosphorylated by CDK1 at Ser1375, creating a docking site for PLK1, which is further phosphorylated by PLK1 at Ser1359. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment and stabilization of PLK1 at mitotic kinetochores, essential for proper chromosome alignment (Lee2015The). RSF1 also interacts with HDAC1, recruiting it to centromeres to regulate histone modifications necessary for chromosome segregation (Lee2018The).
