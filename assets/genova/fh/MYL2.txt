# MYL2

## Overview
The MYL2 gene encodes the myosin regulatory light chain 2 (MLC-2v), a protein that plays a pivotal role in cardiac muscle function. As a member of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein superfamily, MLC-2v is integral to the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation. It achieves this by modulating the activity of myosin ATPase, a crucial enzyme in the contractile process of the heart's ventricular myocardium (Sitbon2019Insights; Sheikh2015Functions). The protein's structure allows it to interact with the myosin heavy chain and actin, forming part of the actomyosin complex essential for muscle contraction (Zhou2016Molecular). MYL2 is also involved in transcriptional regulation, with phosphorylated forms influencing gene expression in cardiac cells (Zhang2015Nuclear). Mutations in MYL2 are linked to various cardiomyopathies, underscoring its importance in cardiac health and disease (Manivannan2020Novel; Weterman2013Recessive).

## Structure
The MYL2 gene encodes the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), which is a crucial component of cardiac muscle function. The primary structure of the MYL2 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the regulatory light chain of myosin, primarily expressed in cardiac muscle (Sitbon2019Insights). The secondary structure of the MYL2 protein includes α-helices, as indicated by studies showing a decrease in α-helical content due to certain mutations (Huang2015Novel). 

The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with the myosin heavy chain (MHC) and actin, contributing to muscle contraction (Zhou2016Molecular). The quaternary structure of MYL2 involves its role as part of the myosin lever arm, interacting with other myosin components to modulate muscle contraction (Sitbon2019Insights).

MYL2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Ser15, which is significant for muscle contraction regulation (Sitbon2019Insights). The protein is part of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein superfamily, which includes a helix-loop-helix region with a 12-amino acid Ca2+ binding loop (Sitbon2019Insights). Splice variants of MYL2 may exist, potentially altering its functional properties (Zhou2016Molecular).

## Function
The MYL2 gene encodes the myosin regulatory light chain 2 (MLC-2v), which is a crucial component of the cardiac muscle sarcomere, the fundamental unit responsible for muscle contraction. In healthy human cells, MYL2 is primarily expressed in the ventricular myocardium, where it plays a vital role in cardiac muscle contraction by modulating the activity of myosin ATPase, thereby influencing muscle contraction and relaxation (Sitbon2019Insights; Sheikh2015Functions).

MLC-2v is involved in the regulation of sarcomere assembly and cardiac contractility. It is essential for proper ventricular development and function, as evidenced by studies showing that the absence of MYL2 leads to defects in sarcomeric assembly and cardiac function (Chen1998Selective; Sheikh2015Functions). The phosphorylation of MLC-2v at specific serine residues is critical for its function, affecting cross-bridge cycling kinetics and calcium-dependent muscle contraction, which are essential for maintaining normal cardiac function (Sheikh2015Functions).

MYL2's expression is restricted to the ventricular chamber throughout development into adulthood, highlighting its role in ensuring the correct assembly and function of ventricular sarcomeres, which are critical for the heart's pumping ability (Sitbon2019Insights).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYL2 gene are associated with several cardiac and neuromuscular disorders. Recessive mutations in MYL2 have been identified as the cause of a specific infantile muscle fiber disease and cardiomyopathy. A study involving affected infants from Dutch and Italian families found that these mutations led to rapidly progressive muscle weakness and heart failure due to cardiomyopathy, with muscle biopsies showing fiber-type disproportion and myofibrillar disorganization (Weterman2013Recessive).

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is another condition linked to MYL2 mutations. A novel frameshift variant in MYL2 was associated with a recessive form of HCM, characterized by early onset and mitral valve dysplasia, leading to early death in affected infants (Manivannan2020Novel). The MYL2-fs variant results in reduced protein levels due to post-translational instability, affecting cardiac function (Manivannan2020Novel).

MYL2 mutations also contribute to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The D94A mutation in MYL2 leads to structural changes in myosin motors, resulting in hypocontractile conformation and decreased calcium sensitivity, which are characteristic of DCM (Yuan2018Sarcomeric). These mutations highlight the critical role of MYL2 in maintaining normal cardiac function and its potential as a therapeutic target for cardiomyopathies.

## Interactions
MYL2, or myosin light chain 2, is involved in several critical interactions within cardiac muscle cells. It binds to the myosin heavy chain (MHC), playing a key role in the regulation of myosin ATPase activity, which is essential for muscle contraction (Weterman2013Recessive). MYL2 also interacts with actin, contributing to the formation and function of the actomyosin complex, which is crucial for muscle contraction and relaxation (Zhou2016Molecular).

Phosphorylation of MYL2 is important for its function, affecting its interaction with other proteins and its role in muscle contraction. The phosphorylation of MYL2 by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is crucial for its regulatory function in cardiac muscle, influencing cross-bridge cycling kinetics and calcium-dependent muscle contraction (Sheikh2015Functions). MYL2 also interacts with cardiac-specific domains such as myosin binding protein C, which is important for sarcomere assembly and cardiac function (Sheikh2015Functions).

In addition to its role in muscle contraction, MYL2 has been shown to function as a transcription factor. Nuclear phosphorylated MYL2 (p-MYL2) can bind to a specific sequence in the NOX2 gene promoter, interacting with RNA polymerase II and transcription factor IIB, thereby modulating NOX2 expression in the myocardium (Zhang2015Nuclear). This novel function highlights MYL2's involvement in transcriptional regulation beyond its traditional role in muscle contraction.
