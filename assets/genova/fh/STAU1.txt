# STAU1

## Overview
STAU1, or staufen double-stranded RNA binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The protein, categorized as an RNA-binding protein, is characterized by its multiple double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs), which facilitate its interaction with RNA molecules. STAU1 plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including mRNA transport, localization, translation, and decay, thereby influencing cellular homeostasis and development (Almasi2021The; Yadav2019Staufen1). It is also implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Gonzalez2022Phosphomimicry; Paul2021Staufen1).

## Structure
The STAU1 protein is characterized by its multiple double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs), which are crucial for its interaction with RNA. The primary structure of STAU1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form these dsRBDs, specifically dsRBD3 and dsRBD4, which are essential for RNA binding (Yadav2019Staufen1; Lazzaretti2018The). The secondary structure of these domains adopts a canonical α-β-β-β-α fold, which is typical for dsRBDs (Yadav2019Staufen1; Lazzaretti2018The).

In terms of tertiary structure, the STAU1 dsRBDs exhibit a well-defined 3D shape, with dsRBD3 and dsRBD4 binding to opposite sides of the RNA, indicating a specific orientation and interaction mode (Yadav2019Staufen1). The quaternary structure involves the dimerization of STAU1 in solution, facilitated by its interaction with dsRNA, which is independent of protein-mediated self-association (Lazzaretti2018The).

STAU1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and localization. The protein also has several splice variant isoforms, which may influence its interaction with RNA and its role in cellular processes (Yadav2019Staufen1). These structural features are critical for STAU1's function in RNA binding and transport.

## Function
STAU1 (staufen double-stranded RNA binding protein 1) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells. It is involved in various molecular processes, including mRNA transport, localization, translation, and decay. STAU1 facilitates the transport of mRNA to different subcellular compartments by interacting with cytoskeletal and motor proteins, which is essential for processes like synaptic plasticity and neuronal development (Almasi2021The; DugreBrisson2005Interaction).

In the cytoplasm, STAU1 is a key player in Staufen-mediated mRNA decay (SMD), a translation-dependent pathway that involves the recruitment of the RNA helicase UPF1 to mRNAs, leading to their degradation. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating mRNA stability (Bonnet‐Magnaval2021The; Park2013Staufen‐mediated). STAU1 also enhances mRNA translation by interacting with the 5' end of mRNAs, potentially improving their accessibility to the ribosomal machinery (DugreBrisson2005Interaction).

STAU1's regulatory functions extend to cell cycle progression, where it balances the expression of mRNA regulons that control differentiation and cell division. Its activity is vital for cell proliferation and differentiation, impacting organismal outcomes such as development and stress response (Bonnet‐Magnaval2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the STAU1 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. In Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2), STAU1 overabundance is linked to impaired RNA processing and autophagic degradation, contributing to disease pathology. Reducing STAU1 levels in SCA2 models has been shown to improve motor behavior and restore normal protein levels, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Paul2021Staufen1; Paul2018Staufen1). STAU1 is also associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's Disease (HD), where its increased levels are linked to impaired autophagy due to elevated mTOR protein levels (Paul2021Staufen1).

In cancer, STAU1 plays a complex role. Its overexpression can impair cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancer cells, suggesting it could be a therapeutic target. However, high STAU1 levels are also associated with increased translation of oncogenes like c-MYC and mTOR, promoting cancer cell growth and survival (Gonzalez2022Phosphomimicry; Bonnet‐Magnaval2021The). STAU1's involvement in stress granule formation and mRNA decay further implicates it in cancer progression and metastasis (Almasi2021The). These findings highlight STAU1's dual role as both a potential oncogene and tumor suppressor, depending on the cellular context.

## Interactions
STAU1 (staufen double-stranded RNA binding protein 1) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, forming complex ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assemblies. STAU1 interacts with pre-mRNAs and mRNAs, forming RNP complexes essential for RNA processing. It colocalizes with splicing factors such as SFRS13A, SFRS4, and SFPQ, indicating its involvement in splicing events (Almasi2021The). STAU1 also interacts with cytoskeletal and motor proteins like dynein and kinesin, facilitating mRNA localization to different subcellular compartments (Almasi2021The).

STAU1's role in mRNA translation is influenced by its interaction with the 5′UTR of target mRNAs and its association with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (DugreBrisson2005Interaction). It also interacts with the 60S ribosomal subunit, potentially affecting ribosomal activity and translation elongation (DugreBrisson2005Interaction). STAU1 forms multimeric complexes through self-association, involving both RNA-binding and protein-protein interactions, with domains such as dsRBD3, dsRBD4, and dsRBD5 playing significant roles (Martel2010Multimerization).

In the context of viral infections, STAU1 interacts with components of the Ebola virus ribonucleoprotein, such as VP35 and NP, enhancing viral RNA synthesis (Fang2018Staufen1). These interactions are RNA-independent and suggest a role for STAU1 in the early formation and termination of the viral RNA synthesis machinery (Fang2018Staufen1).
