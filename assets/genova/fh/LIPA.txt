# LIPA

## Overview
The LIPA gene encodes the enzyme lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), a critical component in lipid metabolism. LAL is a lysosomal enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides into free cholesterol and free fatty acids, playing a vital role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and energy balance (Dubland2015Lysosomal; Li2019Lysosomal). The enzyme's activity is essential for preventing lipid accumulation in lysosomes, thereby averting lysosomal storage disorders and regulating cholesterol metabolism (Gomaraschi2020LIPA). Mutations in the LIPA gene can lead to severe metabolic disorders such as Wolman disease and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD), highlighting its clinical significance (Dubland2015Lysosomal; Cappuccio2019Opening). Additionally, LIPA has been implicated in coronary artery disease, with certain genetic variations affecting its expression and activity, thus influencing cardiovascular risk (Li2022Decoding; Evans2019Functional).

## Structure
The LIPA gene encodes lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), a crucial enzyme in lipid metabolism. The primary structure of LAL consists of 399 amino acids, including a 21-residue signal peptide that directs the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (Anderson1991Cloning; Strøm2019Lysosomal). The enzyme features a core domain and a cap domain, with the latter containing a flexible lid (Strøm2019Lysosomal). The catalytic triad, essential for its enzymatic activity, includes the residues Ser 174, Asp 345, and His 374 (Strøm2019Lysosomal; Lohse1997Human).

LAL undergoes glycosylation, which increases its molecular weight by 6-7 kDa, and is transported to the lysosome via the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (Strøm2019Lysosomal). The enzyme does not require cleavage of a propeptide for activation, challenging previous assumptions about its processing (Strøm2019Lysosomal). The protein's structure includes six cysteine residues, which may play a role in its catalytic mechanism and stability (Anderson1991Cloning). The presence of sequence motifs, such as the esterase-associated -Gly-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Gly- motif, is implicated in the catalytic mechanism (Anderson1991Cloning).

## Function
The LIPA gene encodes lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), an enzyme crucial for lipid metabolism in healthy human cells. LAL is responsible for hydrolyzing cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglycerides (TGs) within lysosomes, releasing free cholesterol (FC) and free fatty acids (FFAs) (Dubland2015Lysosomal; Li2019Lysosomal). This process is essential for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and energy balance, as the released cholesterol and fatty acids are used in various cellular functions, including energy production, cell membrane structure, and signaling pathways (Li2019Lysosomal).

In healthy cells, LAL activity prevents the accumulation of lipids in lysosomes, which is crucial for normal cholesterol metabolism and the prevention of lysosomal storage disorders (Dubland2015Lysosomal; Gomaraschi2020LIPA). The enzyme's activity is also linked to the regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis via sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-mediated pathways, influencing lipoprotein secretion and plasma cholesterol levels (Gomaraschi2020LIPA). LAL-derived free cholesterol plays a regulatory role by inhibiting SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which downregulates cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor expression, ensuring a balance in cholesterol levels within the cell (Dubland2015Lysosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LIPA gene, which encodes lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), lead to significant clinical conditions due to impaired lipid metabolism. Wolman disease is a severe, infantile-onset disorder caused by complete LAL deficiency, resulting in the accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in tissues. This condition is typically fatal within the first year of life without enzyme replacement therapy (Dubland2015Lysosomal; Cappuccio2019Opening). Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD) is a milder form of LAL deficiency, characterized by a near-total loss of enzyme activity. Patients with CESD often present with hepatomegaly, hyperlipidemia, and premature atherosclerosis (Dubland2015Lysosomal; Stitziel2013Exome).

Alterations in LIPA expression are also linked to coronary artery disease (CAD). Genome-wide association studies have identified LIPA as a risk locus for CAD, with certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased LIPA expression and enzyme activity in monocytes. This increased expression is linked to atherogenesis, as it leads to more inflammatory macrophages, contributing to atherosclerosis (Li2022Decoding; Evans2019Functional). These findings suggest that while LIPA overexpression may enhance enzyme activity, it can paradoxically increase CAD risk (Wild2011A; Li2022Decoding).

## Interactions
The LIPA gene encodes lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), which interacts with various proteins, influencing lipid metabolism and cellular processes. In the context of cancer research, LAL interacts with the small molecule ERX-41, which binds to the LXXLL motif of LAL. This interaction is crucial for inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death in triple-negative breast cancer cells, independent of LAL's lipase activity. The binding of ERX-41 to LAL disrupts protein folding within the ER, leading to significant ER stress and cell death (Liu2022Targeting).

In Arabidopsis thaliana, LIPA interacts with SEED LD PROTEIN (SLDP) 1 and 2, forming a lipid droplet-plasma membrane tethering complex. This interaction is essential for the proper subcellular positioning of lipid droplets during early seedling growth. The coiled-coil domain of LIPA is involved in binding SLDPs, facilitating the tethering of lipid droplets to the plasma membrane. This interaction is significant for lipid homeostasis and specialized metabolism in plant cells (Krawczyk2022SLDP).
