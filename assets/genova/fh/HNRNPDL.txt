# HNRNPDL

## Overview
The HNRNPDL gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D-like (HNRNPDL), a member of the RNA-binding protein family involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation. This protein plays a significant role in mRNA biogenesis, alternative splicing, and transcription regulation, impacting various cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis (Li2019hnRNPDL; Fischer2023Heterogenous). HNRNPDL is characterized by its ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, a property influenced by its intrinsically disordered regions and prion-like domain, which are crucial for its function and aggregation behavior (Batlle2020hnRNPDL). Mutations in the HNRNPDL gene are linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1G, highlighting its clinical significance (Vieira2014A). Additionally, alterations in HNRNPDL expression have been associated with various cancers, underscoring its role in disease pathology (Fischer2023Heterogenous).

## Structure
The HNRNPDL protein is a highly conserved nuclear RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA biogenesis. It is encoded by the HNRNPDL gene, which contains nine exons and eight introns, producing three isoforms through alternative splicing: DL1, DL2, and DL3 (Batlle2020hnRNPDL). The DL2 isoform is predominant in human tissues and consists of 301 amino acids, featuring two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a prion-like domain (PrLD) at the C-terminus (Batlle2020hnRNPDL). DL1 is longer, with 420 amino acids, including an additional disordered and Arg-enriched domain at the N-terminus, while DL3 is the shortest, with 244 amino acids, lacking both N and C terminus disordered regions (Batlle2020hnRNPDL).

The protein's phase separation is influenced by its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are enriched with arginine (Arg) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues. These regions are key determinants for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and aggregation (Batlle2020hnRNPDL). The DL1 isoform, with both Arg-rich and Tyr-rich IDRs, shows strong LLPS behavior, while DL2, lacking the Arg-rich N-terminal IDR, has a reduced LLPS propensity (Batlle2020hnRNPDL). The absence of both IDRs in DL3 abolishes its phase separation ability entirely (Batlle2020hnRNPDL). The PrLD is crucial for the aggregation behavior of hnRNPDL, with disease-causing mutations in this domain accelerating aggregation (Batlle2020hnRNPDL).

## Function
The HNRNPDL gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D-like (HNRNPDL), a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation. In healthy human cells, particularly endothelial cells, HNRNPDL plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by controlling processes such as proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. It regulates the expression of key genes like cyclin D1 (CCND1) and tropomyosin 4 (TPM4), which are involved in cell cycle progression and cytoskeleton remodeling, respectively (Fischer2023Heterogenous).

HNRNPDL is involved in alternative splicing and transcription regulation, impacting various biological processes and pathways. It influences the splicing of several genes, including CCAR1 and TNFRSF12A, and is enriched in processes related to cytoskeleton organization and protein phosphorylation (Li2019hnRNPDL). The protein also undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, which contributes to the formation of membraneless organelles within cells, a process regulated by alternative splicing (Batlle2020hnRNPDL).

HNRNPDL's activity is modulated by alternative splicing, and it regulates its own expression via a negative feedback loop, maintaining proper RNA splicing and gene expression in cells (Kemmerer2017Auto).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HNRNPDL gene are associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1G (LGMD1G), a condition characterized by muscle weakness primarily affecting the pelvic and shoulder girdles. Specific mutations, such as D378H and D378N, have been identified in affected individuals from various families, including those from Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina (Berardo2019HNRNPDLrelated; Vieira2014A). These mutations lead to changes in the protein's solubility and phase separation, contributing to the disease pathology (Harrison2017RNAbinding).

HNRNPDL-related muscular dystrophy, also known as LGMDD3, is characterized by symptoms such as proximal and distal muscle weakness, scapular winging, and specific muscle MRI patterns. Muscle biopsies often reveal rimmed vacuoles and autophagic material, classifying it among autophagic rimmed vacuolar myopathies (Berardo2019HNRNPDLrelated). The disease shows variable severity, with some patients being oligo-symptomatic (Berardo2019HNRNPDLrelated).

Alterations in HNRNPDL expression are also implicated in various cancers, including prostate, colon, and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as myeloid leukemia. Dysregulation of HNRNPDL affects mRNA stability and translation efficiency, impacting cell proliferation and migration, which are critical in cancer progression (Fischer2023Heterogenous).

## Interactions
HNRNPDL, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in RNA processing. The protein has three isoforms—DL1, DL2, and DL3—each exhibiting distinct interaction profiles. DL1, with its Arg-rich and Tyr-rich intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), shows strong liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) behavior, forming high-order complexes in the nucleus. This phase separation is driven by interactions between Arg and Tyr residues, similar to those observed in the FUS protein (Batlle2020hnRNPDL).

HNRNPDL interacts with RNA molecules, and its phase separation can be modulated by RNA concentration. High RNA levels can dissolve DL1 droplets, a process reversible by RNase treatment, indicating RNA's role in modulating HNRNPDL's phase separation (Batlle2020hnRNPDL). The protein also participates in the regulation of alternative splicing, with its interactions influenced by the presence of prion-like domains (PrLDs) and RNA recognition motifs (Batlle2020hnRNPDL).

In endothelial cells, HNRNPDL regulates mRNA stability and abundance, interacting with AU-rich elements in mRNA 3′-UTRs. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of mRNA levels of genes like CCND1 and TPM4, affecting cell proliferation and migration (Fischer2023Heterogenous).
