# OMA1

## Overview
OMA1 is a gene that encodes the OMA1 zinc metallopeptidase, a crucial component of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms. This protein is categorized as a zinc metallopeptidase and is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and integrity. OMA1 is primarily involved in the proteolytic processing of OPA1, a dynamin-like GTPase essential for mitochondrial fusion and morphology. Under normal physiological conditions, OMA1 remains largely inactive; however, it becomes activated in response to various stress stimuli, such as oxidative stress and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. This activation leads to the cleavage of OPA1, promoting mitochondrial fragmentation and facilitating the removal of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy. The activity of OMA1 is modulated by its redox state, with specific cysteine residues being critical for its activation and stability (Bohovych2019Redox; Baker2014Stressinduced). The gene's function is vital for maintaining cellular health, preventing apoptosis, and contributing to metabolic homeostasis (Baker2014Stressinduced; Head2009Inducible).

## Structure
OMA1 is a zinc metallopeptidase that is part of the M48 family of metalloendopeptidases, characterized by a HExxH Zn2+-binding motif essential for its proteolytic activity (Alavi2021OMA1—An). The protein is an integral membrane protease located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, with its active site proposed to be formed by extended α-helical transmembrane domains IV and V, and β-sheet blades connecting α-helices III and IV (Alavi2021OMA1—An). Homology models suggest that OMA1 may have six or seven α-helices traversing the membrane, potentially forming a barrel-shaped cavity similar to the zinc metallopeptidase STE24 (Alavi2021OMA1—An).

OMA1 exists in a semi-oxidized state, with its activity and stability influenced by redox conditions. Two conserved cysteine residues, Cys 272 and Cys 332, form a disulfide bond crucial for the structural stability and activity of the OMA1 complex (Bohovych2019Redox). The protein is largely inactive under normal conditions but becomes activated by stress stimuli, such as oxidative stress, which involves conformational changes within the OMA1 complex (Bohovych2019Redox). The C-terminal region of OMA1 is important for its oligomerization and transition to an active conformer, with specific mutations in this region affecting its function (Bohovych2014Stresstriggered).

## Function
OMA1 is a zinc metallopeptidase that plays a critical role in mitochondrial quality control and dynamics. It is primarily located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is involved in the regulation of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1, a protein essential for mitochondrial fusion and maintaining mitochondrial morphology (Baker2014Stressinduced; Head2009Inducible). Under normal conditions, OMA1 participates in the constitutive processing of OPA1, balancing the long and short isoforms necessary for mitochondrial fusion (Baker2014Stressinduced).

OMA1 is activated in response to various stress conditions, such as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative stress, and metabolic crises. This activation leads to the cleavage of OPA1, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation, which facilitates the removal of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy (Bohovych2019Redox; Baker2014Stressinduced). The proteolytic activity of OMA1 is ATP-independent and is regulated by its redox state, with specific cysteine residues playing a crucial role in its activation and stability (Bohovych2019Redox).

OMA1's function is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and cellular health, as it helps prevent the accumulation of defective mitochondrial fragments, thereby protecting against apoptosis and contributing to metabolic homeostasis (Baker2014Stressinduced; Head2009Inducible).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the OMA1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In metabolic disorders, OMA1 deficiency in mice leads to obesity and metabolic dysfunction, characterized by reduced oxygen consumption and impaired thermogenesis. These mice also exhibit increased body weight and fat content, particularly under high-fat diets, indicating a predisposition to diet-induced obesity (Quirós2012Loss). The absence of OMA1 affects mitochondrial dynamics, leading to a pro-fusion phenotype that contributes to metabolic changes such as hepatic steatosis and altered glucose and insulin tolerance (Quirós2012Loss).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, low OMA1 expression is associated with poor survival outcomes. OMA1 depletion in breast cancer cells enhances cell proliferation, induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and increases migratory properties, suggesting a role in promoting metastatic growth (Daverey2019Depletion). The study indicates that OMA1 may suppress metastasis by regulating actin cytoskeleton reorganization and filopodia formation (Daverey2019Depletion).

OMA1 also plays a role in stress responses, where its activation is linked to mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis. In neurodegeneration and heart failure models, OMA1 activation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, while its genetic ablation can delay apoptosis (Gilkerson2021Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
OMA1, a mitochondrial zinc metallopeptidase, is involved in several critical interactions within the cell. It interacts with the mitochondrial inner membrane protein OPA1, where it cleaves long OPA1 isoforms into short, fusion-inactive isoforms, a process crucial for mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis (Gilkerson2021Mitochondrial; Head2009Inducible). This cleavage is activated by stress stimuli and is essential for mitochondrial fragmentation and the release of cytochrome c, a key step in apoptosis (Gilkerson2021Mitochondrial; Jiang2014Activation).

OMA1 also forms part of large protein complexes within mitochondria, interacting with proteins such as PHB1/2 and OPA1. These interactions are crucial for its function and stability, particularly through its binding with cardiolipin (CL), a lipid that stabilizes OMA1 within the mitochondrial membrane (Anderson2019Prohibitin). The interaction with cardiolipin is necessary for OMA1's activation and turnover, influencing mitochondrial dynamics and respiratory chain stability.

OMA1 is activated by pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, which promote its role in cytochrome c release during apoptosis (Jiang2014Activation). This activation is part of a broader response to mitochondrial stress, linking OMA1 to various cellular stress pathways (Baker2014Stressinduced).
