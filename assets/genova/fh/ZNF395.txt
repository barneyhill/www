# ZNF395

## Overview
ZNF395 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 395, a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including immune response and adipogenesis. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 395 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), particularly in keratinocytes and skin fibroblasts, where it enhances the expression of chemokines such as CXCL10 and CXCL11. It operates independently of the interferon-induced STAT transcription factors, instead modulating gene expression through interactions with NFκB signaling pathways (Schroeder2017ZNF395). Additionally, ZNF395 is transiently expressed during adipogenesis, where it collaborates with PPARG2 to promote adipocyte differentiation (Hasegawa2013Identification). The gene's expression and activity are regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation, highlighting its complex role in cellular function and its potential implications in cancer progression and immune response (Schroeder2017ZNF395; Kurogi2021Downregulation).

## Function
ZNF395 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and is involved in the innate immune response. It acts as an activator of a subset of ISGs, including chemokines such as CXCL10 and CXCL11, particularly in keratinocytes and skin fibroblasts. ZNF395 enhances the IFN-mediated induction of these genes, although its effect on CXCL11 is cell-type specific, being significant in keratinocytes but not in fibroblasts (Schroeder2017ZNF395).

ZNF395 functions independently of interferon-induced STAT transcription factors and instead influences basal promoter activity through NFκB motifs. It interacts with NFκB signaling pathways, where IKK (IκB kinase) is involved in its phosphorylation and degradation, affecting its transcriptional activity (Schroeder2017ZNF395). This regulation is crucial for the activation of immune response genes, indicating ZNF395's role in modulating immune functions in cells (Schroeder2017ZNF395).

In addition to its role in immune response, ZNF395 is involved in adipogenesis, the process by which mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into adipocytes. It is transiently expressed during adipogenesis and enhances adipocyte formation when combined with PPARG2, a key adipogenic transcription factor (Hasegawa2013Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF395 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), downregulation of ZNF395 is associated with enhanced growth potential and progression of the disease. This downregulation is often due to genomic loss and is linked to poorly differentiated histology and a worse prognosis, although the difference in prognosis was not statistically significant (Kurogi2021Downregulation). In liver cancer, ZNF395 acts as a suppressor of metastasis. The gene is downregulated by miR-525-3p, which enhances the migration and invasion of liver cancer cells, suggesting that ZNF395 downregulation contributes to cancer progression (Pang2014MiR5253p).

ZNF395 is also involved in the hypoxic induction of proinflammatory cytokines in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. It is overexpressed in various tumors, including glioblastomas, and is associated with poor prognosis. ZNF395's role in hypoxia-associated inflammation suggests it may contribute to disease progression by enhancing proinflammatory cytokine expression (Herwartz2015The). Additionally, ZNF395 is crucial for the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes, which are important in the antiviral innate immune response (Schroeder2017ZNF395).

## Interactions
ZNF395 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It is involved in the regulation of the CXCL10 promoter, requiring intact NFκB motifs to stimulate transcription. ZNF395 interacts with NFκB subunits, suggesting it may be recruited to the CXCL10 promoter through these interactions or by directly binding to a DNA motif overlapping the NFκB consensus motif (Schroeder2017ZNF395).

ZNF395 is regulated by phosphorylation and is a target of the F-box protein β-TRCP, which is part of the SCF complex that mediates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This degradation is regulated by IKK, which phosphorylates ZNF395, allowing it to activate transcription. The central part of ZNF395 contains a phosphodegron motif recognized by β-TRCP, leading to its degradation (Schroeder2017ZNF395).

ZNF395 also interacts with the NFκB signaling pathway, as its transcriptional activity and turnover are enhanced by IKK. This interaction is crucial for the release of CXCR3 ligands from IFNγ-stimulated cells, independent of NFκB activation (Schroeder2017ZNF395). Additionally, ZNF395 can repress transcription by recruiting the SIN3A/HDAC1 complex through interaction with SAP30 (Herwartz2015The).
