# SP140

## Overview
SP140 is a gene that encodes the SP140 nuclear body protein, a chromatin-associated protein primarily expressed in immune cells such as macrophages, B cells, and T cells. The SP140 protein is characterized by its multi-domain structure, which includes a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, a bromodomain (BRD), a SAND domain, and a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). These domains enable SP140 to function as a chromatin reader and transcriptional repressor, playing a critical role in regulating gene expression and maintaining immune cell identity (Granito2010PML; Zucchelli2019Sp140). SP140 is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and immune response regulation, and interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to maintain chromatin structure and function (Amatullah2021Identification). Mutations in the SP140 gene have been linked to autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis, highlighting its clinical significance in immune regulation and disease pathogenesis (Karaky2018SP140; Fraschilla2022Immune).

## Structure
The SP140 nuclear body protein is a multi-domain protein involved in chromatin-mediated gene expression and immune response regulation. It contains several key domains, including a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, a bromodomain (BRD), a SAND domain, and a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) (Granito2010PML; Zucchelli2019Sp140). The PHD finger and bromodomain are conserved domains that function as reader/effector modules for histone post-translational modifications, allowing SP140 to recognize multivalent histone PTMs (Zucchelli2019Sp140).

The PHD finger acts as a protein-protein interaction platform and promotes the SUMOylation of the adjacent bromodomain, which is a common post-translational modification in SP140, with at least 13 SUMOylation sites identified, including within the BRD (Zucchelli2019Sp140). The PHD-BRD cassette forms an integrated structure with hydrophobic interactions, and the PHD domain shields the BRD's exposed hydrophobic residues (Zucchelli2019Sp140).

SP140 forms a crystallographic dimer in complex with single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), which stabilize the PHD-bromodomain structure without inhibiting its activity (Fairhead2019Strategies). The protein's structure is similar to related proteins SP100 and SP100C, with a high sequence identity of 61% (Fairhead2019Strategies).

## Function
SP140 is a nuclear body protein that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and maintaining immune cell identity in healthy human cells. It is predominantly expressed in immune cells, including macrophages, B cells, and T cells, where it functions as a chromatin reader and transcriptional repressor (Fraschilla2020The). SP140 localizes to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and is involved in repressing lineage-inappropriate genes, thereby preserving the identity of immune cells (Fraschilla2020The).

SP140 interacts with chromatin remodeling proteins and topoisomerases, acting as a negative regulator of topoisomerase enzymes TOP1 and TOP2A/B. This interaction is crucial for maintaining chromatin structure and preventing unsolicited transcription at silent regions, thereby ensuring genome stability (Amatullah2021Identification). The protein's function is influenced by the presence of H3K27me3, a marker of facultative heterochromatin, which helps maintain the integrity of transcriptionally silent regions (Amatullah2021Identification).

SP140 also plays a role in regulating dendritic cell activation and maturation, influencing their potential to induce immune tolerance. It modulates DNA accessibility to transcription factors by recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, thereby controlling inflammatory responses (Ghiboub2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SP140 gene are associated with several autoimmune diseases, including Crohn's disease (CD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In Crohn's disease, loss-of-function mutations in SP140 lead to a pro-inflammatory microbial community, characterized by an increase in pathogenic Proteobacteria, which exacerbates intestinal inflammation (Fraschilla2022Immune). SP140 mutations in CD patients are linked to increased levels of Enterobacteriaceae, contributing to chronic inflammation and treatment failure (Fraschilla2022Immune). 

In multiple sclerosis, the rs28445040-T variant in SP140 affects transcript splicing, reducing protein expression and increasing susceptibility to the disease. This variant leads to the up-regulation of genes involved in cytokine production and inflammatory responses, contributing to MS pathology (Karaky2018SP140). 

SP140 also plays a role in regulating immune-related genes through NF-κB inhibition. Alterations in SP140 expression result in increased NF-κB activity, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like MS and CD (Karaky2018SP140). The gene's interactions with topoisomerases and chromatin remodeling proteins are crucial for maintaining immune cell function, and disruptions in these interactions are linked to immune diseases (Amatullah2021Identification).

## Interactions
SP140, a nuclear body protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in immune regulation. It interacts with chromatin organization and DNA unwinding proteins, including topoisomerases TOP1, TOP2A, and TOP2B, as well as DNA-PK, SUPT16H, SSRP1, and SMARCA5. These interactions are crucial for maintaining chromatin structure and function, and they require structured DNA, as they are disrupted by ethidium bromide (Amatullah2021Identification). SP140 also interacts with histone H3, particularly in the context of inflammation, and binds to transcription start sites of genes such as TNF and IL6 in macrophages (Ghiboub2020Modulation).

SP140 is a target for SUMO-1, with at least 13 SUMOylation sites, including the bromodomain. The PHD finger of SP140 promotes SUMOylation of the adjacent bromodomain, suggesting that SP140's chromatin binding domains create a multifaceted interaction scaffold (Zucchelli2019Sp140). The protein's interactions with transcription factors involved in TNF signaling, such as ATF3, FOSL2, FOSL1, and JUNB, as well as those involved in cytokine-mediated signaling pathways like BATF and IRF8, indicate its role in regulating gene expression related to the innate immune response (Ghiboub2022Modulation).
