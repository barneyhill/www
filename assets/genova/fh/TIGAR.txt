# TIGAR

## Overview
TIGAR, or TP53 induced glycolysis regulatory phosphatase, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism and stress response. The TIGAR protein is a member of the phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) family and functions primarily as a phosphatase, modulating glycolysis and apoptosis by influencing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. It achieves this by hydrolyzing fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, thereby redirecting glycolytic intermediates to the pentose phosphate pathway, which enhances the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and supports cellular antioxidant defenses (Bensaad2009Modulation; Bensaad2006TIGAR). TIGAR's activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing oxidative stress-induced damage, which has implications in cancer development and progression (Bensaad2009Modulation; Bensaad2006TIGAR). The protein's interactions with various cellular pathways underscore its role in regulating metabolism, stress responses, and cell survival, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Geng2019TIGAR; Tang2021Structure).

## Structure
The TIGAR protein, encoded by the human TIGAR gene, consists of 270 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa (Tang2021Structure). It belongs to the phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) family and is characterized by the RHG motif, which includes residues R31, H32, and G33 (Tang2021Structure). The protein features a catalytic domain similar to the histidine phosphatase superfamily, with key catalytic residues H11, H198, and E102 forming a domain akin to the bisphosphatase domain of 6-phosphofructokinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB) (Tang2021Structure).

TIGAR's tertiary structure includes two conserved pockets that bind phosphate molecules, facilitating the dephosphorylation of substrates such as fructose-2,6-diphosphate and fructose-1,6-diphosphate, which are crucial for regulating glucose metabolism (Tang2021Structure). The protein functions as a monomer and lacks a quaternary structure (Tang2021Structure). While the context does not provide specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, these factors may influence TIGAR's activity and stability. The structural conservation across species suggests a fundamental role in cellular metabolism and protection (Tang2021Structure).

## Function
TIGAR (TP53 induced glycolysis regulatory phosphatase) is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular metabolism and stress response. It is primarily involved in the regulation of glycolysis and apoptosis by modulating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. TIGAR functions by hydrolyzing fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, leading to decreased levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and a reduced glycolytic rate (Bensaad2009Modulation; Bensaad2006TIGAR). This activity redirects glycolytic intermediates to the pentose phosphate pathway, increasing the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which is crucial for generating reduced glutathione (GSH) and combating oxidative stress (Bensaad2009Modulation; Bensaad2006TIGAR).

TIGAR's ability to lower ROS levels helps protect cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and DNA damage, contributing to genomic stability and preventing cancer development (Bensaad2009Modulation; Bensaad2006TIGAR). It also plays a role in modulating autophagy, a process that can limit ROS levels by preventing their generation from mitochondria (Bensaad2009Modulation). TIGAR is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular responses to stress and damage, supporting cell survival and metabolic regulation (Bensaad2009Modulation).

## Clinical Significance
TIGAR (TP53 induced glycolysis regulatory phosphatase) plays a significant role in cancer progression and patient prognosis due to its involvement in cellular metabolism and stress response. Overexpression of TIGAR is associated with poor survival outcomes in various cancers, including high-grade serous ovarian cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC), and gastric cancer. In ovarian cancer, high TIGAR expression correlates with poor overall survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance sensitivity to PARP inhibitors like olaparib (Fang2019Genomescale). In AML, high TIGAR expression predicts poor survival and high relapse rates, indicating its role as a prognostic marker (Qian2016TIGAR).

In ESCC, TIGAR overexpression is linked to advanced tumor stages and metastasis, and targeting the glutamine pathway in TIGAR-overexpressing models shows promise for improving chemotherapy efficacy (Chu2019Metabolic). In gastric cancer, TIGAR knockdown reduces cell proliferation and increases sensitivity to oxidative stress and chemotherapy, highlighting its oncogenic role (Liu2019TIGAR). These findings underscore TIGAR's clinical significance as a potential target for cancer therapy.

## Interactions
TIGAR (TP53 induced glycolysis regulatory phosphatase) interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular pathways and functions. It interacts with AKT, leading to the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which promotes tumor growth and metastasis while inhibiting autophagy and apoptosis (Tang2021Structure). TIGAR also inhibits NF-κB signaling by competing with the binding of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) to the HOIP subunit of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), suppressing the E3-conjugating ligase activity of the LUBAC complex (Tang2021Structure).

Under hypoxic conditions, TIGAR translocates to mitochondria, where it interacts with hexokinase 2 (HK2) to enhance its activity, reduce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and maintain cell survival (Tang2021Structure). It also interacts with ATP5A1 in mitochondria, promoting mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress (Geng2019TIGAR; Tang2021Structure).

In the nucleus, TIGAR regulates cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-5-mediated ATM phosphorylation, promoting DNA repair and cell survival under stress (Tang2021Structure). TIGAR's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in regulating cellular metabolism, stress responses, and maintaining genomic stability.
