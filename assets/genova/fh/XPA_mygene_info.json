a central role in nucleotide excision repair (NER), a specialized type of DNA repair. NER is responsible for repair of UV radiation-induced photoproducts and DNA adducts induced by chemical carcinogens and chemotherapeutic drugs. The encoded protein interacts with DNA and several NER proteins, acting as a scaffold to assemble the NER incision complex at sites of DNA damage. Mutations in this gene cause Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XP-A), an autosomal recessive skin disorder featuring hypersensitivity to sunlight and increased risk for skin cancer.
