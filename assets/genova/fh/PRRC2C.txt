# PRRC2C

## Overview
PRRC2C is a gene that encodes the proline-rich coiled-coil 2C protein, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of translation initiation in human cells. The protein is characterized by its proline-rich regions and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, respectively. As a component of ribosomal preinitiation complexes, PRRC2C interacts with eukaryotic initiation factors and ribosomal subunits, influencing the translation of mRNAs with upstream open reading frames (uORFs) (Bohlen2022PRRC2). Additionally, PRRC2C is involved in cellular stress responses, particularly in stress granule formation, and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and preeclampsia (JacoboBaca2020Proteomic; Bohlen2022PRRC2). The protein's ability to bind methylated RNA further suggests a role in RNA stability and regulation (Dansu2022PRMT5).

## Structure
The PRRC2C gene encodes a protein characterized by a proline-rich region, which is significant for facilitating protein-protein interactions. This region is crucial for the protein's role in various cellular processes. The protein also contains coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that promote oligomerization, allowing the protein to form complex structures with other molecules. These domains are integral to the protein's function, as they enable the formation of stable protein assemblies.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to regulate the function of the PRRC2C protein. These modifications can alter the protein's activity, stability, and interactions with other cellular components, thereby influencing its role in cellular processes. The presence of splice variants leads to different isoforms of the PRRC2C protein, which may have distinct structural and functional properties. These isoforms can result in variations in the protein's interaction capabilities and regulatory mechanisms, potentially affecting its involvement in cellular functions. The structural diversity introduced by these splice variants highlights the complexity and adaptability of the PRRC2C protein in human biology.

## Function
PRRC2C is a protein involved in the regulation of translation initiation in human cells, primarily by promoting leaky scanning. This process allows ribosomes to bypass upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and initiate translation at downstream sites, which is crucial for the efficient translation of specific mRNAs (Bohlen2022PRRC2). PRRC2C preferentially associates with ribosomes that are scanning and translating mRNAs with uORFs, showing a higher binding affinity to 80S ribosomes in 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs) compared to coding sequences (Bohlen2022PRRC2).

PRRC2C interacts with eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) such as eIF3 and eIF4, and is associated with preinitiation complexes, indicating its role in the assembly of initiating ribosomes (Bohlen2022PRRC2). It binds ribosomal preinitiation complexes and is enriched on transcripts with translated uORFs, suggesting a specific role in translation initiation for these mRNAs (Bohlen2022PRRC2).

The protein is also involved in cellular stress responses, as it is required for efficient stress granule formation (Bohlen2022PRRC2). PRRC2C's activity is essential for normal cellular function and development, as its knockdown leads to decreased translation rates and impaired cell proliferation (Bohlen2022PRRC2).

## Clinical Significance
PRRC2C is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in translation initiation and alternative splicing. In cancer, particularly lung cancer, PRRC2C undergoes alternative splicing regulated by the oncogenic factor SRSF1. This splicing results in two variants, PRRC2C-L and PRRC2C-S, which influence cell proliferation and apoptosis. The presence of these variants is linked to increased cell growth in lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting a role in cancer progression (de2014Identification). PRRC2C is also associated with preeclampsia, where it is overexpressed in the placentas of affected women, indicating a potential role in the pathophysiology of this condition (JacoboBaca2020Proteomic).

Mutations in PRRC2C have been identified in Burkitt lymphoma, where it is noted for being overexpressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph nodes, although the specific impact of these mutations on the disease is not fully detailed (Kaymaz2017Comprehensive). Additionally, PRRC2C is involved in stress granule formation, and its variants have been linked to familial cholesteatoma, a condition associated with ciliary dysfunction (Cardenas2022Whole). These findings suggest that PRRC2C plays a significant role in various pathological processes, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
PRRC2C is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of translation initiation. It interacts with eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) such as eIF3B, eIF4G1, and eIF4E, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions suggest that PRRC2C is a component of ribosomal preinitiation complexes, binding to the ribosomal 40S component RPS15 (Bohlen2022PRRC2). PRRC2C is also associated with ribosomes that are scanning and translating mRNAs with upstream open reading frames (uORFs), showing a preference for binding to 40S and 80S ribosomes in the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of these mRNAs (Bohlen2022PRRC2).

In addition to its role in translation, PRRC2C is overexpressed in preeclampsia cases and interacts with EHMT2, an epigenetic regulator involved in placental development. This interaction suggests a role for PRRC2C in the transition from placental development to maturation (JacoboBaca2020Proteomic). PRRC2C is also noted for its ability to bind methylated RNA, indicating its involvement in RNA stability and possibly nuclear/cytosolic shuttling (Dansu2022PRMT5). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PRRC2C in cellular processes, particularly in translation and RNA regulation.
