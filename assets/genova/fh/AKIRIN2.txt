# AKIRIN2

## Overview
AKIRIN2 is a gene that encodes the nuclear protein akirin 2, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and various cellular processes. Akirin 2 is a small, non-catalytic protein that lacks recognizable DNA-binding domains but is involved in significant protein-protein interactions, particularly within the context of immune response and chromatin remodeling (Bosch2020Akirin; Tartey2015Chromatin). The protein is integral to several signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, and is essential for the regulation of genes involved in immune responses, such as IL-6 and IL-12b (Bosch2020Akirin; Tartey2015Chromatin). Akirin 2's interactions with transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes underscore its importance in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis prevention (Bosch2020Akirin; Tartey2015Essential). Additionally, alterations in AKIRIN2 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Leng2019Akirin2; Sun2022Identification).

## Structure
The Akirin2 protein is a small nuclear protein with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 22 kDa, encoded by a gene consisting of 5 exons and 4 introns (Bosch2020Akirin). Its primary structure includes a sequence of 192 amino acids (Ma2015Molecular). The secondary structure of Akirin2 is composed of approximately 46.88% α-helix, 49.48% random coil, and 3.65% extended strand (Ma2015Molecular). Structurally, Akirin2 contains two helical structures, one within the C-terminus and one within its central region, while the rest of the sequence is predicted to be intrinsically disordered (Bosch2020Akirin).

Akirin2 has a common N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) shared with Akirin1, and an additional NLS not shared with fly Akirin or Akirin1, which is essential for nuclear localization (Bosch2020Akirin). It also has five confirmed binding sites for 14-3-3β proteins (Bosch2020Akirin). Although Akirin proteins lack homology to recognizable catalytic or DNA-binding domains, predicted DNA-binding sites in the C-terminal half of Akirin2 have been identified in silico, suggesting potential DNA-binding capabilities, though these have not been experimentally confirmed (Bosch2020Akirin).

## Function
The AKIRIN2 gene encodes a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, Akirin2 is involved in several signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which influences cell cycle progression, proliferation, and differentiation (Bosch2020Akirin). It interacts with transcription factors such as NF-κB, forming complexes that regulate the expression of genes like IL-6 and IL-12b, which are crucial for immune responses (Bosch2020Akirin; Tartey2015Chromatin).

Akirin2 also plays a role in chromatin remodeling by interacting with proteins like 14-3-3β, which are involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation and apoptosis (Bosch2020Akirin; Tartey2015Chromatin). This interaction is essential for the regulation of gene promoters and transcriptional activity. Akirin2's involvement in the calcineurin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways highlights its importance in muscle function and development (Bosch2020Akirin).

In the context of immune function, Akirin2 is critical for B cell activation and humoral immune responses, influencing cell cycle progression and apoptosis prevention in response to stimuli (Tartey2015Essential). Its role in recruiting chromatin remodelers to gene promoters is vital for B cell cycling and proliferation (Tartey2015Essential).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AKIRIN2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). In GA, AKIRIN2 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor overall survival, making it an independent risk factor for prognosis (Sun2022Identification). High AKIRIN2 expression in GA is also linked to increased immune cell infiltration and may predict better responses to PD-1 inhibitor treatments and certain chemotherapy drugs (Sun2022Identification).

In CCA, AKIRIN2 is overexpressed in tumor tissues, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor patient outcomes. It promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis by upregulating VEGFA expression through the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. Knockdown of AKIRIN2 in CCA cells results in reduced tumor growth and metastatic potential, highlighting its role in tumor progression (Leng2019Akirin2). AKIRIN2 expression is negatively regulated by miR-490-3p, which can inhibit cancer cell migration and angiogenesis, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Leng2019Akirin2).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of AKIRIN2 in cancer, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
AKIRIN2 is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in transcription regulation and immune response. It interacts with the NFκB subunit p50, but not with p65/RelA, following immune system stimulation in mammalian cells. This interaction is part of a complex with the atypical IκB-like protein, IκBζ, forming a bridge complex with p50-Akirin2-IκBζ that regulates the transcription of IL-6 and IL-12b genes (Bosch2020Akirin). AKIRIN2 also interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the BAF complex, and is crucial for recruiting these complexes to specific promoter regions, affecting gene expression (Bosch2020Akirin).

In addition, AKIRIN2 interacts with 14-3-3β proteins, having five putative binding sites necessary for this interaction. The AKIRIN2/14-3-3β complex binds to the MKP1 and BCAM promoters, leading to gene repression (Bosch2020Akirin). AKIRIN2 also interacts with transcription factors like Gtf2ird1 and Geminin, although the significance of these interactions is not fully understood (Bosch2020Akirin). In human placenta cells, AKIRIN2 interacts with proteins such as RNF10 and THRAP5, as identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by in vitro assays (ArtigasJerónimo2020A). These interactions suggest AKIRIN2's involvement in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and immune response.
