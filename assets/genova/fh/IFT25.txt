# IFT25

## Overview
IFT25 is a gene that encodes the protein intraflagellar transport 25, which is a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT complex B. This protein plays a significant role in the anterograde transport of protein cargo along the axoneme, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella in eukaryotic cells (Taschner2012Architecture; Wang2009Intraflagellar). IFT25 is particularly important in certain cell types, such as male germ cells, where it is vital for the formation of sperm flagella, thereby impacting sperm motility and fertility (Liu2017IFT25). The protein forms a subcomplex with IFT27, which is involved in the regulation of IFT initiation, and interacts with other IFT proteins, such as IFT20 and IFT81, suggesting a role in stabilizing these proteins within the IFT system (Liu2017IFT25; Wang2009Intraflagellar).

## Function
IFT25 is a protein involved in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically as a component of the IFT complex B. This complex is essential for the anterograde transport of protein cargo along the axoneme, a critical process for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella in eukaryotic cells (Taschner2012Architecture; Wang2009Intraflagellar). In humans, IFT25 interacts with IFT27, forming a subcomplex that plays a regulatory role in the initiation of IFT by associating and dissociating with the IFT-B complex (Taschner2012Architecture; Wang2009Intraflagellar).

IFT25 is not required for ciliogenesis in somatic cells, indicating a specialized role in certain cell types, such as male germ cells, where it is crucial for sperm flagella formation (Liu2017IFT25). The protein is highly expressed in the testis and is essential for the proper formation of sperm flagella, impacting sperm motility and fertility (Liu2017IFT25). IFT25's interaction with other IFT proteins, such as IFT20 and IFT81, suggests it may stabilize these proteins, contributing to their function in the IFT system (Liu2017IFT25).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT25 gene are associated with significant developmental defects and impaired Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, which are critical for proper embryonic development. In mice, the absence of IFT25 results in severe heart defects, omphaloceles, polydactyly, micrognathia, cleft palate, and malalignment of the sternal vertebrae, leading to death at birth (Yang2015Cilia). These findings suggest that IFT25 is crucial for the exit of Smo and Ptch1 from cilia and for Gli2 accumulation at the ciliary tip in response to Hh pathway activation, indicating its essential role in Hh signaling (Yang2015Cilia).

In the context of male fertility, IFT25 is indispensable for sperm flagella formation. Conditional knockout mice lacking IFT25 exhibit complete infertility due to severe defects in spermatogenesis, characterized by abnormal sperm morphology, including misshaped heads and tails, and reduced sperm count (Liu2017IFT25). The absence of IFT25 leads to the loss of IFT27 and reduced levels of other IFT proteins, such as IFT20 and IFT81, suggesting a regulatory role in the expression of these proteins (Liu2017IFT25). These abnormalities highlight the critical role of IFT25 in sperm development and its potential impact on male infertility (Liu2017IFT25).

## Interactions
IFT25 is known to physically interact with IFT27, forming a subcomplex that is part of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex B. This interaction has been demonstrated in various organisms, including Chlamydomonas, mice, and T. brucei. In Chlamydomonas, in vitro pull-down assays confirmed the direct binding between recombinant MBP-IFT25 and GST-IFT27 proteins, indicating a specific interaction (Wang2009Intraflagellar). In mice, yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that IFT25 directly interacts with IFT27, and this interaction is crucial for the stability and expression of other IFT proteins, such as IFT20 and IFT81, in male germ cells (Liu2017IFT25). In T. brucei, IFT25 interacts with IFT27 and IFT22, forming a module essential for IFT trafficking and flagellum construction (Huet2018IFT25).

IFT25 is also involved in forming a complex with other IFT-B proteins, including IFT20 and IFT81, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mice (Liu2017IFT25). The interaction between IFT25 and IFT27 is suggested to have a regulatory role in IFT initiation, potentially involving a GTPase activation protein (Taschner2012Architecture).
