# CHD9NB

## Overview
The CHD9NB gene encodes the CHD9 neighbor protein, which is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family. This family is characterized by its role in chromatin remodeling, which is crucial for regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. The CHD9 neighbor protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. Although the specific functions of CHD9NB are not fully elucidated, it is believed to interact with other proteins and pathways to influence cellular dynamics and development. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of CHD9NB in health and disease, as well as its potential interactions with other molecular pathways.
