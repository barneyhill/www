# C3AR1

## Overview
C3AR1 is a gene that encodes the complement C3a receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the immune response. The receptor, known as C3aR1, is a seven-transmembrane protein that primarily binds to the complement component C3a, a peptide generated during the activation of the complement system. This interaction triggers intracellular signaling pathways that mediate various immune responses, including chemotaxis, degranulation, and cytokine release. C3aR1 is expressed on a variety of immune cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, as well as on non-myeloid cells like endothelial and epithelial cells. Beyond its role in the immune system, C3aR1 is implicated in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and muscle regeneration, highlighting its diverse biological functions (Zhang2017Complement; Pekna2021Targeting; Klos2009The; Coulthard2015Is).

## Structure
The C3aR1 protein is a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is primarily recognized as the receptor for the complement activation product C3a. It shares approximately 57% sequence homology with C5aR1, another GPCR whose structure has been resolved, providing insights into the orthosteric binding site of C3aR1 (Sahu2021The). The receptor's primary structure includes key residues such as R161, R340, and D417, which are crucial for ligand binding and activation. Mutations in these residues prevent C3a binding and activation, highlighting their importance in the receptor's function (Sahu2021The).

C3aR1's secondary structure likely includes helical regions typical of GPCRs, although its exact 3D structure has not been resolved. The receptor undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are important for its internalization and recycling (Coulthard2015Is). C3aR1 can form dimers or oligomers, contributing to its quaternary structure, which is a common feature among GPCRs. The receptor is involved in various signaling pathways, including Gi/o protein activation and β-arrestin recruitment, and is expressed in multiple tissues, with predominant expression in immune cells like macrophages (Rowley2020Potent; Sahu2021The).

## Function
The C3AR1 gene encodes the complement C3a receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in the immune response. This receptor specifically binds to the complement component C3a, a peptide generated during the activation of the complement system. Upon binding C3a, C3AR1 initiates intracellular signaling pathways that involve heterotrimeric G-proteins, leading to various cellular responses such as chemotaxis, degranulation, and cytokine release (Klos2009The; Coulthard2015Is).

C3AR1 is expressed on a wide range of immune cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, as well as on non-myeloid cells like endothelial and epithelial cells. In neutrophils, C3AR1 activation does not induce chemoattraction but prevents their mobilization into circulation, counteracting neutrophil-mobilizing factors (Coulthard2015Is). In monocytes and macrophages, C3aR signaling, especially when co-stimulated with TLR-4, induces the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, suggesting a role in chronic inflammation (Coulthard2015Is).

In the central nervous system, C3AR1 is involved in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, influencing neuronal differentiation and maturation through the ERK1/2 pathway (Pekna2021Targeting). The receptor also plays a role in muscle regeneration by regulating macrophage recruitment to injured muscle tissue, which is essential for effective muscle repair (Zhang2017Complement).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the C3AR1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving neuroinflammation and cancer. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tauopathies, C3AR1 is associated with neuroinflammatory processes. Inactivation of C3AR1 in mouse models of tauopathy, such as PS19 mice, has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation, improve synaptic function, and decrease tau pathology. This suggests that C3AR1 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD by regulating inflammatory and immune responses (Litvinchuk2018Complement).

In cancer, C3AR1 mutations and expression levels are linked to tumor progression and patient prognosis. The gene exhibits a mutation frequency of 14% across various cancer types, with missense mutations being the most common. These mutations are associated with prolonged survival in certain cancer cohorts, such as stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Additionally, C3AR1 expression is correlated with immune evasion mechanisms and therapy resistance in tumors, influencing cancer progression and treatment outcomes (Lawal2021PanCancer).

C3AR1 is also involved in optic nerve degeneration in glaucoma, where its deficiency reduces neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, highlighting its role in neuroinflammatory conditions (Harder2020Complement).

## Interactions
C3AR1, or complement C3a receptor 1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It is a G-protein coupled receptor that interacts with beta-arrestins, which are known to regulate receptor signaling and internalization. This interaction is significant in the context of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, where C3AR1, along with C5AR1, is necessary for the activation of RTKs such as EGFR, PDGFR, and VEGFR2. These interactions are crucial for processes like cell growth and survival, as they modulate the phosphorylation states of these receptors and their downstream signaling intermediates, including Src, AKT, and ERK (Strainic2019RTK).

C3AR1 also plays a role in immune cell interactions, particularly with microglia and macrophages. It is involved in the regulation of immune checkpoints and immune cell infiltration, impacting the tumor microenvironment in ovarian cancer (Huang2023Prognostic). In the context of neuroinflammation, C3AR1 is expressed in microglia and is implicated in optic nerve degeneration, where it interacts with signaling pathways such as IL10 in microglia (Harder2020Complement). These interactions highlight C3AR1's role in both immune and neuroinflammatory processes.
