# PPP1R14D

## Overview
The PPP1R14D gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 14D, a regulatory protein that functions as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). This protein plays a crucial role in modulating various cellular processes by inhibiting PP1, an enzyme involved in muscle contraction, glycogen metabolism, and cell division. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with PP1 to regulate its activity, thereby influencing cellular signaling and homeostasis (Lang2020The). The activity of the protein is modulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its inhibitory effect on PP1, impacting processes such as actomyosin contractility (Lang2020The). PPP1R14D is also implicated in cancer biology, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, where it is involved in the PKCα/BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration (Cao2022PPP1R14D).

## Function
PPP1R14D encodes a protein that functions as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a critical enzyme involved in various cellular processes such as muscle contraction, glycogen metabolism, and cell division. By inhibiting PP1, PPP1R14D plays a significant role in modulating these processes, impacting cellular signaling and homeostasis. The protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with PP1 to influence its activity (Lang2020The).

In healthy human cells, PPP1R14D is part of the regulatory subunits that modulate the activity of PP1, which is essential for maintaining cellular functions. The inhibition of PP1 by PPP1R14D can affect the phosphorylation state of various proteins, thereby influencing cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and signal transduction pathways. This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and ensuring proper cellular responses to external stimuli (Lang2020The).

The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its inhibitory effect on PP1. This modulation of PP1 activity by PPP1R14D is vital for processes like actomyosin contractility, which is important for muscle function and other cellular movements (Lang2020The).

## Clinical Significance
PPP1R14D has been implicated in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Studies have shown that PPP1R14D is overexpressed in LUAD tissues compared to normal lung tissues, and this overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis. High levels of PPP1R14D correlate with advanced cancer stages and are linked to shorter overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with LUAD (Cao2022PPP1R14D). The knockdown of PPP1R14D in LUAD cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting that PPP1R14D plays a significant role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Cao2022PPP1R14D).

Mechanistically, PPP1R14D is thought to promote LUAD progression through the PKCα/BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Knockdown of PPP1R14D results in decreased levels of phosphorylated proteins in this pathway, indicating its role in activating these signaling cascades (Cao2022PPP1R14D). These findings suggest that PPP1R14D could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in LUAD (Cao2022PPP1R14D). Further research is needed to explore the in vivo effects and the internal mechanisms of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in regulating proteins after PPP1R14D knockdown (Cao2022PPP1R14D).

## Interactions
PPP1R14D, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is involved in several protein interactions that modulate its function. It acts as a potent inhibitor of PP1 when phosphorylated at threonine 58 by Protein Kinase-C (PKC), but this inhibitory effect can be abolished by phosphorylation at threonine 32 by Protein Kinase-A (PKA) (Karthik2011Characterization). PPP1R14D interacts with PP1 at its RVXF motif, which is crucial for substrate specificity and localization, influencing processes such as glycogen metabolism and cellular signaling pathways (Karthik2011Characterization).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, PPP1R14D is implicated in the activation of the PKCα/BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. This interaction promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Knockdown of PPP1R14D results in decreased levels of phosphorylated PKCα, BRAF, MEK1, and ERK1/2, indicating its role in this signaling cascade (Cao2022PPP1R14D). These interactions suggest that PPP1R14D may reverse PKC regulation by affecting PP1 activity, thereby influencing the expression of proteins such as c-Myc, MMP2, and MMP9 through the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway (Cao2022PPP1R14D).
