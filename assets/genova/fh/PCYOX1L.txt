# PCYOX1L

## Overview
PCYOX1L is a gene that encodes the prenylcysteine oxidase 1 like protein, which is involved in the metabolism of prenylated proteins. This protein plays a significant role in the degradation of prenylcysteine, a process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cellular signaling. As a cytosolic enzyme, prenylcysteine oxidase 1 like is essential for the catabolism of geranylgeranylcysteine substrates, impacting the functionality of small GTPases and other proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways (He2023Long; Petenkova2023Prenylcysteine). The protein is particularly important in immune cells such as neutrophils, where it supports processes necessary for effective immune responses, including respiratory burst and phagocytosis (Petenkova2023Prenylcysteine). Additionally, PCYOX1L is implicated in the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis through its interaction with non-coding RNAs, highlighting its broader significance in human health and disease (He2023Long).

## Function
The PCYOX1L gene encodes the prenylcysteine oxidase 1 like protein, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of prenylated proteins. These proteins undergo a post-translational modification known as prenylation, where a prenyl group is added to facilitate membrane attachment and protein-protein interactions. PCYOX1L is involved in the degradation of prenylcysteine, a process that impacts cellular signaling pathways and helps maintain cellular homeostasis (He2023Long).

In healthy human cells, PCYOX1L is active in the cytosol, where it influences processes such as cell growth and differentiation. The protein's activity is linked to the catabolism of geranylgeranylcysteine substrates, which is essential for maintaining normal levels of protein prenylation. This function is critical for the proper operation of small GTPases and other proteins involved in cellular signaling (Petenkova2023Prenylcysteine).

PCYOX1L's role in the prenylation pathway is significant for the functionality of neutrophils, a type of immune cell. Proper prenylation is necessary for neutrophil functions such as respiratory burst, phagolysosome maturation, and phagocytosis, which are vital for bactericidal activities and immune defense mechanisms (Petenkova2023Prenylcysteine).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PCYOX1L gene have been linked to various clinical conditions. PCYOX1L deficiency is associated with impaired neutrophil bactericidal activities, leading to increased susceptibility to infections, particularly those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This is evidenced by significant ocular pathology and increased corneal bacterial burden in Pcyox1l knockout mice compared to wild-type mice, despite increased neutrophil infiltration in infected tissues (Petenkova2023Prenylcysteine). The deficiency results in reduced de novo protein prenylation, affecting the mevalonate pathway and leading to compromised neutrophil functionality, including reduced reactive oxygen species release and diminished bactericidal activities (Petenkova2023Prenylcysteine).

PCYOX1L is also implicated in the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The long non-coding RNA CRNDE promotes DVT by sequestering miR-181a-5p, which affects PCYOX1L expression. Alterations in PCYOX1L expression, mediated by the CRNDE/miR-181a-5p axis, contribute to thrombus formation and vascular inflammation. Silencing CRNDE or overexpressing miR-181a-5p reduces thrombus formation, while ectopic expression of PCYOX1L counteracts these effects, highlighting its role in thrombogenic processes (He2023Long).

## Interactions
PCYOX1L (prenylcysteine oxidase 1 like) is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing various biological processes. In the context of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), PCYOX1L is regulated by the long non-coding RNA CRNDE, which sequesters miR-181a-5p, a microRNA that can bind to and inhibit PCYOX1L mRNA. This interaction suggests that CRNDE acts as a molecular sponge for miR-181a-5p, thereby allowing the expression of PCYOX1L, which is implicated in thrombus formation (He2023Long). The study highlights a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network involving CRNDE, miR-181a-5p, and PCYOX1L, suggesting that CRNDE promotes DVT by modulating the availability of miR-181a-5p, which in turn affects PCYOX1L expression (He2023Long).

In neutrophils, PCYOX1L is crucial for the proper functioning of the mevalonate pathway, which is important for protein prenylation and cellular viability. The loss of PCYOX1L results in reduced bactericidal properties of neutrophils, as demonstrated in knockout mice, which show increased susceptibility to infections (Petenkova2023Prenylcysteine). These interactions highlight the role of PCYOX1L in immune response and thrombosis.
