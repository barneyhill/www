# LCE3E

## Overview
LCE3E (late cornified envelope 3E) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a crucial component of the skin's protective barrier. The LCE3E protein is categorized as a structural protein, playing a significant role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis. This protein is expressed during the late stages of keratinocyte differentiation, contributing to the structural integrity and barrier function of the skin (Hoss2013Control; Niehues2016Late). The LCE3E protein is particularly active in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum layers of the epidermis, indicating its involvement in the early steps of epidermal formation and differentiation (Niehues2016Late). Its role in maintaining skin integrity is vital for the skin's ability to repair itself and protect against environmental insults, dehydration, pathogens, and physical damage (Karrys2018Bioactive).

## Structure


## Function
LCE3E (late cornified envelope 3E) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a critical component of the skin's protective barrier. This protein is part of the LCE gene cluster, which plays a significant role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis. LCE3E is expressed during the late stages of keratinocyte differentiation, contributing to the structural integrity and barrier function of the skin (Hoss2013Control; Niehues2016Late).

The LCE3E protein is active in the epidermis, particularly in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum layers, but not in the stratum corneum. This expression pattern suggests its involvement in the early steps of epidermal formation and differentiation (Niehues2016Late). The protein's role in maintaining skin integrity is crucial, as it helps form the cornified envelope by crosslinking structural proteins, thereby enhancing the skin's barrier function against environmental insults (Hoss2013Control).

In healthy human cells, LCE3E contributes to the skin's ability to repair itself and maintain its protective functions, which are essential for preventing dehydration and protecting against pathogens and physical damage (Karrys2018Bioactive).

## Clinical Significance
The LCE3E gene, part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster, plays a significant role in skin barrier function. Alterations in the expression of LCE3E have been implicated in psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. The deletion of neighboring LCE3B and LCE3C genes is a known genetic risk factor for psoriasis, and the upregulation of LCE3E, along with other LCE3 genes, may help compensate for this loss, potentially aiding in skin repair and improving psoriasis treatment outcomes (Hoss2013Control).

Research indicates that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and plant-derived delphinidin can upregulate LCE3E expression, suggesting a therapeutic role in psoriasis by enhancing skin barrier integrity (Hoss2013Control). The LCE3D-LCE3E locus has been identified as a significant genetic susceptibility region for psoriasis, highlighting the importance of genetic variations in this area (Zuo2015Wholeexome). These findings underscore the potential clinical significance of LCE3E in managing psoriasis and possibly other skin disorders associated with barrier dysfunction.
