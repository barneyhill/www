# PAK1IP1

## Overview
PAK1IP1 (p21-activated kinase 1 interacting protein 1) is a gene located on chromosome 6p24.2 that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle regulation. The protein, also named PAK1 interacting protein 1, is characterized by its WD40 repeat motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its role in the nucleolus, particularly in the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Ross2013A). Functionally, PAK1IP1 acts as a negative regulator of the serine-threonine kinase PAK1, influencing pathways related to gene expression, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell proliferation (Ross2013A). It also interacts with the tumor protein 53 (Tp53)-murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) loop, playing a significant role in cellular stress responses and craniofacial development (Ross2013A; Panoutsopoulos2020Pak1ip1). Mutations in PAK1IP1 have been linked to developmental disorders, particularly those affecting craniofacial structures, highlighting its clinical significance (Ross2013A).

## Structure
The PAK1IP1 protein is approximately 50 kDa in size and is predominantly composed of five WD40 repeats, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Ross2013A). These WD40 repeats are structural motifs that form a beta-propeller architecture, allowing the protein to engage in various molecular interactions. The mutation in the Pak1ip1 gene, specifically a C to T transition, results in the substitution of a histidine residue with a tyrosine residue in the first position of the third WD40 repeat, indicating the importance of this region for the protein's function (Ross2013A).

PAK1IP1 localizes to the nucleolus and plays a role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Ross2013A). It interacts with the tumor protein 53 (Tp53)-murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) loop, suggesting a regulatory role in cell growth and proliferation under cellular stress conditions (Ross2013A). The protein's interaction with Mdm2 and its involvement in ribosomal RNA processing highlight its complex role in cellular function. However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
PAK1IP1 (PAK1 interacting protein 1) is a gene located on chromosome 6p24.2 that encodes a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it plays a crucial role in ribosomal RNA processing, thereby regulating cell growth and proliferation (Ross2013A). PAK1IP1 functions as a negative regulator of the serine-threonine kinase Pak1, influencing various cellular processes such as gene expression, cytoskeletal assembly, and cell cycle control (Ross2013A).

In healthy cells, PAK1IP1 interacts with the tumor protein 53 (Tp53)-murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) loop, particularly under conditions of cellular stress. This interaction is crucial for maintaining normal cell growth and proliferation by regulating the Tp53 pathway, either indirectly by activating ribosomal proteins that signal nucleolar stress or directly by inhibiting Mdm2's ability to ubiquitinate Tp53 (Ross2013A). The protein's role in ribosome biogenesis and its regulatory function in the cell cycle are essential for normal cellular function and development, particularly in craniofacial morphogenesis (Ross2013A; Panoutsopoulos2020Pak1ip1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PAK1IP1 gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders, particularly those affecting craniofacial structures. In mice, a mutation in the Pak1ip1 gene leads to significant craniofacial defects, including median orofacial clefting, which is characterized by improper formation of the mouth or palate (Ross2013A). This mutation results in increased Tp53 activity, causing cell cycle arrest and reduced proliferation in developing palatal shelves, contributing to craniofacial hypoplasia (Ross2013A). The gene's role in ribosome biogenesis and its interaction with the Tp53-Mdm2 loop are crucial for cell growth and proliferation, and disruptions in these processes can lead to ribosomopathies, which are disorders characterized by impaired ribosome biogenesis and associated with craniofacial and skeletal defects (Panoutsopoulos2020Pak1ip1).

In humans, although no deleterious variants in the PAK1IP1 coding region have been found, a borderline association with SNP rs494723 has been identified, suggesting a possible involvement in orofacial clefting (Ross2013A). The gene is located near translocation breaking points on chromosome 6p24.1, which are linked to craniofacial pathologies such as cleft lip and palate (Ross2013A). These findings underscore the potential clinical significance of PAK1IP1 in contributing to craniofacial dysmorphologies.

## Interactions
PAK1IP1 (PAK1 interacting protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It acts as a negative regulator of the serine-threonine kinase PAK1 by interacting with its N-terminal regulatory domain, thereby inhibiting PAK1's activation by blocking the binding sites of Rac and Cdc42. This interaction plays a role in regulating gene expression, cytoskeletal assembly, and cell cycle control (LIU2014Anticancer; Ross2013A).

PAK1IP1 also localizes to the nucleolus, where it is involved in ribosome biogenesis. It interacts with the tumor protein 53 (Tp53)-murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) loop, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation. PAK1IP1 can induce the Tp53-Mdm2 loop by either activating ribosomal proteins Rpl5 and Rpl11, which act as nucleolar stress signals, or by inhibiting Mdm2's ability to ubiquitinate Tp53. This interaction is significant because it can lead to Tp53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest (Ross2013A; Panoutsopoulos2020Pak1ip1).

In addition, PAK1IP1 has been identified as part of a network of gene-node interactions, including with DDX56, a putative RNA helicase involved in spliceosome assembly and translation initiation (Félix2018Functional).
