# PDPK1

## Overview
PDPK1, or 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in critical cellular signaling pathways. The protein product of PDPK1 plays a pivotal role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell growth, survival, and metabolism. As a kinase, PDPK1 phosphorylates and activates several members of the AGC kinase family, including protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), and various protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, thereby influencing numerous cellular processes (Bayascas2008Dissecting; VANHAESEBROECK2000The). The protein is characterized by a catalytic domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitate its interaction with phosphoinositides and its localization to the plasma membrane (Alessi19973Phosphoinositidedependent). PDPK1's activity is crucial for mediating insulin-induced processes and maintaining glucose homeostasis, underscoring its importance in metabolic regulation (Alessi19973Phosphoinositidedependent). The gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and metabolic disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Maurer20093Phosphoinositide–Dependent; Bayascas2008Mutation).

## Structure
The PDPK1 protein, also known as 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by a catalytic domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The catalytic domain spans residues 84-341 and includes classical kinase subdomains I-XI, showing structural similarity to the PKA, PKC, and PKBα subfamilies (Alessi19973Phosphoinositidedependent). The PH domain, located at the C-terminus, is involved in protein-lipid interactions and is crucial for binding phosphoinositides, facilitating membrane localization (Alessi19973Phosphoinositidedependent). 

The PH domain of PDPK1 has a unique 'budded' structure, featuring an N-terminal extension with two additional beta strands and an alpha helix, forming a hydrophobic core with the standard PH domain (Komander2004Structural). This domain binds phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which is essential for its role in signaling pathways (Komander2004Structural).

PDPK1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulate its activity. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing for functional diversity (Alessi19973Phosphoinositidedependent). The structural features of PDPK1, including its PH domain and catalytic domain, are highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular signaling.

## Function
PDPK1, also known as 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, plays a crucial role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is vital for regulating cell growth, survival, and metabolism. It is a Ser/Thr kinase that phosphorylates and activates several members of the AGC kinase family, including protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), and various protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (Bayascas2008Dissecting; VANHAESEBROECK2000The). 

PDPK1 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Its activity is dependent on its interaction with phosphoinositides, such as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which facilitates its translocation to the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of PKB (Anderson1998Translocation; VANHAESEBROECK2000The). This translocation is crucial for PKB activation, as PDPK1 phosphorylates PKB at the Thr308 residue, a necessary step for PKB's full activation (Alessi19973Phosphoinositidedependent; Anderson1998Translocation).

In healthy cells, PDPK1's activation of PKB is essential for mediating insulin-induced processes, such as glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, contributing to overall glucose homeostasis (Alessi19973Phosphoinositidedependent; Bayascas2008Dissecting). Its role in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal metabolic balance.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PDPK1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and metabolic disorders. In breast carcinoma, PDPK1 is often overexpressed, which enhances the oncogenic effects of upstream lesions in the PI3K pathway, such as ERBB2 amplification and PTEN loss. This overexpression is associated with tumor growth and resistance to PI3K pathway inhibitors, impacting patient survival (Maurer20093Phosphoinositide–Dependent).

In colorectal cancer, genetic inactivation of PDPK1 leads to reduced metastasis, highlighting its role in cancer progression. The disruption of PDPK1 affects the phosphorylation of key proteins involved in tumor growth and metastasis, such as AKT and mTOR (Ericson2010Genetic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, the pseudogene PDPK2P interacts with PDPK1, promoting cancer progression through the PDK1/AKT/caspase 3 pathway. This interaction enhances PDK1 protein levels, contributing to increased cell proliferation and survival (Pan2019lncRNA‐PDPK2P).

Mutations in the PDK1 gene, such as the K465E mutation, lead to insulin resistance and reduced body size in mice. This mutation affects the phosphorylation of PKB/AKT, crucial for insulin signaling, and results in glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia (Bayascas2008Mutation).

## Interactions
PDPK1 (3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1) is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It plays a significant role in the PI3K-PDPK1-AKT1-MTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for brain development and is associated with neurodevelopmental diseases (Hu2020PDPK1). PDPK1 interacts with PIK3C3, a protein essential for autophagy, and this interaction is enhanced by SUMOylation and phosphorylation at Ser241 (Hu2020PDPK1). NonSUMOylated PDPK1 is involved in lipid delivery to expanding phagophores, acting as a bridge between the ER and LC3, and is associated with the autophagosome membrane (Hu2020PDPK1).

PDPK1 also interacts with AKT1, a key component of the AKT signaling pathway. The interaction between PDPK1 and AKT1 is targeted by the compound NSC156529, which inhibits the AKT1-PDPK1 interaction, reducing AKT1 signaling and cancer cell proliferation (MäemetsAllas2015A). This interaction is crucial for the activation of AKT1, as PDPK1 phosphorylates AKT1 at T308, a key step in its activation (MäemetsAllas2015A). These interactions highlight PDPK1's role in regulating autophagy and the AKT signaling pathway, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and other diseases.
