# SCAF11

## Overview
SCAF11, or SR-related CTD associated factor 11, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA processing and transcription regulation. The protein, also named SCAF11, is characterized by its interactions with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complexes, suggesting a role in transcription elongation and termination (Gregersen2019SCAF4). As a member of the SR-related protein family, SCAF11 is implicated in various cellular processes, including immune response modulation and post-transcriptional regulation, particularly in cancer contexts such as breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (Chu2022A; Li2022Identification). Its expression levels have been associated with clinical outcomes in breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Chu2022A).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
SCAF11 has been implicated in breast cancer (BRCA) as a gene with significant prognostic value. High expression levels of SCAF11 are associated with poor clinical outcomes in BRCA patients, suggesting its role in promoting tumor progression. Knockdown experiments in BRCA cell lines have shown that reducing SCAF11 expression suppresses cell proliferation and colony formation, indicating its tumor-promoting role (Chu2022A). SCAF11 is also positively correlated with immune checkpoints such as PD-L1, B7H3, and PDCD1LG2, suggesting it may influence the immune microenvironment and response to immunotherapy in BRCA patients (Chu2022A).

The gene is part of a seven-gene signature used to predict prognosis in BRCA, with high expression levels correlating with poor survival rates. This signature, which includes SCAF11, has been validated in external datasets, confirming its prognostic value (Chu2022A). Functional enrichment analyses have shown that SCAF11 co-expressed genes are involved in immune and inflammation-related pathways, further supporting its role in cancer progression and immune regulation (Chu2022A). These findings suggest that SCAF11 could be a potential therapeutic target in BRCA, particularly in the context of immunotherapy.

## Interactions
SCAF11 (SR-related CTD associated factor 11) is involved in various interactions that influence its role in RNA processing and transcription regulation. It is known to interact with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complexes, as indicated by studies showing that SCAF11, along with SCAF1, consistently interacts with both SCAF4 and SCAF8 through a common interaction with RNAPII (Gregersen2019SCAF4). This suggests that SCAF11 may participate in the regulation of transcription elongation and termination processes.

In the context of breast cancer, SCAF11 expression is positively correlated with several immune checkpoints, including PD-L1, B7H3, and PDCD1LG2, indicating its potential role in modulating the immune response (Chu2022A). SCAF11 is also linked to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, such as HLA-A and HLA-F, which are crucial for immune system interactions (Chu2022A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, SCAF11 is part of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, interacting with miR-122-5p and 10 lncRNAs, highlighting its involvement in post-transcriptional regulation (Li2022Identification). These interactions underscore SCAF11's multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in cancer-related pathways.
