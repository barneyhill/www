# ABHD13

## Overview
ABHD13 is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 13, which is categorized as a depalmitoylating enzyme. This enzyme is integral to lipid metabolism and the regulation of protein palmitoylation, a post-translational modification critical for protein function and localization. ABHD13 is distinguished by its substrate specificity and potency, particularly in comparison to other depalmitoylating enzymes like APT1, and is localized to endomembranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum and early Golgi compartments (maktabi2015role). The gene has been implicated in various biological processes, including the regulation of IgE responses to allergens and potential roles in developmental conditions, although its specific contributions to these processes require further elucidation (Acevedo2016Genetic; McMahon2015De).

## Function
ABHD13 encodes a depalmitoylating enzyme that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and protein palmitoylation regulation. This enzyme is more potent and selective than APT1, particularly towards substrates like N-Ras, while showing no activity towards SNAP25, indicating its substrate specificity (maktabi2015role). ABHD13 is an integral membrane protein localized to endomembranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and early Golgi compartments, where it regulates palmitate turnover (maktabi2015role). 

The enzyme's activity is dependent on its catalytic serine, as a mutation at this site abolishes its function, highlighting its critical role in the depalmitoylation process (maktabi2015role). ABHD13's compartment-specific activity contrasts with the more distributive activity of other depalmitoylation enzymes, allowing for precise spatiotemporal control of protein acylation, which is crucial in polarized cells like neurons (maktabi2015role). This localized activity is essential for maintaining cellular function and protein localization, potentially impacting processes such as neuronal signaling and protein trafficking (maktabi2015role).

## Clinical Significance
The ABHD13 gene has been implicated in the regulation of IgE responses to allergens, particularly in the context of Ascaris infection. A specific genetic variant, rs3783118, located in the ABHD13 gene, has been associated with lower levels of specific IgE to Ascaris and D. pteronyssinus. This variant creates a new binding site for the transcriptional repressor Foxp1, which is significant for lung epithelium differentiation and B-cell development. The study suggests that the associations between ABHD13 and IgE responses may involve cross-reactive components between Ascaris and house dust mite extracts. However, this variant was not associated with the IgE response to ABA-1, a specific allergen from Ascaris that does not cross-react with house dust mites (Acevedo2016Genetic).

In a separate study, ABHD13 was mentioned in the context of a de novo interstitial deletion in chromosome 13q33.3q34, which includes ABHD13 among other genes. This deletion was studied in relation to congenital heart disease and other developmental issues, although the specific role of ABHD13 in these conditions was not detailed (McMahon2015De).
