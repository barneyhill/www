# C22orf39

## Overview
C22orf39 is a gene located on chromosome 22 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 22 open reading frame 39. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by C22orf39 is not currently categorized under well-known protein families such as kinases, receptors, or transmembrane proteins, indicating that it may have a unique or less characterized role within the cell. Research into C22orf39 and its protein product is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential interactions and implications in human health and disease.
