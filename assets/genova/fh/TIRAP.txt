# TIRAP

## Overview
TIRAP, or Toll-Interleukin 1 Receptor (TIR) domain containing adaptor protein, is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic adaptor protein crucial for the innate immune response. The TIRAP protein, also known as MyD88-adaptor-like (MAL), is integral to the signaling pathways of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR2 and TLR4. It functions by facilitating the recruitment of MyD88, another adaptor protein, to TLRs, thereby initiating downstream signaling cascades that activate transcription factors such as NF-kB and AP-1, which are essential for the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Yamamoto2002Essential; Rajpoot2021TIRAP). Structurally, TIRAP contains a phosphoinositide-binding domain and a TIR domain, which are critical for its membrane localization and signal transduction capabilities (Zhao2017Membrane; Valkov2011Crystal). The protein's interactions and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate its activity and stability, highlighting its role in modulating immune responses and its potential implications in various diseases (Zhao2017Membrane; Rajpoot2021TIRAP).

## Structure
The TIRAP protein, also known as MAL, is a crucial adaptor in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal phosphoinositide-binding domain (PBD) and a TIR domain. The PBD, spanning amino acids 15-35, is essential for membrane targeting and undergoes a transition from a disordered to a helical conformation upon interaction with phosphoinositides (Zhao2017Membrane). The TIR domain of TIRAP features a unique fold with a five-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices, differing from other TIR domains by lacking a helical segment between the βB and βC strands and instead having a long loop (Valkov2011Crystal; Ve2014Structure).

The tertiary structure of TIRAP is stabilized by two internal disulfide bonds, a feature not commonly found in other TIR domains (Valkov2011Crystal). The protein's quaternary structure involves potential dimerization interfaces, which are important for its function in signal transduction (Valkov2011Crystal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Thr28, regulate TIRAP's activity by affecting its membrane localization and stability. Phosphorylation leads to ubiquitination and degradation, impacting the protein's ability to bind phosphoinositides (Zhao2017Membrane).

## Function
TIRAP (TIR domain containing adaptor protein) is a crucial adaptor molecule in the immune system, particularly in the signaling pathways mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). It plays a significant role in the innate immune response by facilitating the recruitment of MyD88 to TLRs, specifically TLR2 and TLR4, which is essential for the formation of the Myddosome complex. This complex activates downstream signaling pathways that lead to the activation of transcription factors such as NF-kB and AP-1, responsible for the expression of proinflammatory cytokines crucial for the immune response to pathogens (Yamamoto2002Essential; Rajpoot2021TIRAP).

TIRAP interacts with various intracellular signaling mediators, indicating its central role in diverse immune responses. It interacts with TRAF6, promoting the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-kB, crucial for its transcriptional activation (Rajpoot2021TIRAP). TIRAP is also involved in the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, where it interacts with IRAK-2, leading to NF-kB activation. It can be negatively regulated through interactions with IRAK-1 and IRAK-4, leading to its degradation following phosphorylation and ubiquitination, serving as a mechanism to dampen TLR-4/2 signaling and prevent excessive inflammation (Rajpoot2021TIRAP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the TIRAP gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. The TIRAP p.R81C variant is identified as a novel risk factor for lymphomas, particularly B-cell lymphomas. This variant enhances cell proliferation via NF-κB mediated signaling, contributing to increased B-cell survival and proliferation, and is linked to poor survival outcomes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases (Burkhard2018TIRAP).

In the context of sepsis-associated acute lung injury (ALI), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TIRAP gene, such as rs595209 and rs8177375, have been linked to an increased risk of developing ALI. These genetic variants may influence susceptibility to ALI by affecting the inflammatory response pathways (Song2010Genetic).

The TIRAP rs8177374 polymorphism, resulting in a leucine replacement at serine 180 (S180L), has been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN). This variant is linked to disease severity and progression, affecting immune markers and treatment responses (Tayel2021Prognostic).

The TIRAP S180L polymorphism also plays a role in malaria outcomes, where the heterozygous variant offers protection against severe malaria and mortality, while the homozygous mutant genotype increases the risk of death (Panda2016Heterozygous).

## Interactions
TIRAP (TIR domain containing adaptor protein) is involved in several critical interactions within the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, playing a significant role in inflammatory responses. TIRAP interacts with Cytoplasmic Linker Protein 170 (CLIP170), which regulates microtubule dynamics and acts as a negative regulator of TLR4 by inducing TIRAP ubiquitination and promoting its degradation, thereby reducing downstream signaling activity (Jakka2018Cytoplasmic; Rajpoot2021TIRAP). Pathogenic bacteria like Brucella species can inhibit TIRAP activity through TcpB, which promotes CLIP170-dependent degradation of TIRAP (Rajpoot2021TIRAP).

TIRAP also interacts with the AP-1 subunit c-Jun in endotoxin-induced macrophages, driving c-Jun transactivation and a proinflammatory response. This interaction is significant for the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and the inhibitor Gefitinib can reduce this expression (Rajpoot2021TIRAP; Srivastava2019Inhibition). Additionally, TIRAP interacts with p38 MAPK, where tyrosine phosphorylation of TIRAP enhances its binding affinity, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for its activation and downstream signaling (Rajpoot2022TIRAPmediated).

TIRAP's interaction with Caspase-1 is noted, where Caspase-1 cleaves TIRAP, which is necessary for TLR4 and TLR2 mediated NF-kB and MAPK activation, although the biological relevance of this cleavage is debated (Rajpoot2021TIRAP). These interactions underscore TIRAP's multifaceted role in immune signaling pathways.
