# LGALS9C

## Overview
LGALS9C is a gene that encodes the protein galectin-9C, a member of the galectin family known for its carbohydrate-binding properties. Galectin-9C is characterized as a tandem-repeat type galectin, featuring two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) within a single polypeptide chain. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including immune modulation and apoptosis, primarily through its ability to bind β-galactoside sugars. Structurally, galectin-9C exhibits a β-sheet sandwich formation, facilitating its interaction with oligosaccharides and enabling its biological functions, such as influencing endothelial cell behavior and T-cell apoptosis (Kamitori2018ThreeDimensional; Modenutti2019The; Nonaka2013Selfassociation). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are context-dependent, influenced by factors such as cell type and environmental conditions, which contribute to its potential therapeutic applications in immune regulation and inflammation control (Aanhane2018Different).

## Structure
The LGALS9C gene encodes the C-terminal domain of galectin-9, a tandem-repeat type galectin characterized by two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) within a single polypeptide chain. The primary structure of galectin-9C includes a sequence that facilitates its role in glycan binding, particularly through its CRD, which is conserved across the galectin family (Kamitori2018ThreeDimensional).

The secondary structure of galectin-9C is composed of a two antiparallel β-sheet sandwich, a common feature among galectins, which forms the basis of its carbohydrate-binding site (Modenutti2019The). This structure is crucial for its ability to bind β-galactoside carbohydrates, with specific residues contributing to its binding affinity and specificity (Modenutti2019The).

In terms of tertiary structure, galectin-9C forms a globular shape that allows for efficient interaction with oligosaccharides. The quaternary structure involves the potential for dimerization and oligomerization, which is significant for its biological activity, including pro-apoptotic functions (Nonaka2013Selfassociation). The self-association of galectin-9C is mediated by hydrophobic interactions on a surface opposite to the sugar-binding site, involving residues such as Leu210, Trp277, and Leu279 (Nonaka2013Selfassociation).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, may occur, although specific modifications for galectin-9C are not detailed in the provided context. These structural features collectively contribute to the functional capabilities of galectin-9C in cellular processes.

## Function
Galectin-9C, encoded by the LGALS9C gene, is a member of the galectin family, which is known for its ability to bind β-galactoside sugars. This protein plays a significant role in modulating immune cell activity and maintaining immune homeostasis. In endothelial cells, galectin-9C influences various cellular functions, including proliferation and migration. It has been observed to slightly stimulate endothelial cell proliferation under certain conditions, while inhibiting cell migration and sprout formation in a 3D collagen matrix, indicating its complex role in angiogenesis (Aanhane2018Different).

Galectin-9C also exhibits pro-apoptotic activity, which is attributed to its ability to form oligomers. This activity is crucial for its function in T-cell differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting a role in immune regulation (Nonaka2013Selfassociation). The protein's effects on endothelial cell biology and immune cell modulation highlight its potential therapeutic implications in controlling inflammation and autoimmune responses. The activity of galectin-9C is influenced by the cellular microenvironment, including factors such as cell type, activation status, and concentration, which underscores the complexity of its biological functions (Aanhane2018Different).
