# MTFMT

## Overview
The MTFMT gene encodes the mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase, an enzyme critical for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme is responsible for the N-formylation of methionyl-tRNA, a modification essential for the initiation of mitochondrial translation. By facilitating the binding of formylated methionyl-tRNA to the mitochondrial ribosome, MTFMT plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, particularly complexes I and IV. The proper function of these complexes is crucial for cellular energy production and bioenergetics. Mutations in the MTFMT gene are linked to mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Haack2014Phenotypic; Hayhurst2019Leigh; Arguello2018Mitochondrial).

## Function
The MTFMT gene encodes the mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, MTFMT is responsible for the N-formylation of methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNA), converting it into formylated Met-tRNA (fMet-tRNA). This formylation is essential for the initiation of mitochondrial protein synthesis, as fMet-tRNA has a higher affinity for the mitochondrial initiation factor IF2mt, facilitating its delivery to the ribosome's P site for translation initiation (Haack2014Phenotypic; Hinttala2015An).

MTFMT activity is vital for the proper assembly and function of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, particularly complexes I and IV, and their organization into supercomplexes. The absence of N-formylation, as observed in MTFMT-deficient cells, leads to decreased levels of these complexes and affects their association into supercomplexes, impacting cellular bioenergetics and reducing ATP production efficiency (Arguello2018Mitochondrial).

MTFMT is active within the mitochondria, where it ensures the balance between formylated and unformylated methionyl-tRNA Met, crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Hinttala2015An; Seo2020MTFMT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MTFMT gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, most notably Leigh syndrome, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Leigh syndrome is characterized by symptoms such as hypotonia, spasticity, developmental delay, and typically presents before the age of two years. Patients with MTFMT mutations often have a milder clinical phenotype and better prognosis compared to Leigh syndrome caused by other nuclear defects (Hayhurst2019Leigh). The most common pathogenic variant identified in MTFMT is c.626C>T, which is associated with a loss of function due to impaired splicing, leading to respiratory chain dysfunction (Haack2014Phenotypic).

MTFMT mutations can also lead to mitochondrial multiple respiratory chain deficiencies, affecting complexes I and IV, and are linked to conditions such as Leigh encephalopathy, white matter disease, microcephaly, mental retardation, ataxia, and muscular hypotonia (Haack2014Phenotypic). These mutations result in decreased formylation of Met-tRNA, crucial for translation initiation in mitochondria, thereby impairing mitochondrial protein translation (Haack2014Phenotypic). The c.626C>T variant is considered a founder genetic variant in the European population, with a notable allele frequency (Hayhurst2019Leigh).

## Interactions
MTFMT (mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase) is involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis by catalyzing the formylation of methionyl-tRNA, a crucial step for initiating mitochondrial translation. This enzyme interacts with mitochondrial ribosomes and tRNA molecules, facilitating the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial translation machinery (Seo2020MTFMT).

MTFMT plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and is involved in the recruitment of the NF-κB-activating complex ECSIT to the mitochondrial membrane. In MTFMT-deficient cells, the recruitment of ECSIT is reduced, which correlates with decreased basal NF-κB activity. ECSIT interacts with TRAF6 on mitochondria, acting as a key player in activating basal NF-κB signaling (Seo2020MTFMT). This interaction highlights the importance of MTFMT in the formation of signaling complexes on the mitochondrial membrane, which are crucial for cellular signaling and immune responses.

MTFMT deficiency also affects the release of mitochondrial-derived N-formyl peptides, which can influence host defense responses and susceptibility to intracellular infections. These peptides, when transfected, can impact bacterial survival, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses (Seo2020MTFMT).
