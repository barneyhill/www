# FKBP8

## Overview
FKBP8 is a gene located on chromosome 19 at 19p13.1, encoding the protein FKBP prolyl isomerase 8, a member of the FKBP family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, which is crucial for protein folding and stability. FKBP prolyl isomerase 8 is a non-canonical FKBP family member, distinguished by its Ca2+-calmodulin dependent activity and its involvement in various cellular processes, including protein homeostasis, apoptosis regulation, and mitochondrial quality control (Peng2018FKBP8; Harikishore2012FKBP8). The protein is anchored to mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum membranes, where it interacts with other proteins such as Bcl-2 and Hsp90, playing a significant role in the ER-associated degradation pathway and the trafficking of membrane proteins like the CLC-1 chloride channel (Blundell2017The; Peng2018FKBP8). FKBP8's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis, with implications in various diseases, including Crohn's disease and lung adenocarcinoma (Wang2022Penetrating; Zuo2022Tacrolimusbinding).

## Structure
The FKBP8 protein, encoded by the FKBP8 gene located on chromosome 19 at 19p13.1, is a non-canonical member of the FKBP family. It exhibits Ca2+-calmodulin dependent peptidylprolylisomerase (PPIase) activity and contains several distinct domains. These include a glutamate-rich domain (ERD), an FKBP domain, a tetratricopeptide repeat region (TPR domain), a consensus leucine-zipper (LZ) repeat region, a calmodulin-binding domain, and a transmembrane domain (Harikishore2012FKBP8). The TPR domain is crucial for binding to Hsp90, a molecular chaperone, and this interaction is essential for FKBP8's function (Blundell2017The). The protein's structure is similar to FKBP12, with differences in the loop structure between certain beta strands (Blundell2017The).

FKBP8 is anchored to mitochondrial and ER membranes and is exposed to the cytosol (Harikishore2012FKBP8). The protein interacts with other proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Hsp90, primarily through the formation of a Ca2+-calmodulin/FKBP8 complex (Harikishore2012FKBP8). FKBP8's PPIase activity is not constitutively active and is regulated by calmodulin (Blundell2017The). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation and ubiquitination.

## Function
FKBP8, also known as FKBP prolyl isomerase 8, is a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis and stability in human cells. It is traditionally localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, where it functions as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, facilitating protein folding and conformational changes within the ER quality control system (Peng2018FKBP8). FKBP8 is involved in the ER-associated degradation of misfolded proteins by interacting with the Cullin 4A/B E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is essential for the degradation process (Peng2018FKBP8).

In addition to its role in the ER, FKBP8 has been shown to enhance the stability and trafficking of the CLC-1 chloride channel, a protein critical for maintaining resting membrane potential in skeletal muscles. FKBP8 assists in the trafficking of CLC-1 from the ER through the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane, increasing its membrane expression and prolonging its half-life at the cell surface (Peng2018FKBP8). This function is particularly important in skeletal muscle, where FKBP8's presence at the plasma membrane supports muscle function by stabilizing CLC-1 (Peng2018FKBP8). These activities highlight FKBP8's significant role in peripheral quality control of membrane proteins, contributing to cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
FKBP8 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular processes and interactions. In Crohn's disease, FKBP8 is crucial for the recruitment of myosin light chain kinase 1 (MLCK1) to cell junctions, which is necessary for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. Alterations in FKBP8-MLCK1 interactions have been observed in Crohn's disease patients, suggesting that these interactions are significant in the disease's pathobiology. Targeting FKBP8-MLCK1 interactions may offer therapeutic potential for restoring barrier function in inflammatory bowel diseases (Zuo2022Tacrolimusbinding).

In lung adenocarcinoma, FKBP8 expression is associated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. It is negatively correlated with CD8+ T cells and positively with CD4+ T cells, indicating that FKBP8 may influence the immune landscape and potentially affect tumor progression and patient prognosis (Wang2022Penetrating).

FKBP8 also plays a role in mitochondrial quality control, particularly in mitophagy and mitochondrial fragmentation under stress conditions. Alterations in FKBP8 expression can impact mitochondrial dynamics, which may have clinical implications in conditions where these processes are disrupted, such as neurodegenerative disorders (Yoo2019FKBP8).

## Interactions
FKBP8, also known as FKBP prolyl isomerase 8, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Bcl-2, stabilizing its levels and preventing apoptosis by interacting with its flexible loop domain (Harikishore2012FKBP8). FKBP8 also forms complexes with Ca2+-calmodulin, which are crucial for its interaction with substrate proteins like Bcl-2 and Hsp90 (Harikishore2012FKBP8). 

In the context of intestinal epithelial cells, FKBP8 interacts with myosin light chain kinase 1 (MLCK1) through its peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPI) domain, a process enhanced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation. This interaction is significant for MLCK1 recruitment to the perijunctional actomyosin ring, affecting barrier function (Zuo2022Tacrolimusbinding). Tacrolimus can inhibit this interaction by binding to the PPI domain of FKBP8, suggesting a therapeutic mechanism for conditions like Crohn's disease (Zuo2022Tacrolimusbinding).

FKBP8 also interacts with the non-structural 5A (NS5A) protein of the classical swine fever virus, promoting viral RNA synthesis and replication (Li2016FKBP8). Additionally, FKBP8 is involved in the quality control of the CLC-1 chloride channel, enhancing its stability and surface expression (Peng2018FKBP8). These interactions highlight FKBP8's role in apoptosis regulation, protein folding, and viral replication.
