# BPIFB4

## Overview
BPIFB4 is a gene that encodes the protein BPI fold containing family B member 4, which is part of the bactericidal/permeability-increasing (BPI) protein superfamily. This protein is characterized by its lipid-binding domain and plays a significant role in immune response and cardiovascular protection. The BPIFB4 protein includes motifs that facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as 14-3-3 and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which are crucial for its function in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and vascular health (Villa2015Genetic). Notably, the gene produces different isoforms, including a longevity-associated variant (LAV-BPIFB4), which is linked to enhanced endothelial function and longevity. This variant is associated with improved nitric oxide production and vasorelaxation, contributing to cardiovascular health and reduced risk of age-related diseases (Villa2018A; Spinelli2017LAVBPIFB4). Additionally, BPIFB4 modulates immune responses, reducing inflammation and supporting immune function in long-lived individuals (Ciaglia2019LongevityAssociated).

## Structure
BPIFB4 is a protein encoded by the BPIFB4 gene, belonging to the BPI fold-containing family, which is characterized by a lipid-binding domain. The protein is composed of 575 amino acids and is part of the bactericidal BPI/PLUNC protein superfamily, which plays a role in the immune response (Villa2015Genetic). The BPIFB4 protein includes a protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) substrate motif and an atypical 14-3-3 binding motif, which are crucial for its interaction with other proteins such as 14-3-3 and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) (Villa2015Genetic).

The BPIFB4 gene produces different isoforms through site-directed mutagenesis, including the wild-type (WT) and the longevity-associated variant (LAV) isoforms. The LAV isoform involves specific amino acid changes, such as Ile229 to Val and Asn281 to Thr, which are associated with enhanced endothelial function and longevity (Villa2015Genetic). The LAV-BPIFB4 isoform is more cytoplasmic and forms a complex with the 14-3-3 protein more efficiently than the WT-BPIFB4, contributing to its functional role in vasorelaxation and nitric oxide production (Villa2015Genetic). The phosphorylation of BPIFB4 at serine 75 by PERK is enhanced in the LAV isoform, facilitating its interaction with 14-3-3 and activation of eNOS (Spinelli2017LAVBPIFB4).

## Function
The BPIFB4 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cardiovascular protection and immune modulation. Its longevity-associated variant (LAV-BPIFB4) is particularly noted for enhancing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, which is crucial for vascular function. This variant promotes nitric oxide (NO) production, leading to improved vasorelaxation and vascular health, which are important for delaying cardiovascular diseases (Villa2018A; Spinelli2017LAVBPIFB4). LAV-BPIFB4 achieves this through a signaling pathway involving protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), 14-3-3 proteins, and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and it also activates eNOS-dependent endothelial function via a calcium-mediated mechanism (Spinelli2017LAVBPIFB4).

In addition to its cardiovascular effects, BPIFB4 modulates immune responses. It is involved in reducing the activation of inflammatory monocytes and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. This function is particularly beneficial in long-lived individuals, as it helps counterbalance immune decline and chronic inflammation (Ciaglia2019LongevityAssociated). BPIFB4 is expressed in various cell types, including monocytes and platelets, where it influences immune and vascular functions (Ciaglia2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BPIFB4 gene have been linked to various cardiovascular conditions. A rare variant of BPIFB4, known as RV-BPIFB4, is associated with increased blood pressure due to impaired endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling, leading to endothelial dysfunction and hypertension (Vecchione2017A). This variant has been shown to increase systolic blood pressure in normotensive mice and is correlated with higher diastolic blood pressure in humans, particularly those on anti-hypertensive medication (Vecchione2017A).

Conversely, the longevity-associated variant (LAV-BPIFB4) is linked to improved cardiovascular health. It is enriched in long-living individuals and is associated with enhanced eNOS activity, which contributes to reduced blood pressure and improved endothelial function (Villa2015Genetic; Dossena2020New). LAV-BPIFB4 has shown therapeutic potential in models of atherosclerosis, limb ischemia, and diabetic cardiomyopathy, and it is associated with reduced risk of atherosclerosis and lower carotid stenosis (Puca2019Single; Cattaneo2023BPIFB4). The LAV-BPIFB4 variant also plays a role in modulating immune responses, potentially mitigating inflammation-related diseases common in aging (Ciaglia2019LongevityAssociated).

## Interactions
BPIFB4, particularly its longevity-associated variant (LAV), engages in several interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its biological functions. LAV-BPIFB4 forms a complex with the 14-3-3 protein more efficiently than the wild-type BPIFB4, as demonstrated in HeLa cells where LAV-BPIFB4 shows a prevalent cytoplasmic distribution and colocalizes with 14-3-3 (Villa2015Genetic). This interaction is significant for the modulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, which is crucial for vascular function. The LAV-BPIFB4 isoform also interacts with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a known eNOS activator, suggesting a role in enhancing eNOS signaling (Villa2015Genetic).

In the context of neuroprotection, BPIFB4 isoforms, including LAV-BPIFB4, are involved in reducing DNA damage and enhancing DNA repair efficiency. Potential interacting proteins in this process include nucleolin (NCL) and Ku70, which are part of a multi-protein complex that facilitates DNA repair (Cattaneo2022LongevityAssociated). These interactions highlight BPIFB4's role in cellular stress responses and its potential therapeutic implications in diseases such as Huntington's disease and cardiovascular conditions.
