# JAM3

## Overview
JAM3 is a gene that encodes the protein junctional adhesion molecule 3, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in cell adhesion processes. The protein is primarily located at tight junctions in endothelial and epithelial cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining barrier integrity and cell polarity. JAM3 is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains and forms homodimers and heterodimers with other junctional adhesion molecules, such as JAM2, facilitating interactions crucial for leukocyte transmigration and immune responses (Arrate2001Cloning; Ebnet2003The). The protein's interactions with cell polarity proteins like PAR-3 and tight junction-associated proteins such as ZO-1 underscore its importance in cellular organization and function (Ebnet2003The). Mutations in the JAM3 gene are linked to severe neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental and hematological conditions (Zhang2018JAM3; Akawi2013Delineation).

## Structure
Junctional adhesion molecule 3 (JAM3) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains. The protein structure of JAM3 includes two immunoglobulin-like domains connected by a short linker, forming a U-shaped dimer through interactions between the N-terminal domains (Heinemann2019Structural; Kostrewa2001Xray). This dimerization is facilitated by a conserved R(V,I,L)E motif, which is crucial for the formation of homodimers and is shared among JAM family members (Kostrewa2001Xray). The dimerization process is sensitive to pH and oxidation conditions, with specific residues like Cys73 playing a role in maintaining the dimer interface (Kostrewa2001Xray).

JAM3 is involved in forming tight junctions and interacts with other proteins, such as PAR-3, which is essential for cell polarity (Heinemann2019Structural). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions. While specific details about splice variant isoforms of JAM3 are not provided, such variants could potentially affect its function and localization. The structural features of JAM3 suggest its role in cell adhesion and tight junction integrity.

## Function
Junctional adhesion molecule 3 (JAM3) is a protein involved in various cell adhesion processes, playing a significant role in maintaining the integrity of endothelial and epithelial barriers. It is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is primarily active at tight junctions in cells. JAM3 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, kidney, and placenta, and is upregulated in T cells following activation (Arrate2001Cloning).

JAM3 interacts with other members of the JAM family, particularly JAM2, forming heterotypic interactions that are crucial for cell adhesion and immune cell interactions. This interaction is significant in the context of leukocyte transmigration, where JAM3 acts as a counter-receptor for JAM2, facilitating immune cell movement and contributing to immune responses (Liang2002Vascular; Arrate2001Cloning). JAM3 also plays a role in the regulation of endothelial cell polarity and tight junction formation by associating with the cell polarity protein PAR-3, which is essential for maintaining cell polarity and the integrity of tight junctions (Ebnet2003The).

In addition to its role in cell adhesion, JAM3 is involved in mediating interactions between platelets and leukocytes, which are crucial for immune responses and maintaining vascular integrity (Santoso2002The). These functions highlight JAM3's importance in physiological processes such as inflammation, tissue homeostasis, and vascular permeability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the JAM3 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as hemorrhagic destruction of the brain, subependymal calcification, and congenital cataracts (HDBSCC). This condition is characterized by severe neurological symptoms, including intracranial hemorrhages, subependymal calcifications, congenital cataracts, and developmental delays. Affected individuals often experience a catastrophic clinical course, leading to early mortality (De2021A; Akawi2013Delineation). Specific mutations, such as homozygous missense mutations and frameshift variants, have been identified in patients from diverse ethnic backgrounds, indicating a consistent phenotype across populations (Abdallah2023Case; Akawi2013Delineation).

JAM3 mutations can also lead to fetal intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which is associated with neurodevelopmental delays and cerebral palsy. Compound heterozygous variants in JAM3 have been linked to recurrent fetal ICH in some families (Xu2022Case). In addition to its role in developmental disorders, JAM3 is implicated in leukemia, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). JAM3 expression is crucial for the self-renewal of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) and is associated with poorer outcomes in AML patients. Targeting JAM3 in AML could potentially eliminate LICs without affecting normal hematopoietic stem cells (Zhang2018JAM3).

## Interactions
Junctional adhesion molecule 3 (JAM3) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and polarity. JAM3 associates with the cell polarity protein PAR-3 through a PDZ domain-dependent interaction, primarily involving the first PDZ domain of PAR-3. This interaction is significant in endothelial cells, where JAM3 is predominantly expressed, and plays a role in tight junction formation and cell polarity (Ebnet2003The).

JAM3 also interacts with the tight junction-associated protein ZO-1. This interaction is mediated by the PDZ domain and is important for the localization of ZO-1 at cell-cell contacts, contributing to the regulation of tight junctions (Ebnet2003The).

In the immune system, JAM3 serves as a receptor for VE-JAM/JAM2, facilitating adhesion with specific subsets of peripheral blood lymphocytes, including CD56+ NK cells and CD56+ CD3+ NK T cells. This interaction suggests a role for JAM3 in lymphocyte trafficking and immune surveillance (Liang2002Vascular).

These interactions highlight JAM3's involvement in maintaining cell polarity, vascular permeability, and immune cell adhesion, underscoring its multifaceted role in cellular processes.
