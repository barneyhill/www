# CEP250

## Overview
CEP250 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 250, also known as C-Nap1, which is integral to centrosome cohesion and cell cycle progression. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate interactions with other centrosomal proteins, such as rootletin and NEK2, playing a pivotal role in centriole cohesion and disjunction. These interactions are crucial for maintaining centrosome integrity, ensuring proper spindle formation, and facilitating chromosome segregation during mitosis. CEP250 is also involved in ciliary function, particularly in photoreceptor and cochlear cells, where it contributes to retinal health and auditory function. Mutations in the CEP250 gene have been linked to genetic disorders affecting hearing and vision, such as atypical Usher syndrome and nonsyndromic autosomal recessive progressive hearing loss, underscoring its clinical significance (Kang2023Novel; Khateb2014A; AbuDiab2023Homozygous).

## Structure
CEP250, also known as C-Nap1, is a centrosomal protein involved in centrosome cohesion and cell cycle progression. The protein is predominantly composed of sequences predicted to form coiled-coil structures, which are typical of secondary protein structures and facilitate protein-protein interactions (Khateb2014A; Shigdel2020Genomic). These coiled-coil domains are crucial for the protein's function, as they allow CEP250 to interact with other centrosomal proteins, such as rootletin and NEK2, which are important for centrosome cohesion and centriole disjunction (Zeng2020Involvement; Khateb2014A).

The tertiary and quaternary structures of CEP250 have been explored through studies involving small molecules like WDB002, which bind to the coiled-coil domain of CEP250 in complex with FKBP12. This interaction forms a heterotetramer with C2 symmetry, where CEP250 forms a homodimeric coiled coil and binds one FKBP12-WDB002 complex on each side (Shigdel2020Genomic). The interaction sites on CEP250 include a hydrophobic hotspot composed of specific amino acids, which are critical for binding affinity (Shigdel2020Genomic).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by NEK2, play a significant role in regulating CEP250's function, particularly in centrosome disjunction (Zeng2020Involvement). The presence of splice variants may lead to different isoforms of CEP250, potentially with distinct roles in cellular processes (Khateb2014A).

## Function
CEP250 encodes the C-Nap1 protein, a crucial component of the centrosome, which is involved in maintaining centrosome cohesion and stability during the cell cycle. C-Nap1 acts as a central anchor point for linker proteins at the proximal end of the two connected centrioles, ensuring proper centriole cohesion and centrosome integrity (Huang2019Functional; Khateb2014A). This cohesion is essential for centriole duplication, biogenesis, and cell cycle progression control, facilitating proper spindle formation and chromosome segregation during mitosis (Floriot2022CEP250; Khateb2014A).

CEP250 is active in the centrosome, a key cellular structure for organizing microtubules and facilitating cell division. It interacts with other proteins such as CEP68, CEP135, and rootletin, which are important for maintaining centrosome cohesion and ciliary function (Huang2019Functional). In photoreceptor cells, CEP250 is involved in cilia formation and function, playing a role in retinal health and development (Huang2019Functional). The protein's role extends to the cochlea, where it is crucial for maintaining hair cell function and survival, as evidenced by its involvement in centriole cohesion and cilia development in cochlear cells (Kang2023Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP250 gene have been implicated in several genetic disorders, primarily affecting hearing and vision. A homozygous nonsense mutation in CEP250, combined with a heterozygous nonsense mutation in the C2orf71 gene, has been associated with atypical Usher syndrome. This condition is characterized by early-onset sensorineural hearing loss and retinal degeneration, specifically retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (Khateb2014A; AbuDiab2023Homozygous). The CEP250 mutation results in a truncated protein that lacks the NEK2-phosphorylation region, crucial for its function (Khateb2014A).

CEP250 mutations have also been linked to nonsyndromic autosomal recessive progressive hearing loss. A specific nonsense variant, p.Gln1171Ter, causes protein mislocalization and is associated with this type of hearing loss, indicating that CEP250 plays a role in cochlear function (Kang2023Novel). In mouse models, the absence of CEP250 expression leads to disorganized cilia and progressive hearing loss, highlighting its importance in maintaining auditory function (AbuDiab2023Homozygous).

The gene has also been associated with other retinal phenotypes, including cone-rod dystrophy and mild retinitis pigmentosa, further consolidating its role in Usher-like conditions (FusterGarcía2018Highthroughput).

## Interactions
CEP250, also known as C-Nap1, is a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining centrosome cohesion. It interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that are essential for various cellular processes. One of the key interactions of CEP250 is with FKBP12, a chaperone protein that facilitates the formation of a complex with the small molecule WDB002. This interaction involves a hydrophobic hotspot on the CEP250 coiled coil and is characterized by a large number of hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for centrosome organization and regulation (Shigdel2020Genomic).

CEP250 also interacts with NEK2, a kinase that phosphorylates CEP250 to promote centrosome disjunction. This interaction is significant in the context of cell cycle regulation and mitotic processes, as NEK2's phosphorylation of CEP250 is essential for centrosome separation during mitosis (Zeng2020Involvement). Additionally, CEP250 forms a complex with rootletin, which is important for centriole cohesion and ciliary development (Floriot2022CEP250; Kang2023Novel). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CEP250 in centrosome dynamics and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms.
