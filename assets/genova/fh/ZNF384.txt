# ZNF384

## Overview
ZNF384 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 384, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. This protein plays a pivotal role in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. As an adaptor protein, zinc finger protein 384 is integral to the classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway, facilitating the recruitment of the Ku70/Ku80 complex to sites of DNA damage, thereby promoting efficient DNA repair (Singh2021Zinc). Additionally, it is involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences and interacting with various cellular proteins, influencing processes such as hematopoietic cell differentiation and collagen expression (Janssen2006Interaction). Clinically, ZNF384 is significant due to its involvement in fusion oncoproteins associated with acute leukemia, where it contributes to lineage ambiguity and impacts prognosis and treatment outcomes (Hirabayashi2016ZNF384; Dickerson2022ZNF384).

## Structure
ZNF384 is a zinc finger protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The protein contains a putative leucine zipper (LZ), a serine-rich region (SRR), a proline-rich region (PRR), and a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the N-terminus. These are followed by eight Krüppel-type C2H2 zinc fingers (ZFs) and a glutamine-alanine stretch at the C-terminus (Janssen2006Interaction). The C2H2 zinc finger motifs are crucial for DNA binding, particularly at sites of DNA damage, and play a significant role in the classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) DNA repair pathway (Singh2021Zinc).

The N-terminus of ZNF384 is essential for its interaction with the Ku70/Ku80 complex, facilitating the recruitment of these proteins to DNA damage sites (Singh2021Zinc). The protein's structure allows it to act as an adaptor, promoting the assembly of repair complexes at double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Singh2021Zinc). ZNF384 is also involved in transcriptional regulation, binding to an A-rich DNA consensus sequence and influencing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and type I collagen (Janssen2006Interaction). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its structural and functional properties.

## Function
ZNF384 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in DNA repair and gene expression regulation in healthy human cells. It functions as an adaptor in the classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway, a critical DNA repair mechanism. ZNF384 facilitates the recruitment and binding of the Ku70/Ku80 complex to sites of DNA damage, promoting the assembly of a functional cNHEJ complex that includes other repair factors such as APLF and XRCC4/LIG4 (Singh2021Zinc). This protein is recruited to DNA breaks in a PAR-dependent manner and is essential for efficient loading of repair proteins at these sites (Singh2021Zinc).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, ZNF384 is involved in gene expression regulation. It interacts with various proteins, including zyxin, PCBP1, and vimentin, which are involved in different cellular processes. ZNF384 acts at the transcriptional level, binding to the COL1A1 promoter to activate transcription, while PCBP1 stabilizes the transcript, enhancing collagen expression (Janssen2006Interaction). ZNF384's interactions suggest its involvement in integrin signal transduction and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, particularly in hematopoietic cell differentiation (Janssen2006Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF384 is implicated in various forms of acute leukemia, particularly through fusion oncoproteins that result from gene rearrangements. These fusions are associated with lineage ambiguity in acute leukemia, such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), where tumors express both B-cell and myeloid markers. This suggests an origin from early stem or progenitor cells (Dickerson2022ZNF384). ZNF384-related fusion genes, including TCF3-ZNF384 and EP300-ZNF384, define distinct subgroups of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) with specific immunophenotypic characteristics, such as weak CD10 and aberrant CD13/CD33 expression (Hirabayashi2016ZNF384).

The presence of ZNF384 rearrangements is linked to poor prognosis in some cases, particularly when associated with renal involvement as the first manifestation (Ma2022ZNF384). In adult BCP-ALL, ZNF384 fusions are associated with higher relapse-free survival when treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach (Qin2021The). The expression of ZNF384 fusion oncoproteins can lead to the expansion of immature myeloid cells and contribute to leukemia development by interacting with the Mediator complex, increasing chromatin occupancy, and altering gene transcription (Dickerson2022ZNF384).

## Interactions
ZNF384 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in DNA repair, particularly in the classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway. It acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating the recruitment and binding of the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer to DNA at sites of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Singh2021Zinc). ZNF384 interacts with the Ku70/Ku80 complex through its N-terminal domain, which is essential for its function in DNA repair (Singh2021Zinc). This interaction promotes the assembly of a functional cNHEJ complex, including the recruitment of downstream factors such as APLF and the XRCC4/LIG4 complex, which are critical for efficient DSB repair (Singh2021Zinc).

ZNF384 also interacts with PARP1, a protein involved in chromatin remodeling, which is necessary for its recruitment to DNA damage sites. This recruitment is dependent on PARP1-mediated chromatin relaxation, although ZNF384 does not directly bind to PARP1-generated poly(ADP-ribose) chains (Singh2021Zinc). The protein's C2H2 motifs are crucial for its DNA binding capability, allowing it to bind to both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA with overhangs (Singh2021Zinc). Through these interactions, ZNF384 enhances the binding of Ku70/Ku80 to DNA, thereby influencing the dynamics of DNA repair processes (Singh2021Zinc).
