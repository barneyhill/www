# JSRP1

## Overview
The JSRP1 gene encodes the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (JP-45), a critical component of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum junctional face membrane. JP-45 is integral to the process of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscles, where it modulates the interaction between the voltage-sensing dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and the luminal calcium-binding protein calsequestrin. This modulation is essential for the proper release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby facilitating muscle contraction. Variants of the JSRP1 gene have been associated with altered muscle function and susceptibility to conditions such as Malignant Hyperthermia, highlighting its clinical significance. Additionally, JSRP1 has been implicated in oncogenic processes, such as in a novel fusion with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in lung adenocarcinoma, expanding its relevance beyond muscle physiology (Yasuda2012JP45JSRP1Variants; Xue2022Case).

## Function
The human gene JSRP1 encodes the protein JP-45, which is an integral component of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum junctional face membrane. JP-45 plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, a process where an electrical signal is converted into a chemical signal, leading to muscle contraction. It interacts with Ca v 1.1, the α1 subunit of the voltage-sensing dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), and the luminal calcium-binding protein calsequestrin. This interaction is essential for modulating the sensitivity of the DHPR to activation, which is critical for the proper release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Yasuda2012JP45JSRP1Variants).

In healthy human cells, JP-45 influences the voltage-dependence of charge movement and calcium current activation, shifting them towards more positive potentials compared to the wild-type protein. This modulation affects the voltage-dependence of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ release, thereby impacting muscle function (Yasuda2012JP45JSRP1Variants). The protein's activity is primarily localized in the junctional membrane complex of skeletal muscle cells, where it contributes to muscle contraction and overall muscle function by regulating calcium handling (Yasuda2012JP45JSRP1Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the JSRP1 gene, which encodes the JP-45 protein, have been implicated in various muscle-related conditions. Specifically, two variants of JSRP1, c.323C>T (p.P108L) and c.449G>C (p.G150A), have been identified in individuals with different susceptibilities to Malignant Hyperthermia (MH), a pharmacogenetic disorder triggered by certain anesthetics. These variants decrease the sensitivity of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) to activation, potentially explaining the variable phenotypes in patients with MH who carry the same RYR1 mutation. The study suggests that JSRP1 variants may act as 'function modifiers' in the excitation-contraction coupling process, which is crucial for muscle contraction (Yasuda2012JP45JSRP1Variants).

In addition to its role in MH, a novel fusion involving the JSRP1 intergenic region and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been identified in a patient with lung adenocarcinoma. This fusion is a new addition to the spectrum of ALK fusion partners in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has shown responsiveness to ALK inhibitors, suggesting its relevance in the context of ALK+ NSCLC (Xue2022Case).

## Interactions
The human gene JSRP1 encodes the protein JP-45, which is an integral component of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum junctional face membrane. JP-45 interacts with the α1 subunit of the voltage-sensing dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), known as Ca v 1.1, and the luminal calcium-binding protein calsequestrin. These interactions are crucial for skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling, a process where an electrical signal is converted into a chemical signal, leading to muscle contraction (Yasuda2012JP45JSRP1Variants). The study identified two JSRP1 variants, c.323C>T (p.P108L) and c.449G>C (p.G150A), which affect the sensitivity of the DHPR to activation. These variants do not directly affect the functional properties of the RyR1, another key component in excitation-contraction coupling, but they may modulate the activity of the EC coupling machinery. The presence of these variants could explain phenotypic differences in individuals with the same RYR1 mutation, particularly in the context of Malignant Hyperthermia, a disorder linked to calcium homeostasis dysregulation (Yasuda2012JP45JSRP1Variants).
