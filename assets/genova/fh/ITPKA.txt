# ITPKA

## Overview
Inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase A (ITPKA) is a gene that encodes a kinase protein involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium signaling and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The ITPKA protein is primarily expressed in neuronal tissues, where it plays a critical role in synaptic signaling and plasticity by phosphorylating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) to produce inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4). This enzymatic activity is crucial for modulating calcium (Ca2+) influx, which is essential for learning and memory processes (Schell2010Inositol; Johnson2009Neuronal). Additionally, ITPKA functions as an F-actin-bundling protein, influencing dendritic spine morphology and synaptic integration (Johnson2009Neuronal). Beyond its neuronal functions, ITPKA is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, where it acts as an oncogene promoting cell migration and metastasis through interactions with proteins like Drebrin 1 (Guoren2020TFAP2A). The gene's expression and activity are regulated by various mechanisms, including gene body methylation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Windhorst2017Inositol1).

## Structure
The ITPKA protein is characterized by a specific N-terminal region known as N66, which plays a crucial role in its interaction with F-actin. This region includes a proline-rich area, a predicted α-helix, and a polybasic region. The α-helical region, centered around residue 34, is essential for F-actin binding and bundling, as demonstrated by the L34P mutation, which disrupts these interactions (Johnson2009Neuronal). The N66 domain is involved in actin bundling through homodimerization, which is necessary for targeting ITPKA to dendritic spines (Johnson2009Neuronal).

The polybasic region enhances the affinity for F-actin but cannot bind independently without the helical region (Johnson2009Neuronal). The N66 domain's ability to stabilize F-actin structures is indicated by its role in reducing the rate of F-actin depolymerization (Johnson2009Neuronal). The full N66 domain is required for the correct targeting and function of ITPKA, influencing dendritic spine morphology and actin dynamics (Johnson2009Neuronal).

The primary structure of ITPKA includes specific domains such as the ATP-binding domain and the catalytic domain, although detailed information on its tertiary and quaternary structures is not provided in the context. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, and splice variant isoforms could result in different functional forms (Johnson2009Neuronal).

## Function
Inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase A (ITPKA) is a protein that plays a crucial role in neuronal signaling, particularly within dendritic spines. It is involved in the phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) to produce inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), a process that regulates intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This regulation is essential for synaptic signaling and plasticity, impacting processes such as learning and memory (Schell2010Inositol; Johnson2009Neuronal).

ITPKA is highly enriched in dendritic spines, where it acts as an F-actin-bundling protein. This bundling is crucial for maintaining the structure and morphology of dendritic spines, which are important for synaptic integration and plasticity. The protein's interaction with F-actin is mediated by its N-terminal region, specifically the N66 domain, which is necessary for its localization to dendritic spines (Schell2010Inositol; Johnson2009Neuronal).

ITPKA also functions as a molecular gatekeeper for synaptic IP3 signals, modulating Ca2+ influx across the spine plasma membrane. This activity is regulated by calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) and is positively influenced by the memory kinase CaMKII, contributing to a feedback loop that affects synaptic activity and plasticity (Schell2010Inositol).

## Clinical Significance
The ITPKA gene is significantly implicated in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where it acts as an oncogene. Its overexpression in LUAD is associated with advanced clinical parameters, poor prognosis, and increased tumor proliferation and metastasis. ITPKA promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in cancer metastasis, by interacting with Drebrin 1 (DBN1) and influencing cell migration and proliferation (Guoren2020TFAP2A). Knockdown of ITPKA in LUAD cells reduces markers associated with EMT, such as N-Cadherin and Vimentin, while increasing E-Cadherin levels, indicating its role in promoting EMT and metastasis (Guoren2020TFAP2A).

In addition to lung cancer, ITPKA is overexpressed in other tumor types, including breast and renal cell carcinomas, where it is linked to aggressive cancer phenotypes and poor survival outcomes. Its expression is regulated by gene body methylation, which is positively correlated with malignancy (Windhorst2017Inositol1). In renal cell carcinoma, high ITPKA expression is associated with lower survival rates, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2013Gene). The gene's involvement in calcium signaling and actin dynamics further underscores its role in cancer progression and metastasis (Windhorst2017Inositol1).

## Interactions
ITPKA, or inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase A, is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ITPKA interacts with Drebrin 1 (DBN1), an F-actin-related protein involved in actin remodeling. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, where DBN1 was detected in ITPKA pull-downs and vice versa. The interaction between ITPKA and DBN1 contributes to the wound healing ability of LUAD cells, indicating a role in cancer cell migration and metastasis (Guoren2020TFAP2A).

In neuronal contexts, ITPKA acts as an F-actin–bundling protein, with its N-terminal domain being crucial for targeting to dendritic spines. The protein's ability to bind and bundle F-actin is essential for its localization and function in neurons, affecting spine morphology and actin dynamics (Johnson2009Neuronal). The N66 domain of ITPKA is particularly important for its interaction with F-actin, and mutations in this region can disrupt its binding and bundling capabilities (Johnson2009Neuronal). These interactions highlight ITPKA's role in both cancer progression and neuronal function through its modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
