# CEP78

## Overview
CEP78 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 78, a crucial component involved in the regulation of ciliogenesis. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its function (Gonçalves2020CEP78; Ascari2020Functional). As a centrosomal protein, CEP78 plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of primary cilia by modulating the levels of CP110, a protein that inhibits ciliogenesis when present at the distal ends of centrioles (Gonçalves2020CEP78). Through interactions with the EDD1-DYRK2-DDB1 VPRBP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, CEP78 facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of CP110, thereby promoting cilia formation (Gonçalves2020CEP78). Mutations in the CEP78 gene have been linked to genetic disorders such as cone-rod dystrophy with hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal ciliary function and sensory health (Gonçalves2020CEP78; Fu2016CEP78is).

## Structure
The CEP78 protein is composed of 722 amino acids and features a distinct structural organization. Its N-terminal region contains five consecutive leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions (Gonçalves2020CEP78; Ascari2020Functional). These LRR motifs form a horseshoe-shaped curved solenoid structure, contributing to a parallel β-sheet on the concave surface, which is well-suited for protein-protein interactions (Muto2010CLERC). The LRR domain of CEP78 is predicted to contain multiple leucine-rich repeats, with the first leucine residue fitting the consensus sequence of RNAse inhibitor-like (RI-like) class LRRs (Ascari2020Functional).

The C-terminal region of CEP78 includes a coiled-coil domain, known for facilitating the formation of protein complexes (Ascari2020Functional). The protein's tertiary structure is influenced by the packing of leucine residues in the hydrophobic core of the LRR fold, which is crucial for its stability. A missense variant, p.(Leu150Ser), disrupts this packing, leading to a destabilizing effect on the protein's structure (Ascari2020Functional).

CEP78 interacts with several proteins, including CEP350 and the EDD1-DYRK2-DDB1 VPRBP complex, which are important for its role in ciliogenesis (Gonçalves2020CEP78). The LRR region is essential for binding to VPRBP, while CEP350 primarily interacts with the C-terminal region (Gonçalves2020CEP78).

## Function
CEP78 is a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of primary cilia by negatively regulating CP110 levels, a protein that caps the distal ends of centrioles and suppresses ciliogenesis. It functions downstream of CEP350 and interacts with the EDD1-DYRK2-DDB1 VPRBP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is responsible for CP110 ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is essential for the recruitment and stability of CEP78 at the centrosome, which in turn facilitates the recruitment of EDD1 to the centrosome (Gonçalves2020CEP78).

In healthy cells, CEP78 is involved in regulating the frequency and length of cilia. It localizes to the distal end of centrioles, particularly the mother centriole/basal body, and is crucial for the initiation of ciliogenesis by allowing the removal of CP110 from the distal end of the mother centriole. This process is necessary for the docking of centrioles to vesicles or the plasma membrane, marking the onset of ciliogenesis (Gonçalves2020CEP78).

CEP78 also interacts with proteins like IFT20 and TTC21A, which are essential for sperm flagella assembly and male fertility, highlighting its role in maintaining ciliary structures and normal cellular function (Zhu2023Absence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP78 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, primarily affecting vision and hearing. Notably, mutations in CEP78 can lead to cone-rod dystrophy with hearing loss (CRDHL), a condition characterized by progressive vision impairment and hearing loss (Gonçalves2020CEP78; Fu2016CEP78is). These mutations often result in elongated primary cilia, which are linked to a group of disorders known as ciliopathies (Gonçalves2020CEP78). 

Specific mutations, such as the missense mutation p.L150S, impair the interaction of CEP78 with other proteins like CEP350, affecting its recruitment to the centrosome and leading to abnormal ciliary biogenesis (Gonçalves2020CEP78). Another mutation, p.L277P, has been identified in patients with cone and rod dystrophy without hearing impairment, highlighting the clinical heterogeneity of CEP78-related disorders (Shen2021Consanguinitybased).

CEP78 mutations have also been linked to a distinct subtype of Usher syndrome, characterized by cone-rod dystrophy and progressive sensorineural hearing loss (Fu2016CEP78is). These findings underscore the role of CEP78 in maintaining normal ciliary function and its potential contribution to disease when mutated.

## Interactions
CEP78 is a centrosomal protein that plays a significant role in ciliogenesis through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with the EDD1-DYRK2-DDB1 VPRBP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of CP110, a process essential for cilia formation and length regulation (Gonçalves2020CEP78). CEP78 specifically binds to VPRBP, and this interaction is significantly reduced by the L150S mutation in CEP78 (Gonçalves2020CEP78).

CEP78 also interacts with CEP350, particularly binding to its N-terminal region. This interaction is important for the recruitment of CEP78 to the centrosome and its stability. The L150S mutation in CEP78 weakens this interaction, potentially affecting its stability and detection (Gonçalves2020CEP78). CEP78 binds independently to both VPRBP and the N-terminus of CEP350, indicating no competition between these proteins for binding to CEP78 (Gonçalves2020CEP78).

CEP78's interaction with these proteins is crucial for regulating CP110 levels, which in turn affects ciliogenesis and ciliary length. The absence of CEP78 leads to increased CP110 levels, disrupting normal cilia formation (Gonçalves2020CEP78).
