# KLHL22

## Overview
KLHL22 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 22, which functions as a substrate-specific adaptor protein within the BTB-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is primarily involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, where it plays a critical role in protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. The KLHL22 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including the BTB, BACK, and Kelch domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in ubiquitination processes (Wang2023A; Wang2024A). KLHL22 is notably involved in regulating immune responses by modulating the degradation of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), thereby influencing T cell activity (Zhou2020KLHL22). Additionally, KLHL22 has been implicated in various cancers, exhibiting dual roles as an oncogene in breast cancer and a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer, highlighting its complex involvement in cellular signaling and disease (Zhang2024Overexpression; Song2020&lt).

## Structure
KLHL22 is a protein characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in cellular processes. The protein contains a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which facilitates dimerization through hydrophobic interactions. This domain includes a core fold with alpha-helices and beta-strands, and its dimerization is crucial for interaction with CUL3, a component of the CRL3 KLHL22 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Wang2023A; Wang2024A). The BTB domain of KLHL22 also includes an α1 helix and domain-swapping β1 strands, forming a dimeric assembly described as a 'fluttering bird' conformation (Wang2024A).

The KLHL22 protein also features a BACK domain, which exhibits dynamic behavior and contributes to the overall 'fluttering bird' shape of the BTB-BACK dimer (Wang2024A). The Kelch domain of KLHL22 is involved in the ubiquitination region of the CRL3 KLHL22 complex, playing a role in substrate recognition and ubiquitination (Wang2024A).

The quaternary structure of KLHL22 involves its dimeric assembly, which is essential for the recruitment of two CUL3-RBX1 subunits, forming a complex that resembles the letter 'Z' (Wang2024A). This structural arrangement allows for a variable ubiquitination zone, accommodating substrates of different sizes (Wang2023A).

## Function
KLHL22 is a substrate-specific adaptor protein for the BTB-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In healthy human cells, KLHL22 is involved in maintaining PD-1 homeostasis by targeting incompletely glycosylated PD-1 for ubiquitination and degradation before it reaches the cell surface. This regulation is essential to prevent excessive suppression of T cells, as PD-1 is a key checkpoint inhibitory receptor that modulates T cell function (Zhou2020KLHL22).

KLHL22 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell cycle progression and cellular stress responses. It interacts with the mitotic kinase PLK1, regulating its subcellular localization at the kinetochores, which is crucial for the onset of anaphase in human cells (Metzger2013CUL3). KLHL22's activity in the cytoplasm contributes to normal cellular function and organismal development by maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular pathways (Zhou2020KLHL22).

KLHL22 expression is upregulated upon T cell activation, suggesting its role in immune responses by controlling PD-1 levels and preventing excessive T cell suppression (Zhou2020KLHL22).

## Clinical Significance
KLHL22 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), KLHL22 is overexpressed, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and shorter overall survival. High KLHL22 expression correlates with aggressive disease features such as advanced clinical stage and relapse, making it a potential prognostic biomarker for TNBC (Zhang2024Overexpression). 

In contrast, KLHL22 appears to function as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer (CRC). Its expression is significantly lower in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues. Reduced KLHL22 levels are linked to increased migratory and invasive capacities of CRC cells, suggesting that KLHL22 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and proliferation, potentially through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (KLHL22; p&gt; Song2020&lt). 

These findings highlight the dual role of KLHL22 in cancer, acting as an oncogene in breast cancer while serving as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer. This duality underscores the complexity of KLHL22's involvement in cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target (KLHL22; p&gt; Shi2019Kelchlike; Song2020&lt).

## Interactions
KLHL22 is a substrate-specific adaptor protein that interacts with several proteins as part of the CUL3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination and degradation of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), a key immune checkpoint protein. KLHL22 binds to PD-1 with high affinity, mediating its degradation via the proteasome pathway before PD-1 is transported to the cell surface. This interaction is essential for maintaining PD-1 homeostasis and preventing excessive T cell suppression (Zhou2020KLHL22).

KLHL22 also interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) through its kinase domain and Polo-box domain (PBD). This interaction does not require prior posttranslational modifications and is involved in regulating PLK1's subcellular localization at the kinetochores, which is crucial for mitosis (Metzger2013CUL3).

Additionally, KLHL22 is involved in the ubiquitination of DEP domain-containing protein 5 (DEPDC5), which is part of the GATOR1 complex that inhibits the mTORC1 pathway. This interaction highlights KLHL22's role in amino acid sensing and cellular signaling (Wang2023A).
