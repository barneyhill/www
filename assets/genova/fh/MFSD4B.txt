# MFSD4B

## Overview
MFSD4B is a gene that encodes the protein major facilitator superfamily domain containing 4B, which is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is involved in the transport of small solutes, such as D-glucose and urea, across cell membranes. MFSD4B is part of the SLC60 family, which also includes MFSD4A, and plays a crucial role in nutrient metabolism and energy production. The expression of MFSD4B is regulated by glucose availability, highlighting its importance in glucose metabolism, particularly within the central nervous system. This regulation is significant given the association of glucose dysregulation with diseases like Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes (Gyimesi2022Systematic; Ceder2020Glucose). Additionally, MFSD4B is linked to the T-cell metabolic pathway, although its precise function in human cells requires further investigation (Li2023Camel).

## Structure


## Function
MFSD4B is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and is involved in the transport of small solutes across cell membranes. It is part of the SLC60 family, which includes MFSD4A and MFSD4B, both of which are MFS-like proteins. MFSD4B has been shown to transport D-glucose and urea, indicating its role in nutrient metabolism and cellular processes related to energy production (Gyimesi2022Systematic; Ceder2020Glucose). The protein is regulated by glucose availability, with its expression levels being dynamically controlled in response to changes in glucose concentration. This regulation suggests that MFSD4B plays a significant role in glucose metabolism, particularly in the central nervous system, where glucose dysregulation is linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes (Ceder2020Glucose).

In addition to its role in glucose transport, MFSD4B is also associated with the T-cell metabolic pathway, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Li2023Camel). Understanding the substrate specificities and mechanisms of MFSD4B could contribute to a comprehensive understanding of its role in human physiology (Gyimesi2022Systematic).
