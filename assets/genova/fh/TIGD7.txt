# TIGD7

## Overview
TIGD7 is a gene that encodes the protein tigger transposable element derived 7, which is part of the broader family of proteins derived from transposable elements. These proteins are often involved in genomic stability and regulation, although the specific functions of TIGD7 remain to be fully elucidated. The TIGD7 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including potential roles in reproductive biology due to its high expression in the testis (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). Additionally, TIGD7 has been associated with cancer biology, particularly in the context of colorectal cancer, where its expression is influenced by the RNA splicing factor ESRP1 (Ala2020Proteomics-Based). Despite these associations, the protein's interaction network is not yet comprehensively mapped, highlighting the need for further research to understand its biological significance (Ala2020Proteomics-Based).

## Interactions
TIGD7, a gene derived from Tigger transposable elements, is involved in various protein-protein interactions within the human genome. According to the BioGrid database, TIGD7 has five documented protein-protein interactions, indicating its embedded role in the host genome (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). Although specific interaction partners are not detailed in the provided context, the expression of TIGD7 is notably high in the testis, suggesting a potential role in reproductive biology or related cellular processes (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic).

In the context of cancer research, TIGD7 expression was found to increase in human colorectal cancer cells upon overexpression of ESRP1, a protein involved in RNA splicing. This suggests a possible regulatory interaction between ESRP1 and TIGD7, although the exact nature of this interaction remains to be elucidated (Ala2020Proteomics-Based). Despite its involvement in these processes, TIGD7 was excluded from further analysis in a study due to insufficient interaction data in the STRING database, indicating that its interaction network may not be fully characterized yet (Ala2020Proteomics-Based).
