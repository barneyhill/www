# ZSWIM3

## Overview
ZSWIM3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger SWIM-type containing 3 protein, which is characterized by the presence of a SWIM-type zinc finger domain. This domain is typically involved in protein-protein interactions and may play a role in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by ZSWIM3 is implicated in several biological functions, including its potential involvement in cancer pathogenesis and telomere length regulation. Research has highlighted its significance in colon and colorectal cancers, where it is associated with disease-specific gene modules and microsatellite instability status (Shi2020Comprehensive; Sorokin2021Experimental). Additionally, genetic studies have linked ZSWIM3 to telomere length, suggesting its broader relevance in genomic stability and cellular aging (Burren2023Genetic). Despite these associations, the precise molecular mechanisms and pathways involving ZSWIM3 remain an active area of research.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZSWIM3 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to cancer. In colon cancer, ZSWIM3 is identified as one of the location-specific hub genes related to the disease's pathogenesis. It is part of a gene module that shows significant correlation with clinical features of colon cancer, suggesting its potential role in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Shi2020Comprehensive). Additionally, ZSWIM3 is included in a gene signature used to predict microsatellite instability (MSI) status, which is relevant in certain cancers (Sorokin2021Experimental).

In colorectal cancer, ZSWIM3 is noted for its negative correlation with MUC2 expression, a characteristic associated with mucinous differentiation. This suggests a potential role in defining the mucinous characteristics of colorectal cancer (Seishima2022The).

Furthermore, ZSWIM3 has been associated with telomere length (TL) in genetic studies. It is identified as a gene associated with TL, with its association being independent of other related genes like ZSWIM1. This highlights its potential involvement in telomere-related diseases (Burren2023Genetic). These findings indicate that alterations in ZSWIM3 expression or function may contribute to various pathological conditions, although specific clinical associations are still under investigation.
