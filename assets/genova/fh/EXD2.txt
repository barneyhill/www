# EXD2

## Overview
EXD2, or exonuclease 3'-5' domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein with significant roles in mitochondrial function and genomic stability. The EXD2 protein is categorized as an exonuclease, characterized by its 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which is crucial for processing RNA and DNA substrates. This protein is primarily localized to the mitochondria, where it plays a vital role in mitochondrial ribosome mRNA loading, translation, and ATP production, thereby maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Silva2018EXD2). Additionally, EXD2 is involved in nuclear processes, particularly in the recovery of mRNA synthesis following DNA repair, by interacting with RNA Polymerase II during genotoxic stress (Sandoz2023Active). The gene's function is essential for cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been linked to various clinical conditions, including genomic instability and potential implications in cancer therapy (Chennuri2018EXD2).

## Structure
The EXD2 protein is characterized by several domain configurations that suggest specialized functions across different organisms. It contains an HNH-like domain, which influences its binding to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and the 28S ribosomal subunit. This domain lacks the conserved DH catalytic residues found in other HNH endonucleases, indicating a potential diversity in function (Silva2018EXD2). EXD2 also has an EXO domain similar to RRP6, an exosomal RNAse, and an additional HRDC domain, which is absent in metazoan EXD2 nucleases (Silva2018EXD2). In some trypanosome lineages, such as Leishmania, EXD2 includes a Z3H1-type zinc finger not present in other species (Silva2018EXD2).

The protein is primarily localized to mitochondria, as indicated by immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies, and contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) necessary for this localization (Silva2018EXD2). EXD2 exhibits robust 3'-5' exonuclease activity on DNA and RNA substrates, with a preference for ssRNA in the presence of MgCl2 (Silva2018EXD2). The primary role of EXD2 appears to be in mitochondrial ribosome mRNA loading, translation, and ATP production (Silva2018EXD2).

## Function
The EXD2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and genomic stability in healthy human cells. EXD2 is primarily localized to the mitochondria, where it is involved in maintaining mitoribosome integrity and facilitating mitochondrial translation. It prevents the premature association of mitochondrial mRNAs with the 28S mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring proper assembly of the 55S mitoribosome, which is essential for efficient mitochondrial protein synthesis and ATP production (Silva2018EXD2).

EXD2 also exhibits 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which is crucial for its role in mitochondrial RNA processing and maintaining oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity. This activity helps prevent the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and supports cellular energy production (Silva2018EXD2). Despite its primary mitochondrial functions, EXD2 has been implicated in nuclear processes, such as the recovery of mRNA synthesis after DNA repair, by interacting with RNA Polymerase II during genotoxic stress (Sandoz2023Active).

In the absence of EXD2, cells exhibit impaired mitochondrial translation, increased ROS, and metabolic alterations, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism (Silva2018EXD2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the EXD2 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in maintaining genomic stability and mitochondrial function. In Drosophila, mutations in EXD2 lead to increased genomic instability, characterized by chromosome breakage, which suggests a potential role in DNA repair pathways relevant to human health (Chennuri2018EXD2). This genomic instability could have implications for cancer therapies, as inhibiting EXD2 might enhance the efficacy of interstrand crosslink (ICL)-inducing agents, potentially allowing for lower doses and reduced side effects in cancer treatment (Chennuri2018EXD2).

In humans, interstitial deletions in chromosome 14q24, which includes the EXD2 gene, have been associated with congenital heart defects, brachydactyly, and intellectual disability, indicating that EXD2 loss may influence human development (Silva2018EXD2). However, the specific contribution of EXD2 deficiency to these conditions remains unclear. The gene's role in mitochondrial homeostasis also suggests potential implications for diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction, although direct associations with specific human diseases have not been fully established (Silva2018EXD2). Further research is needed to clarify the clinical significance of EXD2 mutations in human health.

## Interactions
EXD2 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in mitochondrial function and transcription recovery after genotoxic stress. In mitochondria, EXD2 interacts with components of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery and the mitoribosome. It associates with complex I and the small 28S subunit of the mitoribosome, including interactions with matrix-exposed complex I subunits and more than 10 subunits of the 28S mitoribosome (Silva2018EXD2). EXD2 also colocalizes with the mitoribosome protein MRPL12, suggesting a role in maintaining mitoribosome integrity (Silva2018EXD2).

Upon UV-induced genotoxic stress, EXD2 translocates from the mitochondria to the nucleus, where it interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), particularly with elongation-blocked RNAPII. This interaction is crucial for the degradation of nascent mRNAs synthesized during the genotoxic attack, facilitating transcription recovery (Sandoz2023Active). EXD2's exonuclease activity processes newly synthesized mRNA, reinforcing its role in transcription recovery (Sandoz2023Active).

In the context of telomere maintenance, EXD2 interacts with the shelterin protein TRF2 at telomeres in ALT-reliant cells, indicating its involvement in telomere stability and replication fork processing (Broderick2023Pathway).
