# STARD10

## Overview
STARD10 is a gene that encodes the protein StAR-related lipid transfer domain containing 10, which is a member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain family. This protein is primarily involved in the intracellular transport of lipids, such as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis (Alpy2005Give; Clark2020The). The START domain within the protein facilitates lipid binding and transfer through a conserved helix-grip fold structure, which is essential for its function in lipid exchange between membranes (Clark2020The). STARD10 is expressed in various tissues, with significant roles in pancreatic islets for insulin secretion and in sperm cells for energy metabolism (Carrat2017Decreased; Alpy2005Give). Additionally, STARD10 interacts with proteins such as ERBB2 and is implicated in pathological conditions like type 2 diabetes and breast cancer, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and prognosis (Carrat2017Decreased; Floris2019Starrelated).

## Structure
STARD10 is characterized by the presence of a START domain, a ~210 amino acid sequence that forms a helix-grip fold structure with a hydrophobic pocket for lipid binding (Alpy2005Give; Clark2020The). This domain is involved in the binding and transfer of lipids such as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (Alpy2005Give; Clark2020The). The helix-grip fold is a conserved structural feature across the START domain family, facilitating lipid interactions through a hydrophobic cavity (Alpy2005Give; Clark2020The).

STARD10 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by casein kinase II, which can affect its lipid transport activity (Clark2020The). The protein is also subject to potential phosphorylation or deamidation, as indicated by its behavior during purification processes (Hoffmann2005Breast).

While specific details about the quaternary structure of STARD10 are not provided, the protein's role in lipid transfer suggests it may interact with other cellular components to facilitate its function. The START domain's ability to undergo conformational changes is crucial for its interaction with membranes and lipid binding (Alpy2005Give).

## Function
STARD10 is a member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain family, involved in the transport of phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) between intracellular membranes. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis by facilitating lipid exchange between membranes, a process that involves the α4 helix opening the lipid-binding pocket upon membrane interaction (Clark2011The; Alpy2005Give).

In healthy human cells, STARD10 is highly expressed in pancreatic islets, particularly in alpha and beta cells, where it is essential for normal insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Its expression is correlated with insulin secretion, and decreased levels are associated with impaired insulin secretion, which is relevant to type 2 diabetes (Carrat2017Decreased).

STARD10 is active in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum, influencing processes like membrane composition and signaling pathways. It is also involved in energy metabolism, particularly in sperm cells, where it is concentrated in the sperm flagellum, suggesting a role in mobilizing phosphatidylcholine for energy production (Alpy2005Give).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STARD10 gene have been linked to several diseases, notably type 2 diabetes (T2D) and breast cancer. In the context of T2D, decreased expression of STARD10 is associated with impaired insulin secretion in both humans and mice. This impairment is linked to genetic variants near the STARD10 locus, which affect its expression in pancreatic beta cells. These variants are believed to mediate T2D risk by reducing STARD10 expression, thereby impacting insulin secretion and glucose regulation (Carrat2017Decreased).

In breast cancer, low or absent STARD10 expression is associated with poor prognosis. Studies have shown that low STARD10 expression is an independent predictor of decreased survival in breast cancer patients, regardless of HER2/neu amplification and triple-negative status. This suggests that STARD10 could serve as a prognostic marker, helping to identify patients with particularly adverse outcomes. The loss of STARD10 expression may be linked to a loss of estrogen receptor function or dedifferentiation, which are known aspects of cancer progression (Murphy2010Loss).

## Interactions
STARD10 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It has a notable interaction with the ERBB2 protein, a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with breast cancer progression. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of alcohol-induced breast cancer, where ethanol exposure increases the expression of both STARD10 and ERBB2. The co-expression of these proteins is linked to enhanced cell malignancy and aggressiveness, suggesting a positive regulatory loop where overexpression of one leads to increased expression of the other (Floris2019Starrelated).

STARD10 is also phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) on serine 284, which modulates its lipid transfer activity. This phosphorylation negatively regulates STARD10's activity, affecting its association with cellular membranes (Olayioye2007Phosphorylation). Ethanol exposure decreases CKII activity, leading to an increase in the unphosphorylated fraction of STARD10, which enhances its membrane fluidity and influences cancer cell behavior (Floris2019Starrelated).

Additionally, STARD10 interacts with the transcription factor p65, a component of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Ethanol-induced expression of p65 promotes STARD10 and ERBB2 expression by binding to their promoter sequences, highlighting p65 as a key regulator in this process (Floris2019Starrelated).
