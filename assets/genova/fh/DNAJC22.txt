# DNAJC22

## Overview
DNAJC22 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C22, which functions as a co-chaperone in the cellular stress response. This protein is part of the Hsp40 family, known for its role in assisting Hsp70 chaperones with protein folding, stabilization, and degradation, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis (Zhao2008Biological). DNAJC22 is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidneys, and intestine, indicating its involvement in metabolic and detoxification processes (Aschenbrenner2017A). The gene's expression is regulated by the transcription factor HNF4A, which binds to its promoter region, suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism across species (Aschenbrenner2017A). DNAJC22 has been implicated in breast cancer, with altered expression levels observed in various subtypes, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression and as a therapeutic target (Zoppino2018Comprehensive; FernandezMuñoz2024Mutational).

## Function
DNAJC22, a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40), functions as a co-chaperone that interacts with Hsp70 chaperones to assist in protein folding, stabilization, and degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular stress responses, ensuring proper cellular function and integrity (Zhao2008Biological). In healthy human cells, DNAJC22 is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidneys, and intestine, suggesting a role in the metabolic and detoxification processes typical of these organs (Aschenbrenner2017A).

The transcriptional regulation of DNAJC22 is significantly influenced by the transcription factor HNF4A, which binds to the DNAJC22 promoter region. This binding has been confirmed through experimental methods such as ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR, indicating that HNF4A plays a major role in modulating DNAJC22 expression across different tissues and species (Aschenbrenner2017A). The conservation of HNF4A binding sites in the DNAJC22 locus across multiple species suggests a conserved regulatory mechanism, highlighting the gene's evolutionary importance (Aschenbrenner2017A). Despite its established role in transcriptional regulation, the specific function of DNAJC22 in healthy human cells remains uncharacterized in the available literature (Aschenbrenner2017A).

## Clinical Significance
The DNAJC22 gene, a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family, has been implicated in breast cancer through its altered expression levels. Studies have shown that DNAJC22 is upregulated in several breast cancer subtypes, including Luminal A, Luminal B, and HER2, but not in the Basal subtype (Zoppino2018Comprehensive). This differential expression suggests a potential role in the progression and subtype-specific characteristics of breast cancer. 

Additionally, DNAJC22 has been identified as having subtype-specific copy number variations (CNVs) in the Basal subgroup of breast cancer, where it exhibits deletion CNVs (FernandezMuñoz2024Mutational). These genetic alterations may contribute to the distinct molecular and clinical features observed in this aggressive breast cancer subtype.

The regulation of DNAJC22 by the transcription factor HNF4A has been demonstrated across multiple species, indicating a conserved mechanism that may influence its expression in cancer contexts (Aschenbrenner2017A). While the direct impact of DNAJC22 mutations on specific diseases remains unclear, its altered expression and regulation suggest a significant role in cancer biology, warranting further investigation into its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target.
