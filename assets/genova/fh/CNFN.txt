# CNFN

## Overview
The CNFN gene encodes the protein cornifelin, which plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of the cornified envelope in epithelial tissues. Cornifelin is categorized as a structural protein, integral to the barrier function of the skin, and is involved in keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal homeostasis. It operates in conjunction with other proteins such as involucrin and loricrin to ensure the structural integrity of the cornified envelope, which is crucial for protecting epithelial tissues from environmental stressors (Choi2014Identification). The expression of cornifelin is particularly significant in the upper layers of the epithelium, where it contributes to the development and maintenance of the cornified envelope, enhancing the barrier function in response to irritants and playing a protective role in conditions like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (Choi2014Identification). Additionally, alterations in CNFN expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where it may function as a tumor suppressor (Zhu2023Identification).

## Structure


## Function
The CNFN gene encodes cornifelin, a protein integral to the formation and maintenance of the cornified envelope in epithelial tissues. In healthy human cells, cornifelin is a crucial component of the cornified envelope, which is essential for the barrier function of epithelial tissues. This protein works alongside other proteins such as involucrin and loricrin to ensure the structural integrity of the cornified envelope. While involucrin serves as a crosslinking precursor, cornifelin contributes to the envelope's structure in a manner similar to loricrin (Choi2014Identification).

Cornifelin is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it participates in keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal homeostasis. Its expression is particularly important in the upper layers of the epithelium, where the cornified envelope develops, helping to maintain the integrity of the epithelial barrier (Choi2014Identification). The protein's role extends to enhancing barrier function in response to irritants, as its expression increases in conditions like psoriatic skin and atopic dermatitis, suggesting a protective mechanism against further permeation of irritants (Choi2014Identification). This up-regulation is also associated with the proliferation of corneocytes and the repair of damaged corneal structures (Choi2014Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The CNFN gene, also known as cornifelin, has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), CNFN expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. Higher CNFN expression is associated with a trend towards longer overall survival and disease-free survival, although this is not statistically significant. CNFN expression is also higher in patients without lymph node metastasis, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion in HNSCC (Zhu2023Identification).

In skin conditions, CNFN is notably upregulated in psoriatic skin compared to normal skin, indicating its involvement in the pathophysiology of psoriasis. The gene is a component of the cornified envelope and is expressed in the granular cell layer of the epidermis. Overexpression of CNFN in transgenic mice led to changes in the expression of other cornified envelope proteins, such as loricrin and involucrin, which are also altered in psoriasis (Michibata2004Identification). These findings suggest that CNFN may play a role in skin barrier function and its dysregulation could contribute to skin disorders like psoriasis.
