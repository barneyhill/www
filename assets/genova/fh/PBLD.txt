# PBLD

## Overview
The PBLD gene encodes the phenazine biosynthesis-like domain-containing protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and modulating immune responses. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its involvement in signaling pathways and protein interactions. PBLD plays a crucial role in the regulation of tight junction proteins, thereby supporting the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing permeability (Chen2021Epithelial). It also interacts with key components of the NF-κB signaling pathway, inhibiting its activation and thus reducing inflammatory responses (Chen2021Epithelial). Additionally, PBLD is involved in antiviral defense mechanisms by enhancing type I interferon responses and promoting apoptosis, which are essential for inhibiting viral replication (Zhu2024PBLD). Alterations in PBLD expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and viral infections, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2024PBLD; Han2022PBLD).

## Structure


## Function
The PBLD gene, also known as phenazine biosynthesis-like domain-containing protein, plays a significant role in maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier function and modulating inflammatory responses. In healthy human cells, PBLD is involved in the regulation of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Overexpression of PBLD enhances the expression and proper localization of these proteins, thereby supporting barrier integrity and reducing permeability (Chen2021Epithelial).

PBLD also interacts with the NF-κB signaling pathway, a critical regulator of immune responses. By inhibiting NF-κB activation, PBLD reduces the expression of inflammatory mediators, thus playing a protective role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and modulating inflammation (Chen2021Epithelial). This interaction involves PBLD's association with IKKα and IKKβ, key components of the NF-κB pathway, suggesting a mechanism by which PBLD suppresses NF-κB activation (Chen2021Epithelial).

In the context of viral infections, PBLD enhances the type I interferon response and promotes apoptosis, which are essential for inhibiting viral replication. This function is mediated through its interaction with IRF3, facilitating the production of antiviral cytokines and promoting virus-induced apoptosis (Zhu2024PBLD).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PBLD gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PBLD is significantly downregulated, which is associated with increased angiogenesis and cancer metastasis. This downregulation correlates with poor tumor differentiation and advanced disease stages, suggesting that PBLD acts as a tumor suppressor in HCC (Han2022PBLD; Wu2019Novel). PBLD inhibits angiogenesis by targeting the HIF-1a/VEGF axis and the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, reducing VEGF secretion and HIF-1a nuclear translocation (Han2022PBLD). 

In breast cancer, PBLD expression is also decreased, and its knockdown leads to enhanced tumor progression and chemoresistance. The circKDM4C/miR-548p/PBLD axis has been identified as a potential therapeutic target, as circKDM4C upregulates PBLD expression, reducing tumor growth and metastasis (Liang2019circKDM4C).

PBLD also plays a role in antiviral responses. It enhances type I interferon responses and apoptosis to inhibit viral replication. PBLD-deficient mice show increased susceptibility to viral infections, highlighting its importance in immune defense (Zhu2024PBLD). These findings suggest that PBLD expression alterations could have significant implications for therapeutic strategies in cancer and viral infections.

## Interactions
PBLD (phenazine biosynthesis-like domain-containing protein) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. PBLD interacts directly with DUSP6, a dual-specificity phosphatase, to maintain its stability by preventing SKP2-induced degradation. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting angiogenesis by affecting the ERK/HIF-1a/VEGF signaling axis (Han2022PBLD). PBLD also interacts with SKP2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, but shows a preferential binding to DUSP6, thereby inhibiting SKP2's role in DUSP6 degradation (Han2022PBLD).

In the context of inflammation, PBLD physically interacts with IKKα and IKKβ, key components of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This interaction inhibits NF-κB activation, which is significant in modulating intestinal epithelial barrier function and inflammatory responses (Chen2021Epithelial).

PBLD also plays a role in antiviral defense by interacting with IRF3, a transcription factor involved in the type I interferon response. PBLD enhances the interaction between IRF3 and the pro-apoptotic protein Puma, facilitating virus-induced apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway. This interaction is crucial for promoting apoptosis and inhibiting viral replication (Zhu2024PBLD).
