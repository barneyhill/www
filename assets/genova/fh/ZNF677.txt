# ZNF677

## Overview
ZNF677 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 677, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 677 is implicated in various cellular processes, including acting as a tumor suppressor in several types of cancer. The gene's expression is often regulated through promoter methylation, which can lead to its downregulation and contribute to tumorigenesis. The protein's ability to inhibit pathways such as Akt phosphorylation underscores its significance in cancer biology, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Liang2021OverExpression; Li2018ZNF677; Bidar2021ZNF677).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF677 gene have been implicated in various cancers, primarily due to promoter hypermethylation leading to its downregulation. In gastric cancer, ZNF677 is significantly hypermethylated, correlating with decreased gene expression, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This hypermethylation is observed early in gastric tumorigenesis, even in precancerous lesions, indicating its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker (Bidar2021ZNF677).

In colorectal cancer, the loss of ZNF677 expression is associated with adverse clinical features, including lymph node metastasis. This loss is often due to promoter methylation, and restoring ZNF677 expression can reduce cell growth and increase chemotherapy sensitivity (Siraj2021Loss).

ZNF677 also plays a tumor-suppressive role in thyroid cancer by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation, a key process in tumorigenesis. Its downregulation, often through promoter methylation, is linked to poor survival outcomes (Li2018ZNF677).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, ZNF677 is frequently hypermethylated, leading to reduced expression. Its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liang2021OverExpression).
