# TES

## Overview
The TES gene encodes the testin LIM domain protein, a multifunctional protein involved in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. Testin is characterized by its modular structure, which includes an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, a central PET domain, and three C-terminal LIM domains, the latter being zinc-binding motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Coutts2003TES; Sala2017The). As a cytoskeletal-associated protein, testin plays a significant role in maintaining cell shape and motility by interacting with actin filaments and other focal adhesion proteins. It is particularly active in focal adhesions and cell-to-cell junctions, contributing to the integrity of the endothelial cell layer and influencing cell migration through interactions with the Ena/VASP protein family (Boëda2007Tes; Archacki2011Comparative). The TES gene is also recognized for its tumor suppressor functions, with its expression often downregulated in various cancers due to epigenetic modifications, underscoring its importance in cancer pathogenesis (Bai2014Downregulation; Weeks2010Silencing).

## Structure
The TES gene encodes the testin LIM domain protein, which is characterized by its modular structure comprising an N-terminal cysteine-rich (CR) domain, a central PET domain, and three C-terminal LIM domains. The LIM domains are zinc-binding motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion (Coutts2003TES; Sala2017The).

The PET domain, spanning amino acids 52-233, interacts with the LIM1-2 domains, contributing to the protein's conformational dynamics. This interaction is essential for testin's ability to form both monomeric and antiparallel homodimeric structures, suggesting a complex conformational repertoire (Sala2017The). The LIM1 domain is a hotspot for phosphorylation, which may regulate conformational transitions (Sala2017The).

Testin can exist in different conformational states, including a closed monomer, an open monomer, and an antiparallel dimer. The monomeric form has an estimated molecular weight of 60 kDa, while the dimeric form is approximately 98 kDa, indicating a more spherical conformation (Sala2017The). The protein's structure and interactions are further influenced by post-translational modifications and potential splice variant isoforms, which may result in distinct functional properties (Coutts2003TES).

## Function
The TES gene encodes the testin LIM domain protein, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cell shape and motility by interacting with actin filaments. In healthy human cells, TES is involved in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction. It is active in focal adhesions and cell-to-cell junctions, contributing to the integrity of the endothelial cell layer (Archacki2011Comparative). TES expression is notably higher in atherosclerosis-resistant internal mammary arteries compared to atherosclerosis-prone left anterior descending coronary arteries, suggesting a protective role against atherosclerosis (Archacki2011Comparative).

TES influences the adhesion and migration of monocytes across the endothelial cell layer, processes critical in the development of atherosclerosis. Overexpression of TES reduces monocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration, while knockdown increases these functions, indicating its role in maintaining endothelial cell integrity (Archacki2011Comparative). TES also regulates cell migration through its interaction with the Ena/VASP protein family, specifically binding to the EVH1 domain of Mena via its LIM3 domain. This interaction modulates the localization and function of Mena, thereby influencing cell motility (Boëda2007Tes). The LIM3 domain of TES is essential for this interaction, highlighting its specificity in regulating Mena-dependent cell migration (Boëda2007Tes).

## Clinical Significance
The TES gene, encoding the testin LIM domain protein, is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), TES is frequently silenced by dense promoter methylation, leading to a loss of expression and contributing to leukemia development (Weeks2010Silencing). Similarly, in glioblastoma (GBM), hypermethylation of the TES promoter is associated with reduced TES expression, decreased apoptosis, and poor clinical outcomes (Bai2014Downregulation).

In gastric cancer, TES is often downregulated due to promoter methylation and loss of heterozygosity, correlating with poor prognosis and lower tumor differentiation (Ma2010Extensive). TES expression is also reduced in prostate tumors, where it is thought to contribute to tumorigenesis through its involvement in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (Chêne2004Extensive).

TES's tumor suppressor function is further supported by studies in Tes knockout mice, which show a higher incidence of tumors, indicating its critical role in inhibiting tumor growth (Drusco2005Knockout). The gene's inactivation in various cancers is primarily due to epigenetic changes rather than mutations, highlighting the significance of TES in cancer pathogenesis (Weeks2020Silencing).

## Interactions
The TES gene encodes the testin LIM domain protein, which is involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. TES interacts with several focal adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins, including zyxin, Mena, VASP, talin, and actin. These interactions occur in actin-rich structures such as stress fibers, focal adhesions, and adherens junctions (Griffith2005RNAi; Sala2017The). TES directly binds to the EVH1 domain of Mena through its LIM3 domain, but not to the EVH1 domains of VASP or Evl, despite their sequence similarity to Mena's EVH1 domain (Boëda2007Tes). This interaction is crucial for regulating cell migration in a Mena-dependent manner and may contribute to TES's antitumorigenic potential (Boëda2007Tes).

TES also forms complexes with actin-related proteins, such as Arp7A, in the subacrosomal layer of round spermatids. The N-terminal 65-residue extension of Arp7A interacts directly with the LIM2-3 domains of TES, suggesting a potential cytoskeletal function for Arp7A (Boëda2011Molecular). TES's recruitment to focal adhesions is dependent on its interaction with zyxin, which is necessary for its localization to these sites (Garvalov2003The).
