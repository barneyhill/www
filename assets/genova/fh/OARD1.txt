# OARD1

## Overview
OARD1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme O-acyl-ADP-ribose deacylase 1, also known as TARG1. This enzyme is a crucial component of cellular metabolism, particularly in the regulation of ADP-ribose derivatives. As a deacylase, TARG1 is involved in reversing mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation, a post-translational modification that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including DNA damage response and chromatin structure regulation. TARG1 is predominantly active in the nucleoplasm and nucleoli, where it contributes to nucleolar homeostasis and RNA metabolism, implicating it in ribosome biogenesis and rRNA synthesis. The enzyme's interactions with ribosomal proteins and its involvement in DNA repair mechanisms underscore its importance in maintaining cellular integrity. Mutations in the OARD1 gene have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and other clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in human health (Liu2017The; Žaja2020Comparative).

## Function
OARD1, also known as TARG1, is an enzyme involved in the regulation of cellular processes through its role in the metabolism of ADP-ribose derivatives. It is primarily active in the nucleoplasm and nucleoli of cells, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining nucleolar homeostasis. The loss of TARG1 leads to an increase in the number and total area of nucleoli, indicating its importance in nucleolar morphology and function (Žaja2020Comparative). TARG1 is also associated with increased rRNA synthesis, suggesting a role in regulating nucleolar activity and rDNA transcription (Žaja2020Comparative).

TARG1 is involved in RNA metabolism, particularly in nucleolar and possibly cytoplasmic RNA processes, and is implicated in ribosome biogenesis (Žaja2020Comparative). It interacts with ribosomal proteins, although the exact molecular mechanisms remain unclear (Žaja2020Comparative). The enzyme's activity in reversing mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation, a post-translational modification, is essential for various cellular functions, including DNA damage response and chromatin structure regulation (Žaja2020Comparative). TARG1's broad tissue distribution suggests a potentially wide-ranging role in cellular functions across different tissues (Žaja2020Comparative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the OARD1 gene, which encodes the enzyme TARG1, have been linked to several clinical conditions. Homozygous, inactivating germline mutations in OARD1 are associated with severe neurodegenerative phenotypes in children, indicating a crucial role for TARG1 in neuronal function (Lüscher2017ADP-Ribosylation). Additionally, OARD1 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified OARD1 as a risk locus for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), suggesting its involvement in the disease's genetic architecture (Andrews2020Interpretation; Clarimon2020Genetic).

OARD1 is also associated with Kashin-Beck disease (KBD), an endemic osteochondropathy. A significant genetic association was found between the SNP rs11280 on the OARD1 gene and KBD, indicating that variations in this gene may increase the risk of developing the disease (Cheng2021Genetic). While the mutation rate of OARD1 in cancer is low, its role in cellular processes such as nucleolar function and RNA metabolism suggests potential implications in carcinogenesis (Feijs2020The; Žaja2020Comparative).

## Interactions
OARD1, also known as O-acyl-ADP-ribose deacylase 1, is involved in interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in cellular processes such as DNA repair and nucleolar morphology. OARD1 interacts with RNA and ribosomal proteins, although it is unclear whether these interactions are direct or mediated through RNA components (Žaja2020Comparative). The BioID interaction screen has been used to identify potential substrates and interactors of OARD1 in living cells, providing insights into its physiological roles (Žaja2020Comparative).

OARD1 is also involved in the DNA damage response, where it participates in dePARylation, a process crucial for the regulation of DNA repair mechanisms. It removes the whole PAR chain from PARylated proteins and can hydrolyze the glutamate-ADP-ribose bond, releasing the terminal ADP-ribose unit from MARylated proteins (Liu2017The). This enzymatic activity is essential for preventing the trapping of repair factors at DNA lesions, which could block access to downstream repair factors (Liu2017The).

OARD1's role in DNA damage signaling is further supported by its involvement in the removal of terminal mono(ADP-ribose) moieties, which is crucial for the regulation of PARP1 activity and the recruitment of proteins involved in DNA damage repair (Ray2017The).
