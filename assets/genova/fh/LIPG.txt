# LIPG

## Overview
The LIPG gene encodes the protein endothelial lipase (EL), a member of the triglyceride lipase family, which plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism. EL is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of phospholipids in high-density lipoproteins (HDL), influencing HDL cholesterol levels and contributing to lipid homeostasis (Ishida2003Endothelial). This enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the thyroid, lung, and liver, and is regulated by factors associated with vascular disease processes (Ishida2003Endothelial). EL's activity extends to the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL), where it works synergistically with lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to promote efficient lipolysis (Khetarpal2021Endothelial). Beyond its metabolic functions, LIPG has clinical significance in cancer biology, particularly in breast cancer, where its overexpression is linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Lo2018LIPG; Cadenas2019LIPG‐promoted).

## Structure
The LIPG gene encodes the endothelial lipase (EL) protein, which is a member of the triglyceride lipase family. The primary structure of EL consists of approximately 500 amino acids, including a 20-residue signal peptide, resulting in a mature protein of 480 residues (Razzaghi2012PopulationBased). The secondary structure of EL includes a two-domain configuration with a catalytic triad in the N-terminal domain responsible for hydrolyzing HDL phospholipids, and a C-terminal PLAT domain involved in substrate binding (Razzaghi2013Genetic). 

The tertiary structure of EL is characterized by a unique 23-amino acid loop within the C-domain, which may adopt a novel structure and is involved in lipid interaction (Razzaghi2013Genetic). EL forms homodimers in a head-to-tail conformation, which is crucial for its interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and allows it to accommodate various sizes of HDL particles, indicating a quaternary structure (Razzaghi2013Genetic). 

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is essential for its function as a glycoprotein (Hong2020LIPG:). The protein is cleaved into inactive fragments by extracellular proprotein convertases, with the cleavage site identified at Arg-330 (Hong2020LIPG:).

## Function
The LIPG gene encodes endothelial lipase (EL), an enzyme primarily involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the hydrolysis of phospholipids in high-density lipoproteins (HDL). EL is expressed in various tissues, including the thyroid, lung, placenta, kidney, liver, testis, and adult vasculature, and is regulated by factors involved in vascular disease processes (Ishida2003Endothelial). It plays a significant role in HDL metabolism by catalyzing the hydrolysis of HDL phospholipids, which facilitates HDL clearance from circulation (Cohen2003Endothelial). This activity is crucial for normal lipoprotein metabolism, as it influences HDL cholesterol levels and phospholipase activity (Ishida2003Endothelial).

EL also contributes to the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) by working synergistically with lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to promote efficient lipolysis and clearance of these lipoproteins (Khetarpal2021Endothelial). In humans, a loss-of-function variant in LIPG is associated with elevated plasma triglycerides and phospholipids in TRLs, indicating its role in TRL metabolism (Khetarpal2021Endothelial). EL's activity in lipid metabolism is significant for maintaining lipid homeostasis and may have implications for cardiovascular health (Hong2020LIPG:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LIPG gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in breast cancer. LIPG is overexpressed in basal-like triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), where it plays a crucial role in promoting tumor initiation, metastasis, and malignant characteristics such as invasiveness and stemness (Lo2018LIPG). The gene's overexpression is linked to the DTX3L-ISG15 pathway, which is involved in immune response and cancer development, suggesting that LIPG may enhance the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, potentially contributing to TNBC progression (Lo2018LIPG).

In breast cancer, LIPG also supports lipid storage and adaptation to oxidative stress, providing a survival advantage under metabolic stress conditions (Cadenas2019LIPG‐promoted). High LIPG expression is associated with shorter metastasis-free survival in node-negative breast cancer patients, indicating its role in poor prognosis (Cadenas2019LIPG‐promoted). The gene's involvement in lipid metabolism is crucial for breast cancer cell proliferation, as it facilitates the uptake of extracellular lipids necessary for cell growth (Slebe2016FoxA). These findings suggest that targeting LIPG could be a potential therapeutic strategy in breast cancer treatment.

## Interactions
LIPG, also known as endothelial lipase, is involved in various interactions that influence lipid metabolism. It collaborates with lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to enhance the lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), with studies showing that the combination of LIPG and LPL results in greater triglyceride lipolysis than LPL alone (Khetarpal2021Endothelial). LIPG also demonstrates phospholipase activity, particularly on low-density lipoproteins (LDL), promoting LDL catabolism (Khetarpal2021Endothelial).

In the context of colorectal cancer, LIPG interacts with the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1, which stabilizes LIPG mRNA through m6A modification. This interaction is part of a signaling axis involving ZDHHC1, which negatively regulates LIPG expression by palmitoylating IGF2BP1, thereby inhibiting colorectal cancer cell growth (Zhang2024ZDHHC1).

LIPG's role extends to its interaction with apolipoproteins, which are crucial for lipid transport and metabolism. These interactions may form part of multiprotein complexes that affect lipid signaling pathways (Khetarpal2021Endothelial). Through these interactions, LIPG plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and related cellular processes.
