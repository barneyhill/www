# PPP1R15A

## Overview
PPP1R15A is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A, also known as GADD34. This protein is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and plays a pivotal role in cellular stress responses by facilitating the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). As a regulatory subunit, PPP1R15A is integral to the modulation of the integrated stress response (ISR) and the unfolded protein response (UPR), processes that are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions. The protein forms a ternary complex with PP1 and G-actin, which is essential for its substrate-specific activity. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases (CrespilloCasado2017PPP1R15Amediated; Bouchla2024Silencing; Hicks2023The).

## Structure
PPP1R15A, also known as GADD34, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). The protein is composed of over 600 residues, with the C-terminal 70 residues being essential for substrate-specific dephosphorylation of eIF2α-P (CrespilloCasado2017PPP1R15Amediated). This C-terminal region is highly conserved and natively unfolded, gaining structure upon binding with the PP1 catalytic and G-actin ancillary subunits (CrespilloCasado2017PPP1R15Amediated). 

The N-terminal region of PPP1R15A contains a membrane association domain, which affects its solubility, while a soluble fragment (residues 325-636) lacks this domain (CrespilloCasado2017Choice). The protein forms a ternary complex with PP1 and G-actin, which is crucial for its function in eIF2α dephosphorylation (CrespilloCasado2018A). Specific mutations in the C-terminal extension, such as W582A and F592A, can abolish its ability to mediate eIF2α dephosphorylation, highlighting the importance of this region for its function (CrespilloCasado2017PPP1R15Amediated). The interaction with G-actin is essential for providing substrate specificity to the PPP1R15A-PP1 complex (Chen2015Gactin).

## Function
PPP1R15A, also known as GADD34, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a critical role in the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). This process is essential for regulating protein synthesis in response to cellular stress, particularly during the integrated stress response (ISR) and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (CrespilloCasado2017PPP1R15Amediated; Hicks2023The). 

In healthy human cells, PPP1R15A forms a complex with PP1 and G-actin to specifically target eIF2α for dephosphorylation, thereby modulating the ISR and maintaining protein folding homeostasis (CrespilloCasado2017PPP1R15Amediated). This dephosphorylation is crucial for terminating stress signaling and resuming normal protein synthesis, which is vital for cellular recovery from stress (Harding2009Ppp1r15). 

PPP1R15A is inducible and contributes to a negative feedback loop in the ISR, helping cells recover from stress by resuming normal protein synthesis (CrespilloCasado2017PPP1R15Amediated). The protein is particularly important in the PERK-dependent branch of the UPR, influencing cell survival or death based on the duration of stress (Hicks2023The). In dendritic cells, PPP1R15A is involved in cytokine production in response to viral infection, linking pathogen detection with stress response pathways (Clavarino2012Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PPP1R15A gene, also known as GADD34, have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PPP1R15A is overexpressed in patients compared to healthy controls, and its upregulation is associated with worse cytogenetic risk. This overexpression contributes to chemotherapy resistance, as silencing PPP1R15A enhances the sensitivity of AML cells to chemotherapeutic agents like Idarubicin and Cytarabine, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Bouchla2024Silencing).

In the context of metabolic diseases, inactivation of PPP1R15A in mice has been shown to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, even in conditions of beta-cell depletion. This suggests that PPP1R15A plays a role in regulating energy metabolism and insulin resistance, with potential therapeutic implications for managing obesity and type 2 diabetes (Patel2019Inactivation).

PPP1R15A is also involved in the regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) through its role in eIF2α dephosphorylation. Dysregulation of this process can lead to prolonged ER stress and altered cell survival outcomes, which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (Hicks2023The).

## Interactions
PPP1R15A, also known as GADD34, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a crucial role in cellular stress responses by dephosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). PPP1R15A forms a complex with the catalytic subunit PP1 and the ancillary subunit G-actin to specifically target eIF2α for dephosphorylation (CrespilloCasado2017PPP1R15Amediated). The interaction with PP1 is mediated through a conserved RVxF motif in the C-terminal region of PPP1R15A, which is essential for its function (crespillo2018eif2). 

Mutations in PPP1R15A, such as V556E and F592A, have been shown to affect its binding affinity with PP1 and G-actin, respectively, indicating distinct interaction sites for these proteins (CrespilloCasado2017PPP1R15Amediated). The interaction between PPP1R15A and PP1 is strong, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 27±8 nM, as measured by bio-layer interferometry (BLI) (crespillo2018eif2). 

Despite previous reports suggesting that compounds like Sephin1 and Guanabenz disrupt the PPP1R15A-PP1 complex, studies have found no measurable effect of these compounds on the interaction in vitro (CrespilloCasado2017PPP1R15Amediated).
