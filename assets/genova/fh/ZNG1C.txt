# ZNG1C

## Overview
ZNG1C is a gene that encodes the protein Zn regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator 1C, which plays a crucial role in cellular zinc homeostasis. This protein is categorized as a GTPase, a type of enzyme that hydrolyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein synthesis. The activity of Zn regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator 1C is modulated by zinc ions, which are essential for its function in regulating metalloprotein activity. The gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest due to their potential implications in zinc-related metabolic pathways and disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
