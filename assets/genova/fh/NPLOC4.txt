# NPLOC4

## Overview
The NPLOC4 gene encodes the NPL4 homolog, a ubiquitin recognition factor that plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and turnover in eukaryotic cells. The NPL4 protein is a component of the p97 complex, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, chromatin-associated functions, and DNA repair. As a ubiquitin recognition factor, NPL4 facilitates the extraction of ubiquitinated proteins for degradation, working in concert with Ufd1 and the AAA-ATPase p97. This complex is essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis and is implicated in processes such as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and ribosome-associated quality control. The structural domains of NPL4, including the UBXL, zinc-finger, MPN, C-terminal, and NZF domains, enable its interaction with ubiquitin chains and other proteins, underscoring its role in modulating p97's activity and involvement in protein degradation pathways (Meyer2000A; Blythe2017Ubiquitin; Sato2019Structural).

## Structure
The NPLOC4 protein, also known as NPL4 homolog, ubiquitin recognition factor, is a component of the human p97 complex and plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It contains several domains, including a UBXL domain, a zinc-finger domain, an MPN domain, a C-terminal domain (CTD), and an NZF domain. These domains facilitate its interaction with ubiquitin chains and other proteins within the complex (Sato2019Structural).

The zinc-finger motifs, particularly ZF1 and ZF2, are essential for binding interactions, including those with cupric ions, which can affect the function of the p97 complex (Pan2021Seesaw). The NZF domain of NPLOC4 binds ubiquitin chains without linkage specificity, unlike its yeast counterpart, which specifically binds K48-linked chains (Sato2019Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, NPLOC4 forms a complex with Ufd1 and the Cdc48 ATPase, known as the Cdc48-UN complex, which is involved in substrate unfolding and degradation (Sato2019Structural). The interaction between NPLOC4 and Ufd1 is crucial for the assembly and function of this complex (Sato2019Structural). The protein's structure and interactions are significant for its role in cellular proteostasis and potential therapeutic targeting (Pan2021Seesaw).

## Function
The NPLOC4 gene encodes the Npl4 protein, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a key pathway for protein degradation and turnover in cells. Npl4 functions as a ubiquitin recognition factor, facilitating the extraction of ubiquitinated proteins from cellular structures for degradation. It is part of a complex with Ufd1 and the AAA-ATPase p97, which is involved in various cellular processes, including ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and nuclear transport pathways (van2018VCPp97Mediated; Meyer2000A).

In healthy human cells, the Npl4 protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to processes such as cell cycle regulation, chromatin-associated functions, and DNA repair. The p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex is essential for the degradation of transcription factors and other proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, playing a role in chromosomal segregation during mitosis and the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (Meyer2012Emerging). The complex also participates in ER-associated degradation (ERAD), ribosome-associated quality control, and mitochondria-associated degradation, which are vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and responding to cellular stress (Blythe2017Ubiquitin; van2018VCPp97Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
NPLOC4 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), NPLOC4 is highly expressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal lung tissues. This overexpression is associated with shorter survival times and advanced tumor stages, suggesting that NPLOC4 may serve as a poor prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target. The study by Wang et al. highlights the potential of targeting NPLOC4 with drugs like disulfiram (DSF) combined with copper (Cu) to inhibit ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and induce apoptosis in cancer cells (Wang2023NPLOC4).

In the context of genetic disorders, NPLOC4 is part of a gene cluster associated with the risk of strabismus, a condition characterized by ocular misalignment. Variants within the NPLOC4-TSPAN10-PDE6G gene cluster have been linked to strabismus, with specific variants affecting the expression of nearby genes, potentially contributing to the development of this condition (Plotnikov2019A).

Additionally, NPLOC4, as part of the p97/VCP complex, is involved in protein unfolding and degradation. Mutations affecting this complex can lead to multisystem proteinopathy, a condition that includes diseases such as inclusion body myopathy and Paget's disease of bone (Blythe2017Ubiquitin).

## Interactions
NPLOC4, also known as NPL4 homolog, ubiquitin recognition factor, is involved in several protein interactions, primarily forming a complex with UFD1 and the AAA ATPase p97 (also known as VCP or Cdc48). This complex is crucial for various cellular processes, including the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where it facilitates the extraction and degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Blythe2017Ubiquitin; Pye2007Structural). NPLOC4 and UFD1 form a heterodimer that binds to p97, creating a ternary complex essential for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and other pathways (Blythe2017Ubiquitin; Meyer2000A).

The NPLOC4-UFD1 complex interacts with ubiquitin chains, with UFD1 showing specificity for K48-linked chains, enhancing the recruitment of substrates to p97 (Blythe2017Ubiquitin; Sato2019Structural). NPLOC4 is also involved in the recognition of Lys48-linked polyubiquitylated substrates, which is critical for stimulating ATPase activity in the Cdc48-UN complex (Sato2019Structural). The interaction between NPLOC4 and ubiquitin chains is facilitated by specific domains within NPLOC4, such as the NZF domain, which binds ubiquitin chains without linkage specificity (Sato2019Structural). These interactions highlight NPLOC4's role in modulating p97's activity and its involvement in protein degradation pathways.
