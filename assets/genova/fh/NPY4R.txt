# NPY4R

## Overview
The NPY4R gene encodes the neuropeptide Y receptor Y4, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a critical role in regulating energy homeostasis and appetite. This receptor is primarily activated by pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and is involved in various physiological processes, including the modulation of food intake and energy balance. The neuropeptide Y receptor Y4 is characterized by its seven transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which facilitates its function in ligand binding and receptor activation. The gene is located in a genomic region known for copy number variation, which can influence its expression and function, potentially impacting metabolic processes such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (Choong2021Theoretical; Aerts2016CNV). Additionally, alterations in the NPY4R gene have been associated with neuropsychiatric conditions, underscoring its significance in both metabolic and mental health contexts (Stahel2019Evaluation; Sharma2022Effect).

## Structure
The NPY4R gene encodes the neuropeptide Y receptor Y4, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation. The receptor is characterized by a seven transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which consists of seven long helices with random coils at the N- and C-terminals (Choong2021Theoretical; Aerts2016CNV). This helical bundle structure is common among members of the GPCR family, contributing to its functional conformation (Choong2021Theoretical).

The primary structure of NPY4R includes specific amino acid sequences that facilitate its role in ligand binding and receptor activation. Although detailed information on post-translational modifications is not provided in the context, GPCRs like NPY4R often undergo modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence receptor activity and signaling.

The NPY4R gene is located in a region known for copy number variation, which may impact its expression and function (Shebanits2019Copy). While the context does not provide specific details on splice variant isoforms, such variations could potentially affect the receptor's structure and function. The receptor's involvement in obesity and type 2 diabetes pathophysiology highlights its significance in metabolic processes (Choong2021Theoretical; Aerts2016CNV).

## Function
The NPY4R gene encodes the neuropeptide Y4 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of energy balance and appetite. This receptor is primarily activated by pancreatic polypeptide (PP), which acts as a satiety signal. In healthy human cells, NPY4R is expressed in both central and peripheral tissues, such as the pancreas, colon, liver, heart, and intestine, playing a crucial role in energy homeostasis (Shebanits2018Copy; Aerts2016CNV).

In the pancreas, NPY4R is found in somatostatin-containing cells, where its activation by PP decreases somatostatin secretion, suggesting a regulatory role in endocrine signaling (Kim2014Pancreatic). This receptor is also involved in modulating food intake, as demonstrated by experiments showing that PP's effects on reducing food intake are mediated through NPY4R (Kim2014Pancreatic).

NPY4R's function extends to the central nervous system, where it is expressed in brain regions such as the hippocampus and hypothalamus, areas critical for appetite and energy metabolism regulation (Shebanits2018Copy; Kim2014Pancreatic). The receptor's activity influences metabolic and cardiovascular functions, highlighting its importance in maintaining energy balance and body weight regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPY4R gene have been linked to obesity and related metabolic disorders. The study by Aerts et al. identified a significant association between copy number variation (CNV) loss at the 10q11.22 region, which includes the NPY4R gene, and obesity. This CNV loss was more prevalent in the obese population compared to controls, suggesting a potential link to increased body mass index (BMI) (Aerts2016CNV). Specific non-synonymous point mutations, such as M116T and V271M, were found to cause receptor dysfunction, affecting ligand-binding and receptor activation, which may contribute to obesity by altering the signaling pathways of the NPY4R receptor (Aerts2016CNV).

The NPY4R gene is also implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions. Alterations in the NPY system, including NPY4R, have been observed in individuals with depression and suicidal behavior, although the specific role of NPY4R in these conditions is less clear due to limited clinical data (Sharma2022Effect). The gene's involvement in regulating appetite and energy balance suggests that its dysfunction could influence both metabolic and psychiatric disorders (Stahel2019Evaluation). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NPY4R in both obesity and mental health conditions.

## Interactions
The neuropeptide Y receptor Y4 (NPY4R) is a G-protein coupled receptor that primarily interacts with peptide YY (PYY) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). These interactions are significant in the context of type 2 diabetes pathophysiology, where PYY has been identified as a potential therapeutic option. Computational studies have shown that PYY exhibits a higher binding affinity towards NPY4R compared to NPY1R, with binding free energies calculated using molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) and generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) approaches (Choong2021Theoretical). 

The binding of PYY to NPY4R involves non-polar interactions, with unfavorable polar interaction energy being compensated by favorable non-polar interactions. The C-terminal of PYY forms persistent hydrogen bonds with NPY4R, contributing to the stability of the complex (Choong2021Theoretical). These interactions suggest that engineered PYY analogs with preferential binding specificity for NPY4R could be a potential therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes (Choong2021Theoretical). 

NPY4R is also involved in various physiological processes, including appetite regulation and energy homeostasis, through its interactions with PYY and NPY (Kienast2019Neuropeptide).
