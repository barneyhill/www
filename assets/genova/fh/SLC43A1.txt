# SLC43A1

## Overview
SLC43A1 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 43 member 1, also known as LAT3, which is a transmembrane transporter involved in the Na+-independent transport of large neutral amino acids across cell membranes. This protein plays a vital role in cellular nutrient uptake, influencing metabolic pathways and cellular growth processes. It is particularly significant in muscle tissue, where it affects muscle protein synthesis and is regulated by nutritional status and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling (Iresjö2018Overnight). Additionally, SLC43A1 is implicated in vascular health, as its expression is modulated in vascular smooth muscle cells, potentially affecting cell proliferation and polyamine uptake (Grossi2014Vascular). The gene's expression and function have clinical relevance, particularly in conditions such as prostate cancer and erythrocyte metabolism disorders, where its altered expression or mutations can have significant pathological consequences (Huang2024Mutations; Bröer2018Amino).

## Function
SLC43A1, also known as LAT3, is a gene encoding a protein that functions as a neutral amino acid transporter, primarily involved in the transport of large neutral amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and methionine across cell membranes. This transporter plays a crucial role in cellular nutrient uptake and metabolism, influencing muscle protein synthesis and potentially affecting insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathways (Iresjö2018Overnight).

In muscle tissue, SLC43A1 is implicated in the regulation of amino acid transport and is associated with the expression of myosin heavy chain transcripts. Its expression is influenced by nutritional status and IGF-1 signaling, suggesting a role in muscle growth and maintenance (Iresjö2018Overnight). The protein is typically active in the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the uptake of essential amino acids necessary for cellular growth and homeostasis (Iresjö2018Overnight).

In vascular smooth muscle cells, SLC43A1 is upregulated in the absence of caveolin-1, indicating its involvement in polyamine uptake and cell proliferation. This suggests that SLC43A1 may contribute to cellular processes related to vascular health and disease (Grossi2014Vascular).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC43A1 gene, encoding a Na+-independent transporter for large neutral amino acids, has been implicated in several medical conditions due to its altered expression or mutations. In prostate cancer, SLC43A1 is often overexpressed, which is associated with enhanced mTORC1 signaling and increased cell growth. This overexpression is frequently observed alongside SLC7A5, another amino acid transporter, suggesting a coordinated regulation that may contribute to cancer progression. The expression of SLC43A1 in prostate cancer cells is regulated by androgen receptor binding, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in androgen-sensitive cancers (Bröer2018Amino).

In the context of erythrocyte metabolism, mutations in the KLF1 gene, specifically the H350R mutation, lead to downregulation of SLC43A1 expression. This downregulation is associated with non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia (NSHA) in mice, highlighting the gene's role in hemoglobin synthesis and red blood cell production. Supplementation with L-leucine has been shown to partially rescue the anemia phenotype, underscoring the importance of SLC43A1 in erythrocyte function (Huang2024Mutations). These findings suggest that alterations in SLC43A1 expression can have significant clinical implications, affecting both cancer progression and erythrocyte metabolism.
