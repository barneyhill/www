# PNMA6A

## Overview
PNMA6A is a gene that encodes the protein PNMA family member 6A, which is part of the paraneoplastic Ma (PNMA) family of proteins. These proteins are typically involved in cellular processes related to immune response and have been studied for their roles in various neurological and oncological conditions. The PNMA6A protein is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it is implicated in cellular signaling pathways that may influence tumorigenesis and metabolic disorders. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in tumor recurrence, developmental abnormalities, and metabolic conditions, although the precise biological functions and mechanisms of PNMA6A remain to be fully elucidated (Jiang2020Identification; GonzálezTablas2021WholeExome; Chen2021The).

## Clinical Significance
PNMA6A has been implicated in various diseases and conditions, although its clinical significance is not fully understood. In WHO Grade 1 meningiomas, PNMA6A is frequently mutated, with non-synonymous variants identified in 22% of tumors. These mutations are more common in recurrent meningiomas compared to non-recurrent ones, suggesting a potential role in tumor recurrence, although the statistical significance of this finding is not strong (GonzálezTablas2021WholeExome). The presence of PNMA6A variants in tumor samples but not in blood DNA indicates that these mutations are likely acquired in tumor cells (GonzálezTablas2021WholeExome).

In the context of fetal growth restriction (FGR), a deletion involving the PNMA6A gene, along with PNMA3 and MAGEA1, has been associated with developmental delay and ventricular septal defect. This suggests that alterations in PNMA6A may contribute to developmental abnormalities (Chen2021The).

PNMA6A has also been identified as a differentially expressed gene in subclinical hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes, with decreased expression noted in hypothyroid conditions. This indicates a potential involvement in metabolic disorders, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Jiang2020Identification).
