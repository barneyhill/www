# GPR101

## Overview
GPR101 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 101 (GPCR101), a member of the class A rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains and is involved in various physiological processes, including growth regulation and immune response. GPCR101 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the hypothalamus, and plays a role in regulating motivated behavior and energy homeostasis. It is also expressed in leukocytes, where it mediates the actions of specialized pro-resolving mediators, contributing to the resolution of inflammation. Clinically, mutations and overexpression of GPR101 are associated with growth disorders such as X-linked acrogigantism and acromegaly, highlighting its importance in growth hormone regulation and pituitary function (Trivellin2018An; Flak2019GPR101; Trivellin2014Gigantism).

## Structure
The GPR101 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) encoded by a single 1527 bp-long exon, resulting in a 508-amino acid protein (Trivellin2018An; Hou2019Mutations). It belongs to the class A rhodopsin-like family of GPCRs and is characterized by seven transmembrane domains (TM1-TM7), which are linked by three extracellular loops (ECL1-ECL3) and three intracellular loops (ICL1-ICL3) (Trivellin2018An). The protein has a long intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) between transmembrane domains 5 and 6, which is significant for its interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins (Trivellin2018An; Nagata2016Toward).

GPR101 shares approximately 30% sequence identity in its transmembrane regions with other GPCRs, such as adrenergic and serotonin receptors, and about 50% similarity with alpha1A-adrenergic receptors when limited to the TM domains (Trivellin2018An; Nagata2016Toward). The protein lacks a complete BBXXB motif, which may contribute to its high cAMP activity, and contains an intact E/DRY motif at the ECL2-TM3 interface (Trivellin2018An). The GPR101 protein also has conserved cysteine residues in TM3 and ECL2 that form a disulfide bond (Trivellin2018An). The absence of certain motifs and the presence of specific structural features suggest a unique activation mechanism for GPR101 (Trivellin2018An).

## Function
GPR101 is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. It is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, where it is involved in regulating motivated behavior and energy homeostasis (Trivellin2018An). GPR101 is also expressed in human and mouse leukocytes, including neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, where it mediates the pro-resolving actions of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) like RvD5 n-3 DPA. This interaction promotes the uptake and killing of bacteria and enhances the clearance of apoptotic cells, playing a crucial role in the resolution of inflammation and immune response regulation (Flak2019GPR101).

In the pituitary gland, GPR101 is associated with the regulation of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion. It is implicated in the differentiation of mammosomatotroph cells, which are involved in the secretion of these hormones, suggesting a role in growth regulation and pituitary maturation (Trivellin2018An; Abboud2020GPR101). The receptor's expression is age-dependent, with high levels during fetal development and adolescence, indicating its involvement in pituitary proliferation and maturation (Trivellin2018An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPR101 gene are associated with several growth disorders, most notably X-linked acrogigantism (XLAG) and acromegaly. XLAG is characterized by early-onset gigantism due to microduplications on chromosome Xq26.3, which lead to the overexpression of GPR101. This overexpression results in excessive growth hormone secretion, causing rapid growth in affected individuals, often beginning in infancy (Iacovazzo2016Germline; Trivellin2014Gigantism). 

In acromegaly, a condition typically presenting in adults, a specific mutation in GPR101, c.924G→C (p.E308D), has been identified. This mutation is associated with increased growth hormone secretion and cell proliferation in pituitary tumors, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Trivellin2014Gigantism). The mutation was found in a subset of patients with sporadic acromegaly and was absent in a large control group, suggesting its role as a disease-associated mutation (Iacovazzo2016Germline).

GPR101's role in these conditions highlights its significance in growth regulation and hormone secretion. The gene's overexpression and mutations are significant contributors to the development of pituitary tumors and the resultant hormonal imbalances seen in these disorders (Hou2019Mutations; Trivellin2014Gigantism).

## Interactions
GPR101, a G protein-coupled receptor, engages in several protein interactions that influence its function and signaling pathways. It interacts with various G proteins, including Gαs, Gαq/11, Gα12/13, and Gαi1, as demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 cells. These interactions suggest that GPR101 can activate multiple signaling pathways, such as the cAMP and inositol monophosphate pathways, contributing to its role in growth hormone hypersecretion and gigantism (Abboud2020GPR101).

GPR101 also interacts with the P525L mutant form of the protein FUS, which is associated with juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This interaction is specific to the mutant form and does not occur with the wild-type FUS, which is localized in the nucleus (Nagata2016Toward).

In the context of inflammatory responses, GPR101 serves as a receptor for the pro-resolving mediator RvD5 n-3 DPA. This interaction recruits Gαs-like proteins, leading to increased cAMP levels in human macrophages, which plays a role in regulating inflammation (Flak2019GPR101). These interactions highlight GPR101's involvement in diverse physiological processes through its engagement with various proteins.
