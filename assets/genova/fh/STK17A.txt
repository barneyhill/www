# STK17A

## Overview
STK17A is a gene that encodes the serine/threonine kinase 17a (STK17A) protein, also known as DRAK1, which is a member of the death-associated protein kinase family. This protein is characterized by its serine/threonine-protein kinase catalytic domain, which is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential biological functions (Xu2020Identification). As a kinase, STK17A plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by phosphorylating target proteins, such as the myosin light chain, thereby influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cell contractility (Short2019Serine). The protein is involved in various cellular pathways, including those related to DNA damage response, where it undergoes post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which affect its subcellular localization and function (Xu2020Identification). STK17A's involvement in cancer biology is notable, as it exhibits dual roles in different cancer types, acting as a tumor promoter in glioblastoma and a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Mao2013SerineThreonine; Short2019Serine).

## Structure
The STK17A protein, also known as DRAK1, is a member of the death-associated protein kinase family and is characterized by a serine/threonine-protein kinase catalytic domain. This domain is highly conserved among different species, including teleosts and mammals, indicating its fundamental role in the protein's function (Xu2020Identification). The Japanese flounder STK17A gene encodes a 383-amino-acid protein with an estimated molecular mass of 42.5 kDa, and it contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence within the catalytic domain, which is responsible for its nuclear localization (Xu2020Identification). 

In terms of post-translational modifications, STK17A has several potential phosphorylation sites, which may be mediated by protein kinase C (PKC). This phosphorylation is suggested to play a role in the translocation of the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm following DNA damage (Xu2020Identification). The protein's kinase activity is crucial for its function, as demonstrated by its role in phosphorylating myosin light chain (MLC), which affects cytoskeletal dynamics and cell contractility (Short2019Serine). However, specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of STK17A are not provided in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
STK17A has significant clinical implications in various cancers, particularly glioblastoma (GBM) and colorectal cancer. In glioblastoma, STK17A is overexpressed, with expression levels correlating with tumor grade and malignancy. High STK17A expression is associated with poor patient survival, making it a potential therapeutic target. Knockdown of STK17A in GBM cells reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, and increases sensitivity to genotoxic stress, suggesting its role in promoting tumor progression and survival (Mao2013SerineThreonine). 

In colorectal cancer, STK17A expression is decreased in primary tumors and further reduced in metastatic lesions. This downregulation is linked to a mesenchymal phenotype, indicative of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances cell migration and invasion. Loss of STK17A leads to decreased expression of cell-cell adhesion molecules like E-cadherin, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis. Overexpression of STK17A results in a more epithelial morphology and reduced anchorage-independent growth, highlighting its role in maintaining epithelial characteristics (Short2019Serine). 

These findings underscore the dual role of STK17A in different cancer types, acting as a tumor promoter in glioblastoma and a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer, with potential implications for targeted therapies.
