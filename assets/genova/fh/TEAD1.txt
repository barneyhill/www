# TEAD1

## Overview
TEAD1 is a gene that encodes the TEA domain transcription factor 1, a protein that plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression related to cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. As a transcription factor, TEAD1 is characterized by its TEA DNA-binding domain and its ability to interact with co-activators such as YAP (Yes-Associated Protein) and TAZ, which are integral components of the Hippo signaling pathway. This protein is crucial for various physiological processes, including cardiac and skeletal muscle development, as well as epidermal proliferation. TEAD1's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis. Mutations in the TEAD1 gene have been linked to several diseases, including Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy and various cancers, where its expression levels can serve as a prognostic marker (Vassilev2001TEADTEF; Landin2012Alteration; Knight2008TEAD1).

## Structure
TEAD1 is a transcription factor characterized by a TEA DNA-binding domain and a YAP/TAZ interaction domain. The protein's structure includes a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) that interacts with genomic DNA through non-covalent interactions involving amino acid side chains and the DNA backbone (Filandrová2021Motif). The TEAD1 DBD is composed of helix H3 and loops L1 and L2, which are key interaction interfaces for binding to DNA motifs such as the M-CAT motif (Filandrová2021Motif). 

The TEAD1 protein also contains a C-terminal region responsible for interaction with YAP, forming a heterodimer with YAP through three main interfaces involving hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals contacts (Li2010Structural). The TEAD1 structure is composed of four alpha helices and 12 beta strands, forming a beta-sandwich fold surrounded by alpha helices (Li2010Structural).

TEAD1 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as acylation, which can affect its interaction with coactivators like YAP and TAZ (Bokhovchuk2019Molecular). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Filandrová2021Motif).

## Function
TEAD1 (TEA domain transcription factor 1) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression related to cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, primarily through its interaction with the Hippo signaling pathway. TEAD1 functions by binding to DNA at specific sites, such as the M-CAT motif, and interacting with co-activators like YAP (Yes-Associated Protein) to modulate the expression of target genes (Vassilev2001TEADTEF).

In the context of cardiac and skeletal muscle, TEAD1 is constitutively expressed and is crucial for the regulation of muscle-specific genes. Disruption of TEAD1 can lead to heart defects and embryonic lethality, highlighting its essential role in heart development and function (Landin2012Alteration). TEAD1 also plays a role in epidermal proliferation by binding to active enhancers and driving the expression of proliferation-related genes, which is critical for maintaining skin homeostasis (Li2020TEAD1).

TEAD1's activity is not limited to direct transcriptional regulation; it also influences apoptosis resistance by up-regulating Livin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, through complex interactions with cofactors (Landin2012Alteration). This multifaceted role underscores TEAD1's importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TEAD1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy (SCRA), also known as helicoidal peripapillary chorioretinal degeneration, is linked to mutations in TEAD1. This rare ocular disease is characterized by progressive bilateral atrophic retina and choroid strips extending from the optic nerve. A novel missense variant, c.1261T>A, p.Tyr421Asn, was identified in a Serbian family, occurring at the same position as the previously known 'Icelandic mutation' c.1261T>C, p.Tyr421His, suggesting a mutation hotspot in exon 13 of the TEAD1 gene (Grubisa2021Novel).

TEAD1 is also implicated in cancer progression. In prostate cancer, high expression levels of TEAD1 correlate with poor clinical outcomes, and its expression is associated with reduced survival rates. TEAD1 acts as a prognostic marker, with its overexpression linked to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth (Knight2008TEAD1). Additionally, TEAD1 is involved in the Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and contact inhibition. Alterations in TEAD1 expression are associated with poor outcomes in several cancers, including prostate, colon, gastric, breast, and kidney cancers (Zinatizadeh2021The).

## Interactions
TEAD1 (TEA domain transcription factor 1) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. TEAD1 interacts with the Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional coactivator, forming a complex that is essential for YAP-induced gene expression. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of organ size and is implicated in oncogenic processes. The YAP-TEAD1 complex involves extensive interactions through three highly conserved interfaces, with interface 3 being particularly critical for complex formation (Kim2021Hot; Li2010Structural).

TEAD1 also binds to genomic DNA, recognizing specific motifs such as the M-CAT motif. The orientation of these motifs significantly affects TEAD1's binding affinity and occupancy, with the 5'/3' orientation showing greater affinity compared to the 3'/5' orientation. This interaction is mediated by the DNA-binding domain of TEAD1, which involves non-covalent interactions primarily through helix H3 and the L1 loop (Filandrová2021Motif).

Additionally, TEAD1's interaction with YAP is necessary for the positive regulation of NAIP expression, highlighting its role in transcriptional activation. This interaction is dependent on the presence of YAP, as demonstrated by reduced NAIP induction when YAP levels are decreased (Landin2013Interaction).
