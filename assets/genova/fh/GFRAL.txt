# GFRAL

## Overview
GFRAL, or GDNF family receptor alpha like, is a gene that encodes a receptor protein primarily involved in the regulation of appetite and energy homeostasis. The GFRAL protein is a transmembrane receptor that specifically binds to the hormone growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), forming a complex with the co-receptor RET to mediate its signaling functions. This receptor is predominantly expressed in the caudal brainstem, particularly in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius, where it plays a critical role in mediating the anorectic effects of GDF15, especially under conditions of stress and illness (Hes2024GDNF; Assadi2020GDF15). The GFRAL-GDF15 signaling pathway is implicated in various physiological processes, including appetite regulation and energy expenditure, and is being explored as a therapeutic target for conditions such as obesity and cancer cachexia (Ahmed2021GDF15GFRAL). Additionally, alterations in GFRAL expression have been associated with several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Zhao2020Upregulated).

## Structure
The GFRAL protein is a receptor for the hormone GDF15 and is part of the GDNF receptor family. It features a highly conserved second cysteine-rich domain and a hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide, which are characteristic of this receptor family (Fichtner2024GFRAL). Unlike its homologs, GFRAL has a single transmembrane region instead of a GPtdIns cleavage site at its C-terminal sequence (Fichtner2024GFRAL). The extracellular domain of GFRAL, which includes residues 19-351 in humans, is crucial for its function and has been expressed and purified for study (Fung2021FcGDF15).

GFRAL forms a complex with the co-receptor RET to mediate its signaling functions. The interaction involves specific interfaces between GFRAL and RET, such as a helix-loop-helix-loop motif in the D3 domain of GFRAL and the concave surface on CLD1 and CLD2 in RET (Li2019CryoEM). The D1 domain of GFRAL is typically not involved in binding, except in specific complexes (Li2019CryoEM). The protein's structure is further stabilized by calcium ion binding, which facilitates the dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation of the RET kinase domain (Li2019CryoEM). There is also mention of a soluble isoform of GFRAL lacking the transmembrane region, suggesting potential splice variant isoforms (Fichtner2024GFRAL).

## Function
The GFRAL gene encodes a receptor that is primarily expressed in the caudal brainstem, specifically in the area postrema (AP) and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) (Hes2024GDNF). GFRAL functions as a high-affinity receptor for the hormone growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which is involved in regulating appetite and body weight by mediating the anorectic effects of GDF15 (Assadi2020GDF15). This interaction is crucial for energy homeostasis and is particularly active in response to stress and illness, influencing feeding behavior and energy expenditure (Ahmed2021GDF15GFRAL).

The GFRAL-GDF15 complex, along with the co-receptor RET, activates intracellular signaling pathways such as ERK1/2, AKT, and phospholipase C (PLCγ), which are involved in various cellular processes (Assadi2020GDF15). These pathways do not involve the SMAD pathway, suggesting that GDF15 may signal through other receptors in different tissues (Assadi2020GDF15). Although GFRAL expression is primarily localized to the brainstem, there is evidence of rare expression in peripheral tissues, indicating potential roles beyond the central nervous system (Hes2024GDNF). The GFRAL-GDF15 signaling pathway is being explored as a therapeutic target for conditions such as cancer cachexia and obesity (Ahmed2021GDF15GFRAL).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GFRAL gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of obesity, the GDF15-GFRAL signaling pathway plays a significant role in regulating body weight and energy homeostasis. Studies have shown that GDF15 can reduce food intake and body weight through its interaction with GFRAL, suggesting potential therapeutic applications for obesity treatment (Fung2021FcGDF15; Hale2021Growth). However, the genetic link between the GDF15/GFRAL axis and body mass index (BMI) is not strong, as some studies have found no relationship between GDF15 levels and various anthropometric or metabolic measurements (Hale2021Growth).

In cancer, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), GFRAL is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. The GDF15-GFRAL pathway promotes cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, making it a potential biomarker for PDAC diagnosis and therapy (Zhao2020Upregulated). GFRAL expression is also upregulated in other cancers, such as hepatic carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma, but not in renal clear cell carcinoma (Zhao2020Upregulated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GFRAL in both metabolic and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
GFRAL, a receptor primarily expressed in the caudal brainstem, specifically interacts with the cytokine GDF15. This interaction is crucial for mediating various physiological responses, including appetite regulation and energy expenditure. GDF15 binds exclusively to GFRAL, which then forms a complex with the co-receptor RET. This complex is necessary for the downstream signaling effects of GDF15, leading to the activation of intracellular pathways such as extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Akt, and phospholipase C (Qin2023Immunization; SilvaBermudez2024Macrophages).

The GDF15-GFRAL-RET axis plays a significant role in regulating chemosensitivity in tumor cells, particularly in the context of pancreatic cancer, where it enhances chemoresistance through paracrine signaling (Qin2023Immunization). GFRAL's interaction with GDF15 is also implicated in various cancers, influencing tumor progression and metastasis, although the direct association is confirmed primarily in pancreatic cancer (SilvaBermudez2024Macrophages).

While GFRAL is primarily expressed in the brainstem, its expression is noted in other tissues such as the spleen, thymus, and testis, but not in macrophages (SilvaBermudez2024Macrophages). The interaction between GDF15 and GFRAL is specific, with no high-affinity binding to other receptors, including those of the TGF-β receptor family (SilvaBermudez2024Macrophages).
