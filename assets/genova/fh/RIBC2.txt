# RIBC2

## Overview
RIBC2, or RIB43A domain with coiled-coils 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular structural organization and intracellular transport. The protein is characterized by coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting its role in maintaining cellular architecture and function. RIBC2 is implicated in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the S/G2-M phase, and is essential for cell proliferation (Giotti2018Assembly). Additionally, RIBC2 is associated with ciliary function, localizing to the ciliary axoneme and basal body in specific cell types, indicating its involvement in processes like embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis (van2017CiliaCarta:; Patir2020The). The gene's expression and interactions have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and ulcerative colitis, highlighting its clinical significance (Kang2016A; xiong2020common).

## Function
RIBC2 (RIB43A domain with coiled-coils 2) is a gene that encodes a protein potentially involved in cellular structural organization and intracellular transport processes. The protein is characterized by coiled-coil domains, which are known to facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in maintaining cellular architecture. In healthy human cells, RIBC2 has been associated with the S/G2-M phase of the cell cycle, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing RIBC2 expression can significantly inhibit cell proliferation, highlighting its importance in cell cycle progression (Giotti2018Assembly).

RIBC2 has also been implicated in ciliary function. It was observed to co-localize with acetylated alpha tubulin, a marker for the ciliary axoneme, in human respiratory cells, suggesting an association with the ciliary axoneme. In hTERT-RPE1 cells, RIBC2 localized at the basal body, indicating that its ciliary localization may be cell type specific (van2017CiliaCarta:). Additionally, RIBC2 is part of a transcriptional signature associated with motile cilia, which are essential for processes like embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis (Patir2020The). These findings suggest that RIBC2 may play a role in both cell cycle regulation and ciliary function.

## Clinical Significance
The RIBC2 gene has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. A common variant, rs2272804, in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of RIBC2 creates an upstream open reading frame (uORF) that significantly inhibits gene expression. This variant is associated with reduced mRNA and protein levels, potentially contributing to oncogenesis. RIBC2 is differentially expressed in several cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. Overexpression of RIBC2 can enhance the expression of TRIM37, a gene involved in oncogenesis, and down-regulate TRAF2, which is associated with TNF receptor signaling, suggesting a role in cancer biology (xiong2020common).

In ulcerative colitis (UC), RIBC2 is identified as a hypermethylated gene, leading to transcriptional repression. This hypermethylation is also observed in colon cancer cell lines, indicating a potential link between UC and cancer. The hypermethylation of RIBC2 could serve as a molecular biomarker for UC prognosis and diagnosis (Kang2016A; Akanyibah2024Effects). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RIBC2 in both cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
RIBC2, or RIB43A domain with coiled-coils 2, is involved in various protein interactions that may influence cellular processes and cancer biology. The rs2272804 variant in the 5'UTR of the RIBC2 gene creates an upstream open reading frame, significantly reducing RIBC2 expression. This variant affects the expression of other proteins, such as TRIM37 and TRAF2, suggesting interactions between RIBC2 and these proteins. Overexpression of RIBC2 in HEK293T cells led to increased expression of TRIM37 and decreased expression of TRAF2, indicating potential regulatory interactions (xiong2020common).

In addition, RIBC2 has been identified as a potential interacting partner of the YB-1 protein in the context of oxaliplatin resistance in colon cancer cells. This interaction was confirmed through tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, suggesting that RIBC2 may be part of a protein complex contributing to chemotherapy resistance (Tsofack2011NONO).

These interactions highlight the role of RIBC2 in modulating protein expression and its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways, making it a subject of interest for further research in oncogenesis and therapeutic resistance.
