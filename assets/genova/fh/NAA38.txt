# NAA38

## Overview
NAA38 is a gene that encodes the protein N-alpha-acetyltransferase 38, which functions as an auxiliary subunit within the N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) complex, specifically the NatC complex. This protein is integral to the process of N-terminal acetylation, a common post-translational modification that influences protein stability, folding, and interactions. As part of the NatC complex, NAA38 contributes to the acetylation of proteins with specific N-terminal sequences, thereby playing a role in various cellular processes, including protein folding and subcellular targeting (Koufaris2024Bioinformatic; Varland2018Identification). Although the precise function of NAA38 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, its involvement in the acetylation of up to 10% of human proteins underscores its potential impact on cellular function and protein regulation (Varland2018Identification).

## Structure


## Function
NAA38, also known as the NatC auxiliary subunit, is a component of the N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) complex, specifically the NatC complex. This complex is responsible for the N-terminal acetylation of proteins, a modification that affects protein stability, folding, and interactions (Koufaris2024Bioinformatic; Varland2018Identification). NAA38 plays a role in assisting the NatC complex by acting as a ribosome anchor or modulating substrate specificity, although its precise function in healthy human cells remains unclear (Koufaris2024Bioinformatic).

The NatC complex, which includes NAA38, is involved in acetylating proteins with specific N-terminal sequences, influencing various cellular processes such as protein folding and subcellular targeting (Varland2018Identification). While NAA38 is part of the NatC complex, it is not always required for certain functions, such as the Golgi-targeting of Arl3 (Varland2018Identification). The biological significance of NAA38 is underscored by its involvement in the NatC complex, which acetylates up to 10% of human proteins, highlighting its potential impact on cellular function and protein regulation (Varland2018Identification). Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific molecular activities and cellular localization of NAA38 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
NAA38, also known as the NatC auxiliary subunit, is a component of the heterotrimeric NatC complex, which also includes the subunits NAA30 and NAA35. NAA38 interacts extensively with NAA35, which acts as the central assembly hub of the complex. NAA35 wraps around NAA38, forming a ring-like structure that stabilizes the complex and facilitates its function in N-terminal acetylation (Grunwald2020Divergent; grunwald2020structural). The interaction between NAA38 and NAA35 is characterized by hydrophobic interactions and the formation of a bifurcated, antiparallel β-sheet, which prevents NAA38 from engaging in homo- or hetero-oligomeric interactions with other proteins (grunwald2020structural).

NAA38 also interacts with the catalytic subunit NAA30, particularly with the α2 helix of NAA30, forming a hydrogen bonding network that is crucial for substrate recognition by the NatC complex (Deng2021Molecular). Despite its structural similarity to RNA-associated Lsm proteins, NAA38 does not bind small nuclear RNAs, as it lacks the conserved RNA-binding motifs found in other Lsm proteins (grunwald2020structural). These interactions highlight the role of NAA38 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the NatC complex.
