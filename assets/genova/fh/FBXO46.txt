# FBXO46

## Overview
FBXO46 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 46, a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by an F-box motif. This motif is typically involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly as part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The F-box protein 46 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction, by mediating the degradation of specific protein substrates. The precise biological functions and pathways involving FBXO46 remain an active area of research, with ongoing studies aiming to elucidate its role in health and disease contexts.
