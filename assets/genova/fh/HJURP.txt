# HJURP

## Overview
HJURP (Holliday Junction Recognition Protein) is a gene that encodes a histone chaperone protein crucial for centromere function and chromatin assembly. The protein, also named Holliday Junction Recognition Protein, is primarily involved in the deposition and maintenance of CENP-A, a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, at centromeres. This function is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability (Dunleavy2009HJURP). HJURP interacts with various centromeric proteins, including CENP-T and the Mis18 complex, facilitating the recruitment and stable localization of these proteins at the centromere (Ding2019Holliday; Pan2019Mechanism). The protein's activity is regulated by the cell cycle, and it is predominantly active in the nucleus, particularly at centromeric regions (Dunleavy2009HJURP). Additionally, HJURP has been implicated in cancer progression, with its expression levels serving as a potential prognostic marker in various cancers (Li2022Pancancer; Tan2023Emerging).

## Structure
The Holliday Junction Recognition Protein (HJURP) is a histone chaperone with a complex molecular structure that plays a critical role in centromere function and chromatin assembly. HJURP contains several distinct structural domains, including the suppressor of chromosome missegregation protein 3 (SCM3) domain, the HJURP mid-domain (HMD), and two C-terminal domains (HCTD1 and HCTD2) (Li2023Advances). The SCM3 domain is a CENP-A binding site that facilitates CENP-A nucleosome formation (Li2023Advances). The HMD domain includes a conserved DNA-binding region that interacts directly with DNA, essential for CENP-A loading at centromeres (Li2023Advances).

The secondary structure of HJURP features a long helix (aA) and a three-stranded anti-parallel beta sheet, connected by a loop (L1) (Hu2011Structurea). The helix aA interacts with the central helix of CENP-A in an anti-parallel manner, with hydrophobic and polar interactions contributing to the stability of the complex (Hu2011Structurea).

HJURP forms a quaternary structure by binding to a CENP-A-H4 heterodimer, preventing the spontaneous association of DNA with the complex (Hu2011Structure). The HCTD2 domain mediates HJURP dimerization, which is essential for centromeric CENP-A loading (Li2023Advances). HJURP is phosphorylated at the HCTD1 domain during most of the cell cycle, with dephosphorylation occurring at the end of mitosis (Li2023Advances).

## Function
HJURP (Holliday Junction Recognition Protein) is a critical factor in the deposition and maintenance of CENP-A, a histone H3 variant, at centromeres in human cells. This protein acts as a specific chaperone for CENP-A, ensuring its proper targeting and incorporation into centromeric chromatin, which is essential for centromere function and chromosome segregation during cell division (Dunleavy2009HJURP). HJURP localizes to centromeres during late telophase and early G1 phase, coinciding with the timing of new CENP-A deposition, and its association with centromeres is transient, lasting 2 to 3 hours (Dunleavy2009HJURP).

In addition to its role with CENP-A, HJURP is involved in the centromeric assembly of CENP-T, another protein critical for centromere function. HJURP interacts with CENP-T, facilitating its recruitment and stable localization at the centromere, which is crucial for the assembly of the kinetochore machinery and accurate chromosome segregation (Ding2019Holliday). The protein's activity is regulated by the cell cycle, and it is primarily active in the nucleus, particularly at centromeric regions, underscoring its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Ding2019Holliday; Dunleavy2009HJURP).

## Clinical Significance
HJURP (Holliday Junction Recognition Protein) is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. Overexpression of HJURP is frequently observed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Li2022Pancancer; Tan2023Emerging). In HCC, high HJURP expression correlates with larger tumor size, advanced stage, and poor prognosis, driven by hypomethylation of its promoter region (Li2023Advances; Li2021Hypomethylationdriven).

HJURP's role in cancer progression is linked to its involvement in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and chromosomal stability. It affects pathways such as MAPK/ERK1/2, AKT/GSK3β, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting tumor cell proliferation and metastasis (Li2023Advances; Tan2023Emerging). In renal cell carcinoma, HJURP acts as a tumor suppressor, with lower expression levels associated with poor prognosis (Yuan2020Holliday). The protein's interaction with immune cells and its role in immune evasion further complicate its impact on cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Li2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
HJURP (Holliday Junction Recognition Protein) is a key player in centromere function and chromatin assembly, primarily through its interactions with various proteins. It acts as a chaperone for CENP-A, a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, facilitating its deposition at centromeres. This interaction is crucial for chromosome stability and segregation during cell division (Li2023Advances; Pan2019Mechanism).

HJURP interacts with the Mis18 complex, which includes Mis18α, Mis18β, and M18BP1, to target centromeres and deposit new CENP-A. The R1 and R2 repeats of HJURP bind to the Mis18 complex, and these interactions are essential for centromere recruitment (Pan2019Mechanism). The N-terminal region of Mis18α modulates the binding affinity for HJURP, and specific mutations in Mis18α can impair HJURP binding (Pan2019Mechanism).

HJURP also interacts with CENP-T, another centromeric protein, and this interaction is essential for the stable localization of CENP-T at the centromere. The C-terminal region of HJURP is critical for binding CENP-T, and HJURP dimerization is necessary for this interaction (Ding2019Holliday).
