# TMX2

## Overview
TMX2, or thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 2, is a gene located on chromosome 11q12.1 that encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein belonging to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, which is part of the thioredoxin superfamily. The protein plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis, particularly in redox-mediated processes and cellular transport mechanisms. TMX2 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the outer nuclear membrane, where it regulates ER-mitochondria contacts and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Unlike typical thioredoxins, TMX2 lacks the canonical oxidoreductase active CXXC domain, instead featuring an SNDC motif, which influences its functional properties (Dekker2024The). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as importin-β and TOM70, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and metabolic balance, especially under oxidative stress conditions (Oguro2019Thioredoxinrelated; Chen2024The). Mutations in the TMX2 gene are associated with severe neurological disorders, highlighting its critical role in normal brain development and function (Vandervore2019TMX2).

## Structure
TMX2 is a type 1 transmembrane protein belonging to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, which is part of the thioredoxin superfamily. The protein is encoded by the TMX2 gene located on chromosome 11q12.1 and consists of 296 amino acids (Vandervore2019TMX2). TMX2 is characterized by several structural domains: an N-terminal signal sequence (amino acids 1-48), a cytosolic domain (amino acids 49-102), a single transmembrane domain (amino acids 103-125), an atypical thioredoxin domain (amino acids 167-170, SNDC), an ER intraluminal C-terminal domain (amino acids 126-296), and a di-lysine ER retention motif (amino acids 293-296, KKDK) (Vandervore2019TMX2).

Unlike other thioredoxins, TMX2 lacks the canonical oxidoreductase active CXXC domain, instead featuring an SNDC motif, which raises questions about its oxidoreductase activity (Dekker2024The). TMX2 is not glycosylated, as confirmed by the absence of glycosylation at various artificial sites (Chen2024The). The protein can form disulfide bonds and undergoes dimerization, particularly under oxidative stress conditions, which is partially mediated by inter-disulfide bonds (Vandervore2019TMX2). TMX2 exists in two isoforms, with the longest being the most biologically relevant as an ER resident protein (Vandervore2019TMX2).

## Function
TMX2 (thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 2) is a crucial component in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in redox-mediated processes and cellular transport mechanisms. In healthy human cells, TMX2 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the outer nuclear membrane, where it plays a significant role in regulating ER-mitochondria contacts (ERMCS) and nucleocytoplasmic transport (Oguro2019Thioredoxinrelated; Chen2024The).

TMX2 is involved in controlling the redox state at the ERMCS, preventing the sulfenylation of mitochondrial proteins such as TOM70, which is crucial for maintaining proper ERMCS spacing and mitochondrial function (Chen2024The). This regulation is essential for calcium homeostasis and lipid metabolism, impacting mitochondrial energy generation and cellular lipid composition (Chen2024The).

In the nuclear envelope, TMX2 regulates the Ran protein gradient and importin-β-dependent nuclear cargo transport, which is vital for maintaining nucleocytoplasmic transport efficiency. TMX2 interacts with importin-β and Ran, facilitating the recycling of importin-β and maintaining the Ran gradient, especially under oxidative stress conditions (Oguro2019Thioredoxinrelated). These functions highlight TMX2's role in cellular stress responses and its importance in maintaining cellular and metabolic balance.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMX2 gene are linked to several severe neurological disorders. These include congenital microcephaly, cortical polymicrogyria, and other migration disorders, which are caused by bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in TMX2. These conditions have been identified in 14 affected individuals from ten unrelated families (Vandervore2019TMX2). TMX2 mutations are also associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by microcephaly, cortical malformations, and spasticity, known as NEDMCMS (Chen2024The). A specific recurrent homozygous mutation, c.500G>A, has been identified in individuals with microlissencephaly, a condition marked by microcephaly and lissencephaly, leading to decreased mRNA levels and affecting neural progenitor cells during embryogenesis (Ghosh2019Recurrent).

The dysfunction of TMX2 results in decreased mitochondrial respiratory reserve capacity and increased glycolytic activity, indicating its critical role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Vandervore2019TMX2). TMX2 mutations can lead to altered mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, contributing to developmental abnormalities (Vandervore2019TMX2). These mutations are linked to severe brain developmental abnormalities, including developmental delay, impaired speech and ambulation, epilepsy, and cortical malformations (Vandervore2019TMX2).

## Interactions
Thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 2 (TMX2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. TMX2 interacts with importin-β and Ran proteins, playing a significant role in regulating the Ran protein gradient and importin-β-dependent nuclear cargo transport. It binds directly to both importin-β and Ran, with importin-β interacting with both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of TMX2, while Ran shows stronger binding to the C-terminal region (Oguro2019Thioredoxinrelated). TMX2 is not a transport cargo of importin-β but is involved in maintaining the nucleocytoplasmic Ran gradient, essential for the importin-β transport cycle (Oguro2019Thioredoxinrelated).

TMX2 also interacts with proteins at the ER-mitochondria contacts (ERMCS), including TOM70, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein. This interaction is crucial for preventing the sulfenylation of TOM70, mediated by reactive oxygen species, and is dependent on the presence of a cysteine residue (C170) in TMX2 (Chen2024The). TMX2's interaction with TOM70 and other mitochondrial proteins, such as voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC), is important for modulating ERMCS spacing and function (Chen2024The). These interactions highlight TMX2's role in redox-mediated processes and cellular homeostasis.
