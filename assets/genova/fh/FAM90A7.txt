# FAM90A7

## Overview
FAM90A7 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, specifically member A7. This gene is part of a larger family of genes that are characterized by their conserved sequences, which suggest a shared evolutionary origin and potentially similar functional roles. The protein encoded by FAM90A7 is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Proteins in this family are often implicated in regulatory roles within the cell, and they may participate in pathways that are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli. Understanding the specific interactions and functions of FAM90A7 could provide insights into its role in health and disease, as well as its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
