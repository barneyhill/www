# RAB24

## Overview
RAB24 is a gene that encodes the RAB24 protein, a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, which are pivotal in regulating intracellular vesicle trafficking. The RAB24 protein is distinguished by its unique structural features, including a serine residue at position 67 in its GTP-binding motif, which contributes to its low GTPase activity and preferential binding to GTP (Munafó2002Induction). This protein is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and late endosomes, playing a significant role in autophagy and endosomal-lysosomal pathways (Olkkonen1993Molecular). RAB24's interactions with other proteins, such as Rab7 and the Rab Interacting Lysosomal Protein (RILP), are crucial for its function in vesicular transport and cellular homeostasis (Amaya2016Rab24). Mutations in the RAB24 gene have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as hereditary ataxia and Alzheimer's disease (Ginsberg2010Microarray; Agler2014Canine).

## Structure
The RAB24 protein is a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, which are involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking. The primary structure of RAB24 includes a unique serine at position 67 in its GTP-binding motif, which is atypical compared to the glutamine found in other Rab proteins. This substitution is associated with low GTPase activity, as RAB24 predominantly binds GTP (Munafó2002Induction). The protein also contains a C-terminal hypervariable domain, which is crucial for its subcellular targeting and functional specificity (Maltese2002Mutant).

RAB24's secondary and tertiary structures are characterized by conserved regions typical of Rab proteins, including guanine nucleotide-binding motifs. The tertiary structure resembles other GTPases, with a central barrel composed of a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Bhuin2014Rab). The protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and late endosomes, indicating its role in vesicular transport (Olkkonen1993Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of RAB24 include prenylation, which is essential for its membrane attachment, although it is noted to be inefficient compared to other Rab proteins (Munafó2002Induction). The protein's atypical structure and modifications suggest a specialized role in cellular processes such as autophagy.

## Function
RAB24 is a member of the Rab GTPase family, which plays a crucial role in intracellular vesicle trafficking. In healthy human cells, RAB24 is involved in the autophagic pathway, a cellular process responsible for degrading and recycling cellular components. Under normal conditions, RAB24 is distributed in a reticular pattern overlapping with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. During autophagy, particularly under starvation conditions, RAB24 redistributes to autophagosome-like structures, indicating its role in autophagosome formation and function (Munafó2002Induction).

RAB24 also interacts with Rab7 and the Rab Interacting Lysosomal Protein (RILP) complex, which is essential for the recruitment of Rab7 to late endosomes and lysosomes. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of endosomal degradation and the proper functioning of the late endosomal/lysosomal pathway (Amaya2016Rab24). RAB24's activity is necessary for the localization and function of Rab7, affecting the aggregation and fusion of late endocytic structures and the degradation of endocytosed cargo (Amaya2016Rab24). These processes are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein turnover, particularly in neurons with high metabolic demands (Agler2014Canine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RAB24 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders. In Old English Sheepdogs and Gordon Setters, a mutation in the RAB24 gene is associated with hereditary ataxia, a condition characterized by Purkinje neuron degeneration in the cerebellum. This mutation results in an amino acid change from glutamine to proline, affecting the protein's function in autophagy, a cellular process crucial for neuronal health (Agler2014Canine). The mutation is linked to the accumulation of autophagosomes and ubiquitin-positive bodies in the cerebellum, suggesting a defect in the autophagy pathway that contributes to neurodegeneration (Agler2014Canine).

In humans, alterations in RAB24 expression have been associated with Alzheimer's disease. Studies have shown significant upregulation of RAB24 in the hippocampal CA1 region of individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, correlating with cognitive decline and neuropathological indices (Ginsberg2010Microarray). This suggests that RAB24 may play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, potentially through mechanisms involving endosomal dysfunction. Additionally, Rab24 has been identified as a risk factor for multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, and ischemic events, indicating its broader involvement in pathological processes (Amaya2016Rab24).

## Interactions
Rab24, a member of the Rab GTPase family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular trafficking and autophagy. Rab24 interacts with Rab7 and the Rab Interacting Lysosomal Protein (RILP) to regulate endosomal degradation. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of Rab7 to vesicular membranes, facilitating the degradation of endocytic cargo (Amaya2016Rab24). Rab24 forms a complex with Rab7 and RILP, and this association is dependent on the active GTP-bound state of both Rab24 and Rab7 (Amaya2016Rab24). The interaction with RILP is specific, as Rab24 does not co-localize with FYCO1, another Rab7 effector (Amaya2016Rab24).

Rab24 also interacts with the HOPS complex subunit Vps41, which can disrupt the Rab24-RILP association, indicating a regulatory role in endosomal-lysosomal fusion processes (Amaya2016Rab24). The small GTPase Arl8b is involved in the membrane localization of Vps41 and can also interact with Rab24, although this interaction is disrupted by Vps41 (Amaya2016Rab24). These interactions highlight Rab24's role in vesicular transport and its specific interactions with key molecular components in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway.
