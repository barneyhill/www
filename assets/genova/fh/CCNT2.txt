# CCNT2

## Overview
The CCNT2 gene encodes cyclin T2, a regulatory protein that is part of the cyclin family, which is primarily involved in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control. Cyclin T2 functions as a key component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, partnering with cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) to facilitate the transition from abortive to productive transcription elongation by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. This protein exists in two isoforms, T2a and T2b, due to alternative splicing, and is expressed in various tissues, including muscle and blood. Cyclin T2 is implicated in several cellular processes such as muscle differentiation, cell cycle progression, and transcription regulation. Its dysregulation has been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Peng1998Identification; Żuryń2021The; De2002Cyclin).

## Structure
Cyclin T2, encoded by the CCNT2 gene, is a member of the cyclin family and exists in two isoforms, cyclin T2a and T2b, resulting from alternative splicing (Żuryń2021The). The protein contains a 'cyclin box' domain located in the N-terminal region, which is essential for binding to the Cdk9 kinase. This interaction is crucial for forming the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which plays a significant role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Żuryń2021The). The C-terminal domain of cyclin T2 includes PEST sequences, which are often associated with proteins that have a short intracellular half-life, suggesting a role in protein degradation (Żuryń2021The).

Cyclin T2 is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle cell differentiation, antigen processing, and cell proliferation. In cancer cells, an imbalance in cyclin T and Cdk9 mRNA levels is observed, with high levels of cyclin T expression noted in various lymphomas (Żuryń2021The). The protein's function can be modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may affect its interaction with other proteins and its role in transcription regulation.

## Function
Cyclin T2, encoded by the CCNT2 gene, is a crucial component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which plays a significant role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. Cyclin T2 forms a complex with CDK9, and this P-TEFb complex phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, facilitating the transition from abortive to productive transcription elongation (Peng1998Identification; Żuryń2021The). Cyclin T2 exists in two isoforms, T2a and T2b, which arise from alternative splicing and are expressed in various human tissues, particularly in terminally differentiated tissues such as muscle and blood (Żuryń2021The; De2002Cyclin).

In addition to its role in transcription, Cyclin T2 is involved in muscle cell differentiation, where it interacts with MyoD to stimulate the transcription of muscle-specific genes (Cottone2005Pkn). Cyclin T2 also interacts with the Rb protein, which is crucial for regulating the cell cycle transition between the G1 and S phases, indicating its involvement in cell cycle progression and potentially in cancer cell proliferation (Żuryń2021The). Cyclin T2's activity is primarily nuclear, where it exerts its regulatory functions in gene expression and cell cycle control.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCNT2 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In intellectual disability (ID), a splice site mutation in CCNT2 leads to the overexpression of different isoforms, including a non-protein coding isoform not found in controls. This mutation results in intron retention and creates additional recognition sites for the YY1 transcription factor, contributing to dysregulation in pathways related to the actin cytoskeleton, axonogenesis, and tyrosine protein kinase pathways (InanlooRahatloo2019WholeTranscriptome). The study also notes that mutations in CCNT2, along with CDK9 and TAF2, show similar dysregulated pathways, suggesting a shared mechanism in ID (InanlooRahatloo2019WholeTranscriptome).

In bipolar disorder (BD), the circular RNA circCCNT2, derived from the CCNT2 gene, is upregulated in the anterior cingulate cortex of affected individuals. This upregulation is linked to the disorder's pathology and is modulated by lithium treatment, which reduces circCCNT2 expression in BD patients (Lin2021Circular).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the miR-212-5p/CCNT2 axis is involved in the disease's progression. Decitabine treatment upregulates miR-212-5p, which targets CCNT2, leading to decreased CCNT2 protein levels and promoting apoptosis in AML cells (Xing2020Decitabine).

## Interactions
Cyclin T2 (CCNT2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in transcription regulation and muscle differentiation. One of its primary interactions is with CDK9, forming the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex. This complex is crucial for the phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, facilitating transcription elongation (Żuryń2021The; De2002Cyclin).

CCNT2 also interacts with protein kinase N alpha (PKNa), a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in muscle differentiation. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-down assays. The interaction between Cyclin T2a and PKNa enhances MyoD-dependent transcription and promotes the expression of myogenic differentiation markers such as Myogenin and Myosin Heavy Chain in differentiating cells (Cottone2005Pkn).

In addition, CCNT2 is involved in the regulation of the actin-cytoskeleton pathway, as evidenced by its differential expression and splice-junction usage in intellectual disability patients. This suggests a broader role in cytoskeletal organization and neural development (InanlooRahatloo2019WholeTranscriptome).
