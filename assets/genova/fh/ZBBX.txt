# ZBBX

## Overview
The ZBBX gene encodes a protein known as zinc finger B-box domain containing, which is characterized by the presence of a zinc finger domain. This domain is typically involved in DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by ZBBX is categorized as a transcription factor, which suggests its involvement in the regulation of gene expression. The zinc finger B-box domain containing protein is implicated in several biological pathways, including the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is essential for cellular growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and interactions of this protein is vital for elucidating its role in normal cellular physiology and its potential implications in disease states.
