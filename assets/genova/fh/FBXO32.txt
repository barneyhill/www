# FBXO32

## Overview
FBXO32 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 32, a muscle and cardiomyocyte-specific protein that is a critical component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex, functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a significant role in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, which is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. The FBXO32 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle homeostasis, autophagy, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. It is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, where it targets multiple substrates for degradation, influencing muscle mass and cardiac function. Alterations in the FBXO32 gene, such as mutations or changes in expression levels, have been associated with several diseases, including cancer and dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (AlYacoub2016FBXO32; Wu2024FBXO32mediated).

## Structure
The FBXO32 gene encodes a muscle and cardiomyocyte-specific F-Box protein that is part of the SCF complex, which plays a role in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (Ghasemi2022A). The molecular structure of FBXO32 includes several domains: the leucine zipper domain, the leucine-charged residue-rich domain (LCD), a nuclear export signal (NES-like motif) within the LCD domain, two highly conserved nuclear localization signals (NLS), the F-Box domain, the PDZ domain, and the cytochrome c-like domain (CytC) (Ghasemi2022A). The F-Box domain is crucial for binding to the Skp1 protein in the SCF complex, facilitating the binding of specific substrates (AlYacoub2016FBXO32; Ghasemi2022A).

The FBXO32 protein is 355 amino acids long and localizes at the sarcomere (Ghasemi2022A). Variants in the F-Box domain can disrupt SCF assembly and autophagy, affecting the protein's function (AlYacoub2016FBXO32). The protein is transported between the nucleus and cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex, mediated by importin α3 and importin β1, with importin α3 recognizing the NLS sequence (Ghasemi2022A). The FBXO32 gene has three transcripts, with NM_058229 being the largest, containing 9 exons and 6744-bp nucleotides (Ghasemi2022A).

## Function
FBXO32, also known as F-box protein 32, is a crucial component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This complex is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of specific protein substrates, playing a vital role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (AlYacoub2016FBXO32). In healthy human cells, FBXO32 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, where it regulates muscle homeostasis by targeting multiple substrates for degradation, including calcineurin, eIF-3, MyoD, MAPK-1, and IκBα (Song2019Emerging).

FBXO32 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. It is involved in the regulation of autophagy, a process crucial for cellular maintenance and stress responses (AlYacoub2016FBXO32). The protein also plays a role in cardiac function, acting as a negative regulator of physiological cardiac hypertrophy by enhancing the activity of Forkhead transcription factors and degrading calcineurin A, which is involved in cardiac hypertrophy (AlYacoub2016FBXO32). Through these activities, FBXO32 contributes to the regulation of muscle mass and protein turnover, impacting overall organismal health and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FBXO32 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of cancer, FBXO32 is significantly amplified in various human tumors, correlating with tumor aggressiveness and poor survival outcomes in breast, colon, lung, gastric, and ovarian cancers. Its expression is associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for tumor metastasis, and is linked to the regulation of mesenchymal markers and the degradation of tumor suppressors like PTEN, promoting cancer progression through pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR (Wu2024FBXO32mediated; Sahu2017FBXO32).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), FBXO32 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cell cycle progression and EMT, enhancing cell migration and invasion, which are critical for metastasis (Wu2024FBXO32mediated).

FBXO32 mutations are also linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). A specific missense mutation, p.G243R, impairs the function of the SCF complex, affecting ubiquitination and autophagy processes. This mutation leads to the accumulation of proteins involved in cardiac hypertrophy and autophagy, contributing to the pathogenesis of DCM (AlYacoub2016FBXO32; AlYacoub2021Mutation).

## Interactions
FBXO32, also known as Atrogin-1, is involved in several protein interactions, primarily as a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex. This complex is crucial for ubiquitination, a process that tags proteins for degradation. FBXO32 interacts with SKP1, CUL1, and ROC1, which are essential components of the SCF complex. A mutation in FBXO32, specifically the p.G243R variant, impairs its ability to bind with these proteins, disrupting the SCF complex's formation and function (AlYacoub2016FBXO32).

FBXO32 also interacts with CtBP1 (C-terminal-binding protein 1), promoting its nuclear retention and stability through ubiquitination. This interaction is significant for the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Sahu2017FBXO32). In melanoma cells, FBXO32 interacts with components of chromatin remodeling complexes, such as BRG1 and BAF60a, influencing gene expression related to cell proliferation and migration (Habel2021FBXO32).

Additionally, FBXO32 targets PTEN for ubiquitin-proteasome degradation, affecting the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in lung adenocarcinoma (Wu2024FBXO32mediated). These interactions highlight FBXO32's role in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction.
