# CCDC43

## Overview
The CCDC43 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 43 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and migration. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions, making it a significant player in cellular signaling pathways. CCDC43 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, where its overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages. The protein's role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and influencing the tumor immune microenvironment underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Tao2023CCDC43; Wang2020The; Wang2018The).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC43 gene is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CCDC43 is overexpressed, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is associated with poor prognosis. High CCDC43 expression correlates with tumor progression and shorter median survival times in CRC patients (Wang2018The). The gene is a direct transcriptional target of FOXK1, and its upregulation facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in cancer metastasis (Wang2018The).

In gastric cancer (GC), CCDC43 is similarly overexpressed, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor survival rates. It promotes malignant behaviors such as cell growth and invasion, and its expression is linked to EMT markers (Wang2020The). In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), high CCDC43 expression is associated with impaired antitumor immunity and poor prognosis. It is linked to increased tumor mutational burden and enhanced DNA damage repair functions, contributing to cancer progression (Wang2022SingleCell).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCDC43 expression is correlated with higher tumor grade and stage, and it is involved in several pro-carcinogenic signaling pathways. Its expression affects the tumor immune microenvironment, influencing immune cell abundance and response to immunotherapy (Tao2023CCDC43).
