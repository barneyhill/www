# RAPGEFL1

## Overview
RAPGEFL1 is a gene that encodes the protein Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor-like 1, which is involved in intracellular signaling pathways. This protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), a category of proteins that facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP on small GTPases, thereby activating them. Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor-like 1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, by modulating the activity of the Rap family of small GTPases. The precise biological roles and mechanisms of RAPGEFL1 are still under investigation, but its involvement in critical signaling pathways suggests it may have significant implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
