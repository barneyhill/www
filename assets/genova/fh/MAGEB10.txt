# MAGEB10

## Overview
MAGEB10 is a gene that encodes the protein MAGE family member B10, which is part of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and immune response modulation. MAGEB10, like other MAGE proteins, is primarily expressed in reproductive tissues and certain types of tumors, where it may contribute to oncogenic processes. The protein is involved in protein-protein interactions that can influence tumor microenvironments and cancer cell proliferation, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression (Verma2024Melanoma). Additionally, alterations in the expression and methylation patterns of MAGEB10 have been implicated in diseases such as canine mammary tumors and Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability, and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, highlighting its significance in both oncological and genetic disorders (Melin2016GenomeWide; Velasco2018Comparative).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
MAGEB10 is implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression and methylation patterns. In canine mammary tumors, MAGEB10 is one of the tumor antigen genes present in significant genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci, suggesting its role in cancer susceptibility and immune response activation due to somatic mutations or overexpression (Melin2016GenomeWide). In the context of Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability, and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, significant hypomethylation of the MAGEB10 promoter is observed in ICF1 patients, which is not present in healthy controls. This hypomethylation is associated with DNMT3B mutations, indicating a potential role in the epigenetic dysregulation seen in ICF syndrome (Velasco2018Comparative).

While MAGEB10 is not specifically highlighted in studies of bladder cancer, it is mentioned in the context of protein-protein interactions within the MAGE family, which are known to influence tumor microenvironments and promote cancer cell proliferation (Verma2024Melanoma). These interactions suggest that MAGEB10 may play a role in cancer progression through its involvement in the broader MAGE gene family network.
