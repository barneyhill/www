# CSTPP1

## Overview
CSTPP1, also known as C11ORF49, is a gene that encodes the protein centriolar satellite-associated tubulin polyglutamylase complex regulator 1. This protein is a key regulator of the tubulin polyglutamylase complex (TPGC) and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as maintaining nuclear shape and facilitating cilium disassembly. As a regulatory protein, CSTPP1 influences microtubule dynamics through the polyglutamylation of tubulin, a post-translational modification that affects the binding of microtubule-associated proteins and the assembly of microtubules. CSTPP1's interactions with various proteins, including TPGC subunits and centrosomal proteins, underscore its importance in cytoskeletal organization and cellular function (Wang2021Regulators).

## Function
C11ORF49, also known as CSTPP1, is a crucial regulator of the tubulin polyglutamylase complex (TPGC) in human cells. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining nuclear shape and facilitating cilium disassembly by balancing microtubule (MT) and actin assembly. CSTPP1 is involved in the polyglutamylation of tubulin, a post-translational modification that influences MT dynamics and stability. This modification affects the binding of microtubule-associated proteins, such as MAP4, and regulates MT assembly, which is essential for proper nuclear morphology and cilium disassembly (Wang2021Regulators).

CSTPP1 localizes to centrosomes and interacts with TPGC subunits and PCM1, indicating its role in the assembly and stability of TPGC. It modulates MT polyglutamylation, affecting the recruitment of actin nucleators and MT-actin crosslinkers, thereby influencing actin organization and cilium disassembly. The loss of CSTPP1 leads to increased MAP4 binding, excessive MT polymerization, and nuclear lobulation, as well as enhanced ciliogenesis due to defects in an actin-mediated cilium disassembly pathway (Wang2021Regulators).

CSTPP1's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function, impacting processes like nuclear shape control and cilium disassembly, which are vital for healthy cell and organismal development (Wang2021Regulators).

## Interactions
CSTPP1, also known as C11ORF49, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its regulatory functions. It interacts with the tubulin polyglutamylase complex (TPGC), which includes subunits such as LRRC49/CSTPP2 and TPGS1. These interactions are essential for the stability and assembly of the TPGC, influencing microtubule dynamics (Wang2021Regulators). CSTPP1 also binds to microtubules (MTs) directly, suggesting a role in modulating tubulin polyglutamylation activity by affecting the binding and trafficking of the TPGC along MTs (Wang2021Regulators).

CSTPP1 interacts with centrosomal proteins, including Talpid3 and C2CD3, as identified through proteomic screening. These interactions are important for maintaining proper nuclear morphology and cilium disassembly (Wang2021Regulators). The protein also associates with PCM1, a centrosome satellite marker, indicating its involvement in centrosome satellite dynamics (Wang2021Regulators).

In CSTPP1 knockout cells, there is increased recruitment of MAP4 to MTs, which enhances MT nucleation and polymerization, affecting nuclear lobulation. This suggests that CSTPP1 regulates nuclear morphology by controlling MT polyglutamylation and assembly (Wang2021Regulators). These interactions highlight CSTPP1's role in balancing microtubule and actin assembly, crucial for cytoskeleton organization and cellular processes.
