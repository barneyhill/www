# RAB13

## Overview
RAB13 is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, which is a member of the RAS oncogene family. The RAB13 protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly in the recycling of integrins and the assembly of tight junctions in epithelial cells. As a GTPase, RAB13 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signaling, and maintaining cell polarity and barrier functions. The protein's activity is regulated through interactions with other proteins, such as β1-integrins and protein kinase A, and is essential for the dynamics of the blood-testis barrier and other cellular junctions. Clinically, RAB13 has been implicated in several cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and chemotherapeutic resistance (Marzesco2002The; Wang2022Rab13; Chen2019RAB13; Bhuin2014Rab).

## Structure
RAB13 is a small GTPase protein that is part of the Ras superfamily, involved in intracellular vesicle transport. The primary structure of RAB13 includes guanine nucleotide-binding motifs, which are characteristic of GTPases and are essential for its function in vesicle transport (Bhuin2014Rab). The secondary structure of RAB13, like other Rab proteins, likely consists of a central six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, a common feature among GTPases (Park2013Structural).

The tertiary structure of RAB13 is similar to other Rab GTPases, with a central barrel composed of a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, allowing it to undergo conformational changes upon nucleotide exchange (Bhuin2014Rab). This structural configuration is crucial for its interactions with effector proteins and its role in vesicle transport.

RAB13 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as prenylation at its carboxy-terminal cysteine residues, which is essential for membrane binding and function (Bhuin2014Rab). This modification facilitates its localization to specific cellular membranes, such as tight junctions in epithelial cells, where it plays a role in maintaining tight junction integrity (Marzesco2002The).

## Function
RAB13, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is a small GTPase involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, RAB13 is essential for the recycling of β1-integrins, which are important for cell adhesion and signaling. It associates with β1-integrins and is required for their recycling, maintaining cell surface dynamics and function (Sahgal2018GGA2). RAB13 is also involved in the assembly and function of tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial cells. It regulates the localization and assembly of TJ proteins, such as claudin1 and occludin, which are crucial for maintaining cell polarity and barrier functions (Marzesco2002The).

In the context of the blood-testis barrier (BTB), RAB13 interacts with protein kinase A (PKA) in Sertoli cells, influencing the dynamics of the TJ permeability barrier. It modulates PKA activity, affecting the organization of F-actin and the recruitment of junction proteins, which are essential for maintaining the integrity of the BTB (Su2013RAB13). RAB13's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and associated with the cytoskeleton, impacting cellular organization and signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
RAB13, a member of the RAS oncogene family, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RAB13 expression is significantly elevated and correlates with poor patient outcomes. It supports breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) properties and tumor progression by promoting tumor-stroma cross-talk and maintaining BCSC stemness through the IL8/CXCR1/2 signaling axis (Wang2022Rab13).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), RAB13 is identified as a hub gene in peritoneal metastasis and is associated with immune cell infiltration. Its expression correlates with the T stage of CRC and is linked to changes in immune cell populations, suggesting a role in tumor-immune interactions (Lv2024Identification).

RAB13 is also overexpressed in gastric cancer, where it contributes to tumor progression and chemotherapeutic resistance. High RAB13 levels are associated with poor overall and progression-free survival, and its silencing impairs cell proliferation and increases sensitivity to chemotherapy (Chen2019RAB13).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), RAB13 negatively regulates immune cell infiltration and is linked to immune escape mechanisms, affecting prognosis (Zhang2023Clinical).

## Interactions
RAB13, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking and cellular dynamics. RAB13 interacts with β1-integrins, playing a significant role in their recycling. This interaction is facilitated by its association with GGA2, a protein that also binds β1-integrins in a RAB13-dependent manner. The colocalization of RAB13, GGA2, and β1-integrin in endosomes suggests a complex that is essential for integrin recycling and cell migration (Sahgal2019GGA2).

RAB13 also forms complexes with JRAB/MICAL-L2, which are involved in the recycling of E-cadherin and occludin to the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of tight junctions and adherens junctions, as demonstrated by the colocalization of these complexes with E-cadherin and occludin at the perinuclear compartment and plasma membrane (Yamamura2008The).

In Sertoli cells, RAB13 interacts with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), influencing the assembly of the tight junction permeability barrier. This interaction modulates PKA activity, affecting the dynamics of the Sertoli cell permeability barrier (Su2013RAB13).
