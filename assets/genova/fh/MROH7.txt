# MROH7

## Overview
The MROH7 gene encodes the protein maestro heat like repeat family member 7, which is a membrane protein characterized by HEAT repeats. These repeats are implicated in cytoplasmic transport and potentially in chromosome organization, suggesting a role in various cellular processes (He2019MROH7‐TTC4). The protein functions as an apoptosis repressor, particularly in vascular endothelial cells, where it interacts with other proteins such as TTC4 and TIA1 to regulate apoptosis (He2019MROH7‐TTC4). MROH7 is also part of a read-through long noncoding RNA, MROH7-TTC4, which is involved in apoptosis regulation through its interaction with TIA1 (He2019MROH7‐TTC4). The gene has been associated with various clinical conditions, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta, highlighting its potential significance in disease pathogenesis (Patowary2020Identifying; Choi2022The).

## Structure


## Function
The MROH7 gene, also known as maestro heat like repeat family member 7, encodes a protein that plays a role in various cellular processes, particularly in vascular endothelial cells (VECs). MROH7 is a membrane protein characterized by 'HEAT' repeats, which are involved in cytoplasmic transport and potentially in chromosome organization (He2019MROH7‐TTC4). It functions as an apoptosis repressor in VECs, where its overexpression has been shown to decrease cell apoptosis induced by serum and FGF-2 deprivation (He2019MROH7‐TTC4). The exact mechanism by which MROH7 inhibits apoptosis is not fully understood, but it is known to interact with other proteins such as TTC4 and TIA1, which are involved in apoptosis regulation (He2019MROH7‐TTC4).

MROH7 is also part of a read-through long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) known as MROH7-TTC4, which includes the upstream gene MROH7 and the downstream gene TTC4. This lncRNA is upregulated by the inhibition of ANXA7 GTPase activity, leading to reduced apoptosis in VECs (He2019MROH7‐TTC4). The interaction of MROH7 with TIA1 suggests a role in RNA processing and translation regulation, contributing to its function in suppressing apoptosis (He2019MROH7‐TTC4). The specific function of MROH7 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in apoptosis regulation highlights its potential significance in cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The MROH7 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), MROH7 has been identified as a hub gene within low-preserved modules, showing up-regulation in ESCC datasets. This suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of this type of cancer, as it was highlighted alongside other significant genes like BAG6 and EZH2 (Patowary2020Identifying).

In a study on hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) in a Korean family, a missense variant in MROH7 was identified, although the study primarily focused on the HCCS gene. The variant in MROH7 had an Asian minor allele frequency of 0.0105, indicating its presence in the population, but its specific role in AI remains less clear compared to HCCS (Choi2022The).

Additionally, MROH7 was mentioned in the context of syndromic obesity, where it was identified as a candidate gene in a study involving children with the condition. However, the study did not provide detailed insights into the specific impact of MROH7 mutations or expression changes in this context (Vuillaume2014New).

## Interactions
MROH7, also known as HEATR8, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MROH7-TTC4, which acts as an apoptosis repressor in vascular endothelial cells (VECs). This interaction is facilitated by the RNA-binding protein TIA1, which is involved in RNA processing and translation regulation. TIA1 binds strongly to MROH7-TTC4, enhancing its anti-apoptotic function when TIA1 phosphorylation is inhibited (He2019MROH7‐TTC4).

MROH7 may also interact with TTC4, a protein that suppresses apoptosis in VECs. TTC4 is a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat domain proteins and is involved in cell cycle regulation. The overexpression of TTC4 in VECs decreases apoptosis, suggesting a potential interaction between MROH7 and TTC4 in inhibiting apoptosis (He2019MROH7‐TTC4).

These interactions highlight MROH7's role in forming multiprotein complexes or engaging in transient interactions that modulate cellular functions, particularly in the context of apoptosis regulation in vascular endothelial cells (He2019MROH7‐TTC4).
