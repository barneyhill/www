# TEX54

## Overview
TEX54 is a gene that encodes the protein testis expressed 54, which is predominantly expressed in the testis. The protein is categorized as a testis-specific protein, suggesting a role in male reproductive biology. While the precise function of TEX54 remains to be fully elucidated, its expression pattern indicates potential involvement in spermatogenesis or other testicular processes. Research into TEX54 may provide insights into its role in fertility and its potential implications in reproductive health disorders. Further studies are needed to explore its interactions and pathways to better understand its biological significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
