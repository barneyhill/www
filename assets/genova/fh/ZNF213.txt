# ZNF213

## Overview
ZNF213 is a gene located on chromosome 16p13.3 that encodes the zinc finger protein 213, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for its role in DNA binding and gene regulation. The protein is characterized by its three C2H2 zinc finger motifs, a Kruppel associated A box (KRAB-A), and a leucine-rich motif known as the LeR domain or SCAN box, which collectively contribute to its function as a transcription factor (Chen1999Identification). ZNF213 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein stability through polyubiquitination, particularly influencing the degradation of the YAP protein (Liu2021ZNF213). It plays a significant role in breast cancer progression by interacting with estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in cancer treatment (Liu2021ZNF213; Zhuang2020ZNF213).

## Structure
The ZNF213 protein is a zinc finger protein encoded by the ZNF213 gene located on chromosome 16p13.3. It is composed of 424 amino acids and features several distinct domains that contribute to its function as a transcription factor. The protein contains three C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which are located between amino acids 318 and 399. These motifs conform to the C2H2 finger consensus and are connected by 'H-C links', which are indicative of DNA-binding zinc fingers (Chen1999Identification). 

In addition to the zinc finger motifs, ZNF213 includes a Kruppel associated A box (KRAB-A) between amino acids 200 and 234, although it diverges from the typical KRAB-A consensus sequence (Chen1999Identification). The protein also features a leucine-rich motif known as the LeR domain or SCAN box, which is located in exon 3 (Chen1999Identification). 

ZNF213 is involved in the regulation of protein stability through polyubiquitination, specifically promoting YAP protein degradation via K48-linked poly-ubiquitination at specific lysine sites (Liu2021ZNF213). The protein's interaction with YAP involves the KRAB-A domain, but the full-length ZNF213 is necessary for its effect on YAP protein stability (Liu2021ZNF213).

## Function
ZNF213, or zinc finger protein 213, is a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is known for its role in DNA binding and gene regulation. In healthy human cells, ZNF213 functions primarily as a transcription factor, utilizing its zinc finger motifs to bind specific DNA sequences and modulate gene expression (Chen1999Identification). The protein contains three Kruppel-type C2H2 zinc fingers, which are characteristic of DNA-binding proteins, suggesting its involvement in regulating transcriptional activity (Chen1999Identification).

ZNF213 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, indicating its broad role in cellular processes (Chen1999Identification). The protein is typically active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional activity of target genes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal development. The presence of a Kruppel associated A box and a leucine-rich motif (LeR domain/SCAN box) in ZNF213 suggests it may function as a transcription repressor, further highlighting its regulatory role in gene expression (Chen1999Identification).

The gene's 3' untranslated region contains a polymorphism that may affect mRNA stability and translational efficiency, although the specific impact of this polymorphism on ZNF213's function in healthy cells requires further investigation (Chen1999Identification).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF213 has been implicated in breast cancer, particularly in its interaction with estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) signaling. In ER alpha positive breast cancer, ZNF213 enhances ER alpha stability by inhibiting its ubiquitination, which promotes ER alpha signaling and contributes to breast cancer progression. This interaction is significant because ER alpha is a key driver of breast cancer, and ZNF213's role in modulating its stability suggests that it could be a target for therapeutic intervention, especially in cases of endocrine resistance (Zhuang2020ZNF213).

In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), ZNF213 appears to play a protective role by negatively regulating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. ZNF213 facilitates the degradation of YAP protein, thereby suppressing cancer cell invasion and migration. Clinically, higher ZNF213 expression is associated with longer relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients, including those with TNBC, while higher YAP expression correlates with poorer outcomes. This suggests that ZNF213 could serve as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in TNBC (Liu2021ZNF213).

Overall, alterations in ZNF213 expression and its interactions with key signaling pathways are linked to breast cancer progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its clinical significance.

## Interactions
ZNF213, a zinc finger protein, is involved in several protein interactions that influence breast cancer progression. In estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) positive breast cancer cells, ZNF213 interacts with ER alpha, particularly associating with its AF1 domain through its zinc finger (ZF) domain. This interaction modulates ER alpha poly-ubiquitination and protein stability, enhancing ER alpha signaling and stability, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation (Zhuang2020ZNF213).

In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, ZNF213 interacts with the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. ZNF213 negatively regulates YAP by promoting its poly-ubiquitination, leading to YAP degradation. This interaction involves the KRAB-A domain of ZNF213 and is essential for controlling YAP protein levels and the expression of YAP target genes, thereby inhibiting TNBC progression (Liu2021ZNF213).

ZNF213 also interacts with RNA-processing paraspeckle-forming proteins such as PSPC1, NONO, and SFPQ, suggesting a role in RNA-related functions. These interactions are supported by similar sub-nuclear localization patterns (Helleboid2019The). Additionally, ZNF213 may interact with proteins like DHX9, hnRNPU, and NCL, independent of KAP1, indicating diverse interaction capabilities (Itokawa2009KAP1independent).
