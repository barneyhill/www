# SEPSECS

## Overview
The SEPSECS gene encodes the enzyme Sep (O-phosphoserine) tRNA:Sec (selenocysteine) tRNA synthase, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of selenocysteine, the 21st amino acid. This enzyme is essential for the conversion of O-phosphoserine-tRNA^Sec to selenocysteinyl-tRNA^Sec, a key step in the selenocysteine biosynthesis pathway, which is vital for the production of selenoproteins. Selenoproteins are crucial for various cellular functions, including antioxidant defense and redox signaling. The SEPSECS protein functions as a tetramer, consisting of a catalytic and a non-catalytic dimer, and is active in the cytoplasm where it facilitates the incorporation of selenocysteine into selenoproteins (Schmidt2012Synthesis; Schoenmakers2020Human). Mutations in the SEPSECS gene can lead to neurological disorders due to impaired selenoprotein synthesis, highlighting its clinical significance (FradejasVillar2018Consequences).

## Structure
The SEPSECS protein is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme involved in the conversion of O-phosphoserine-tRNA [Ser]Sec to Sec-tRNA [Ser]Sec, using selenophosphate as a donor substrate (Schoenmakers2020Human). The human SEPSECS structure is characterized by a tetrameric formation that binds two Sec-tRNA [Ser]Sec molecules. This tetramer consists of a catalytic dimer and a non-catalytic dimer, with the latter mediating RNA-protein interactions to stabilize the complex. The CCA end of Ser-tRNA [Ser]Sec is positioned in the active site of the catalytic dimer (Schoenmakers2020Human).

Mutations in SEPSECS, such as Ala239Thr, Thr325Ser, Tyr334Cys, and Tyr429*, have been linked to structural instability, leading to misfolding and reduced catalytic activity. These mutations affect the protein's stability and folding, with some variants showing decreased solubility and co-purification with bacterial chaperones, indicating potential misfolding (Puppala2016Structural). The structural integrity of the SEPSECS tetramer is generally maintained despite these mutations, although they may have functional implications (Puppala2016Structural). The enzyme's activity is crucial for selenoprotein synthesis, particularly in the brain, and its dysfunction is associated with various neurological disorders (Schoenmakers2020Human).

## Function
The SEPSECS gene encodes the enzyme Sep (O-phosphoserine) tRNA:Sec (selenocysteine) tRNA synthase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of selenocysteine, the 21st amino acid. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of O-phosphoserine-tRNA^Sec to selenocysteyl-tRNA^Sec, a key step in the selenocysteine biosynthesis pathway. Selenocysteine is incorporated into selenoproteins, which are essential for various cellular functions, including antioxidant defense and redox signaling (Schmidt2012Synthesis; Schoenmakers2020Human).

SEPSECS functions as a tetramer and requires the cofactor pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) for its activity. The enzyme binds two Sec-tRNA^Ser molecules and undergoes a conformational change upon binding with Ser-tRNA^Ser, facilitating the conversion process (Schoenmakers2020Human). This process is vital for maintaining the integrity of the human selenoproteome, which is necessary for normal development and function of the brain and other organs (Schmidt2012Synthesis).

In healthy human cells, SEPSECS ensures the proper synthesis of selenoproteins, which play significant roles in maintaining cellular health and function. The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the synthesis and incorporation of selenocysteine into selenoproteins (Minich2022Selenium).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEPSECS gene are linked to several severe neurological disorders, primarily due to its role in the selenocysteine incorporation pathway. These mutations can lead to systemic selenoprotein deficiency, manifesting in conditions such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2D (PCH2D) and progressive cerebellocerebral atrophy (PCCA). Patients with these conditions often experience profound intellectual disability, global developmental delay, spasticity, epilepsy, and hypotonia, frequently accompanied by progressive microcephaly due to cortical and cerebellar atrophy (Schoenmakers2020Human; FradejasVillar2018Consequences).

Specific mutations, such as p.Tyr334Cys and p.Ala239Thr, have been identified in various populations, including Iraqi and Moroccan families. These mutations affect the enzyme's ability to bind tRNA and its catalytic efficiency, leading to reduced selenoprotein synthesis and increased oxidative stress in brain tissue (Puppala2016Structural; FradejasVillar2018Consequences). The clinical presentation of SEPSECS-related disorders can vary, with some cases showing severe prenatal onset and others a milder, late-onset phenotype (Schoenmakers2020Human).

The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with individuals carrying homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations exhibiting symptoms, while heterozygous carriers remain unaffected (Puppala2016Structural; FradejasVillar2018Consequences).

## Interactions
The SEPSECS enzyme plays a crucial role in the selenocysteine incorporation pathway by interacting with tRNA molecules. It specifically converts O-phosphoserine-tRNA [Ser]Sec to selenocysteinyl-tRNA [Ser]Sec, using selenophosphate as a donor substrate. This interaction involves the formation of a tetrameric complex that binds two tRNA molecules, with the enzyme's activity being dependent on the pyridoxal-5-phosphate cofactor (Schoenmakers2020Human; FradejasVillar2018Consequences).

The interaction of SEPSECS with tRNA is mediated by its non-catalytic dimer, which stabilizes the complex, while the catalytic dimer facilitates the conversion process. Mutations in SEPSECS can impair the enzyme's ability to form stable complexes with tRNA, reducing its catalytic activity and leading to systemic selenoprotein deficiency (Schoenmakers2020Human).

SEPSECS may also interact with other proteins involved in selenoprotein synthesis, such as selenophosphate synthetase 2 (SEPHS2) and the Sec-specific elongation factor EEFSEC, although these interactions are not explicitly detailed in the provided context (Santesmasses2020Bioinformatics; FradejasVillar2018Consequences).
