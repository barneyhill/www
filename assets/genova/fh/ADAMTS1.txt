# ADAMTS1

## Overview
ADAMTS1 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 1, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family. This protein is a secreted zinc-dependent metalloprotease involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) through the cleavage of proteoglycans such as aggrecan and versican. It plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including tissue morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and inflammation (Kelwick2015The; Lee2005Fibulin1). The ADAMTS1 protein is characterized by a complex multi-domain structure, including a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and thrombospondin type I motifs, which facilitate its incorporation into the ECM and its regulatory functions (Kuno1998ADAMTS1; Takeda2016ADAM). ADAMTS1 is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, where its expression and activity can influence disease progression and serve as potential biomarkers (Kelwick2015The; de2013The).

## Structure
The ADAMTS1 protein is a member of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a complex multi-domain structure. It includes a signal peptide, a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a thrombospondin type I motif, and a cysteine-rich domain (Kuno1998ADAMTS1; Takeda2016ADAM). The metalloproteinase domain is catalytically active and features a conserved arrangement of three histidine zinc ligands and a catalytic glutamate residue, similar to other zinc metalloproteases (Gerhardt2007Crystal). The disintegrin-like domain, structurally homologous to cysteine-rich domains, is involved in regulatory functions near the active site (Gerhardt2007Crystal).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, which affects its molecular size and processing by furin endopeptidase (Kuno1998ADAMTS1; Kuno1999ADAMTS1). The ADAMTS1 protein is secreted and incorporated into the extracellular matrix (ECM), with its thrombospondin type I motifs playing a crucial role in ECM binding (Kuno1998ADAMTS1). The protein forms a dimer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, mediated by a four-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet (Gerhardt2007Crystal). The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned in the provided context.

## Function
ADAMTS1 is a secreted zinc-dependent metalloprotease involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by cleaving proteoglycans such as aggrecan and versican. It plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including tissue morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and inflammation (Kelwick2015The; Lee2005Fibulin1). In healthy human cells, ADAMTS1 is active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to maintaining tissue homeostasis by regulating the ECM structure and function (Kelwick2015The).

ADAMTS1 is involved in the inhibition of angiogenesis by cleaving matrix-bound thrombospondins-1 and -2, generating bioactive anti-angiogenic fragments, and sequestering angiogenic factors like VEGF 165 (Kelwick2015The). It is also essential for normal ovulation and renal function, as it processes matrix proteins and growth factors, modulating angiogenesis and tissue remodeling (Lee2006ADAMTS1). The protein's activity is regulated by various factors, including hormones and inflammatory cytokines, which influence its expression and function in different tissues (Kelwick2015The).

In the developing kidney, ADAMTS1, with fibulin-1 as a cofactor, enhances the proteolytic degradation of aggrecan, contributing to normal kidney development and function (Lee2005Fibulin1). Its role in ECM remodeling is crucial for processes such as wound healing, where it regulates fibroblast and endothelial cell migration (Krampert2005ADAMTS1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADAMTS1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In familial mandibular prognathism (MP), a rare nonsynonymous single-nucleotide mutation (c. 742I>T) in ADAMTS1 has been identified as a potential causative variant, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This mutation may disrupt the balance of jaw bone growth, contributing to mandibular overgrowth (Guan2015The).

In cancer, ADAMTS1 plays a complex role. It is often downregulated in primary tumors due to epigenetic silencing, such as promoter hypermethylation, observed in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. This downregulation is associated with tumor progression and may serve as an early biomarker for colorectal cancer (de2013The). Despite its tumor-suppressive properties, ADAMTS1 can also promote metastasis in certain contexts, such as in breast cancer, where its overexpression is linked to poor survival and accelerated tumor growth (Kelwick2015The; de2013The).

ADAMTS1 is also involved in cardiovascular diseases, where it may promote atherosclerosis by stimulating the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells through versican cleavage (Kelwick2015The). Its role in angiogenesis, through interactions with VEGF, further underscores its clinical significance in both cancer and cardiovascular conditions (Lambert2020ADAMTS1).

## Interactions
ADAMTS1 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular processes. It forms covalent complexes with the plasma protease inhibitor α2-macroglobulin (α2M), a process dependent on its proteolytic activity and facilitated by its metalloproteinase domain (Kuno1999ADAMTS1). ADAMTS1 also cleaves thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) and thrombospondin-2 (TSP2), releasing antiangiogenic polypeptides, which are crucial for regulating angiogenesis (Lee2006ADAMTS1). The interaction with TSP1 and TSP2 involves the heparin-binding domains, which are necessary for efficient cleavage (Lee2006ADAMTS1).

In cancer pathways, ADAMTS1 interacts with latent TGF-b, activating it through cleavage, which contributes to liver fibrogenesis and tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (de2013The). It also interacts with VEGF, suggesting an angio-inhibitory mechanism (de2013The). ADAMTS1 cleaves structural ECM proteins like versican, releasing fragments that promote tumor cell proliferation (de2013The).

ADAMTS1's interaction with syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, regulates cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis, affecting cellular responses to VEGFA and promoting microvessel sprouting (Lambert2020ADAMTS1). It also cleaves nidogen-1 and nidogen-2, glycoproteins in basement membranes, indicating its role in ECM remodeling (Canals2006Identification).
