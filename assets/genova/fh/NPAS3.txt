# NPAS3

## Overview
Neuronal PAS domain protein 3 (NPAS3) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the basic Helix-Loop-Helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) family, which is characterized by its role in regulating gene expression through DNA binding and dimerization. The NPAS3 protein is involved in critical neurodevelopmental and metabolic pathways, influencing processes such as neurogenesis and glucose metabolism. It functions primarily by forming a heterodimer with the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), facilitating the regulation of target genes essential for normal brain function and structure (Sha2011Transcriptional; Luoma2018Molecular). NPAS3 is expressed in the central nervous system and plays a significant role in maintaining cognitive functions and behavior. Alterations in the NPAS3 gene have been associated with various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Rossi2021Molecular; Pickard2005Disruption).

## Structure
The NPAS3 protein is a member of the basic Helix-Loop-Helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors, characterized by its distinct domain architecture. It contains an N-terminal bHLH domain responsible for DNA binding and dimerization, followed by two PAS domains, PAS-A and PAS-B, which are involved in dimerization and potentially ligand binding (Rossi2021Molecular; Luoma2018Molecular). The C-terminal region of NPAS3 includes a transactivation domain, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor (Luoma2018Molecular).

The bHLH domain also contains a predicted nuclear export sequence, while the PAS domains are essential for heterodimerization with ARNT, a common partner in the bHLH-PAS family (Luoma2018Molecular). The PAS domains feature internal hydrophobic cavities that can bind various ligands, suggesting a role in multi-ligand binding, which is significant for potential therapeutic targeting (Wu2016NPAS1ARNT).

NPAS3 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which differ by small amino acid sequences flanking the bHLH domain, potentially affecting its interaction with ARNT and subcellular localization (Luoma2018Molecular). These structural features underscore NPAS3's role in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric processes.

## Function
NPAS3 (neuronal PAS domain protein 3) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in neurodevelopmental and metabolic pathways in healthy human cells. It is part of the basic Helix Loop Helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) family and functions by forming a heterodimer with ARNT, another protein, to regulate gene expression through direct DNA binding (Luoma2018Molecular). NPAS3 is involved in the regulation of genes such as VGF and TXNIP, which are crucial for normal neurodevelopment and neural function (Luoma2018Molecular).

In the brain, NPAS3 is expressed in the developing central nervous system and the adult brain, where it influences neurogenesis, particularly in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (Sha2011Transcriptional; Pieper2005The). It regulates the expression of genes involved in neuronal proliferation and differentiation, sharing target profiles with SOX transcription factors (Sha2011Transcriptional). NPAS3 also plays a role in metabolic regulation, influencing glucose metabolism by repressing glycolysis genes (Sha2011Transcriptional).

The gene's activity is modulated by circadian rhythms, affecting its transcriptional targets at different times of the day (Sha2011Transcriptional). Overall, NPAS3 is crucial for maintaining normal brain function and structure, impacting cognitive functions and behavior (Pieper2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPAS3 gene have been linked to several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and learning disabilities. Disruptions in NPAS3, such as chromosomal rearrangements and specific mutations, have been observed in individuals with schizophrenia and cognitive deficits, suggesting a causative role in these conditions (Yu2013A; Pickard2005Disruption). The NPAS3 gene encodes a transcription factor involved in brain development, and its dysfunction can lead to decreased numbers of cortical interneurons and deficits in neurogenesis, contributing to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and intellectual disabilities (Rossi2021Molecular).

Variants in NPAS3, such as the V304I mutation, have been associated with mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and major depression, by affecting protein function and neurite outgrowth (Yu2013A). Additionally, NPAS3 protein aggregation, not limited to specific mutations, has been observed in various mental health conditions, indicating a broader role in neuropsychiatric disorders (Samardžija2021Protein). The gene's involvement in maintaining the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain further underscores its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Rossi2021Molecular).

## Interactions
NPAS3 interacts with the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) to form a heterodimer, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor. This interaction involves the basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) and PAS domains of NPAS3, but not the C-terminal transactivation domain. The NPAS3::ARNT heterodimer regulates the expression of genes such as VGF and TXNIP by binding to their proximal promoters (Luoma2018Molecular). 

NPAS3 is also involved in regulating neural cell proliferation through its interactions with glutamatergic pathways. It activates signaling pathways involving NMDA receptors and mGluR5, with its effects on protein kinase D (PKD) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation being mediated through these receptors. The presence of VGF is crucial for NPAS3's impact on these kinases (Yang2016NPAS3).

Additionally, NPAS3 has been shown to bind to DNA, specifically to the promoter regions of its target genes, which include VGF. This binding is facilitated by the presence of an 'E box' motif, a known binding site for bHLH transcription factors like NPAS3 (Sha2011Transcriptional).
