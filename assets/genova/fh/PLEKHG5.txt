# PLEKHG5

## Overview
PLEKHG5 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology and RhoGEF domain containing G5, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and is characterized by the presence of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a RhoGEF domain. These domains are essential for its function in modulating Rho family GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and autophagy. PLEKHG5 is implicated in maintaining cell polarity, adhesion, and migration, particularly in macrophages and osteoclasts, and is also involved in autophagy and synaptic vesicle turnover in motoneurons. Mutations in the PLEKHG5 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting its clinical significance in hereditary neuropathies and motoneuron diseases (Lüningschrör2017Plekhg5regulated; Azzedine2013PLEKHG5; Kim2013Mutations).

## Structure
The PLEKHG5 protein is characterized by the presence of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) domain, which are integral to its function in cellular signaling pathways. The PH domain facilitates interactions with lipids, contributing to the protein's ability to associate with cellular membranes. The RhoGEF domain is crucial for modulating Rho family GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization and cell migration.

The tertiary structure of PLEKHG5 is shaped by these domains, allowing it to interact with other proteins and lipids effectively. This structural configuration is essential for its role in signal transduction. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, potentially influencing the protein's activity and its interactions with other cellular components.

PLEKHG5 also exhibits multiple splice variants, which can lead to differences in its functional properties. These variants may alter the protein's structure and, consequently, its role in cellular signaling. The existence of these splice variants suggests a level of regulatory complexity, allowing the protein to participate in diverse cellular contexts and processes.

## Function
PLEKHG5 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily through its role as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho GTPases. This protein is essential for maintaining cell polarity, adhesion, and migration in macrophages and osteoclasts. In macrophages, PLEKHG5 influences cell morphology and migration, with its depletion leading to impaired cell polarity and enhanced migration capabilities. It also affects chemotactic responses and cell adhesion, as well as the fusion of precursor macrophages into multinuclear osteoclasts (Iwatake2017The). In osteoclasts, PLEKHG5 is crucial for normal bone-resorption activity, protein transport, and podosome organization, with its depletion resulting in reduced bone-resorption activity and impaired migratory ability (Iwatake2017The).

In the nervous system, PLEKHG5 is involved in autophagy and synaptic vesicle turnover in motoneurons. It acts as a GEF for Rab26, facilitating the autophagy of synaptic vesicles, which is crucial for maintaining synaptic homeostasis and axonal integrity. PLEKHG5 deficiency leads to impaired autophagosome biogenesis and axonal growth, contributing to motoneuron diseases (Lüningschrör2017Plekhg5regulated). In Schwann cells, PLEKHG5 is involved in autophagy and myelin maintenance, with its absence resulting in impaired autophagosome formation and myelin degradation (Lüningschrör2020Absence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLEKHG5 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, primarily affecting motor neurons and peripheral nerves. These mutations can lead to various forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), including autosomal recessive intermediate CMT (RI-CMT) and distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN) (Azzedine2013PLEKHG5; Kim2013Mutations). PLEKHG5 mutations have also been linked to distal spinal muscular atrophy type IV (DSMA-IV) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), conditions characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy (Lüningschrör2017Plekhg5regulated; Gonzalez‐Quereda2020Novel).

In CMT, mutations often result in sensory neuropathy and muscle atrophy, with symptoms such as pes cavus deformity and distal amyotrophy (Azzedine2013PLEKHG5). In ALS, PLEKHG5 mutations contribute to motoneuron degeneration, leading to late-onset motoneuron disease with symptoms like hindlimb paralysis and reduced motor performance (Lüningschrör2017Plekhg5regulated).

The gene's role as a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for Rab26 is crucial for synaptic vesicle autophagy, and its dysfunction can lead to defective autophagy and accumulation of synaptic vesicles, contributing to motoneuron disease pathophysiology (Lüningschrör2017Plekhg5regulated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PLEKHG5 in hereditary neuropathies and motoneuron diseases.

## Interactions
PLEKHG5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Rho GTPases, including RhoA, RHOB, and RHOC, which are crucial for cytoskeletal organization and cell migration (Witte2020PLEKHG5). In macrophages and osteoclasts, PLEKHG5 modulates the Rho-mDia1-EB1 pathway, affecting actin reorganization and focal adhesion. This interaction leads to changes in protein levels and localization, such as increased RhoA levels and altered EB1 localization in Plekhg5-depleted cells (Iwatake2017The).

PLEKHG5 also acts as a GEF for Rab26, a small GTPase involved in autophagy and synaptic vesicle turnover. This interaction is essential for recruiting autophagy machinery to synaptic vesicles and is implicated in motoneuron disease pathogenesis (Lüningschrör2017Plekhg5regulated). The interaction with Rab26 is specific, as PLEKHG5 does not regulate other Rab proteins like Rab5, Rab27b, or Rab33b (Lüningschrör2017Plekhg5regulated).

In glioblastoma cells, PLEKHG5 influences autophagy and cell survival through its interaction with RAB26, affecting lysosomal membrane homeostasis and autolysosome formation (Witte2020PLEKHG5). These interactions highlight PLEKHG5's role in regulating cellular dynamics and its potential as a therapeutic target.
