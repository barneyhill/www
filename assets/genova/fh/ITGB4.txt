# ITGB4

## Overview
The ITGB4 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 4, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion and signaling. This protein is a component of the integrin α6β4 complex, which is essential for the formation and stabilization of hemidesmosomes, structures that anchor epithelial cells to the basement membrane. The integrin subunit beta 4 is distinguished by its large cytoplasmic domain, which facilitates interactions with intracellular proteins, linking the integrin to the cytoskeleton and contributing to the structural integrity of epithelial tissues (Spinardi1993The; Walko2014Molecular). Beyond its structural role, ITGB4 is involved in various cellular processes, including tumor progression and endothelial barrier regulation, through its interactions with signaling molecules and receptors (Ni2014Interaction; Chen2010Integrin). Mutations in ITGB4 are associated with genetic disorders such as epidermolysis bullosa, highlighting its clinical significance in both human and veterinary medicine (Matyas2021Case; Peters2015DNAbased).

## Structure
The ITGB4 protein, also known as integrin subunit beta 4, is a large protein with a unique molecular structure compared to other beta integrins. It consists of 1822 amino acid residues, significantly more than the 769-798 residues found in other integrins (Holmes2011Comparative). The primary structure includes an N-signal peptide, an N-terminal extracellular beta-integrin domain, a cysteine-rich tandem-repeat region, an integrin beta-tail region, and a transmembrane-helix anchor region (Holmes2011Comparative). The cytoplasmic domain is notably extensive, comprising approximately 1000 amino acids, and includes four fibronectin type III-like repeats (Iacovacci1997Genomic).

The secondary structure of ITGB4 features a central helical domain with coiled motifs essential for membrane insertion (Holmes2011Comparative). The tertiary structure is characterized by the arrangement of these domains, facilitating specific interactions with cellular components (Holmes2011Comparative). In terms of quaternary structure, ITGB4 pairs with the integrin alpha 6 subunit to form the α6β4 integrin complex, which is crucial for cell-matrix adhesion (Holmes2011Comparative).

ITGB4 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its interactions and functions (Holmes2011Comparative). The gene's exon-intron organization allows for alternative splicing, leading to tissue-specific isoforms and structural variants (Iacovacci1997Genomic).

## Function
The ITGB4 gene encodes the integrin beta-4 subunit, which is a critical component of the integrin alpha-6/beta-4 (α6β4) complex. This integrin is primarily involved in the formation and stabilization of hemidesmosomes, which are structures that anchor epithelial cells to the basement membrane. The β4 subunit has a unique and large cytoplasmic domain that interacts with intracellular proteins such as plectin and BPAG1e, linking the integrin to the keratin intermediate filament cytoskeleton. This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of epithelial tissues (Spinardi1993The; Walko2014Molecular).

In healthy human cells, integrin α6β4 acts as a receptor for laminin-332, a major component of anchoring filaments, facilitating stable cell adhesion and contributing to epidermal homeostasis. The absence of integrin α6β4 results in the loss of hemidesmosomes and stable epidermal adhesion, leading to conditions such as junctional epidermolysis bullosa (Walko2014Molecular). The β4 subunit's cytoplasmic domain is crucial for the assembly of hemidesmosomes, as it mediates interactions with the cytoskeleton, ensuring proper localization and function of the integrin complex in epithelial cells (Spinardi1993The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ITGB4 gene are associated with several forms of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a group of genetic disorders characterized by skin fragility and blistering. One notable condition linked to ITGB4 mutations is junctional epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (JEB-PA), an autosomal recessive disorder that often presents with skin blistering, pyloric atresia, and other malformations such as aplasia cutis and limb deformities (Matyas2021Case; Ellis2021Novel). The majority of JEB-PA cases are due to mutations in ITGB4, which can lead to severe and sometimes lethal phenotypes (Luo2023Case).

In some cases, ITGB4 mutations result in milder forms of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), characterized by blistering primarily on the hands and feet, nail dystrophy, and dental issues (Jonkman2002Deletion). These mutations can cause frameshifts and premature termination codons, affecting the protein's structure and function (Jonkman2002Deletion).

ITGB4 mutations are also implicated in Charolais cattle, where a 4.4 kb deletion in the gene is associated with epidermolysis bullosa junctionalis (EBJ), a condition marked by skin fragility (Peters2015DNAbased). The gene's role in cell adhesion and signaling makes it significant in both human and veterinary medicine.

## Interactions
Integrin β4 (ITGB4) is a transmembrane protein that primarily interacts with integrin α6 to form the α6β4 integrin complex, which is crucial for hemidesmosome formation and epithelial cell adhesion (Hogervorst1990Cloning). ITGB4 interacts with plectin, linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, and plays a role in tumor invasiveness (Chen2010Integrin). It also forms complexes with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors, specifically S1PR2 and S1PR3, in endothelial cells, which are involved in endothelial barrier regulation (Ni2014Interaction).

ITGB4 directly associates with S1PR3, and this interaction is enhanced by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) treatment (Ni2014Interaction). The interaction with S1PR2 is indirect, mediated through S1PR1, and is influenced by S1P (Ni2014Interaction). ITGB4 also interacts with SHP-2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, modulating MAPK signaling and reducing inflammatory responses in endothelial cells (Chen2010Integrin).

In cancer, ITGB4 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and protein kinase B (AKT), promoting tumor migration and invasion (Huang2024The). It also interacts with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other signaling molecules, influencing tumor progression (Huang2024The). These interactions highlight ITGB4's role in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions.
