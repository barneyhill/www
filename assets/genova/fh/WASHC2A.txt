# WASHC2A

## Overview
WASHC2A is a gene that encodes the protein WASH complex subunit 2A, a critical component of the WASH complex involved in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. The WASH complex is essential for the activation of the Arp2/3 complex, which facilitates the formation of branched actin networks on endosomal surfaces, crucial for maintaining endosome morphology and function (Derivery2009The). The protein encoded by WASHC2A, also known as FAM21A, acts as a scaffold within the cytoplasm, particularly associated with endosomes, where it organizes endosomal retrieval sub-domains and recruits additional protein complexes necessary for endosomal sorting (McNally2018Endosomal). Through its interactions with various proteins, including those in the retromer complex, WASHC2A plays a pivotal role in the trafficking and recycling of plasma membrane components, such as transferrin receptors, and is implicated in the regulation of endosomal dynamics (Seaman2013Retromer-mediated; Alekhina2017Cellular).

## Function
The WASHC2A gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the WASH complex, which plays a significant role in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. This complex is involved in the activation of the Arp2/3 complex, leading to the formation of branched actin networks on the surface of endosomes. These networks are essential for maintaining endosome morphology and facilitating the fission of transport intermediates from sorting and recycling endosomes (Derivery2009The).

WASHC2A, also known as FAM21A, is part of a multiprotein assembly that interacts with dynamin and microtubule motors to regulate endosomal trafficking and recycling processes. The WASH complex is involved in the trafficking of various receptors, including transferrin receptors, and is essential for the recycling of plasma membrane components (McNally2018Endosomal; Alekhina2017Cellular). 

The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with endosomes, where it helps organize endosomal retrieval sub-domains and acts as a scaffold for recruiting additional protein complexes necessary for endosomal sorting (McNally2018Endosomal). The absence of WASHC2A can lead to defects in endosomal fission and the formation of elongated membrane tubules, highlighting its critical role in maintaining endosomal structure and function (Derivery2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WASHC2A gene, a component of the WASH complex, have been linked to elevated plasma LDL cholesterol levels, which can contribute to hypercholesterolemia and associated cardiovascular risks. This is due to the WASH complex's role in the endosomal trafficking of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is crucial for efficient LDL uptake. Disruptions in this process can lead to elevated cholesterol levels, as observed in patients with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndrome and Ritscher-Schinzel/3C syndrome (RSS), who have mutations in related genes (van2017News).

The WASH complex, including WASHC2A, is also involved in regulating the architecture of the endolysosomal system. Mutations in genes encoding components of the WASH regulatory complex (SHRC), such as KIAA1033 and strumpellin, have been associated with intellectual disability syndromes and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Although the specific mechanism by which WASH deregulation contributes to these pathologies is unclear, the collapse of the endolysosomal system in WASH-depleted cells suggests a significant impact on cellular processes (Alekhina2017Cellular).

## Interactions
WASHC2A, also known as FAM21A, is a crucial component of the WASH complex, which plays a significant role in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. WASHC2A interacts with several proteins, forming part of a multiprotein complex that includes WASH1, FAM21, and CCDC53 (Derivery2009The). The long unstructured tail of WASHC2A is essential for its interactions with other proteins, such as the CCC complex and retriever, which are recruited to the endosomal membrane (McNally2018Endosomal).

WASHC2A also interacts with FK506-binding protein 15 (FKBP15), although the functional significance of this interaction remains unclear (McNally2018Endosomal). The protein's tail binds directly to TBC1D23, a bridging factor that links golgins to endosome-derived carriers, facilitating endosome-to-Golgi traffic (Shin2017TBC1D23). This interaction is crucial for the transport of cargo such as TGN46 and CI-MPR.

The WASH complex, including WASHC2A, is recruited to endosomal membranes by the retromer complex, which consists of VPS35, VPS29, and VPS26. The interaction between WASHC2A and VPS35 is mediated through the tail of WASHC2A, which contains motifs critical for this association (Seaman2013Retromer-mediated). These interactions are essential for the sorting of cargo proteins and the regulation of endosomal dynamics.
