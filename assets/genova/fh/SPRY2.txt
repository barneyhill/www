# SPRY2

## Overview
SPRY2 is a gene that encodes the protein sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 2, which plays a critical role in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich SPRY domain, which is essential for its function as a signaling modulator. As a regulatory protein, sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 2 primarily acts as an inhibitor of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, specifically targeting the ERK pathway, thereby influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Gao2017Hypoxia; Yusoff2002Sprouty2). The protein's ability to form various oligomeric structures and undergo post-translational modifications further underscores its functional versatility (Chen2013Structure). SPRY2's interactions with other proteins, such as c-Cbl and SHP2, highlight its role in modulating complex signaling networks, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing pathological conditions, including cancer (Guy2009Sprouty).

## Structure
The SPRY2 protein, encoded by the SPRY2 gene, is involved in regulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. Its molecular structure includes a conserved cysteine-rich SPRY domain, which is crucial for its function. The SPRY2 domain consists of 10 beta strands arranged in two antiparallel sheets, forming a core structure. This domain also features an N-terminal extension, an insertion loop, and a 'lid' region, contributing to its stability and unique conformation (Lau2014Crystal).

SPRY2 can self-assemble into oligomers, including high-order oligomers, hexamers, trimers, dimers, and monomers, as identified through size-exclusion gel filtration and confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Chen2013Structure). The protein's quaternary structure is characterized by a donut-shaped oligomer with two lip-cover domains, as revealed by electron microscopy (Chen2013Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, vary across different oligomeric forms of SPRY2, suggesting potential functional differences (Chen2013Structure). The presence of silicon and iron in SPRY2 may contribute to its electroconductivity, a property that is concentration-dependent (Chen2013Structure). These structural features and modifications highlight the complexity and functional versatility of the SPRY2 protein.

## Function
The SPRY2 gene encodes the Sprouty2 protein, which functions as a regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways in healthy human cells. Sprouty2 primarily inhibits the Ras/MAP kinase pathway by targeting the activation of Raf, a key component in the signaling cascade. This inhibition is specific to the ERK pathway and does not affect other pathways such as JNK or p38 (Yusoff2002Sprouty2). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and plays a crucial role in modulating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Gao2017Hypoxia).

Sprouty2 acts as a negative feedback inhibitor in areas of active growth factor signaling, optimizing its role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation (Gao2017Hypoxia). It is involved in development, regulating processes like angiogenesis and organ development, including the kidneys, lungs, and limb buds (Gao2017Hypoxia). The protein's regulatory function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive cell growth, which can lead to tumorigenesis (Fong2006Sprouty). In hepatocytes, SPRY2 is involved in metabolic regulation, impacting glucose uptake and lipid storage (Cook2019CRISPRCas9mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPRY2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SPRY2 is frequently downregulated, which is associated with increased cell proliferation and tumor growth. This downregulation is often due to promoter hypermethylation and loss of heterozygosity, contributing to the development and progression of liver cancer (MasoumiMoghaddam2014The; Lee2007Integration). In prostate cancer, SPRY2 interacts with the PTEN gene, and its deficiency can lead to the activation of the PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways, although it is not sufficient alone to drive tumorigenesis (MasoumiMoghaddam2014The).

SPRY2 mutations are also linked to IgA nephropathy (IgAN), an autosomal dominant form of kidney disease. A specific missense mutation, p.Arg119Trp, in the SPRY2 gene has been identified in a family with IgAN, leading to the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway, which is implicated in the disease's pathogenesis (Milillo2015A).

In papillary thyroid cancer, SPRY2 acts as a negative feedback regulator of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Its expression levels can influence the clinical behavior of tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation, affecting tumor aggressiveness and response to treatment (Dultz2013Clinical).

## Interactions
SPRY2 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in modulating signaling pathways. It binds to c-Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, through a conserved tyrosine kinase-binding motif, which includes the phosphorylated tyrosine residue Y55. This interaction can lead to SPRY2's ubiquitination and degradation, or it may facilitate the ubiquitination of other proteins by c-Cbl (Kawazoe2019The; Guy2009Sprouty). SPRY2 also interacts with SHP2, an adaptor protein, in the context of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, potentially acting as a link to bring c-Cbl into contact with its substrates (Guy2009Sprouty).

The cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of SPRY2 is crucial for its interactions and membrane localization. It mediates interactions with kinases such as Raf1, TESK1, and DYRK1A, influencing various signaling pathways (Guy2009Sprouty). SPRY2's interaction with TESK1 inhibits its kinase activity, affecting cofilin phosphorylation, while DYRK1A phosphorylates SPRY2 at Thr75, impacting its function in ERK signaling (Guy2009Sprouty).

In cancer contexts, SPRY2 interacts with the MET receptor in rhabdomyosarcoma, stabilizing MET to maintain ERK/MAPK signaling, which is crucial for the migratory and clonogenic potential of cancer cells (Saini2018SPRY2). These interactions highlight SPRY2's role as a modulator of cellular signaling and its potential impact on cancer progression.
