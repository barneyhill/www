# ATP13A3

## Overview
ATP13A3 is a gene that encodes the ATPase 13A3 protein, a member of the P5B-ATPase family, which is involved in the transport of polyamines across cellular membranes. The ATPase 13A3 protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a pivotal role in the mammalian polyamine transport system, facilitating the uptake of essential polyamines such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. These polyamines are crucial for cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hamouda2021ATP13A3). ATP13A3 is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with the highest levels found in the liver, and is localized in early and recycling endosomes (Houdou2023Novel). The gene has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and cancer, underscoring its clinical significance (Sekhar2022ATP13A3; Machado2021Biallelic).

## Function
ATP13A3 is a P5B-ATPase that plays a critical role in the mammalian polyamine transport system, facilitating the uptake of polyamines such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine into cells. These polyamines are essential for various cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and their transport is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hamouda2021ATP13A3). ATP13A3 is ubiquitously expressed in humans, with the highest expression in the liver, and is localized in early and recycling endosomes, where it functions downstream of polyamine internalization via endocytosis (Houdou2023Novel).

The protein exhibits broad substrate specificity for polyamines and is involved in a two-step uptake mechanism that includes endocytosis followed by ATP13A3-mediated transport to the cytosol (Hamouda2021ATP13A3). ATP13A3 also protects cells against the toxicity of polyamine synthesis inhibitors by enhancing polyamine uptake, which is particularly important when endogenous polyamine synthesis is inhibited (Hamouda2021ATP13A3). In addition to its role in polyamine transport, ATP13A3 has been linked to pulmonary arterial hypertension and may have implications in cancer, highlighting its broader physiological relevance (Houdou2023Novel; Hamouda2021ATP13A3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP13A3 gene have been linked to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a condition characterized by high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs, leading to heart failure. Biallelic variants in ATP13A3 are associated with childhood-onset PAH, which is marked by extreme morbidity and mortality. These variants are often rare or absent in the general population and are predicted to be deleterious, affecting the gene's function as a cation transporter involved in polyamine transport (Machado2021Biallelic). The study of these variants suggests a dose-dependent relationship between ATP13A3 mutations and the severity of PAH, with affected children often being refractory to conventional treatments (Machado2021Biallelic).

In addition to PAH, altered expression of ATP13A3 has been implicated in cancer. High ATP13A3 expression is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer, as it facilitates the uptake of polyamines, which are essential for cell proliferation. This makes ATP13A3 a potential target for cancer therapies aimed at modulating polyamine uptake (Sekhar2022ATP13A3). The gene's role in polyamine transport and its altered expression in various cancers highlight its clinical significance.
