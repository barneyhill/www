# MANF

## Overview
Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The MANF protein is categorized as a neurotrophic factor and is involved in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR), thereby maintaining protein-folding homeostasis and supporting cell survival under stress conditions (Lindahl2017Unconventional; Kovaleva2020MANF). It is widely expressed in various tissues, including the brain and pancreas, and is particularly abundant in secretory cells. MANF's protective functions extend to influencing immune responses and promoting tissue repair by modulating macrophage phenotypes (Kim2017Mesencephalic). Clinically, mutations in the MANF gene are associated with several conditions, including type 2 diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in both metabolic and neurological health (Lindahl2017Unconventional; Sivakumar2023Mesencephalic).

## Structure
The MANF protein is characterized by a two-domain structure. The N-terminal domain is homologous to saposin-like proteins (SAPLIPs) and features a globular, highly α-helical structure with five α-helices and one 3_10 helix, stabilized by three disulfide bridges (Lindahl2017Unconventional; Hellman2011Mesencephalic). This domain forms a 'closed leaf' conformation with a hydrophobic core, similar to porcine NK-lysin and human granulysin (Lindahl2017Unconventional). The C-terminal domain is homologous to the SAP domain of Ku70 and contains three alpha helices, with a helix-loop-helix DNA binding motif (Lindahl2017Unconventional; Hellman2011Mesencephalic). This domain includes a CXXC motif, which forms a disulfide bridge crucial for its function (Lindström2013Characterization).

The MANF protein is monomeric in neutral solution and contains eight conserved cysteine residues forming four disulfide bridges (Lindahl2017Unconventional). It is not glycosylated when expressed and secreted from cells (Lindahl2017Unconventional). The protein's structure is flexible, with a linker between the two domains allowing freedom of orientation, which may be crucial for its function (Lindahl2017Unconventional). The intact full-length protein is necessary for its functional activity, as neither the N- nor C-terminal domains alone can rescue mutant phenotypes (Lindström2013Characterization).

## Function
Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). MANF is involved in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response related to the ER, by interacting with the ER-located receptor IRE1α. This interaction helps modulate IRE1α activity, reducing its oligomerization and phosphorylation, which are crucial for the activation of downstream signaling pathways (Kovaleva2020MANF).

In healthy human cells, MANF is widely expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, including the brain, pancreas, and salivary glands. It is particularly abundant in secretory cells, such as pancreatic beta cells, where it supports protein production and secretion (Lindahl2017Unconventional). MANF plays a protective role against ER stress, which is vital for the survival of insulin-producing beta cells, and is implicated in beta cell proliferation and survival (Lindahl2014MANF; Lindahl2017Unconventional).

MANF also influences immune responses by promoting a switch from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotypes, aiding in tissue repair and reducing inflammation through the inhibition of NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways (Kim2017Mesencephalic). Its expression is developmentally regulated, with higher levels observed shortly after birth, indicating its importance in early development and cellular function (Lindahl2017Unconventional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MANF gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions. Patients with homozygous mutations in MANF have been reported to exhibit type 2 diabetes, obesity, microcephaly, mild cognitive disability, short stature, hypothyroidism, and primary hypogonadism. These symptoms mirror those observed in MANF-deficient mice, which also show increased activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways in pancreatic beta cells, indicating a role in beta cell survival under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Lindahl2017Unconventional). 

Alterations in MANF expression are linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. In Parkinson's disease, MANF promotes the survival of dopamine neurons, and its overexpression has been shown to delay neurodegeneration in models of the disease (Sivakumar2023Mesencephalic). In Alzheimer's disease, MANF modulates the unfolded protein response and protects neurons from amyloid β-induced toxicity. MANF knockdown exacerbates amyloid β-mediated neurotoxicity, while its overexpression reduces UPR transducers, suggesting a protective role (Sivakumar2023Mesencephalic).

MANF is also implicated in diabetes, as its deficiency leads to severe insulin-dependent diabetes in mice due to reduced beta cell mass, linked to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of these cells (Lindahl2017Unconventional).

## Interactions
MANF (mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor) interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP (Binding Immunoglobulin Protein), specifically associating with BiP's nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) in its ADP-bound state. This interaction stabilizes the ADP-bound conformation of BiP, inhibiting both ADP release and ATP binding, which affects client protein release (Yan2019MANF). The binding of MANF to BiP is characterized by fast association and dissociation kinetics and is nucleotide-independent, suggesting a regulatory role in BiP's function (Yan2019MANF). MANF acts as a nucleotide exchange inhibitor, stabilizing BiP-client complexes and potentially enhancing protein-folding efficiency (Yan2019MANF).

MANF's interaction with BiP is further supported by its ability to counteract the stimulatory effect of the nucleotide exchange factor Grp170 on nucleotide release, indicating independent regulatory actions (Yan2019MANF). The interaction is characterized by charge complementarity and involves specific ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds between residues of MANF and BiP (Yan2019MANF). These interactions highlight MANF's role in regulating BiP's chaperone cycle and maintaining protein-folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum.
