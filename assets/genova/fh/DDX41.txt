# DDX41

## Overview
DDX41 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 41, a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases. This protein is primarily involved in RNA processing and plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating the innate immune response. DEAD-box helicase 41 functions as a sensor for intracellular nucleic acids, particularly recognizing cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) and interacting with the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to initiate immune responses. It is also implicated in the regulation of R-loop formation, RNA splicing, and transcriptional elongation, which are essential for genomic integrity and cellular function. Mutations in the DDX41 gene have been associated with hematological malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Mosler2021R-loop; Shinriki2022Unique; Kim2023Current).

## Function
DDX41 is a DEAD-box type RNA helicase that plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating the innate immune response in healthy human cells. It functions as a sensor for nucleic acids released from intracellular pathogens, recognizing cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) and interacting with the adaptor molecule STING to trigger a STING-dependent immune response. This interaction is crucial for the production of type I interferons, particularly IFN-β, upon DNA stimulation (Shinriki2022Unique; Zhang2011The).

In addition to its role in immune sensing, DDX41 is involved in the regulation of R-loop formation, which are structures consisting of DNA:RNA hybrids and single-stranded DNA. Excessive R-loop formation can lead to genomic instability. DDX41 helps prevent the accumulation of R-loops, thereby reducing genomic instability and replication stress. It can unwind RNA-DNA hybrids in vitro, supporting its role in R-loop regulation (Mosler2021R-loop).

DDX41 is also involved in RNA splicing and transcriptional elongation, processes essential for maintaining DNA replication integrity. It primarily binds to the 5' splice site of coding RNAs and interacts with mature ribosomal RNA, indicating its role in RNA biogenesis (Shinriki2022DDX41).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DDX41 gene are associated with several hematological malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Germline mutations in DDX41 are significant in myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition, accounting for about 80% of such cases. These mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with a notable male predominance (Kim2023Current). The most common germline variant is p.D140fs, while somatic mutations often occur at p.R525H, affecting the helicase domain's ATPase activity (Shinriki2022Unique). These mutations can lead to impaired RNA splicing and altered gene expression, contributing to cancer development (Cheah2017Myeloid).

DDX41 mutations are linked to low peripheral white blood cell counts, bone marrow hypoplasia, and a less differentiated tumor cell phenotype (Shinriki2022Unique). Patients with germline DDX41 variants may exhibit cytopenia and macrocytosis, potentially leading to a diagnosis of idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS) (Shinriki2022Unique). The presence of DDX41 variants in AML patients is linked to a better prognosis, including prolonged relapse-free survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Rolles2023DDX41). Treatment responses to conventional chemotherapy in AML patients with germline DDX41 variants are relatively good, but relapse rates are similar to those with wild-type DDX41 (Shinriki2022Unique).

## Interactions
DDX41 is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in immune responses and RNA processing. It binds directly to DNA through its DEADc domain, which is crucial for its function as a DNA sensor in the immune response. This interaction is specific to DNA, as DDX41 does not bind RNA, demonstrated by its lack of interaction with biotinylated poly(I:C) (Zhang2011The).

DDX41 interacts with the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a key adaptor protein in the DNA sensing pathway. This interaction is essential for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the activation of TBK1, NF-κB, and IRF3, which are involved in the production of type I interferons in response to cytosolic DNA (Zhang2011The). The DEADc domain of DDX41 is responsible for binding STING, and the interaction site on STING spans its second to fourth transmembrane domains (Zhang2011The).

DDX41 also interacts with components of the spliceosome, such as the NineTeen complex (NTC), which is crucial for spliceosome activation and reorganization. It binds to core NTC components like PRP19 and CDC5L, indicating a role in RNA splicing regulation (Shinriki2022DDX41).
