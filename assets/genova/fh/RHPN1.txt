# RHPN1

## Overview
RHPN1 is a gene that encodes the protein rhophilin Rho GTPase binding protein 1, which is a key player in the Rho GTPase signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a cytoplasmic signaling molecule that interacts with Rho GTPases, influencing the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The RHPN1 protein is integral to cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance, motility, and intracellular transport, which are essential for tissue development and repair. Its interactions with RhoA and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) facilitate the formation of actin stress fibers, impacting cell migration and adhesion. These functions are particularly significant in specialized cells like podocytes in the kidney, where RHPN1 helps maintain the filtration barrier, and in cancer cells, where it influences metastasis (Liu2020Rhophilin‐associated; Lal2015Rhophilin1).

## Function
RHPN1, or rhophilin Rho GTPase binding protein 1, is a protein involved in the Rho GTPase signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes. It interacts with Rho proteins, playing a significant role in the organization of the cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape and motility. RHPN1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the maintenance of cellular architecture and facilitates intracellular transport. These activities are vital for tissue development and repair, as they ensure proper cell function and structural integrity.

In healthy human cells, RHPN1's interaction with Rho GTPases influences the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, impacting processes such as cell migration and adhesion. This regulation is critical for the proper functioning of podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney that are essential for glomerular filtration. The protein's role in cytoskeletal regulation is crucial for maintaining the filtration barrier in the kidneys, highlighting its importance in renal physiology. The molecular activities of RHPN1, through its binding to Rho GTPases, underscore its role in cellular and organismal homeostasis, particularly in tissues requiring dynamic structural changes (Lal2015Rhophilin1).

## Interactions
RHPN1 (rhophilin Rho GTPase binding protein 1) is known to interact with RhoA, a member of the Rho GTPase family, which plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. This interaction is facilitated by Rhophilin-associated tail protein 1 (ROPN1), which acts as an adaptor protein, linking RHPN1 to RhoA signaling pathways. The interaction between RHPN1 and RhoA is essential for the activation of RhoA and the subsequent formation of actin stress fibers, which are critical for cell migration and metastasis, particularly in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Liu2020Rhophilin‐associated).

RHPN1 also interacts with Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), an effector of RhoA, to regulate the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction enhances the motility of cancer cells by promoting the formation of actin stress fibers (Liu2020Rhophilin‐associated). The disruption of RHPN1's interaction with ROPN1 and RhoA, such as through the silencing of RHPN1, can inhibit RhoA activation and actin fiber formation, thereby reducing cell motility and metastasis (Liu2020Rhophilin‐associated). These interactions highlight the role of RHPN1 in modulating cellular functions through its involvement in RhoA signaling pathways.
