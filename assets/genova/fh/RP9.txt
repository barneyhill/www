# RP9

## Overview
The RP9 gene encodes the RP9 pre-mRNA splicing factor, a protein integral to the pre-mRNA splicing process, which is a vital component of posttranscriptional gene regulation in mammalian cells. This protein is a part of the spliceosome, specifically involved in the assembly and disassembly of the U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP complex, which is crucial for spliceosome assembly and activation (Lv2017Targeted; Yang2021Pre-mRNA). The RP9 protein localizes to the nuclear splicing factor compartment and interacts with various splicing factors, including Prpf3, playing a significant role in the splicing activity both in vitro and in vivo (Růžičková2016Mutations). Mutations in the RP9 gene are linked to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative retinal disease, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in maintaining retinal function and overall cellular health (Lv2017Targeted; Keen2002Mutations).

## Function
The RP9 gene, also known as PAP-1, encodes a protein involved in the pre-mRNA splicing process, a critical step in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells. This protein is part of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts, facilitating the production of mature mRNA molecules that are translated into proteins (Lv2017Targeted; Yang2021Pre-mRNA). RP9 is specifically associated with the assembly and disassembly of the U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP, a dynamic complex essential for spliceosome assembly and catalytic activation (Lv2017Targeted).

RP9 localizes to the nuclear splicing factor compartment, where it interacts with various splicing factors, including Prpf3, a U4/U6 snRNP-specific protein (Růžičková2016Mutations). Although its exact role in splicing is not fully understood, RP9 exhibits splicing activity both in vitro and in vivo (Růžičková2016Mutations). The protein's function is crucial for maintaining normal cellular function and organismal development, as it ensures the proper splicing of pre-mRNA, which is particularly important in cells with high splicing demands, such as retinal cells (Yang2021Pre-mRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RP9 gene are associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a degenerative eye disease characterized by progressive vision loss, night blindness, and retinal degeneration. Two specific amino acid substitutions, His137Leu and Asp170Gly, have been linked to this condition. The His137Leu mutation was identified in a family with RP9, affecting 47 members, while the Asp170Gly mutation was found in a single RP patient (Keen2002Mutations). These mutations are thought to disrupt the normal splicing processes in photoreceptor cells, contributing to retinal degeneration (Lv2017Targeted).

The RP9 protein interacts with the Pim-1 kinase and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, particularly affecting the splicing of photoreceptor-specific genes such as FSCN2. Mutations in RP9 can lead to decreased cell proliferation and migration, as well as down-regulation of genes associated with retinal function (Lv2017Targeted). The exact role of RP9 in splicing remains unclear, but the Asp170Gly variant has shown splicing defects, suggesting a potential mechanism for its involvement in adRP (Růžičková2016Mutations). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RP9 mutations in retinal diseases.
