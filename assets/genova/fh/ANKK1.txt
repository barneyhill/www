# ANKK1

## Overview
The ANKK1 gene encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1, which is a member of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase family. This protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat and kinase domains, which are crucial for its role in signal transduction and cellular processes such as survival, death, and differentiation (Neville2004Identification). ANKK1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it is involved in neurodevelopment and neurogenesis, particularly in neural progenitor cells and adult neurogenic regions (EspañaSerrano2016The). The protein's ability to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus suggests its function as a signal transducer (Garrido2010The). Variants of the ANKK1 gene have been associated with neuropsychiatric and behavioral conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in the dopaminergic system and its potential role in disorders such as addiction and schizophrenia (Ma2014Updated; Dubertret2010A).

## Structure
The ANKK1 protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat and kinase domains, which are integral to its function in signal transduction. The primary structure of ANKK1 includes a predicted length of 765 amino acids, with similarities to the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase family, particularly RIP4, featuring an N-terminal kinase domain and C-terminal ankyrin repeats (Hoenicka2010The). The ANKK1-kinase isoform contains the RIP kinase domain, which is highly conserved across species such as humans, mice, and rats, indicating its evolutionary importance (Hoenicka2010The).

The ANKK1 protein exists in multiple isoforms, including ANKK1, ANKK1-kinase, and ANKK1-ankyrin. ANKK1-kinase contains only the RIP kinase domain, while ANKK1-ankyrin includes only the ankyrin repeat domain (Hoenicka2010The). The ANKK1-kinase domain spans residues 22-289 and includes putative phosphorylation sites, with the Ala239Thr polymorphism within this domain potentially creating an additional phosphorylation site (Garrido2010The).

Post-translational modifications are suggested by the presence of 49- to 67-kDa bands in Western blot analysis, which may result from such modifications (Hoenicka2010The). The ANKK1-kinase isoform is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, supported by nuclear localization signals and nuclear export sequences, indicating its role in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Garrido2010The).

## Function
The ANKK1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase family, which plays a role in cell survival, death, and differentiation across various tissues (Neville2004Identification). ANKK1 is involved in signal transduction pathways and contains ankyrin repeats and a kinase domain, suggesting its role in phosphorylation processes (Neville2004Identification). The protein is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating it may shuttle between these compartments as a signal transducer (Garrido2010The).

ANKK1 is differentially expressed during neurodevelopment, particularly in neural progenitor cells, and is involved in cell cycle regulation, especially during the G1 and M phases (EspañaSerrano2016The). It is expressed in neural stem cells and their progeny in the adult brain, particularly in areas associated with adult neurogenesis, such as the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) (EspañaSerrano2016The). ANKK1's expression is influenced by dopaminergic treatment, such as apomorphine, which suggests a role in dopaminergic signaling pathways (Garrido2010The). The gene's expression pattern and its involvement in cell cycle dynamics indicate its potential role in neurogenesis and brain structure development (EspañaSerrano2016The).

## Clinical Significance
The ANKK1 gene is associated with several neuropsychiatric and behavioral conditions, primarily through its influence on the dopaminergic system. Variants in ANKK1, such as the TaqIA polymorphism, have been linked to altered dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) expression, which affects susceptibility to addictions, including nicotine and alcohol dependence (Ma2014Updated; Ponce2009The). The A1 allele of TaqIA is associated with reduced DRD2 availability, contributing to addiction vulnerability (Ma2014Updated).

ANKK1 variants are also implicated in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. The SNP rs1800497 in ANKK1 shows a significant association with schizophrenia, particularly in patients with specific genotypes (Dubertret2010A). Additionally, ANKK1 variants may interact with DRD2 genotypes to influence psychopathic traits in alcoholic patients (Ponce2008DRD2).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), rare variants in ANKK1, particularly in regulatory regions, have been identified as potential risk factors. These variants can affect gene regulation and dopaminergic response, contributing to PD vulnerability (PérezSantamarina2021Regulatory). The rs7107223 SNV in the ANKK1 enhancer region is notably associated with increased PD risk (PérezSantamarina2021Regulatory).
