# FXYD4

## Overview
FXYD4 is a gene that encodes the protein FXYD domain containing ion transport regulator 4, also known as the corticosteroid hormone-induced factor (CHIF). This protein is a member of the FXYD family, which is characterized by a conserved FXYD motif crucial for its interaction with the Na,K-ATPase enzyme complex. FXYD4 is a type I single-span transmembrane protein, playing a significant role in modulating the activity of Na,K-ATPase, an enzyme essential for maintaining sodium and potassium ion gradients across the plasma membrane. This modulation is particularly important in epithelial tissues such as the kidney and distal colon, where it influences sodium reabsorption and overall electrolyte balance (Garty2006ROLE; Geering2008Functional). The protein's interaction with Na,K-ATPase affects the enzyme's ion affinities and stability, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and ion transport regulation (Geering2005Function).

## Structure
FXYD4, also known as the corticosteroid hormone-induced factor (CHIF), is a member of the FXYD protein family, characterized by a conserved FXYD motif. This motif includes phenylalanine, tyrosine, and aspartic acid, which are essential for structural interaction with Na,K-ATPase (Garty2006ROLE). The primary structure of FXYD4 consists of a single transmembrane segment, with marked homology in a stretch of 35 amino acids around this domain (Garty2006ROLE). 

In terms of secondary structure, FXYD4 is a type I single-span membrane protein, featuring an extracellular N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminus. The transmembrane segment is likely to form an alpha helix, with conserved residues preferentially located on one face of the helix (Garty2006ROLE). 

The tertiary structure of FXYD4 is stabilized by interactions within the transmembrane domain, which is crucial for its association with Na,K-ATPase. The quaternary structure involves its interaction with the α/β complex of Na,K-ATPase, affecting the enzyme's affinity for sodium and potassium ions (Geering2005Function). 

FXYD4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including the cleavage of a signal peptide in the mature protein (Garty2006ROLE). These structural features enable FXYD4 to modulate Na,K-ATPase activity, particularly in tissues like the kidney and distal colon (Geering2008Functional).

## Function
FXYD4, also known as the corticosteroid hormone-induced factor (CHIF), is a member of the FXYD protein family that modulates the activity of the Na,K-ATPase pump, a crucial enzyme for maintaining sodium and potassium gradients across the plasma membrane. This modulation is essential for cellular homeostasis and ion balance in epithelial tissues, particularly in the kidney and distal colon (Garty2006ROLE; Geering2008Functional).

In the kidney, FXYD4 increases the sodium affinity of Na,K-ATPase, which is important for sodium reabsorption in specific nephron segments. This function is vital for maintaining electrolyte balance and fluid regulation in the body. Despite the absence of FXYD4, mice do not exhibit impaired renal function, suggesting the presence of compensatory mechanisms. However, FXYD4-deficient mice show impaired colonic sodium transport, highlighting its physiological relevance in sodium regulation in the colon (Geering2008Functional).

FXYD4 is a type I single-span membrane protein with an extracellular N terminus and a cytoplasmic C terminus. It interacts structurally with Na,K-ATPase, affecting its kinetic properties, such as ion affinities and enzyme stability, which are crucial for the homeostasis of cation balance in epithelial cells (Garty2006ROLE).

## Interactions
FXYD4, also known as the corticosteroid hormone-induced factor (CHIF), is a member of the FXYD family of proteins that interact with the Na,K-ATPase enzyme complex. FXYD4 specifically associates with the α1-β complexes of Na,K-ATPase, both in the kidney and after coexpression in oocytes (Geering2005Function). This interaction is facilitated by the FXYD motif, which is essential for the stable association with Na,K-ATPase (Garty2006ROLE). 

FXYD4 modulates the apparent affinity of Na,K-ATPase for intracellular Na+ ions, increasing it twofold, which is significant for Na+ reabsorption in the renal collecting duct (Geering2005Function). The interaction between FXYD4 and Na,K-ATPase is characterized by specific structural interactions, with positively charged residues in the cytoplasmic domain playing a crucial role in the functional effects of FXYD4 (Geering2005Function). 

In the kidney, FXYD4 and the γ-subunit of Na,K-ATPase are expressed in different nephron segments, forming distinct complexes such as α/β/CHIF, without forming mixed complexes (Garty2002A). This specificity suggests that FXYD4 acts as a tissue-specific modulator of Na,K-ATPase, adapting its kinetic properties to the physiological needs of different tissues (Garty2006ROLE).
