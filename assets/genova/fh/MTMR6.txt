# MTMR6

## Overview
MTMR6 is a gene that encodes the myotubularin-related protein 6, a member of the myotubularin family of phosphatases. This protein is characterized by its ability to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), playing a crucial role in phosphoinositide signaling pathways (Robinson2006Myotubularin). Myotubularin-related protein 6 is particularly significant in the regulation of calcium-activated potassium channels, specifically the KCa3.1 channel, which is involved in various cellular processes such as T-cell activation and proliferation (Robinson2006Myotubularin; Srivastava2005The). The protein's structure includes a pleckstrin homology/GRAM domain, a phosphatase domain, and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its localization to the plasma membrane and its interaction with target proteins (Choudhury2006Specificity; Srivastava2005The). Through these interactions, MTMR6 exerts its regulatory effects, contributing to the maintenance of immune system balance and potentially preventing autoimmune diseases (Robinson2006Myotubularin).

## Structure
MTMR6 is a member of the myotubularin family of phosphatases, characterized by specific structural domains that contribute to its function. The protein contains a pleckstrin homology/GRAM (PH/G) domain, a phosphatase domain, and a coiled-coil (CC) domain. The PH/G domain is crucial for the localization of MTMR6 to the plasma membrane and plays a role in its interaction with phosphoinositides, although it binds with low affinity (Choudhury2006Specificity). The phosphatase domain is responsible for dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and PI(3,5)P2, which is essential for the inhibition of the KCa3.1 potassium channel (Choudhury2006Specificity; Srivastava2005The).

The CC domain of MTMR6 is involved in protein-protein interactions, specifically with the KCa3.1 channel, and is necessary for the inhibition of this channel (Srivastava2005The). The interaction between the CC domain of MTMR6 and KCa3.1 is critical for the channel's regulation, highlighting the domain's role in target specificity (Srivastava2005The). MTMR6 may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and interactions (Srivastava2005The).

## Function
MTMR6 (myotubularin related protein 6) is a phosphatase involved in the regulation of phosphoinositide signaling pathways, primarily by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) (Robinson2006Myotubularin). In healthy human cells, MTMR6 plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of calcium-activated potassium channels, specifically the KCa3.1 channel. This channel is important for regulating membrane potential and is involved in various cellular processes, including T-cell activation and proliferation (Robinson2006Myotubularin; Srivastava2005The).

MTMR6 inhibits the KCa3.1 channel by decreasing the local levels of PtdIns3P, which is necessary for the channel's activity. This inhibition is mediated through a coiled-coil interaction between MTMR6 and the channel, highlighting the specificity of MTMR6's regulatory function (Srivastava2005The). The activity of MTMR6 is localized to the plasma membrane adjacent to KCa3.1, allowing for selective dephosphorylation of PtdIns3P in the vicinity of the channel (Srivastava2005The).

The regulation of KCa3.1 by MTMR6 is significant for maintaining immune system balance, as it sets a threshold for stimulus-dependent T-cell activation, potentially preventing autoimmune diseases (Robinson2006Myotubularin).

## Interactions
MTMR6 interacts with the Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3.1, acting as a negative regulator by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), which is necessary for the channel's activity. This interaction is facilitated by the coiled-coil (CC) domains of both MTMR6 and KCa3.1, allowing MTMR6 to localize near the channel and exert its inhibitory effect (Srivastava2006Phosphatidylinositol3; Srivastava2005The). The inhibition of KCa3.1 by MTMR6 is specific and requires both the CC and phosphatase domains of MTMR6 (Srivastava2005The).

MTMR6 also forms heteromeric interactions with inactive MTMR9/STYX, which can lead to increased catalytic activity, relocalization, and modified substrate specificity (gegenschatz2012structural). These interactions highlight the functional significance and potential tissue-specific regulation of MTMR6. The interaction with MTMR9 is an example of how MTMR6 can participate in complex regulatory networks within the cell (gegenschatz2012structural).

MTMR6 does not inhibit all SK channels, as it does not affect KCa2.2 channel activity, indicating a selective interaction with KCa3.1 (Srivastava2005The). This specificity underscores the precise regulatory role MTMR6 plays in cellular signaling pathways.
