# HARS1

## Overview
Histidyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (HARS1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme histidyl-tRNA synthetase 1, a member of the class IIa aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. This enzyme is crucial for protein synthesis, facilitating the attachment of histidine to its corresponding tRNA, a process known as aminoacylation. HARS1 is ubiquitously expressed in the cytoplasm, underscoring its essential role in cellular viability and protein homeostasis (Vester2012A; Galatolo2020Bi‐allelic). Beyond its primary function in translation, HARS1 is involved in immune modulation, particularly in regulating T-cell activation and cytokine release (Adams2019Serumcirculating). Mutations in the HARS1 gene have been linked to several neuropathies, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and Usher syndrome type IIIB, highlighting its clinical significance (Mullen2020Neuropathy‐associated; Wilhelm2023Towards).

## Structure
Histidyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (HARS1) is a homodimeric protein composed of 509 amino acids, featuring a catalytic domain essential for its aminoacylation function and an anticodon-binding domain (Adams2019Serumcirculating). The protein also contains a WHEP domain, a flexible helix-turn-helix motif located at the N-terminal end, which is not required for its aminoacylation activity (Adams2019Serumcirculating). 

The catalytic domain of HARS1 is crucial for its enzymatic activity, facilitating the attachment of histidine to its corresponding tRNA. This domain is the site of several mutations associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2W (CMT2W) and hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN), which can lead to structural changes and affect the protein's function (Kalotay2023Dominant). 

HARS1 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions within the cell (Mullen2020Neuropathy‐associated). The protein's ability to form dimers is an aspect of its quaternary structure, which remains unaffected by certain disease-associated mutations (Kalotay2023Dominant). 

Splice variant isoforms of HARS1 contribute to its structural and functional diversity, potentially affecting its role in cellular processes (Adams2019Serumcirculating).

## Function
Histidyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (HARS1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of the amino acid histidine to its corresponding tRNA. This process, known as aminoacylation, is essential for the accurate translation of genetic information into proteins, ensuring that histidine is correctly incorporated during protein synthesis (Vester2012A; Galatolo2020Bi‐allelic). HARS1 functions as a homodimeric class IIa aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and is ubiquitously expressed in the cytoplasm of cells, reflecting its fundamental role in cellular viability and protein homeostasis (Vester2012A; Galatolo2020Bi‐allelic).

In addition to its canonical role in protein synthesis, HARS1 has been implicated in immune modulation. It is involved in regulating immune cell activation, particularly inhibiting T-cell activation and cytokine release, which suggests a role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Adams2019Serumcirculating). The enzyme's activity is crucial for normal cellular functions, especially in cells with specialized protein synthesis requirements, such as neurons (Mullen2020Neuropathy‐associated). Disruptions in HARS1 function can lead to various disorders, highlighting its importance in both cellular and organismal health (Galatolo2020Bi‐allelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HARS1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the peripheral nervous system. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary neuropathy, is linked to various HARS1 mutations, including V133F, V155G, Y330C, and S356N. These mutations lead to reduced aminoacylation activity, protein mistranslation, and accumulation of insoluble proteins, contributing to neuropathy by disrupting axonal structure and neurite outgrowth (Qiu2022Histidine; Mullen2020Neuropathy‐associated). The dominant negative mechanism, where mutant HARS1 proteins form heterodimers with wild-type proteins, further impairs function, exacerbating the disease phenotype (Mullen2020Neuropathy‐associated).

Usher syndrome type IIIB (USH3B) is another condition associated with HARS1 mutations, specifically the Y454S variant. This mutation is characterized by progressive hearing and vision loss, with symptoms often worsening during febrile illnesses due to the mutation's thermolability (Qiu2022Histidine; Wilhelm2023Towards). Histidine supplementation has been explored as a potential treatment for USH3B, as it may rescue the thermal instability of the Y454S mutation, although its efficacy varies depending on the specific mutation (Qiu2022Histidine).

## Interactions
Histidyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (HARS1) is known to participate in several interactions that influence its function and contribute to disease mechanisms. HARS1 forms stable homodimers and can also dimerize with wild-type HARS1, which is crucial for its function in protein synthesis. This dimerization capability is maintained even in neuropathy-associated variants, such as those linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, suggesting that these mutations do not impair the ability to form dimers (Mullen2020Neuropathy‐associated).

The interaction between mutant and wild-type HARS1 proteins is proposed to contribute to a dominant negative mechanism underlying CMT pathology. Mutant HARS1 proteins can form heterodimers with wild-type proteins, potentially interfering with their function and leading to reduced protein synthesis, particularly in neurons (Mullen2020Neuropathy‐associated). This interaction is significant in cell types with specialized protein synthesis requirements, such as neurons, where it can lead to neurite outgrowth defects and axonal guidance issues (Mullen2020Neuropathy‐associated).

HARS1 also interacts with nucleic acids, specifically tRNA, as part of its role in aminoacylation, attaching histidine to its corresponding tRNA. This interaction is essential for maintaining proper protein synthesis and cellular function (Wilhelm2023Towards).
