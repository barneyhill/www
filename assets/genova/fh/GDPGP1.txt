# GDPGP1

## Overview
GDPGP1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme GDP-D-glucose phosphorylase 1, which is involved in carbohydrate metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a phosphorylase and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of GDP-D-glucose to D-glucose 1-phosphate and GDP, a reaction crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis within cells. GDP-D-glucose phosphorylase 1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in energy regulation and storage, impacting overall metabolic processes. In neuronal cells, the enzyme is particularly important under metabolic stress conditions, where it helps maintain glycogen levels, thus providing cytoprotective effects against stressors such as hypoxia (Singhal2020Neuronal).

## Structure


## Function
GDPGP1, also known as GDP-D-glucose phosphorylase 1, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of GDP-D-glucose to D-glucose 1-phosphate and GDP. This reaction is significant for maintaining glucose homeostasis within cells. The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to energy regulation and storage, impacting overall metabolic processes (Singhal2020Neuronal).

In neuronal cells, GDPGP1 is particularly important under conditions of metabolic stress. It helps protect neurons by maintaining glycogen levels, which are essential for stress resistance. The enzyme's activity is cytoprotective, meaning it aids in safeguarding neurons from stressors such as hypoxia. However, under stress conditions, the expression of GDPGP1 is reduced, leading to decreased glycogen levels and increased neuronal vulnerability (Singhal2020Neuronal).

The role of GDPGP1 in neurons highlights its importance in the broader context of neuronal metabolism and stress responses. Its function in glycogen metabolism suggests that it may have a protective role, challenging the traditional view of glycogen as neurotoxic in neurons (Singhal2020Neuronal).
