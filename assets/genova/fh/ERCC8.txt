# ERCC8

## Overview
The ERCC8 gene encodes the Cockayne syndrome group A (CSA) protein, which is a crucial component of the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway. This pathway is vital for repairing DNA damage that impedes transcription, particularly lesions on the transcribed strands of active genes. The CSA protein is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, characterized by its WD40 repeat motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions necessary for DNA repair processes. These interactions include forming complexes with proteins such as CSB, DDB1, and UVSSA, which are essential for the recognition and repair of DNA lesions. Mutations in the ERCC8 gene are linked to Cockayne syndrome, a disorder marked by growth failure, neurological degeneration, and photosensitivity, underscoring the gene's significance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis (Duong2022Cockayne; Taghdiri2017A; Saijo2013The).

## Structure
The ERCC8 gene encodes the CSA protein, a 44-kDa protein consisting of 396 amino acids, located on chromosome 5q12.1 (Wang2017Molecular; Xie2017A). The protein is characterized by seven WD40 repeat motifs, which are crucial for its function. These motifs typically end with a Trp-Asp (WD) dipeptide and are involved in forming beta propeller structures that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Gauhar2022A; Laugel2010Mutation). The WD40 domains are highly conserved and play a significant role in the protein's structural integrity and function, particularly in DNA repair processes (Zhang2019Homozygosity; Duong2022Cockayne).

The CSA protein is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which includes interactions with DDB1, Cullin 4A, and Roc1, and exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity (Wang2017Molecular; Gauhar2022A). This complex is essential for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), where CSA cooperates with CSB to recruit necessary repair proteins (Wang2017Molecular). The protein's structure also includes a helix-loop-helix motif and seven well-ordered WD40 propellers, contributing to its functional architecture (Wang2017Molecular).

## Function
The ERCC8 gene encodes the Cockayne syndrome group A (CSA) protein, which plays a crucial role in the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway. This pathway is essential for repairing DNA damage, particularly lesions that block transcription on the transcribed strands of active genes. The CSA protein is part of a protein complex with ubiquitin ligase activity, which includes DDB1, cullin 4A, and Roc1, and is involved in the recognition and repair of DNA lesions that stall RNA polymerase II during transcription (Wang2017Molecular; Saijo2013The).

The CSA protein contains multiple WD40 repeat motifs, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions and the formation of a beta-propeller structure. These motifs facilitate the CSA protein's interactions with other proteins, such as CSB, DDB1, and UVSSA, forming distinct protein complexes necessary for the repair process (Saijo2013The). In healthy human cells, the CSA protein is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of TC-NER proteins once repair is completed, maintaining genomic stability and preventing premature aging and other symptoms associated with Cockayne syndrome (Duong2022Cockayne). The CSA protein is active in the cell nucleus, where it ensures the integrity of transcriptional processes and cellular homeostasis (Taghdiri2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ERCC8 gene, also known as CSA, are primarily associated with Cockayne syndrome (CS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth failure, neurological degeneration, and photosensitivity. CS is linked to defective nucleotide excision repair (NER) of oxidized genomic DNA, leading to symptoms such as early-onset neurodegeneration, microcephaly, and developmental delay (Yousefipour2021Identification; Taghdiri2017A). The ERCC8 gene encodes the CSA protein, which is crucial for transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER), a pathway essential for maintaining genomic integrity by repairing DNA damage in active genes (Taghdiri2017A).

Several mutations in ERCC8 have been identified, including a novel homozygous duplication mutation (c.317_320dupAGTG, p.Trp107Ter) and a splicing variant (c.481 + 1G > A), both of which contribute to the clinical manifestations of CS (Yousefipour2021Identification). Another study identified a deep intronic variation, c.173+1119G>C, which causes the insertion of a cryptic exon in the ERCC8 transcript, leading to frameshifting and a premature termination codon (Schalk2018Deep).

In addition to CS, a novel missense mutation in ERCC8, c.176T>C (p.M59T), has been associated with autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA) in a consanguineous Pakistani family, highlighting the gene's role in other neurological disorders (Gauhar2022A).

## Interactions
The ERCC8 gene encodes the CSA protein, which is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions essential for DNA repair processes. CSA is a component of a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase complex that includes Cullin4A and Roc1, interacting through DNA damage binding protein 1 (DDB1). This complex is responsible for the degradation of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) proteins, facilitating the resumption of transcription (Aamann2013Multiple). CSA interacts with the CSB protein, leading to CSB's ubiquitinylation and degradation by the proteasome in a UV-dependent manner. This interaction is stabilized by the presence of the COP9 signalosome complex (Groisman2006CSA-dependent).

CSA also interacts with UVSSA, which is crucial for stabilizing CSB after UV irradiation and recruiting the UVSSA-USP7 complex to CSB and RNA Pol II in UV-irradiated chromatin (Aamann2013Multiple). Additionally, CSA forms a complex with RNA polymerase II and XAB2, which is important for chromatin recruitment during transcriptional stalling (Aamann2013Multiple). CSA's interactions extend to p53 and Mdm2, facilitating p53 ubiquitination, which is essential for its regulation (Aamann2013Multiple). These interactions highlight CSA's role in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis.
