# UGT2A3

## Overview
UGT2A3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member A3, which is part of the UDP-glycosyltransferase superfamily. This enzyme is involved in the glucuronidation process, a critical phase II metabolic pathway that enhances the solubility and excretion of lipophilic substances, including bile acids and various drugs. UGT2A3 is primarily expressed in the small intestine, colon, liver, and adipose tissue, with the highest expression levels in the small intestine, indicating its significant role in gastrointestinal metabolism and detoxification (Court2008Novel; GotohSaito2019Characterization). The enzyme's activity is regulated by the pregnane X receptor (PXR) ligand rifampicin, which can induce its expression, highlighting its potential role in drug metabolism (Court2008Novel). UGT2A3's function is particularly important in conditions like cholestatic liver disease, where it aids in detoxifying and eliminating toxic bile acids (Court2008Novel). Additionally, alterations in UGT2A3 expression or mutations have been implicated in various cancers, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Hu2022The).

## Structure
The UGT2A3 protein is a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, which plays a crucial role in drug metabolism. The primary structure of UGT2A3 consists of 527 amino acids, encoded by the UGT2A3 gene located on chromosome 4q13 (Court2008Novel). The protein has a nascent size of 60.3 kDa, which reduces to approximately 57.7 kDa after cleavage of an N-terminal signal peptide (Court2008Novel). 

UGT2A3 is predicted to have a GT-B fold, a common structural motif in the glycosyltransferase 1 (GT1) family, to which it belongs (Fujiwara2016Structure). This fold is characterized by two Rossmann-like domains that facilitate the binding of UDP-glucuronic acid, a key substrate in the glucuronidation process. The protein is also known to undergo N-glycosylation at Asn-131 and Asn-313, which is important for proper protein folding and enzymatic function (GotohSaito2019Characterization).

UGT2A3 forms part of a cluster of genes encoding UGT2B and UGT2A isoforms, and it shares 62% amino acid sequence identity with UGT2A2 (GotohSaito2019Characterization). The protein is expressed in various tissues, with higher levels in the intestine and kidney compared to the liver (GotohSaito2019Characterization).

## Function
UGT2A3 (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2A3) is an enzyme involved in the glucuronidation process, a critical phase II metabolic pathway that enhances the solubility and excretion of lipophilic substances. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of glucuronic acid to various substrates, including bile acids such as hyodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and ursodeoxycholic acid, facilitating their detoxification and elimination from the body (Court2008Novel; GotohSaito2019Characterization).

UGT2A3 is primarily expressed in the small intestine, colon, liver, and adipose tissue, with the highest expression levels observed in the small intestine. This distribution suggests a significant role in the metabolism and clearance of bile acids within the gastrointestinal tract (Court2008Novel; GotohSaito2019Characterization). The enzyme is also expressed in the kidney and other tissues, indicating its involvement in broader detoxification processes (GotohSaito2019Characterization).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by the pregnane X receptor (PXR) ligand rifampicin, which can induce its expression in intestinal cells, highlighting its potential role in drug metabolism (Court2008Novel). UGT2A3's function in glucuronidating bile acids is particularly important in conditions like cholestatic liver disease, where it aids in detoxifying and eliminating toxic bile acids (Court2008Novel).

## Clinical Significance
UGT2A3, a member of the UDP-glycosyltransferase superfamily, plays a significant role in drug metabolism and detoxification processes. Alterations in the expression or mutations of UGT2A3 can have clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In various human cancers, mutations in UGT2A3 have been identified, with over 70% being missense, nonsense, or small indel mutations that can lead to amino acid substitutions or truncated proteins. These mutations may alter the enzyme's normal function, potentially impacting cancer development or progression (Hu2022The). The presence of numerous mutations in cancer samples suggests a potential role in oncogenesis or tumor progression (Hu2022The).

UGT2A3 is expressed in tissues associated with drug metabolism, such as the liver, kidney, and intestine. Changes in its expression can influence cancer progression and treatment resistance. For instance, high expression of related UGT family members, like UGT2B17, is associated with poorer prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia due to its role in drug resistance (Liu2023The). Although specific clinical implications of UGT2A3 mutations or expression alterations are not detailed, the gene's involvement in drug metabolism suggests it could serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target in cancer prognosis (Hu2022The).
