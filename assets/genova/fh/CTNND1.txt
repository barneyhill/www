# CTNND1

## Overview
CTNND1 is a gene that encodes the protein catenin delta 1, also known as p120-catenin, which is a member of the catenin superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion and signaling, primarily through its interactions with cadherins at adherens junctions. Catenin delta 1 is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for maintaining cellular architecture and signaling pathways. The protein functions as a scaffolding molecule, influencing cell motility, invasion, and transcriptional regulation by interacting with various cellular components, including the GTPase RhoA and the transcriptional repressor Kaiso. CTNND1 is involved in critical cellular processes, such as maintaining epithelial tissue integrity and regulating dendritic spine morphogenesis in neurons. Mutations in CTNND1 have been linked to several hereditary syndromes and cancers, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Alharatani2020Novel; HerreraPariente2024CTNND1; Ishiyama2010Dynamic).

## Structure
CTNND1 encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and signaling. The protein is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeats, which are essential for mediating protein-protein interactions. These repeats contribute to the protein's ability to interact with other cellular components, facilitating its role in cellular signaling pathways. The armadillo repeat domain is a prominent structural feature that influences the protein's tertiary structure by promoting a stable, elongated conformation conducive to binding interactions.

CTNND1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its activity and interactions. These modifications are critical for the dynamic regulation of the protein's function in response to cellular signals. The gene also produces multiple splice variants, which may lead to differences in the protein's structure and function. These isoforms can potentially alter the protein's interaction capabilities and its role in cellular processes, reflecting the complexity and versatility of CTNND1 in cellular dynamics. The presence of these splice variants underscores the gene's adaptability and its potential involvement in diverse cellular contexts.

## Function
The CTNND1 gene encodes the p120-catenin protein, which is integral to maintaining cell-cell adhesion and signaling in healthy human cells. p120-catenin is a member of the catenin superfamily and interacts with the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) of E-cadherin, a key component of adherens junctions (AJs) in epithelial cells. This interaction stabilizes the cadherin-catenin complex at the cell surface, preventing E-cadherin endocytosis and maintaining cell adhesion (Kievit2018Variants; Ishiyama2010Dynamic). 

p120-catenin also functions as a scaffolding protein for the GTPase RhoA and associated regulatory proteins, influencing cell motility and invasion through cytoskeletal and transcriptional events (Alharatani2019Novel). It interacts with the transcriptional repressor Kaiso, facilitating Wnt signal transduction, and is involved in regulating dendritic spine morphogenesis in neurons through its interaction with N-cadherin (Ishiyama2010Dynamic). 

In epithelial tissues, p120-catenin is crucial for maintaining a tight and polarized cell layer, necessary for barrier and transport functions. Its loss or mislocalization is linked to tumor development and progression, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing cancerous growths (Kievit2018Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTNND1 gene, which encodes the protein p120-catenin, are associated with several hereditary syndromes and conditions. These include a dominant craniofacial and cardiac syndrome characterized by features such as narrow up-slanting palpebral fissures, hooded eyelids, and telecanthus, as well as congenital choanal atresia and cleft palate (Alharatani2020Novel). CTNND1 mutations are also linked to Blepharocheilodontic syndrome (BCDS), which presents with features like distichiasis, ectropion, and euryblepharon (Kievit2018Variants). 

In addition to craniofacial and cardiac anomalies, CTNND1 variants have been implicated in early-onset gastric cancer (EOGC). These variants can disrupt cell-to-cell adhesion by affecting the cadherin/catenin complex, leading to altered cell interactions and morphological changes (HerreraPariente2024CTNND1). 

CTNND1 is also associated with non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NS-CL/P). Variants in CTNND1 can lead to mRNA nonsense-mediated decay and haploinsufficiency, affecting the interaction with E-cadherin, which is crucial for epithelial adhesion and the fusion of the lip and palate (Cox2018Mutations).

## Interactions
CTNND1, also known as catenin delta 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with E-cadherin through a juxtamembrane domain, stabilizing adherens junctions crucial for maintaining epithelial tissue integrity (Lu2010δ‐Catenin). CTNND1 also interacts with β-catenin and is part of the adherens junction complex, which includes classical cadherins and α-catenin (Tang2016Overexpression). 

In pancreatic cancer, CTNND1 interacts with several proteins, including MLLT4, SRC, RHOA, CDH2, CDH5, CDH17, CTNNB1, ZBTB33, CDH1, and PLEKHA7, suggesting its role in cell adhesion and signaling processes (Huang2022Catenin). In hepatocellular carcinoma, CTNND1 enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling and interacts with the transcriptional repressor Kaiso, modulating gene expression (Tang2016Overexpression).

In breast cancer, CTNND1 interacts with the chromatin remodeling protein MORC2, which affects its subcellular localization and promotes cancer cell migration and invasion (Liao2017Chromatin). This interaction is dependent on the PRD domain of MORC2 and influences the CTNND1-Kaiso interaction, impacting the expression of Kaiso target genes (Liao2017Chromatin). CTNND1's interactions with these proteins highlight its multifaceted role in cancer progression and cellular dynamics.
