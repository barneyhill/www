# ELF1

## Overview
ELF1 (E74 like ETS transcription factor 1) is a gene that encodes a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, which are critical regulators of gene expression. The protein product of ELF1, also referred to as ELF1, functions primarily as a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including immune response, cell growth, and differentiation. It is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate the transcription of target genes. ELF1 is particularly significant in the regulation of immune-related genes and plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis and T-cell development. Its interactions with other proteins, such as SP1, RB1, and members of the NF-κB family, underscore its involvement in complex regulatory networks. Additionally, ELF1 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (John1995Regulation; Zhang2024Overexpression; Larsen2015The).

## Structure


## Function
ELF1 (E74 like ETS transcription factor 1) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is part of the Ets family of transcription factors and is involved in various cellular processes, including immune response, cell growth, and differentiation. ELF1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences, such as GGAA motifs, to influence the transcription of target genes (Larsen2015The).

In the context of immune function, ELF1 regulates the expression of genes involved in the antiviral response, such as the OAS1 gene, by enhancing its transcriptional response to interferon-β (IFN-β) (Larsen2015The). ELF1 interacts with other transcription factors like SP1 and RB1 to modulate gene expression in response to IFN stimulation, suggesting its role in coordinating complex regulatory networks (Larsen2015The).

ELF1 also plays a significant role in hematopoiesis and T-cell development. It regulates the expression of immune-related genes, including the interleukin-2 receptor α-chain (IL-2Rα) gene, by interacting with other proteins such as HMG-I(Y) and NF-κB family members (John1995Regulation). These interactions highlight ELF1's importance in maintaining proper immune system function and cellular differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
ELF1, a transcription factor, plays a significant role in various cancers and other diseases due to its altered expression or interactions. In gastric cancer (GC), ELF1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, advanced TNM staging, and shorter survival. It is linked to tumor angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and immune cell infiltration, particularly affecting interactions with B cells and CD4+ T cells (Zhang2024Overexpression). ELF1's interaction with MMP9 is crucial in GC, as it regulates neovascularization and extracellular matrix degradation, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis (Zhang2024Overexpression).

In leukemia, ELF1 acts as a transcriptional regulator of the MEIS1 gene, essential for hematopoietic stem cell function. Alterations in ELF1 expression can impact MEIS1 regulation, potentially contributing to leukemogenesis (Xiang2010Identification). ELF1 is also implicated in the transcriptional response to interferon-β, influencing the expression of antiviral genes like OAS1, and is a target in virus-related diseases such as Burkitt's lymphoma and T-cell leukemia (Larsen2015The).

In abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), ELF1 is part of the transcriptional networks controlling disease development, with increased expression observed in AAA tissues (Pahl2015Transcriptional). These findings highlight ELF1's clinical significance across various conditions.

## Interactions
ELF1, a member of the ETS transcription factor family, is involved in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for its role in gene regulation. ELF1 interacts with HMG-I(Y) proteins, forming a complex that can bind to AT-rich sequences in the IL-2Rα promoter, facilitating transcriptional activation. This interaction is mediated through the Ets domain of ELF1, which is essential for binding HMG-I(Y) in the absence of DNA (John1995Regulation).

ELF1 also associates with NF-κB family proteins, specifically NF-κB p50 and c-Rel, but not with NF-κB p65. These interactions occur without DNA and are important for the regulation of the IL-2Rα promoter, indicating a functional cooperativity between ELF1 and these proteins in transcriptional activation (John1995Regulation).

In the context of interferon-β (IFN-β) stimulation, ELF1 enhances the transcriptional response of the OAS1 gene by forming complexes with SP1 and RB1 proteins. ELF1 binds to a duplicated GGAA motif in the OAS1 promoter, which is crucial for its transcriptional activity. This interaction is part of a complex regulatory mechanism involving multiple transcription factors (Larsen2015The).
