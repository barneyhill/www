# SIRPG

## Overview
SIRPG, or signal regulatory protein gamma, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the signal regulatory protein family. The protein, also referred to as SIRPγ, is predominantly expressed on T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as natural killer (NK) cells. SIRPγ plays a pivotal role in modulating immune responses through its interaction with CD47, a transmembrane protein involved in various immunoregulatory processes. Unlike other members of the SIRP family, SIRPγ lacks signaling motifs in its cytoplasmic domain, suggesting a unique function as a 'decoy receptor' that competes for CD47 binding with SIRPα. This interaction is crucial for T-cell activation, particularly under chronic stimulation conditions, and is involved in processes such as T-cell transendothelial migration and antigen-specific T-cell proliferation (Sharp2021The; Dehmani2021SIRPγCD47). Additionally, SIRPγ is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in the regulation of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, where it contributes to tumor progression and immune evasion (Xu2022SIRPγexpressing).

## Function
SIRPG (signal regulatory protein gamma) is a member of the signal regulatory protein family, primarily expressed on T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as NK cells. It plays a significant role in modulating immune responses through its interaction with CD47, a transmembrane protein involved in various immunoregulatory processes (Sharp2021The). Unlike other SIRP proteins, SIRPG does not contain signaling motifs in its cytoplasmic domain, suggesting it may function as a 'decoy receptor' that competes for CD47 binding with SIRPa (Sharp2021The).

SIRPG is involved in integrin-independent adhesion of lymphocytes to antigen-presenting cells, enhancing cell-cell adhesion and potentially acting as an accessory protein in T cell responses (Nettleship2013Crystal). The interaction between SIRPG and CD47 is crucial for T-cell activation, particularly under chronic stimulation conditions, and is involved in processes such as T-cell transendothelial migration and antigen-specific T-cell proliferation (Dehmani2021SIRPγCD47). SIRPG is upregulated upon T-cell activation and is expressed on the entire T-cell surface, indicating its role in cell-cell contact during immune responses (Dehmani2021SIRPγCD47). The SIRPG-CD47 interaction positively regulates T-cell activation, which may have implications for understanding immune responses in chronic conditions (Dehmani2021SIRPγCD47).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SIRPG gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly autoimmune conditions and cancer. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2281808 in the SIRPG gene is associated with autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. This SNP leads to reduced expression of SIRPγ on CD8 T-cells, resulting in a heightened effector state characterized by increased cytokine production and cytotoxic potential. These changes may contribute to exaggerated immune responses and a predisposition to autoimmune diseases (Sinha2018An).

In cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SIRPγ is upregulated in cancer stem-like cells, promoting immune escape and tumor progression through the Hippo signaling pathway. SIRPγ expression is linked to poor survival outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma, and its interaction with CD47 helps cancer cells evade phagocytosis by the immune system. Targeting SIRPγ with neutralizing antibodies has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and enhance phagocytosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Xu2022SIRPγexpressing).

## Interactions
Signal regulatory protein gamma (SIRPG) is known to interact with CD47, a protein that plays a crucial role in immune cell signaling. The interaction between SIRPG and CD47 is significant in T-cell biology, particularly in the context of chronic stimulation. This interaction is weaker compared to the SIRPα/CD47 interaction but is essential for T-cell transendothelial migration, cell-cell adhesion, and antigen-specific T-cell proliferation (Dehmani2021SIRPγCD47). SIRPG/CD47 interactions are also involved in the regulation of IFN-γ secretion in chronically activated T cells, highlighting their role in immune response modulation (Dehmani2021SIRPγCD47).

SIRPG can form a complex with an antibody fragment, FabOX117, as demonstrated in structural studies. The crystal structure revealed a 2:2 complex formation, although in solution, SIRPG behaves as a monomer and forms a 1:1 complex with FabOX117 (Nettleship2013Crystal). This interaction suggests a moderately strong binding affinity with a dissociation constant of 1.2 μM (Nettleship2013Crystal).

In cancer biology, SIRPG is implicated in the regulation of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. It interacts with MST1 and PP2A, acting as a bridging factor that recruits PP2A to dephosphorylate MST1, leading to YAP activation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cancer stem-like cell properties and promoting tumor progression (Xu2022SIRPγexpressing).
