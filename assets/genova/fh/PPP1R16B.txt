# PPP1R16B

## Overview
The PPP1R16B gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 16B, a crucial component in the regulation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity. This regulatory subunit, also known as TGF-b Inhibited Membrane Associated Protein (TIMAP), is primarily involved in modulating endothelial cell functions and maintaining the endothelial barrier. The protein is characterized by its PP1 interaction motif and ankyrin repeats, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and membrane targeting (Magdaleno2002mPPP1R16B). PPP1R16B is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the brain and kidney, suggesting its involvement in neuronal development and function (Magdaleno2002mPPP1R16B). Clinically, alterations in PPP1R16B expression have been linked to cancer progression and kidney diseases, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling pathways and potential as a therapeutic target (Boratkó2017TIMAP; Mendrysa2010An).

## Structure
The human gene PPP1R16B encodes a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunit, which plays a crucial role in modulating PP1 activity. The protein structure of PPP1R16B is highly conserved across species, including humans, mice, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster, indicating its evolutionary importance (Magdaleno2002mPPP1R16B).

PPP1R16B contains several key structural features. It includes a PP1 interaction motif, which is essential for its role as a targeting subunit, facilitating the binding and regulation of PP1 activity. The protein also possesses ankyrin repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in complex formation and signaling pathways. Additionally, PPP1R16B has C-terminal prenylation signals, which likely target the protein to the plasma membrane, influencing its cellular localization and function (Magdaleno2002mPPP1R16B).

The expression of PPP1R16B mRNA is observed in various tissues, with the highest levels in the kidney and brain, particularly in regions such as the olfactory bulb, striatum, dentate gyrus, and cerebellum. This expression pattern suggests a significant role in neuronal function and development, as evidenced by increased expression during postnatal cerebellar development (Magdaleno2002mPPP1R16B).

## Function
PPP1R16B, also known as TGF-b Inhibited Membrane Associated Protein (TIMAP), is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a significant role in endothelial cells. It interacts with the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PP1, particularly forming a complex with PP1Cb/d, and is involved in regulating PP1C activity through phosphorylation events (Casamayor2020Controlling). TIMAP is highly expressed in endothelial cells and is crucial for maintaining the endothelial barrier, especially in response to inflammatory stimuli like thrombin (Boratkó2017TIMAP).

TIMAP contains a prenylation consensus CAAX box site, which may facilitate its membrane binding, and is involved in cellular processes regulated by TGF-b, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell adhesion (Casamayor2020Controlling). It targets myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) to the plasma membrane, suggesting a role in actin cytoskeleton regulation and apoptosis inhibition (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

Phosphorylation of TIMAP by PKA and GSK3b enhances PP1c activity, which is crucial for maintaining the endothelial barrier. This phosphorylation state affects TIMAP's interaction with PP1c and its substrate specificity, impacting cell adhesion, motility, and microvilli dynamics (Boratkó2017TIMAP).

## Clinical Significance
The PPP1R16B gene, encoding a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. Alterations in PPP1R16B expression or function have been associated with cancer, particularly in the context of its interaction with oncogenic pathways. In cancer research, PPP1R16B has been identified as an oncogene that can promote lymphomagenesis in cooperation with c-Myc, a well-known oncogene. Studies using murine models have shown that expression of PPP1R16B in hematopoietic stem cells leads to the development of lymphomas with decreased latency, indicating its role in tumor progression (Mendrysa2010An).

PPP1R16B is also involved in endothelial cell function, where it plays a role in maintaining the endothelial barrier. Its repression in fibrotic kidneys with elevated TGF-β levels suggests a potential involvement in kidney diseases, as it inhibits TGF-β signaling and macrophage M2 polarization (Boratkó2017TIMAP). Furthermore, PPP1R16B's interaction with the nonintegrin laminin receptor LAMR1, which is associated with tumor progression, suggests its role in cancer cell motility and survival, contributing to tumor aggressiveness and metastasis (Mendrysa2010An). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPP1R16B in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PPP1R16B, also known as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 16B, is involved in interactions that modulate the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The protein contains a protein phosphatase 1 interaction motif, which facilitates its role as a regulatory subunit of PP1, suggesting its involvement in protein interactions and membrane targeting (Magdaleno2002mPPP1R16B). The presence of ankyrin repeats in PPP1R16B is indicative of its capacity to mediate protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for regulating the function of the PP1 catalytic subunit (Heinzel2007The).

Despite its potential roles in protein interactions, studies have shown that the inactivation of the mPPP1R16B gene in mice does not result in abnormalities in thymus or T cell development, indicating that PPP1R16B is not essential for these processes (Heinzel2007The). This suggests that while PPP1R16B may participate in interactions with PP1 and possibly other proteins, its role in certain biological processes may be redundant or compensated by other proteins. The exact functional role of PPP1R16B in these interactions remains to be fully elucidated (Heinzel2007The).
