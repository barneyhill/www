# BHLHE23

## Overview
BHLHE23 is a gene that encodes the protein basic helix-loop-helix family member e23, which is part of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by their conserved bHLH domain, which is essential for DNA binding and dimerization, allowing them to regulate gene expression. The BHLHE23 protein plays a significant role in the development and function of rod bipolar cells in the retina, which are crucial for scotopic vision, or vision under low light conditions. Alterations in the BHLHE23 gene have been associated with night vision disorders, such as congenital stationary night blindness, due to its regulatory influence on genes involved in retinal function (Woods2018A).

## Structure
BHLHE23 is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors, characterized by a conserved bHLH domain that facilitates DNA binding and dimerization. The primary structure of BHLHE23 includes a sequence of amino acids forming the bHLH motif, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor. The secondary structure typically involves the formation of alpha helices, which are a common feature in proteins of this family. These helices contribute to the protein's ability to bind DNA and interact with other proteins.

The tertiary structure of BHLHE23 involves the folding of these alpha helices, allowing the protein to achieve a functional conformation necessary for its role in gene regulation. In terms of quaternary structure, BHLHE23 may dimerize with other bHLH proteins, a process that is essential for its activity as a transcription factor. This dimerization is a key aspect of its function, as it influences the protein's ability to bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression.

Post-translational modifications and splice variants can further influence the function and interactions of BHLHE23, although specific details on these modifications and variants are not provided in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the BHLHE23 gene have been implicated in night vision disorders. BHLHE23 is crucial for the development and survival of rod bipolar cells (RBCs) in the retina, which are essential for scotopic vision. In Bhlhe23 knockout mouse models, the absence of this gene leads to a phenotype similar to congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), characterized by a non-progressive electronegative electroretinogram (ERG) phenotype. This suggests that mutations affecting BHLHE23 could contribute to night blindness in humans, although such mutations have not yet been identified in patients with CSNB (Woods2018A).

BHLHE23 also regulates the expression of other genes involved in retinal function, such as Car8, which is important for RBC signal transduction. The down-regulation of Car8 in Bhlhe23 -/- mice indicates a direct regulatory relationship, further linking BHLHE23 to night vision disorders (Woods2018A). The identification of the RBC transcriptome, including BHLHE23, may aid in genetic screening for inherited causes of night blindness (Woods2018A).
