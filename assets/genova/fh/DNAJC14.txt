# DNAJC14

## Overview
DNAJC14 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C14, which is a molecular chaperone involved in various cellular processes. As a member of the Hsp40 family, DNAJC14 is categorized as a Type III Hsp40 protein and plays a crucial role in modulating protein folding and stress responses. The protein contains a J domain, essential for its interaction with Hsp70 family members, and features zinc-finger motifs and transmembrane domains that contribute to its structural and functional properties. DNAJC14 is involved in the unconventional secretion of misfolded proteins and has been implicated in viral replication, particularly in the context of flavivirus infections, by interacting with viral proteins and influencing replication complexes. Its activity is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm, where it regulates cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Jung2016The; Yi2011Identification).

## Structure
DNAJC14 is a member of the Hsp40 family, specifically categorized as a Type III Hsp40 protein. It contains a J domain, which is crucial for its function, and two zinc-finger motifs, suggesting some structural similarities to Type I Hsp40 members (Yi2011Identification). The J domain includes a conserved HPD motif essential for ATPase activity, which is critical for its role in modulating flavivirus replication (Yi2011Identification). Mutations in this motif, such as H471Q, result in a loss of function, highlighting its importance (Jung2016The).

The C-terminal domain of DNAJC14 is vital for its self-interaction and antiviral activity, particularly against the Yellow Fever Virus (YFV). Deletion of the C-terminal 77 amino acids results in the loss of these functions (Yi2011Identification). DNAJC14 also contains transmembrane domains, which enhance its inhibitory activity, although they are not strictly necessary for function (Yi2011Identification).

DNAJC14 is known to interact with Hsc70, a heat shock protein, and this interaction is important for its role in unconventional protein secretion (Jung2016The). The protein's ability to dimerize is required for its function, as demonstrated by the CT1 mutant, which cannot multimerize and fails to inhibit YFV (Yi2011Identification).

## Function
DNAJC14, a member of the Hsp40 family, functions as a molecular chaperone involved in various cellular processes. It contains a J-domain that recruits Hsp70 family members, stimulating ATP hydrolysis, which is crucial for the chaperone process (Yi2011Identification). In healthy cells, DNAJC14 regulates the ATPase cycle of Hsp70, with the HPD motif being critical for accelerating Hsp70 ATPase activity, suggesting its role in protein folding and stress responses (Yi2011Identification).

DNAJC14 is also involved in the unconventional secretion of misfolded proteins, such as the H723R-pendrin variant, by interacting with Hsc70 to facilitate their trafficking to the cell surface. This process is independent of the conventional ER-to-Golgi transport and is induced by ER stress signals (Jung2016The). DNAJC14 modulates the function of Hsc70, switching its role from promoting proteasomal degradation to facilitating cell-surface secretion of misfolded proteins (Jung2016The).

In addition to its role in protein trafficking, DNAJC14 is implicated in the regulation of cellular processes such as mitochondrial import, translation, endocytosis, and exocytosis (Yi2011Identification). Its activity is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm, influencing cellular homeostasis and stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
DNAJC14 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in protein folding and stress response. Mutations in DNAJC14 can lead to protein misfolding, which is associated with diseases such as Pendred syndrome. This condition is characterized by premature degradation of misfolded proteins, including the H723R-pendrin variant, which DNAJC14 helps to secrete through an unconventional pathway, potentially offering a therapeutic target for congenital deafness linked to folding-deficient pendrin mutants (Jung2016The).

Alterations in DNAJC14 expression levels can impact viral replication, particularly in the context of flavivirus infections. DNAJC14 modulates the replication of viruses such as Yellow Fever Virus, Kunjin virus, and Hepatitis C Virus by inhibiting viral RNA replication. This modulation is crucial for the formation of viral replication complexes, suggesting that DNAJC14 could be targeted for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies (Yi2011Identification).

Additionally, DNAJC14 has been identified as a significant contributor to the genomic fabric of the hippocampus in a neuropsychiatric lupus mouse model, indicating its potential involvement in central nervous system pathology or autoimmunity (Iacobas2021TWEAKing).

## Interactions
DNAJC14, also known as DRIP78, Jiv, or HDJ3, is a co-chaperone protein that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in viral replication and protein trafficking. It physically interacts with the NS3 protein of the Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating its involvement in the formation of viral replication complexes (Yi2011Identification). DNAJC14 also interacts with Hsc70, a member of the Hsp70 family, to facilitate the unconventional secretion of misfolded proteins like the H723R-pendrin variant. This interaction is crucial for the ATPase activity of Hsc70, which is necessary for the secretion process (Jung2016The).

The protein's J-domain is essential for its interaction with Hsp70 family members, stimulating ATP hydrolysis, which is critical for its chaperone activity (Yi2011Identification). DNAJC14's self-interaction is mediated by its C-terminal 77 amino acids, which is important for its antiviral activity against YFV (Yi2011Identification). These interactions highlight DNAJC14's role in modulating protein complexes and influencing viral replication and protein trafficking.
