# PELP1

## Overview
PELP1, or proline, glutamate, and leucine-rich protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. The PELP1 protein is characterized by its rich composition of proline, glutamate, and leucine, and it functions as a coactivator for estrogen receptor α (ERα), playing a crucial role in estrogen-dependent transcriptional activation (Vadlamudi2001Molecular). As a nuclear receptor coregulator, PELP1 is implicated in the modulation of gene expression and is involved in cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. The protein's structure includes several LXXLL motifs, a zinc finger, and regions rich in glutamic acid and proline, which facilitate its interactions with various signaling molecules and transcriptional coactivators (Gordon2022CryoEM; Vadlamudi2001Molecular). PELP1's involvement in oncogenic pathways has been linked to its overexpression in several hormone-dependent cancers, making it a significant focus of research in cancer biology (Rajhans2007Oncogenic).

## Structure
PELP1, a human protein encoded by the PELP1 gene, is a large scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes. It consists of 1282 amino acids and is located on chromosome 17 (Vadlamudi2001Molecular). The primary structure of PELP1 includes several motifs common in transcriptional regulators, such as nine nuclear receptor-interacting boxes (LXXLL motifs), a zinc finger, and regions rich in glutamic acid and proline (Vadlamudi2001Molecular). These LXXLL motifs are crucial for protein-protein interactions, although in the PELP1-WDR18 complex, they are not positioned to support steroid receptor binding (Gordon2022CryoEM).

The secondary structure of PELP1 features α-helical structures, with seven LXXLL motifs on the internal face and four solvent-exposed (Gordon2022CryoEM). The tertiary structure includes a dimerized PELP1 Rix1 domain forming an α-solenoid structure resembling a horseshoe (Gordon2022CryoEM). In terms of quaternary structure, PELP1 forms a heterotetramer assembly with WDR18, where the PELP1 dimer acts as a scaffold for two WDR18 protomers (Gordon2022CryoEM).

PELP1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Vadlamudi2001Molecular). The protein is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels in the testes, mammary glands, and brain (Vadlamudi2001Molecular).

## Function
PELP1 (proline, glutamate, and leucine-rich protein 1) is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling pathways. It acts as a coactivator of ERα, enhancing estrogen-dependent transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner (Vadlamudi2001Molecular). PELP1 contains LXXLL motifs that facilitate its binding to the AF2 domain of ERα, which is crucial for the receptor's activation function (Vadlamudi2001Molecular). This interaction is ligand-dependent, meaning it requires the presence of estrogen to occur.

In healthy human cells, PELP1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with general transcriptional coactivators such as p300 and CBP, contributing to the regulation of gene expression (Vadlamudi2001Molecular). PELP1 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the testis, mammary gland, brain, skeletal muscle, and lung (Vadlamudi2001Molecular). Its expression is developmentally regulated, particularly in the mammary glands, where it is higher during pregnancy and lower during lactation (Vadlamudi2001Molecular). These activities suggest that PELP1 is involved in modulating cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation, impacting organismal outcomes related to development and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
PELP1 (proline, glutamate, and leucine-rich protein 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a nuclear receptor coregulator. Its overexpression is linked to hormone-dependent cancers such as breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers, where it functions as an oncogene by enhancing the transformation potential of oncogenes like c-Src and promoting estradiol-mediated cell migration and growth (Rajhans2007Oncogenic). In breast cancer, PELP1 is associated with higher-grade tumors and resistance to hormonal therapies, contributing to poor prognosis (Gonugunta2014The; Sareddy2016PELP1:). 

In gastric cancer, PELP1 overexpression correlates with advanced tumor stage and grade, promoting proliferation and invasion through the Src-PI3K-Erk pathway (Yan2020PELP1). PELP1 is also significant in triple-negative breast cancer, where its expression is linked to poor outcomes, especially when combined with high Ki-67 levels (Zhang2015Prognostic). 

PELP1's role in metastasis is highlighted by its involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and interaction with proteins like STAT3, enhancing cell motility and invasion (Roy2012Significance; Manavathi2005Proline). Its expression is a potential prognostic marker in various cancers, including astrocytomas, where it correlates with tumor aggressiveness (Padmavathy2020Clinical).

## Interactions
PELP1 is a multi-domain scaffold protein that facilitates various protein-protein interactions, particularly with steroid receptors (SRs) and other signaling factors. It interacts with estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) and potentially other receptors like androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor (PR) through its LxxLL motifs, which are crucial for these interactions (Gonugunta2014The). PELP1 also forms a stable subcomplex with WDR18, which suppresses PELP1-mediated coactivation of ERα by holding its LxxLL motifs in a conformation that does not favor steroid receptor coactivation (Gordon2022CryoEM).

PELP1 is a central scaffold of the Rix1 complex, which includes WDR18, TEX10, and SENP3, and is involved in ribosome synthesis and heterochromatin maintenance (Gordon2022CryoEM). The C-terminal region of PELP1 is necessary for binding TEX10 and SENP3, although these interactions do not significantly alter the structure of the PELP1 Rix1 domain or its interface with WDR18 (Gordon2022CryoEM). PELP1 also interacts with kinases like Abl and Src, and is phosphorylated by Src kinase, which creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of PI3K, leading to PI3K pathway activation (Gonugunta2014The).
