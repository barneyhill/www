# ANKRD30A

## Overview
ANKRD30A is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 30A protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role for the protein in various cellular processes. The ANKRD30A protein has been implicated in the replication of HIV-1, where it acts as a host factor facilitating viral replication. Additionally, ANKRD30A is associated with breast cancer, particularly in its expression patterns across different subtypes. It is notably downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and is considered a breast differentiation antigen linked to estrogen receptor expression. The gene's expression levels have been correlated with clinical outcomes, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in breast cancer (Chen2020Bioinformatic; meyerson2014evolutionary; Chen2015Microarray).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ANKRD30A, also known as NY-BR-1, is a gene with significant clinical implications in breast cancer. It is predominantly expressed in breast tissues and is associated with breast cancer subtypes, particularly luminal breast cancer, where its high expression correlates with better prognosis, including improved relapse-free survival and overall survival (Chen2020Bioinformatic). In contrast, ANKRD30A expression is notably downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype characterized by its aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Low expression of ANKRD30A in TNBC is linked to decreased relapse-free survival, suggesting its potential role in disease aggressiveness and as a prognostic marker (Pariyar2022Verification; Chen2020Bioinformatic).

ANKRD30A is also considered a promising target for breast cancer immunotherapy due to its breast-specific expression and the presence of HLA-A2 restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes (Chen2020Bioinformatic). Its expression is associated with estrogen receptor status and is more prevalent in well-differentiated tumors, indicating its potential as a marker for tumor differentiation and related disseminated tumor cells (Dwivedi2014Molecular). Despite its potential, the clinical significance of genetic variations within ANKRD30A, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, remains under investigation (Kosaloglu2016In).

## Interactions
ANKRD30A, or ankyrin repeat domain 30A, is a protein that has been identified as a host factor important for HIV-1 replication. Its interaction with HIV-1 occurs between the stages of cellular entry and nuclear entry of the virus. A dominant negative assay demonstrated that expressing a fragment of ANKRD30A in cells could reduce HIV-1 and FIV infection by up to 50%, suggesting that the final third of the ANKRD30A protein constitutes the virus interaction domain (meyerson2014evolutionary). Despite these findings, specific physical interactions of ANKRD30A with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies (meyerson2014evolutionary).

ANKRD30A is also associated with breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it is downregulated compared to non-TNBC cases. It is identified as a breast differentiation antigen and is linked to estrogen receptor expression (Chen2015Microarray). The potential role of ANKRD30A as a transcription factor due to its nuclear localization signal and bZIP site has been suggested, indicating it might regulate the expression of other genes, such as LINC00993, although specific interactions remain to be elucidated (Chen2015Microarray).
