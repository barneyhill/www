# PPIAL4A

## Overview
PPIAL4A is a gene that encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase A like 4A, which belongs to the cyclophilin family of proteins. These proteins are known for their role as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, which facilitate protein folding by catalyzing the isomerization of peptide bonds at proline residues. The PPIAL4A protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding and cellular stress responses, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The gene is located on chromosome 1q21.2 and is part of a gene family that has been implicated in both developmental and oncological conditions. Its involvement in congenital heart disease and cancer highlights its potential significance in medical research and therapeutic development (Yoshihara2010Germline; Dasouki2020New).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The PPIAL4A gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in protein folding and cellular stress responses. Alterations in the expression of PPIAL4A have been associated with congenital heart disease (CHD), particularly in the context of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The gene is located in the 1q21.2 region, which includes potential candidate genes like NBPF16 and PPIAL4A-PPIAL4E, that may influence developmental processes. The PPIAL4 gene family, to which PPIAL4A belongs, encodes proteins that accelerate protein folding, potentially impacting developmental processes and contributing to the manifestation of TOF and other CHDs (Dasouki2020New).

In the context of cancer, PPIAL4A has been identified as part of an amplification at 1q21.1 in BRCA1-associated ovarian cancer patients. This region is associated with neuroblastoma and early tumorigenesis, suggesting that alterations in PPIAL4A may contribute to cancer development (Yoshihara2010Germline). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPIAL4A in both congenital and oncological conditions, underscoring the importance of further research into its role in disease pathogenesis.
