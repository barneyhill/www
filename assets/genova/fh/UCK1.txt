# UCK1

## Overview
Uridine-cytidine kinase 1 (UCK1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme uridine-cytidine kinase 1, which is a key player in the pyrimidine salvage pathway. This enzyme is classified as a kinase due to its role in catalyzing the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine to their respective monophosphate forms, a critical step in nucleotide metabolism. UCK1 is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, including the liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart, underscoring its essential function in maintaining nucleotide pools necessary for RNA and DNA synthesis (van2016The; Van2001Phosphorylation). The enzyme's activity is regulated through interactions with proteins such as KLHL2 and USP28, which influence its stability and degradation (Zhang2020Deubiquitinase). UCK1's role in nucleotide metabolism and its interactions with other proteins have significant implications in clinical contexts, particularly in cancer treatment, where it affects the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents (Zhang2020Deubiquitinase).

## Function
UCK1 (uridine-cytidine kinase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, catalyzing the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine to their respective monophosphate forms. This phosphorylation is essential for nucleotide metabolism, supporting the synthesis of RNA and DNA in cells (van2016The; Van2001Phosphorylation). UCK1 is a 277-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 31 kDa, and it is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart, indicating its fundamental role in nucleotide metabolism across different cell types (Van2001Phosphorylation).

In terms of molecular activity, UCK1 follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics and uses ATP as a phosphate donor to phosphorylate uridine and cytidine, with a higher catalytic efficiency for cytidine (Van2001Phosphorylation). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular proliferation and maintenance by ensuring a steady supply of nucleotides for nucleic acid synthesis (van2016The). UCK1's activity is critical for maintaining nucleotide pools necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis, which are vital for cell growth and division. Its ubiquitous expression and enzymatic function underscore its importance in normal cellular and organismal physiology (Van2001Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
UCK1 (uridine-cytidine kinase 1) plays a significant role in pyrimidine metabolism and has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer. Alterations in UCK1 expression or its interactions can influence the efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatments. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), UCK1 is crucial for the activation of the chemotherapeutic agent 5'-azacytidine (5'-AZA). Downregulation of UCK1 is associated with resistance to 5'-AZA, suggesting that maintaining UCK1 levels is important for treatment sensitivity (Zhang2020Deubiquitinase). The ubiquitin ligase KLHL2 mediates the degradation of UCK1, while the deubiquitinase USP28 stabilizes it, enhancing the sensitivity of AML cells to 5'-AZA (Zhang2020Deubiquitinase).

In neuroblastoma, UCK1 and UCK2 have distinct roles, with UCK1 overexpression leading to decreased metabolism of uridine and cytidine, potentially affecting the cytotoxicity of nucleoside analogues (van2016The). UCK1's interaction with UCK2 can alter subcellular localization, impacting its function and the cellular response to treatment (van2016The). These findings highlight the potential of targeting UCK1 and its regulatory pathways as a therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
UCK1 (uridine-cytidine kinase 1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and stability. UCK1 interacts with KLHL2, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, which mediates its degradation through K48-linked ubiquitination at the K81 site. This interaction occurs in the cytoplasm and is crucial for the regulation of UCK1 levels via the proteasome pathway (Zhang2020Deubiquitinase). USP28, a deubiquitinase, counteracts KLHL2-mediated ubiquitination, stabilizing UCK1 by removing ubiquitin chains. This stabilization is dependent on the deubiquitinating activity of USP28, as demonstrated by the inability of a catalytic-inactive mutant of USP28 to stabilize UCK1 (Zhang2020Deubiquitinase).

The interaction between UCK1 and USP28 is mediated by KLHL2, as USP28 does not directly bind to UCK1. Coexpression of KLHL2 enhances the interaction between USP28 and UCK1, while silencing KLHL2 reduces it (Zhang2020Deubiquitinase). UCK1 also interacts with UCK2, another uridine-cytidine kinase, altering UCK2's subcellular localization from the cytosol to the nucleus. This interaction affects pyrimidine metabolism and the activation of cytotoxic nucleoside analogues (van2016The).
