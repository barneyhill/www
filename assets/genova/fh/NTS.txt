# NTS

## Overview
The NTS gene encodes the neuropeptide neurotensin, which is involved in a variety of physiological processes both as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and as a hormone in the gastrointestinal tract. Neurotensin is a tridecapeptide that interacts with specific receptors, primarily the G-protein coupled receptors NTS1 and NTS2, and the single transmembrane domain receptor NTS3. These interactions are crucial for neurotensin's role in modulating neurotransmitter systems, influencing processes such as pain perception, body temperature regulation, and food intake (Boules2013Diverse; Magafa2019Novel). The NTS gene and its associated pathways have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer, where alterations in NTS expression and receptor activity are linked to tumor progression and metastasis (Wu2013Neurotensin; Qiu2017A). Additionally, neurotensin plays a role in metabolic and liver diseases, highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target (Dongiovanni2020Neurotensin).

## Structure
Neurotensin (NT) is a tridecapeptide composed of 13 amino acids with the sequence pGlu–Leu–Tyr–Glu–Asn–Lys–Pro–Arg–Arg–Pro–Tyr–Ile–Leu (Kleczkowska2013Neurotensin). The C-terminal hexapeptide fragment, NT8–13 (Arg–Arg–Pro–Tyr–Ile–Leu), is crucial for receptor binding and activation, with specific roles for each amino acid in this sequence (Kleczkowska2013Neurotensin). The presence of Pro10 is essential for forming a reverse-turn conformation, which is critical for receptor activation (Kleczkowska2013Neurotensin). The aromatic amino acid at Tyr11 is important for binding, particularly to the human NTS1 receptor (Kleczkowska2013Neurotensin).

Neurotensin interacts with three types of receptors: NTS1, NTS2, and NTS3. NTS1 and NTS2 are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by seven transmembrane domains, while NTS3 has a single transmembrane domain (Magafa2019Novel). The NTS1 receptor exhibits constitutive activity and undergoes conformational changes upon neurotensin binding, which is crucial for its signaling efficacy (Asadollahi2023Unravelling; Krumm2016Structure). The study of NT analogues has focused on enhancing metabolic stability by incorporating unnatural amino acids to resist enzymatic degradation (Magafa2019Novel). 

The context does not provide detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of neurotensin itself, nor does it mention specific domains, prominent folds, or common post-translational modifications.

## Function
Neurotensin (NTS) is a neuropeptide that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It functions as both a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and a hormone in the gastrointestinal tract. In the CNS, NTS is involved in modulating several neurotransmitter systems, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic systems. This modulation is crucial for processes such as pain perception, body temperature regulation, and food intake (Boules2013Diverse).

NTS exerts its effects through three specific receptors: NTSR1, NTSR2, and NTSR3, with NTSR1 being the most studied. NTSR1 is a G-protein coupled receptor widely distributed in the CNS and is associated with dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. It plays a role in antinociception, hypothermia, and the control of anterior pituitary hormone secretion (Boules2013Diverse).

In the gastrointestinal tract, NTS is released from neuroendocrine cells in response to dietary fat, facilitating lipid absorption and regulating other gastrointestinal peptides. It also influences gut motility and cardiovascular modulation, acting as a growth factor for various cells (Barchetta2022New; Boules2013Diverse).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the neurotensin (NTS) gene and its receptor NTSR1 have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), NTS and NTSR1 are overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, promoting cancer cell growth and progression. Blocking NTSR1 signaling has been shown to inhibit tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Qiu2017A). In prostate cancer, NTS and NTSR1 are upregulated, leading to increased proliferation and invasiveness, especially after androgen ablation therapy (Wu2013Neurotensin). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NTS and NTSR1 are coexpressed at high levels, correlating with aggressive cancer behaviors and poor prognosis. The NTS pathway influences tumor progression through the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway, enhancing sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Christou2020Neurotensin). 

In cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), NTS expression is elevated, facilitating metastasis through the EGFR/AKT signaling pathway. High NTS levels are associated with increased metastasis and shorter survival times, indicating its role as a prognostic factor (Su2019Neurotensin). 

NTS is also linked to liver diseases, particularly in metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), where genetic variants in NTS are associated with hepatic fibrosis and increased risk of HCC (Dongiovanni2020Neurotensin).

## Interactions
Neurotensin (NTS) interacts with the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTS1), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), primarily expressed in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between NTS and NTS1 involves the binding of the last six residues of neurotensin (NT8-13), which are crucial for high-affinity receptor binding and activation (Asadollahi2023Unravelling). Upon binding, neurotensin induces conformational changes in NTS1, which are necessary for receptor activation. These changes include the transition of tyrosine 11 (Y11) in neurotensin between different rotameric states, which is essential for activating NTS1 (Bumbak2020Conformational).

The binding of neurotensin to NTS1 also involves interactions with specific residues in the receptor, such as Q211, S214, D54, L55, and H132, which stabilize the conformational states of Y11 (Bumbak2020Conformational). The interaction is characterized by an induced-fit mechanism, where conformational changes in the receptor occur after neurotensin binding, leading to the formation of a closed conformation between the N-terminal region and extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) of NTS1 (Asadollahi2023Unravelling). This interaction is crucial for the pharmacological behavior of NTS1 and its role in modulating neurotransmitter systems (Asadollahi2023Unravelling).
