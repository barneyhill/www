# MINAR1

## Overview
MINAR1, or membrane integral NOTCH2 associated receptor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular signaling pathways. The protein, also named MINAR1, is characterized as a transmembrane receptor with a significant degree of intrinsic disorder, which influences its structural dynamics and functional interactions (Ho2018MINAR1). It plays a pivotal role in modulating angiogenesis and has been implicated in the inhibition of breast cancer growth through its interaction with the NOTCH2 receptor (Ho2018MINAR1). This interaction is essential for the protein's stability and function, as it reduces aggregation and enhances biological activity (Ho2018MINAR1). Additionally, MINAR1 has been identified as a host dependency factor in the replication of coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in both cancer and infectious diseases (Kratzel2021A).

## Structure
The MINAR1 protein, encoded by the human gene MINAR1, is characterized as a major intrinsically disordered protein with a sequence of 916 amino acids and a predicted molecular weight of 103 kDa (Ho2018MINAR1). Approximately 70% of its amino acid sequence is predicted to be intrinsically disordered, lacking a stable tertiary structure (Ho2018MINAR1). The protein includes a large extracellular domain with multiple potential glycosylation sites, a single transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular domain (Ho2018MINAR1). 

MINAR1 is highly conserved across species, with a 96.5% sequence similarity between human and mouse MINAR1, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function (Ho2018MINAR1). The protein's intrinsically disordered nature contributes to its tendency to aggregate and its typical insolubility, as demonstrated by its retention in the insoluble fraction during a cellulose acetate filter trap assay (Ho2018MINAR1). The interaction with the Notch2 receptor enhances the stability and function of MINAR1, reducing its aggregation (Ho2018MINAR1). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a significant role in cellular signaling, particularly in inhibiting angiogenesis and breast cancer growth (Ho2018MINAR1).

## Function
MINAR1, or membrane integral NOTCH2 associated receptor 1, is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly through its interaction with the NOTCH2 receptor. In healthy human cells, MINAR1 is expressed in various tissues, including epithelial cells of the breast and endothelial cells of blood vessels (Ho2018MINAR1). It functions as a Notch2-binding protein, which is crucial for its stability and function, as MINAR1 is intrinsically disordered and gains structure through this interaction (Ho2018MINAR1).

MINAR1 is involved in inhibiting angiogenesis, a process critical for blood vessel formation. It achieves this by inhibiting capillary tube formation in endothelial cells, as demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo models (Ho2018MINAR1). This inhibition suggests that MINAR1 may help maintain vascular homeostasis in healthy tissues by modulating angiogenesis (Ho2018MINAR1).

The protein is characterized by a high degree of intrinsic disorder, which contributes to its tendency to aggregate. However, its interaction with Notch2 stabilizes MINAR1, reducing aggregation and enhancing its biological activity (Ho2018MINAR1). This stabilization is essential for its role in cellular processes and organismal outcomes related to angiogenesis and potentially other signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
The MINAR1 gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to cancer and viral infections. In breast cancer, MINAR1 expression is significantly downregulated in advanced tumors, and its re-expression in cancer cells has been shown to inhibit tumor growth. This suggests a potential tumor-suppressive role for MINAR1, possibly through its interaction with the Notch2 protein, which stabilizes MINAR1 and enhances its function (Ho2018MINAR1). The interaction between MINAR1 and Notch2 is crucial in inhibiting angiogenesis, a process essential for tumor growth and metastasis, indicating that alterations in MINAR1 expression or function could contribute to cancer progression (Ho2018MINAR1).

MINAR1 has also been identified as a host dependency factor in coronavirus replication, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. It is involved in the autophagy pathway, which is hijacked by coronaviruses for replication. Knockout studies have shown that MINAR1 is necessary for autophagosome formation, and its inhibition can impair viral replication, suggesting that MINAR1 could be a target for antiviral strategies (Kratzel2021A). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of MINAR1 in both cancer and infectious diseases.

## Interactions
MINAR1, also known as membrane integral NOTCH2 associated receptor 1, is a protein that interacts with the Notch2 receptor. This interaction is significant for the stability and function of both proteins. MINAR1 is identified as a Notch2-binding protein, and this interaction has been confirmed through various experimental methods, including immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-localization studies in HEK-293 cells and human umbilical primary vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Ho2018MINAR1). The binding of MINAR1 to Notch2 was further demonstrated using a GST pull-down assay, which showed that a GST fusion protein of MINAR1 could directly interact with Notch2-GFP (Ho2018MINAR1).

The interaction between MINAR1 and Notch2 reduces the aggregation of MINAR1, thereby increasing its stability and solubility. This interaction is crucial for MINAR1's role in inhibiting angiogenesis and breast cancer growth (Ho2018MINAR1). The co-expression of MINAR1 with Notch2 in HEK-293 cells was shown to reduce the aggregation of MINAR1, indicating that Notch2 contributes to the stability of MINAR1 (Ho2018MINAR1). These findings suggest that the physical interaction between MINAR1 and Notch2 is essential for the stability and function of MINAR1.
