# FDPS

## Overview
Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) is a gene that encodes the enzyme farnesyl diphosphate synthase, a crucial component of the mevalonate pathway. This enzyme is classified as an isoprenoid diphosphate synthase and plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, which are essential for various cellular functions, including cholesterol synthesis and protein prenylation. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of farnesyl diphosphate, a key intermediate in the production of sterols and other biomolecules necessary for maintaining cell membrane integrity and signaling pathways. FDPS is involved in several physiological processes and has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, due to its interactions with multiple signaling pathways (Abate2017Deregulated; Kim2018Farnesyl; Wang2021Cardiac‐specific).

## Structure
Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) is a homodimeric enzyme, with each subunit having a molecular weight of approximately 44 kDa (Tarshis1994Crystal). The enzyme is composed entirely of alpha-helices, with 10 core helices arranged around a central cavity, forming a unique folding pattern (Tarshis1994Crystal). This structure is stabilized by extensive hydrophobic interactions and features two conserved aspartate-rich motifs, DDXXD, located in helices D and H, which are crucial for substrate binding and catalysis (Tarshis1994Crystal).

The active site of FDPS contains distinct allylic and homoallylic binding domains, facilitating the enzyme's role in catalyzing the chain elongation reaction of isoprenoid biosynthesis (Tarshis1994Crystal). The enzyme's quaternary structure is a homodimer, with the dimeric form stabilized by interactions between helices D and E (Tarshis1994Crystal).

FDPS is part of a larger family of isoprenoid diphosphate synthases, sharing structural similarities, particularly in the conserved DDXXD motifs, which are essential for binding diphosphate moieties through Mg2+ bridges (Tarshis1994Crystal). These structural features are critical for the enzyme's function in the biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphate, a key intermediate in cholesterol and steroid synthesis.

## Function
Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) is a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. These isoprenoids are essential for various cellular functions, including the synthesis of cholesterol and the prenylation of proteins. Prenylation is a post-translational modification that attaches lipid groups to proteins, facilitating their attachment to cell membranes and influencing their activity and function (Kim2018Farnesyl).

FDPS catalyzes the conversion of isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate into geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). FPP serves as a precursor for the synthesis of cholesterol, ubiquinones, and other essential biomolecules. This process is vital for maintaining cell membrane integrity and supporting various signaling pathways (Kim2018Farnesyl).

In healthy human cells, FDPS is involved in the synthesis of sterols and isoprenylated metabolites, which are critical for normal cellular functions. The enzyme's activity is also linked to immunoregulatory functions, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting immune responses (Abate2017Deregulated). FDPS is active in the cytosol, where it participates in the mevalonate pathway, contributing to the production of essential lipids and proteins necessary for cell growth and function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or activity of the FDPS gene have been implicated in several diseases. In glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain cancer, FDPS expression and activity are significantly elevated compared to normal brain tissues. This upregulation is associated with oncogenic signaling pathways such as STAT3, ERK, and AKT, contributing to tumor cell survival and proliferation. Silencing FDPS in glioblastoma cells enhances apoptosis, suggesting its role in maintaining the malignant phenotype and indicating that targeting the mevalonate pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy (Abate2017Deregulated).

In prostate cancer, FDPS overexpression is linked to increased aggressiveness and tumor recurrence. It activates oncogenic signaling pathways, including AKT and ERK, and is associated with PTEN loss, which further promotes cancer progression. Knockdown of FDPS reduces cancer cell proliferation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Seshacharyulu2019FDPS).

In cardiac health, FDPS deletion in mice leads to cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. This is due to the abnormal activation of small GTP-binding proteins and subsequent upregulation of the mTOR and ERK signaling pathways, which contribute to cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction (Wang2021Cardiac‐specific).

## Interactions
Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) is a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, which is crucial for the synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids. FDPS interacts with several proteins and signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation and survival. In glioblastoma, FDPS is associated with oncogenic signaling pathways, including ERK, STAT3, and AKT, which promote tumor cell survival and proliferation (Abate2017Deregulated). Knockdown of FDPS in glioma cells results in decreased activity of these signaling proteins, suggesting that FDPS may play a role in promoting cell survival and proliferation through these pathways (Abate2017Deregulated).

FDPS also interacts with the Rac1/MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in the context of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). It regulates the activity of Rac1, a small GTPase, which in turn affects the MAPK/ERK pathway, influencing cell proliferation (Guo2023Farnesyl). In glioma, FDPS promotes the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages by regulating CCL20 expression through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Chen2020FDPS). These interactions highlight the role of FDPS in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases like cancer and PCOS.
