# RAVER1

## Overview
RAVER1 is a gene that encodes the ribonucleoprotein, PTB binding 1, a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and other cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, which facilitate RNA binding and interaction with other proteins, playing a crucial role in the modulation of pre-mRNA splicing (Rideau2006A; Rangarajan2011Apo). RAVER1 functions primarily as a co-factor in the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP)-dependent control of alternative splicing, impacting gene expression and cellular function (Wedler2024RAVER1). It is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, associating with contractile elements in muscle tissues and interacting with proteins such as vinculin and alpha-actinin, suggesting roles in structural, transport, signaling, or regulatory functions (Zieseniss2006Raver1). Clinically, alterations in RAVER1 expression are linked to cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies (Wedler2024RAVER1; Wedler2023RAVER1).

## Structure
The RAVER1 protein is characterized by its three RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains located in the amino-terminal region, which are crucial for its function in RNA binding and interaction with other proteins (Rangarajan2011Apo). These RRM domains exhibit a canonical fold with a four-stranded beta-sheet and two alpha-helices, forming a babbab topology with conserved RNP motifs that enhance RNA binding affinity (Rangarajan2011Apo). The RRM1 domain has a shorter b2-b3 loop, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, specifically vinculin binding, rather than RNA binding (Rangarajan2011Apo).

The crystal structure of the unbound RRM1-3 domains reveals significant domain movements, particularly involving Arg59 of RRM1 and Glu159 of RRM2, triggered by a bound sulfate ion that mimics RNA phosphate (Rangarajan2011Apo). The RRM2 and RRM3 domains maintain a consistent orientation due to a hydrophobic C-terminal alpha-helix, while the RRM1 domain shows different orientations depending on its binding state (Rangarajan2011Apo).

RAVER1 also contains a proline-rich region in its C-terminal region, which is essential for its repressor activity in splicing but not for PTB interaction (Rideau2006A). The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms with distinct functions (Rideau2006A).

## Function
RAVER1 is a protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, a critical process for generating protein diversity in cells. It acts as a co-factor in the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP)-dependent control of alternative splicing, influencing the insertion of protein interaction modules in factors that guide miR/RISC-dependent gene silencing (Wedler2024RAVER1). RAVER1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates pre-mRNA splicing, impacting gene expression and cellular function (Zieseniss2006Raver1).

In muscle tissues, RAVER1 is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, associating with contractile elements and playing a role in protein-protein interactions. It is an integral component of the sarcomere, particularly in the I-Z-I region, and interacts with proteins like vinculin and alpha-actinin, suggesting a role in structural, transport, signaling, or regulatory functions (Zieseniss2006Raver1).

RAVER1 also modulates the miR/RISC pathway, which is crucial for gene silencing. It affects the alternative splicing of TNRC6 proteins, key components in miR/RISC activity, by linking mRNA-associated miRISC complexes to the 3'end decay machinery. This modulation is essential for maintaining proper miR/RISC activity and cellular homeostasis (Wedler2023RAVER1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAVER1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. RAVER1 is associated with tumor cell proliferation and survival, and its upregulation is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (Wedler2024RAVER1; Wedler2023RAVER1). Depletion of RAVER1 in cancer cell models results in reduced tumor cell proliferation, spheroid growth, and anoikis resistance, while increasing apoptosis, indicating its role as a pro-oncogenic factor (Wedler2024RAVER1; Wedler2023RAVER1).

RAVER1 also plays a critical role in modulating alternative splicing within the miR/RISC pathway, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial integrity and regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Its depletion leads to enhanced TGF-beta signaling, promoting lethal EMT and apoptosis, which are key processes in cancer progression (Wedler2024RAVER1; Wedler2023RAVER1). The gene's interaction with PTBP1 is important for its function, but RAVER1 also has PTBP1-independent roles that impact cancer cell behavior (Wedler2024RAVER1; Wedler2023RAVER1). These findings suggest that targeting RAVER1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
RAVER1 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in modulating alternative splicing and other cellular processes. It interacts with the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), specifically through a peptide motif (SLLGEPP) that binds to the RRM2 domain of PTB. This interaction is crucial for splicing repression and involves multiple cooperative interactions with other splicing regulatory complexes (Rideau2006A). RAVER1 also interacts with cytoskeletal proteins such as vinculin and alpha-actinin, forming complexes that can be recovered from cell extracts. These interactions suggest a role in intracellular signaling and the modulation of microfilament attachment sites (Zieseniss2006Raver1).

RAVER1 is involved in the miR/RISC pathway, influencing the alternative splicing of key effectors like TNRC6 proteins, which are essential for miR-induced mRNA decay. This modulation affects the association of TNRC6 proteins with AGO2, a key component of the miR/RISC complex (Wedler2024RAVER1). RAVER1's interactions with various RNA-binding proteins, including PTBP1 and SRSF2, further highlight its role in alternative splicing regulation (Wedler2023RAVER1).
