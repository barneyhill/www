# TREX2

## Overview
TREX2 is a gene that encodes the protein three prime repair exonuclease 2, which is a crucial enzyme involved in DNA repair processes. The protein is categorized as a DEDDh exonuclease and functions primarily as a 3'-to-5' exonuclease, playing a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by removing mismatched sequences from duplex DNA. Structurally, the TREX2 protein forms a homodimer, which is essential for its DNA binding and exonuclease activity, and requires magnesium ions for its catalytic function (Cheng2018Structural). TREX2 is particularly important in skin cells, where it contributes to skin homeostasis and has been implicated in conditions such as psoriasis (Cheng2018Structural). Additionally, alterations in TREX2 expression have been linked to various clinical outcomes, including cancer, where it may act as a tumor suppressor (Weigel2019DNA).

## Structure
The TREX2 protein is a dimeric exonuclease that plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain, with over 40% sequence identity in its nuclease domain shared with TREX1, leading to similar secondary and three-dimensional structures (Cheng2018Structural). The secondary structure of TREX2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with specific regions such as the α7 helix, α8 helix, and α7/α8 loop being critical for DNA binding (Cheng2018Structural).

The tertiary structure of TREX2 is characterized by a homodimeric conformation, which is essential for its DNA binding and exonuclease activity. The crystal structure of apo-mTREX2 was determined at 1.9 Å resolution, revealing a two-fold symmetry axis (Cheng2018Structural). The active site of TREX2 includes conserved residues such as Asp14, Glu16, Asp123, Asp193, and His188, which are typical of DEDDh exonucleases (Cheng2018Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, TREX2 forms a dimer, which is crucial for its function. The protein interacts with DNA through specific domains, including a Leu20-Pro21-Asn22 cluster that interacts with the 5'-terminal of dsDNA (Cheng2018Structural). The presence of magnesium ions is necessary for its catalytic activity, and the protein's activity is inhibited by EDTA, a metal ion chelating agent (Cheng2018Structural).

## Function
The TREX2 gene encodes the three prime repair exonuclease 2, a crucial enzyme involved in maintaining genomic stability through its role in DNA repair processes. TREX2 functions as a 3'-to-5' exonuclease, which is essential for removing 3'-mismatched sequences from duplex DNA. This activity is vital for cell survival and proliferation, particularly in response to DNA damage such as that caused by UV exposure. Upon DNA damage, TREX2 is upregulated and recruited to the nucleus, where it interacts with damaged DNA to facilitate repair (Cheng2018Structural).

TREX2's exonuclease activity is characterized by its ability to precisely trim the 3'-overhangs of duplex DNA, converting them into blunt-ended duplex DNA. This process is facilitated by a specific active site conformation that includes two magnesium ions, which are crucial for its catalytic function. The enzyme's non-processive nature ensures that it releases the cleaved DNA substrate before further processing, maintaining the integrity of the DNA (Cheng2018Structural).

In healthy human cells, TREX2 plays a significant role in preventing mutations and supporting proper cell cycle progression. Its activity is particularly important in keratinocytes, where it contributes to skin homeostasis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of conditions like psoriasis (Cheng2018Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TREX2 gene have been linked to various clinical outcomes, particularly in the context of cancer. In laryngeal cancer, decreased DNA methylation at the TREX2 locus is associated with increased mRNA and protein expression, which correlates with improved survival outcomes (Weigel2019DNA). This suggests that TREX2 may function as a tumor suppressor, with its expression potentially providing protective effects against tumorigenesis (Weigel2019DNA). High TREX2 expression is also linked to enhanced UV protection and a lower risk of skin cancer, indicating its role in DNA repair and genomic stability (Weigel2019DNA).

In keratinocytes, TREX2 is involved in DNA degradation during terminal differentiation. Its deficiency, along with DNase1L2, leads to DNA accumulation without triggering inflammatory responses, suggesting a role in maintaining DNA integrity and preventing inflammation (Manils2017Double). TREX2's involvement in DNA repair processes implies that its dysfunction could contribute to autoimmune disorders due to impaired DNA repair mechanisms affecting immune regulation (Manils2017Double).

The gene's expression patterns also vary with age and cancer stage, with increased expression observed in younger cancer patients, suggesting a potential role in early-stage cancer development (Kim2020Global).

## Interactions
TREX2, a three prime repair exonuclease, is involved in maintaining genomic integrity through its interactions with duplex DNA. It exhibits significant 3'-to-5' exonuclease activity, which is crucial for processing duplex DNA with long double-stranded regions. TREX2 interacts with the non-scissile strand of duplex DNA via additional α-helix and loop regions, which distinguishes it from TREX1. Specific amino acids, such as Asp121, Arg156, and Arg167, are involved in binding to the non-scissile strand over a longer region, facilitating its role in chromosomal rearrangement and maintenance (Cheng2018Structural).

The structural analysis of TREX2 reveals that it interacts with the 5'-terminal of dsDNA through a Leu20-Pro21-Asn22 cluster, which is essential for precise trimming of the 3'-overhang. This interaction highlights TREX2's requirement for a long double-stranded region for effective binding, underscoring its role in error-free post-replication repair and genome editing (Cheng2018Structural). These interactions are critical for TREX2's function in DNA repair pathways, contributing to its ability to maintain genomic stability and integrity.
