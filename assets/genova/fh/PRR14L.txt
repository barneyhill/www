# PRR14L

## Overview
The PRR14L gene encodes the proline-rich 14-like protein, which is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in hematopoietic differentiation and cell cycle regulation. This protein is characterized by its largely disordered structure, with specific regions exhibiting structural order, including the Tantalus domain that facilitates interactions with phosphatase components such as B56α and B56γ (Chase2018PRR14L; Chase2023Identification). PRR14L is crucial for the differentiation and growth of granulomonocytic and erythroid cells, and its dysfunction is associated with hematological conditions like chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (Chase2018PRR14L). The protein's interactions with midbody proteins, such as KIF4A, underscore its role in mitosis and cell cycle processes (Chase2018PRR14L). Mutations in PRR14L are linked to acquired uniparental disomy of chromosome 22q, contributing to age-related clonal hematopoiesis and myeloid neoplasms (Chase2018PRR14L).

## Structure
The PRR14L protein is 2151 amino acids long with a predicted molecular weight of 237 kDa. It is largely disordered, with 92% of its residues having low confidence scores for structural order, according to AlphaFold predictions. However, two C-terminal regions, residues 1613-1625 and 2025-2144, show higher confidence scores, suggesting potential structural order. The latter region contains the Tantalus domain, which includes a conserved short linear motif that facilitates binding to PP2A components B56α and B56γ (Chase2018PRR14L; Chase2023Identification).

The PRR14L protein is predicted to have a nuclear localization signal at amino acids 2079-2104, which is disrupted in certain mutants. This signal is crucial for its nuclear localization in specific cell types (Chase2018PRR14L). The protein's structure is further complicated by its association with acquired isodisomy of chromosome 22 in myeloid neoplasms, suggesting a role in cell growth and apoptosis (Chase2023Identification).

Experimental methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance may be required to confirm the structural predictions and disorder status of PRR14L, as current in silico methods provide conflicting results (Chase2023Identification).

## Function
The PRR14L gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in hematopoietic differentiation and cell cycle progression in healthy human cells. It is particularly important for the differentiation and growth of granulomonocytic and erythroid cells. Knockdown of PRR14L in primary human bone marrow CD34+ cells results in impaired cell growth and increased apoptosis in granulomonocytic cells, leading to a shift towards a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-like phenotype. This is characterized by a decrease in granulocyte markers and an increase in monocyte markers (Chase2018PRR14L).

PRR14L is also involved in cell division, localizing to the midbody of dividing cells and interacting with proteins such as KIF4A. This suggests a role in the regulation of mitosis and cell cycle processes. The knockdown of PRR14L affects the expression of genes related to granulocyte and monocyte function, as well as cell cycle and mitosis-related gene sets, indicating its involvement in these pathways (Chase2018PRR14L).

In erythroid cells, PRR14L knockdown leads to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and a reduction in erythroid differentiation, as evidenced by decreased early and intermediate erythroid markers and a reduction in colony-forming units (Chase2018PRR14L).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRR14L gene are associated with several hematological conditions, particularly age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH) and myeloid neoplasms, including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). These mutations often result in the loss of the C-terminus of the PRR14L protein, which may be a founding event in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Chase2018PRR14L). PRR14L mutations are linked to acquired uniparental disomy of chromosome 22q, suggesting that these mutations alone can drive clonality in ARCH, which is associated with increased risks of inflammation, vascular diseases, and hematologic malignancies (Chase2018PRR14L).

In vitro studies have shown that PRR14L knockdown in hematopoietic cells leads to impaired growth and increased apoptosis, particularly affecting granulomonocytic and erythroid cell differentiation. This results in a CMML-like phenotype, characterized by an increase in monocytes and a decrease in granulocytes (Chase2018PRR14L). The gene's role in cell division and differentiation processes is further supported by its interactions with midbody proteins KIF4A and KIF23, which are relevant to its function during cell division (Chase2018PRR14L).

## Interactions
PRR14L is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in cellular processes related to myeloid neoplasms. It binds to the PP2A components B56α and B56γ through a conserved short linear motif (SLiM) within its Tantalus domain, similar to its paralog PRR14 (Chase2023Identification). These interactions suggest a potential role for PRR14L in modulating phosphatase activity, possibly acting as a scaffold protein due to its largely disordered structure (Chase2023Identification).

PRR14L also interacts with BAP1, a component of the H2A deubiquitinating complex PR-DUB, which is linked to leukemogenic processes (Chase2023Identification). This interaction does not occur through the SLiM sequence, indicating a different binding mechanism (Chase2023Identification).

Additionally, PRR14L has been shown to interact with midbody proteins KIF4A and KIF23, suggesting a role in cell division and differentiation (Chase2018PRR14L). The interaction with KIF4A was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation, highlighting PRR14L's involvement in cellular processes beyond phosphatase regulation (Chase2018PRR14L).
