# SERPINB11

## Overview
SERPINB11 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family B member 11, which belongs to the serpin superfamily. Unlike many other serpins, which typically function as serine protease inhibitors, the protein encoded by SERPINB11 is non-inhibitory, suggesting it may have evolved distinct functions in humans (Finno2015SERPINB11; Seixas2015The). The gene is expressed in various human tissues, including the tonsil, lung, placenta, and prostate, and has been implicated in immune response and host-pathogen interactions (Finno2015SERPINB11; Seixas2012Loss). Evolutionary studies indicate that SERPINB11 has undergone positive selection, particularly in African populations, which may reflect an adaptive response to environmental pressures and pathogen exposure (Seixas2012Loss). The protein's potential roles in health and disease, including associations with conditions such as ovarian cancer and Crohn's disease, underscore its clinical significance (PARK2021SERPINB11Expression; Seixas2012Loss).

## Structure
SERPINB11 is a member of the serpin superfamily, characterized by a conserved tertiary structure that includes three β-sheets (A, B, and C) and nine α-helices, along with a reactive center loop (RCL) that typically serves as bait for target proteases (Finno2015SERPINB11). However, unlike many serpins, SERPINB11 is non-inhibitory, suggesting unique structural features that differentiate it from other serpins (Kryvalap2022The).

In humans, SERPINB11 has undergone evolutionary changes, particularly in the human lineage, where specific amino acid positions such as codons 90, 148, 181, 188, 303, 194, and 253 have been identified as likely under positive selection. These positions are associated with structural changes that may influence the S-to-R transition necessary for its protease inhibition function, although SERPINB11 itself is non-inhibitory (Seixas2012Loss). Substitutions at positions 90, 148, and 303 are located in helices near the A β-sheet, which undergoes structural changes during RCL insertion, potentially destabilizing the helices and affecting the dynamics of RCL insertion (Seixas2012Loss).

SERPINB11 is expressed in various tissues, including the tonsil, lung, placenta, and prostate in humans, and has multiple transcript variants, with one leading to a nonfunctional variant due to a frameshift and premature stop codon (Finno2015SERPINB11).

## Function
SERPINB11 is a member of the serpin family, which typically functions as serine protease inhibitors. However, SERPINB11 has lost its inhibitory activity, suggesting it may have evolved a non-inhibitory function in humans (Finno2015SERPINB11; Seixas2015The). The gene is expressed in various human tissues, including the tonsil, lung, placenta, and prostate, indicating a potential role in these areas (Finno2015SERPINB11).

The protein's function in healthy human cells remains largely uncharacterized, but it is hypothesized to play a role in immune response and host-pathogen interactions. This is supported by its association with environmental conditions and pathogen diversity, suggesting a role in innate immunity (Seixas2012Loss). The gene's evolutionary history indicates that it may have been subject to positive selection, particularly in African populations, which could imply an adaptive advantage in response to environmental changes and pathogen exposure (Seixas2012Loss).

SERPINB11 may also function as a chaperone protein, similar to other serpins like SERPINF1 and SERPINH1, which are involved in processes such as procollagen folding and osteogenesis (Finno2015SERPINB11). However, its exact molecular activities and cellular roles require further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SERPINB11 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In Connemara ponies, a frameshift variant in SERPINB11 is linked to Hoof Wall Separation Disease (HWSD), a condition characterized by the separation of the dorsal hoof wall. This variant results in a truncated protein due to a premature stop codon, significantly affecting hoof integrity (Finno2015SERPINB11).

In humans, SERPINB11 has been implicated in ovarian cancer. High expression levels of SERPINB11 are observed in ovarian endometrioid carcinoma in chickens, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for ovarian cancer in humans (Lim2012Avian). In high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) of the ovary, high SERPINB11 expression is associated with worse progression-free and overall survival, indicating its potential role in cancer prognosis (PARK2021SERPINB11Expression).

Additionally, SERPINB11 is linked to Crohn's disease, an inflammatory condition. The X90E polymorphism in SERPINB11 shows a significant association with Crohn's disease, suggesting a role in host-pathogen interactions and immune response (Seixas2012Loss). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SERPINB11 in various pathological conditions.
