# TSHR

## Overview
The TSHR gene encodes the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, a critical component of the endocrine system. This receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) predominantly expressed in thyroid follicular cells, where it mediates the effects of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) on thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. The TSHR protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes a leucine-rich repeat domain (LRRD) and a serpentine domain formed by seven transmembrane helices, which are essential for its function in signal transduction (Kleinau2017Structural–Functional; Krause2012Extended). The receptor's activation involves interactions with G proteins, leading to the regulation of intracellular cyclic AMP levels, which are crucial for thyroid function (Boutin2020TSH). Mutations in the TSHR gene are associated with various thyroid disorders, including congenital hypothyroidism and resistance to thyrotropin, highlighting its clinical significance (Abramowicz1997Familial; Sunthornthepvarakul1995Resistance).

## Structure
The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids forming distinct domains, such as the leucine-rich repeat domain (LRRD) and the hinge region, which are crucial for hormone binding and signal transduction (Kleinau2017Structural–Functional; Krause2012Extended). The LRRD, approximately 400 amino acids long, is the main binding site for hormones and autoantibodies and is characterized by a scythe blade-like shape stabilized by hydrophobic and aromatic interactions (Kleinau2017Structural–Functional; Krause2012Extended).

The secondary structure of TSHR includes beta-sheets in the LRRD and a serpentine domain formed by seven transmembrane helices (Kleinau2017Structural–Functional). The tertiary structure is horseshoe-like, facilitating hormone binding, with β-sheets oriented towards the interior (Szkudlinski2002ThyroidStimulating). The hinge region contains disulfide bridges that stabilize the receptor's structure, essential for TSH binding and signal transduction (Kleinau2017Structural–Functional).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation at six asparagine residues, are crucial for the expression of biologically active TSHR (Szkudlinski2002ThyroidStimulating). The receptor undergoes natural processing into two subunits, though the functional significance of this cleavage remains unclear (Korta2019Glycosylation).

## Function
The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in thyroid follicular cells, where it plays a crucial role in regulating thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. TSHR activation by thyrotropin (TSH) leads to the regulation of various thyroid-specific genes, including thyroglobulin (TG), thyroperoxidase (TPO), iodothyronine deiodinase type 2 (DIO2), and sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), which are essential for thyroid hormone production and function (Jang2020Thyrotropin). The receptor is involved in signal transduction processes that include reception, conversion, and amplification of signals across the cell membrane, which are dependent on its structural features and interaction with molecules such as TSH, antibodies, and G-proteins (Kleinau2017Structural–Functional).

TSHR couples to G proteins of all four subfamilies, including the stimulatory G protein Gs, which activates adenylyl cyclase to produce cyclic AMP (cAMP), and Gi, which inhibits cAMP production. This regulation of cAMP is crucial for thyroid function (Boutin2020TSH). The receptor's activation involves conformational changes that facilitate the binding of intracellular partners, leading to the production of thyroid hormones, which are critical for various physiological processes, including metabolism, growth, and development (Kleinau2017Structural–Functional; Kleinau2013Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TSHR gene are associated with several thyroid-related conditions. Congenital hypothyroidism is one such condition, often resulting from inactivating mutations in the TSHR gene. These mutations can lead to thyroid hypoplasia or athyrosis, characterized by high TSH levels and low thyroid hormone levels. The Ala 553 to Thr (A553T) mutation is a notable example, causing profound hypoplasia of the thyroid gland and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (Abramowicz1997Familial).

In Japan, the p.R450H mutation in the TSHR gene is prevalent among patients with congenital hypothyroidism, often due to a founder effect. This mutation is associated with milder forms of the disease, likely because of its residual function (Narumi2009TSHRMutations).

Resistance to thyrotropin is another condition linked to TSHR mutations. This condition is characterized by elevated TSH levels despite normal thyroid hormone levels, due to impaired receptor function. Compound heterozygous mutations in the TSHR gene can lead to this resistance, as seen in a study where affected individuals required higher TSH levels for normal receptor activity (Sunthornthepvarakul1995Resistance).

Monoallelic TSHR mutations have also been associated with congenital hypothyroidism, although they do not always cause elevated TSH levels. These mutations may act as risk factors, potentially in combination with other genetic factors like DUOX2 mutations (Abe2018Association).

## Interactions
The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that engages in various interactions with proteins and antibodies. TSHR primarily interacts with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and G proteins, such as the Gs-protein, to transduce extracellular signals into intracellular responses (Kleinau2017Structural–Functional). The receptor also forms complexes with β-arrestin 1, which stabilizes a preformed signaling complex involving the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). This interaction is crucial for the functional crosstalk between TSHR and IGF1R, as demonstrated by the proximity of these receptors in human cell systems (Krieger2020TSHIGF1).

TSHR interacts with various antibodies, including the blocking-type autoantibody K1-70 and the stimulating-type autoantibody M22. These antibodies bind to overlapping regions on the TSHR, particularly the concave surface of the leucine-rich domain (LRD), with M22 forming more extensive interactions than K1-70 (Sanders2011Crystal). The interactions involve hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic contacts, which are critical for the antibodies' inhibitory or stimulating effects on TSHR activity (Sanders2011Crystal). These interactions are essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying thyroid-related diseases.
