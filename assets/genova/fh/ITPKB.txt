# ITPKB

## Overview
Inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase B (ITPKB) is a gene that encodes a kinase enzyme involved in the phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4). This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling, particularly within the immune system, where it influences T and B cell development and function. The ITPKB protein is characterized by its catalytic and calmodulin (CaM) binding domains, which are essential for its regulatory activities (Chamberlain2005Structural). Through its enzymatic action, ITPKB modulates key signaling pathways, such as the Ras-ERK pathway, and affects processes like chemotaxis and calcium-dependent apoptotic pathways (Almutairi2020Severe; Schell2010Inositol). Beyond its enzymatic functions, ITPKB also interacts with the cytoskeleton, influencing cellular structure and movement (Koenig2015Regulation). Clinically, alterations in the ITPKB gene have been associated with various immune disorders and cancers, underscoring its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Elich2018Regulation; Rae2015A).

## Structure
The ITPKB protein, encoded by the ITPKB gene, is a crucial enzyme involved in the phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. The primary structure of ITPKB consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, including a catalytic domain and a calmodulin (CaM) binding domain. The CaM binding domain is characterized by a 1-10 class CaM recognition motif, which is significant for its regulatory function (Chamberlain2005Structural).

The secondary structure of ITPKB includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the CaM binding domain forming an antiparallel β-sheet that mediates dimerization in the presence of CaM (Chamberlain2005Structural). The tertiary structure of ITPKB reveals a homodimeric arrangement, with the catalytic domains linked by the β-sheet in the CaM binding region (Chamberlain2005Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by PKA, PKC, and CaMKII, regulate ITPKB's enzymatic activity (Chamberlain2005Structural). The protein also undergoes proteolysis by calpain, which affects its function. ITPKB has splice variant isoforms that may result in different functional forms, contributing to its diverse roles in cellular signaling (Schurmans2011Regulation).

## Function
The ITPKB gene encodes the enzyme inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase B, which plays a crucial role in immune cell signaling, particularly in T and B cell development and function. In T cells, ITPKB is essential for proper maturation in the thymus, influencing the selection process. It converts inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) into inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), which modulates signaling pathways such as the Ras-ERK pathway and enhances the phosphorylation of downstream targets by binding to interleukin-2 inducible T cell tyrosine kinase (ITK) (Schell2010Inositol). IP4 also competes with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP3) for AKT binding, limiting AKT activation and dampening store-operated calcium entry, which inhibits calcium-dependent apoptotic pathways (Almutairi2020Severe).

In neutrophils, ITPKB-generated IP4 competes with PIP3 for binding to the tyrosine kinase AKT, affecting processes like chemotaxis and the respiratory burst (Schell2010Inositol). ITPKB also has a non-enzymatic role in the immune system, potentially involving the regulation of the cytoskeleton through interactions with Rho GTPases and F-actin, influencing lymphocyte development, polarity, and function (Schell2010Inositol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITPKB gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. ITPKB plays a crucial role in regulating B cell development and function, and its deficiency has been associated with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), characterized by reduced serum IgG and IgA, recurrent infections, and impaired immune responses (Elich2018Regulation). In the context of cancer, ITPKB mutations, including deletions and missense mutations, have been identified as potential drivers in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and are associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt's lymphoma, and transformed follicular lymphoma (FL) (Elich2018Regulation).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), alterations in ITPKB are linked to poorer overall and disease-free survival, with patients exhibiting significantly shorter survival times compared to those without such alterations (Rae2015A). ITPKB is also implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), where it may influence disease progression through its role in calcium signaling and protection against alpha-synuclein aggregation (Fang2022Association). These findings suggest that ITPKB is a significant factor in both immune-related conditions and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ITPKB interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It is involved in the activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway and interacts with the Tec family kinase Itk. In ITPKB-deficient thymocytes, Itk fails to localize to the plasma membrane or assemble with the adapter protein LAT in the TCR signalosome, indicating a requirement for IP4 in promoting Itk interactions. IP4 enhances the binding of the recombinant Itk PH domain to PIP3-coated beads, suggesting that IP4 may alter the Itk PH domain conformation to increase PIP3 accessibility (Wang2015Lipid).

ITPKB also interacts with the actin cytoskeleton. It co-localizes with F-actin during wound closure in Xenopus embryos, and its knockdown impairs F-actin assembly, indicating a close relationship with the actin cytoskeleton (Koenig2015Regulation). The F-actin-binding domain of ITPKB is located between amino acids 108 and 170, and proteolytic cleavage can separate the catalytic region from its cytoskeletal-targeting domain, affecting its cellular location and function (Schell2010Inositol).

Additionally, ITPKB is targeted by microRNA-711, which binds to the ITPKB gene and regulates its expression, as demonstrated by a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay (Zhang2020MicrogliaDerived).
