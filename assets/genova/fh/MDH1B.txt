# MDH1B

## Overview
MDH1B is a gene that encodes the enzyme malate dehydrogenase 1B, which is predicted to have malate dehydrogenase activity, although this has not been experimentally confirmed. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is involved in the citric acid cycle, where it is thought to catalyze the reversible conversion of malate to oxaloacetate using NAD+ as a cofactor. The MDH1B protein is distinguished by a unique thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-binding motif, which is not found in other malate dehydrogenase isoforms, suggesting a potential regulatory role for thiamin in its activity (Mkrtchyan2015Molecular). The gene is expressed in a limited number of tissues, including the pituitary gland and testis, and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, such as muscle metabolism, inflammatory conditions, and cancer progression (Haberman2024Genetics; Zhou2015HsamicroRNA181a). Despite its predicted functions, the specific roles and interactions of MDH1B in human cells remain largely unexplored, necessitating further research to fully understand its biological significance.

## Structure
The MDH1B protein is an isoform of malate dehydrogenase that features a unique ThDP-binding motif, which is not present in other known MDH isoforms. This motif is capable of binding Mg2+ and is located near the oxaloacetate/malate binding site, suggesting an allosteric site for thiamin (Mkrtchyan2015Molecular). The presence of this motif indicates structural differences that may contribute to the varying effects of thiamin on different MDH isoforms. The thiazole-binding pattern found in cytosolic MDH1 suggests potential thiamin interaction with this isoform as well (Mkrtchyan2015Molecular).

MDH1B is predicted to have malate dehydrogenase activity, although this has not been experimentally confirmed. It has six reported isoforms, which are 29% identical to MDH1 over the entire length (Haberman2024Genetics). The structural motifs involved in thiamin binding, such as the thiamin diphosphokinase/ThiB pattern, have been identified in MDH1B, providing insights into its molecular structure (Mkrtchyan2015Molecular). However, specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of MDH1B are not provided in the available context.

## Function
MDH1B (malate dehydrogenase 1B) is a gene encoding an enzyme predicted to have malate dehydrogenase activity, although this has not been experimentally confirmed. The enzyme is involved in the citric acid cycle, catalyzing the reversible conversion of malate to oxaloacetate using NAD+ as a cofactor, which is crucial for cellular respiration and energy production. MDH1B is expressed in a limited number of tissues, notably the pituitary gland and testis, and its role in these tissues remains largely unexplored (Haberman2024Genetics).

MDH1B has six reported isoforms, sharing 29% identity with MDH1, another malate dehydrogenase enzyme. Its expression is downregulated in the skeletal muscle of rheumatoid arthritis patients post-exercise, suggesting a potential role in muscle metabolism or response to stress (Haberman2024Genetics). Despite its predicted enzymatic activity, the specific function of MDH1B in healthy human cells is not well understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in the tissues where it is expressed. The protein's activity in the cytoplasm suggests it may contribute to metabolic pathways and maintaining cellular redox balance, similar to other malate dehydrogenase enzymes (Haberman2024Genetics).

## Clinical Significance
MDH1B, a gene encoding an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression. Although the specific role of MDH1B mutations in diseases is not fully understood, it has been identified as one of the genes with non-synonymous mutations associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (Wang2020Frequent). Additionally, MDH1B expression is downregulated in the skeletal muscle of rheumatoid arthritis patients following exercise, suggesting a potential role in inflammatory conditions (Haberman2024Genetics).

In the context of cancer, MDH1B is part of a prognostic model for cervical cancer, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (Haberman2024Genetics). The gene is also mentioned as a target of hsa-miR-181a-5p, a microRNA involved in regulating cancer-related genes, suggesting that alterations in MDH1B expression or interactions could contribute to cancer development (Zhou2015HsamicroRNA181a).

Furthermore, MDH1B is downregulated in skin fibroblasts from individuals with marginal MCC deficiency, a condition linked to metabolic and neurological symptoms, highlighting its role in metabolic pathways and potential impact on cellular functions (L2016Biochemical).

## Interactions
MDH1B is part of a predicted multi-protein complex associated with the biogenesis of cilia and flagella. This complex includes proteins such as CATIP, RIIAD1, CFAP91, AKAP14, AK9, and MORN5, with CFAP91 acting as a scaffold for assembly. The involvement of this complex in flagella biogenesis and sperm motility is supported by evidence linking CFAP91 and CATIP to cell skeleton organization during cilia/flagella biogenesis, and AK9 to sperm mobility. Although specific interactions of MDH1B with other proteins in this complex are not detailed, its inclusion suggests a role in these processes (Zhang2024Computing).

MDH1B also features a unique thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-binding motif, which is not present in other known MDH isoforms. This motif may facilitate interactions with thiamin and its derivatives, potentially forming a bridge with Mg2+ to the diphosphate group of ThDP. These interactions suggest a regulatory role for thiamin in MDH1B activity, although direct protein-protein interactions involving MDH1B are not specified (Mkrtchyan2015Molecular). The potential for thiamin to regulate enzyme activity through specific binding interactions is noted, but specific partners for MDH1B are not identified (Mkrtchyan2015Molecular).
