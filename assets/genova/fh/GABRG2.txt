# GABRG2

## Overview
The GABRG2 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptor subunit gamma2, a critical component of the GABA A receptor complex, which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The gamma2 subunit plays a pivotal role in the receptor's synaptic localization and function, contributing to both phasic and tonic inhibition by facilitating the entry of chloride ions into neurons, thereby reducing neuronal excitability (Chen2012Investigation; Essrich1998Postsynaptic). This subunit is also a key target for benzodiazepines, which enhance the receptor's inhibitory effects (LorenzGuertin2018γ2). Mutations in the GABRG2 gene have been linked to various epilepsy syndromes and other neurological disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal brain function and inhibitory signaling (Wallace2001Mutant; Shen2016De).

## Structure
The GABRG2 gene encodes the gamma-2 subunit of the GABA A receptor, a crucial component in inhibitory neurotransmission. The protein structure includes a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) for ligand binding, a transmembrane domain (TMD) with four α-helical regions (M1-M4), and a small intracellular loop between M1-M2. The M2 region forms the ion channel pore, allowing the selective passage of chloride ions (Li2024GABRG2; LorenzGuertin2018γ2). The intracellular domain (ICD) between M3 and M4 is significant for interactions with intracellular proteins essential for receptor trafficking and synaptic clustering (LorenzGuertin2018γ2).

The γ2 subunit is involved in synaptic localization via interactions with gephyrin and contributes to phasic currents. It is also a target for benzodiazepines, which bind at the interface of a γ2 subunit and an α1/2/3/5 subunit, enhancing GABA A receptor function (LorenzGuertin2018γ2). The γ2 subunit has two isoforms, γ2S and γ2L, with the latter having additional residues in the ICD (LorenzGuertin2018γ2). Post-translational modifications include ubiquitination, which targets the subunit for endo-lysosomal degradation (LorenzGuertin2018γ2).

## Function
The GABRG2 gene encodes the gamma-2 subunit of the GABA A receptor, a critical component of the central nervous system's inhibitory neurotransmission system. This receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that facilitates the entry of chloride ions into neurons, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability (Chen2012Investigation). The gamma-2 subunit is essential for the postsynaptic clustering of GABA A receptors, which is crucial for their proper localization and function at synapses (Essrich1998Postsynaptic). This clustering is mediated by interactions with gephyrin, a protein that helps anchor the receptors to the cytoskeleton, although the interaction is likely indirect and may involve other stabilizing proteins (Essrich1998Postsynaptic).

In healthy human cells, the gamma-2 subunit is involved in both phasic and tonic inhibition, contributing to the receptor's benzodiazepine sensitivity and playing a significant role in receptor trafficking, clustering, and synaptic maintenance (Shi2010Mutational). The presence of the gamma-2 subunit is crucial for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of GABAergic synapses, which is vital for normal brain function and inhibitory signaling (Essrich1998Postsynaptic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GABRG2 gene, which encodes the gamma-2 subunit of the GABA A receptor, are associated with a range of epilepsy syndromes and other neurological disorders. These mutations can lead to epileptic encephalopathies, characterized by severe childhood-onset epilepsy with medication-resistant seizures and poor developmental outcomes. Specific de novo missense mutations, such as A106T, I107T, P282S, R323Q, R323W, and F343L, have been identified in patients with these conditions, impairing GABA A receptor biogenesis and function, which are crucial for inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain (Shen2016De).

The R43Q mutation in GABRG2 is linked to childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) and febrile seizures (FS), affecting the receptor's sensitivity to benzodiazepines and contributing to increased neuronal excitability (Wallace2001Mutant). Other mutations, such as the p.R136* mutation, are associated with genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and result in impaired receptor trafficking and function, leading to reduced GABAergic inhibition (Johnston2014A).

These mutations highlight the role of GABRG2 in various forms of epilepsy and related neurological disorders, with alterations in its expression or function potentially leading to increased susceptibility to seizures and other neurodevelopmental challenges (Li2024GABRG2).

## Interactions
The GABRG2 gene encodes the γ2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function and localization. GABRG2 interacts with gephyrin, a scaffolding protein that stabilizes the clustering of GABA-A receptors at inhibitory synapses, particularly those containing the γ2 subunit (Chen2024Proteome). The γ2 subunit also forms complexes with neuroligin 2 and Lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 4 (Lhfpl4), which are essential for synaptic anchoring and stabilization of the receptors at inhibitory synapses (Chen2024Proteome).

Ubiquilin 1 (Plic-1) is involved in the ubiquitination and stabilization of GABA-A receptors, preventing their degradation and facilitating their assembly at synaptic sites (Chen2024Proteome). GABA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) enhances the delivery of γ-containing receptors to the cell surface, interacting specifically with γ1, γ2S, and γ2L subunits (Chen2024Proteome). N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) works with GABARAP to facilitate GABA-A receptor trafficking from the Golgi to the cell membrane (Chen2024Proteome).

Mutations in GABRG2, such as R136*, Q390*, and W429*, affect the structural stability and interactions of the γ2 subunit, leading to reduced surface expression and impaired receptor function (Wang2016Differential). These mutations can result in phenotypic heterogeneity in epilepsy syndromes (Wang2016Differential).
