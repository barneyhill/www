# SLC66A1

## Overview
SLC66A1 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 66 member 1, also known as PQLC2. This protein is categorized as a lysosomal amino acid transporter and is integral to the lysosomal membrane. It facilitates the export of cationic amino acids, such as lysine, arginine, and histidine, from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol, thereby playing a critical role in maintaining cellular amino acid homeostasis (Bersuker2024Morphological; Huang2023Deciphering). The protein is also involved in the regulation of lysosomal acidification, which is essential for its transport activity and lysosomal homeostasis (Bersuker2024Morphological). Additionally, SLC66A1 is implicated in the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), suggesting a regulatory role in lysosomal proteolysis (Bersuker2024Morphological). Despite its involvement in these processes, SLC66A1 does not exhibit significant turnover under stress conditions such as glucose starvation, indicating a stable presence in the lysosomal membrane (Lee2021Getting).

## Function
SLC66A1, also known as PQLC2, is a lysosomal amino acid transporter involved in the export of cationic amino acids such as lysine, arginine, and histidine from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol. This function is crucial for maintaining amino acid homeostasis within cells (Bersuker2024Morphological; Huang2023Deciphering). SLC66A1 is localized to the lysosomal membrane, where it plays a role in lysosomal homeostasis and protein degradation. It is implicated in the regulation of lysosomal acidification, which is essential for its optimal transport activity (Bersuker2024Morphological).

The protein is also involved in the degradation of EGFR-RFP, a process that is linked to its function in amino acid transport across the lysosomal membrane. Although deletion of SLC66A1 does not significantly affect basal EGFR-RFP expression levels, it is involved in the degradation pathway, suggesting a regulatory role in lysosomal proteolysis (Bersuker2024Morphological).

In the context of stress conditions such as glucose starvation, SLC66A1 does not show significant turnover, indicating that it may not be a primary target of microautophagy under these conditions (Lee2021Getting). The specific role of SLC66A1 in healthy human cells, particularly in relation to thyroid function, remains an area of ongoing research (Huang2023Deciphering).
