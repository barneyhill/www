# SCD5

## Overview
The SCD5 gene encodes the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase 5, a member of the fatty acyl desaturase family, which plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids. This enzyme is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, characterized by its four transmembrane domains and conserved histidine clusters that are essential for its catalytic function (Wang2005Characterization; Lu2020Whole). SCD5 is primarily expressed in the brain, pancreas, and gonads, where it influences various cellular processes, including membrane fluidity, energy storage, and signal transduction (Igal2021StearoylCoA). The gene's expression and activity are implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, such as neuronal development, cancer, and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Zámbó2022A; Ganner2023SCD5).

## Structure
The SCD5 protein is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, characterized by four transmembrane domains and conserved histidine clusters essential for its function as a fatty-acyl desaturase (Wang2005Characterization; Lu2020Whole). These histidine-rich motifs are crucial for the catalytic activity of the enzyme, facilitating the conversion of saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids (Wang2005Characterization).

SCD5 exists in two isoforms, SCD5 isoform 1 and SCD5 isoform 2, with lengths of 330 and 256 amino acids, respectively. Both isoforms contain four alpha-helical transmembrane regions, which contribute to their structural stability and function (Lu2020Whole). The primary structure of SCD5 includes a highly conserved tryptophan residue at position 209, located in the third transmembrane region, which is critical for its function (Lu2020Whole).

Alternative splicing of the SCD5 gene results in two transcript variants, SCD5A and SCD5B, which differ in their C-terminal protein structure. SCD5A is more abundantly expressed than SCD5B, and this difference in expression is attributed to the functionality of splice sites (Orosz2023Molecular). The alternative splicing may lead to variations in protein function, localization, and interactions (Orosz2023Molecular).

## Function
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 5 (SCD5) is a δ-9 fatty acyl desaturase enzyme involved in the conversion of saturated fatty acids (SFA) to monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) by introducing a double bond at the cis-Δ9 position. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the synthesis of MUFAs like oleyl-CoA from stearoyl-CoA, which are essential for maintaining cellular membrane fluidity, energy storage, and signal transduction (Wang2005Characterization; Igal2021StearoylCoA).

SCD5 is primarily expressed in the brain, pancreas, and gonads, suggesting a role in brain development and function, as well as in other tissues where it may support specific desaturase activities necessary for cellular processes (Igal2021StearoylCoA). In neuronal cells, SCD5 influences cell proliferation and differentiation by modulating signaling pathways such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-Akt/ERK and Wnt pathways, which are critical for neuronal growth and maturation (Sinner2012StearoylCoA).

SCD5 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it participates in lipid metabolism, contributing to the maintenance of cellular lipid homeostasis (Wang2005Characterization). Its activity in lipid biosynthesis and signaling pathways underscores its importance in cellular function and organismal development (Igal2021StearoylCoA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SCD5 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), SCD5 expression is significantly downregulated, which is associated with increased cell proliferation and a shift in lipid metabolism towards ceramide production. This downregulation is linked to shorter overall survival in patients, suggesting a prognostic value for SCD5 expression in ccRCC (Ganner2023SCD5).

SCD5 has also been implicated in autosomal dominant nonsyndromic deafness. A specific missense mutation, c.626G > C, in the SCD5 gene has been identified as a causative factor for this condition, affecting auditory function by altering the protein's role in lipid metabolism within the cochlea (Lu2020Whole).

In diabetes mellitus, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the SCD5 promoter region, rs3811792, reduces promoter activity and is associated with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This SNP affects transcription factor binding, potentially contributing to the development of diabetes by altering SCD5 expression (Zámbó2022A).

SCD5 expression changes have also been linked to cancer, serving as a tumor marker and influencing tumor cell survival and metastatic potential. Its expression can affect the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, reducing metastasis likelihood (Orosz2023Molecular).

## Interactions
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 5 (SCD5) is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. SCD5 modulates key signaling pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-Akt/ERK and Wnt pathways, which are crucial for neuronal cell proliferation and differentiation. SCD5 activity results in lower levels of EGFR phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation, suggesting that the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) products of SCD5 activity downregulate EGFR activation. This downregulation extends to downstream effectors like Akt and ERK, indicating that SCD5 negatively modulates the EGFR-Akt/ERK signaling platform (Sinner2012StearoylCoA).

SCD5 also influences Wnt signaling pathways by decreasing canonical Wnt activity while increasing non-canonical Wnt activity. It affects the synthesis and secretion of Wnt proteins, specifically reducing Wnt7b and increasing Wnt5a secretion, which may alter Wnt-induced signaling activity (Sinner2012StearoylCoA). The enzyme's role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the desaturation of palmitic acid to palmitoleic acid, is linked to these signaling interactions, as the altered lipid composition can impact signaling pathways and cellular behavior (Sinner2012StearoylCoA). These interactions highlight SCD5's role in modulating cellular proliferation and differentiation through its influence on lipid metabolism and signaling pathways.
