# PROS1

## Overview
The PROS1 gene encodes protein S, a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood coagulation. Protein S functions primarily as a cofactor for activated protein C (APC), enhancing its anticoagulant activity by facilitating the inactivation of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, thus preventing excessive thrombin generation and clot formation (Hackeng2006Protein; Hurtado2008Functional). Additionally, protein S acts independently as a cofactor for tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), contributing to the inhibition of factor Xa and the tissue factor pathway, which is crucial for maintaining hemostatic balance (Hackeng2006Protein). Beyond its anticoagulant functions, protein S is involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation and apoptosis, by acting as an agonist for tyrosine kinase receptors MERTK and TYRO3 (Simakou2024PROS1). Mutations in the PROS1 gene are associated with hereditary protein S deficiency, a condition that increases the risk of thrombotic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Larsen2021Genetic).

## Structure
Protein S, encoded by the PROS1 gene, is a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein involved in anticoagulation. Its primary structure includes a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain, a thrombin-sensitive region, four epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and a sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-like domain, which is subdivided into two laminin G (LG) domains (Studer2014Understanding; Nyberg1998The). The SHBG-like region is crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as complement component C4-binding protein (C4BP) and factor Va (FVa) (Villoutreix2001Threedimensional).

The secondary structure of protein S features beta-sheets and alpha-helices, with the SHBG-like domain containing two globular G-type domains necessary for high-affinity binding to C4BP (Evenäs1999Both). The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds and potential calcium-binding sites, particularly in the first LG domain, which may enhance C4BP binding (Villoutreix2001Threedimensional).

Post-translational modifications of protein S include gamma-carboxylation and glycosylation, which are important for its function and stability (Studer2014Understanding). Protein S exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Studer2014Understanding).

## Function
The PROS1 gene encodes protein S, a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood coagulation. Protein S functions as a cofactor for activated protein C (APC), enhancing its ability to inactivate coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, thereby preventing excessive thrombin generation and clot formation (Hackeng2006Protein; Hurtado2008Functional). In addition to its role with APC, protein S also acts independently as a cofactor for tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), promoting the inhibition of factor Xa and the tissue factor (TF) pathway, which is essential for maintaining hemostatic balance (Hackeng2006Protein).

Protein S exists in two forms in plasma: free and bound to the complement component C4b-binding protein (C4BP). The free form is primarily responsible for its anticoagulant activities, while the bound form may play a role in localizing C4BP to phospholipid membranes, potentially regulating complement system activation (Dahlbäck1981High; Heeb2008Role). Beyond coagulation, protein S is involved in cellular processes such as inflammation and apoptosis, acting as an agonist for tyrosine kinase receptors MERTK and TYRO3, which influence immune cell phenotypes and vascular permeability (Simakou2024PROS1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PROS1 gene, which encodes protein S, are clinically significant due to their association with various thrombotic disorders. Hereditary protein S deficiency, often resulting from mutations in the PROS1 gene, is a well-documented condition that increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thrombosis events (ATE) (Larsen2021Genetic). This deficiency can be caused by point mutations, as well as large deletions or duplications in the gene, which are relatively common in cases where point mutations are absent (Pintao2009Gross).

Specific mutations, such as the c.1820 T > C:p.Leu607Ser mutation, have been linked to decreased protein S activity, leading to conditions like venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (Zhang2021A). Other mutations, including nonsense and frameshift mutations, can lead to reduced or undetectable protein S secretion, impacting protein synthesis or stability (Hurtado2008Functional).

Alterations in PROS1 expression levels have also been implicated in cancer. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), PROS1 is upregulated, and its silencing has been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit cell migration and invasion, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for GBM treatment (Mat2016Silencing). In low-grade gliomas, PROS1 expression is significantly increased, indicating its role in tumor progression (Zhou2022LncRNA).

## Interactions
Protein S, encoded by the PROS1 gene, is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood coagulation through various interactions with other proteins. It acts as a cofactor for activated protein C (APC) in the degradation of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, thereby regulating thrombin generation (Rezende2004Coagulation). Protein S also exhibits anticoagulant functions independent of APC by directly binding to and inhibiting factors Xa and Va (Hackeng1994Human; Heeb1994Protein).

Protein S forms a high-affinity complex with C4b-binding protein (C4BP), a regulator of the classical complement pathway. This interaction is highly specific, with a dissociation constant (K_D) of 0.1 nM, indicating a strong binding affinity (Linse1997A). The binding site for C4BP on protein S is located within the SHBG-like domain, involving residues 447-460 (Linse1997A). Approximately 60% of plasma protein S circulates in a noncovalent complex with C4BP, while the free fraction retains full anticoagulant properties (Gierula2020Anticoagulant).

Protein S also interacts with tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), enhancing its ability to inhibit factor Xa. This interaction involves the laminin G-like domains of protein S (Somajo2015Amino). Additionally, protein S is a ligand for receptor tyrosine kinases of the TAM-family, which may play a role in various cellular processes (Villoutreix2001Threedimensional).
