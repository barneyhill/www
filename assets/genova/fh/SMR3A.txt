# SMR3A

## Overview
The SMR3A gene encodes the submaxillary gland androgen regulated protein 3A, a member of the opiorphin family, which functions as an endogenous inhibitor of neutral endopeptidases. This protein is primarily expressed in the salivary glands and is regulated by androgen hormones, with a notable expression in males. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of salivary gland function and the secretion processes of the submaxillary glands, contributing to oral health and digestion. The protein's activity in the extracellular space influences the tone of urogenital smooth muscle and erectile function by prolonging the action of peptide agonists at G-protein-coupled receptors (St.2015Calciumbinding; Davies2009The). In addition to its physiological roles, SMR3A has clinical significance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where its expression levels are associated with patient prognosis and treatment outcomes (Grünow2017Regulation; Rong2022Conjoint).

## Function
The SMR3A gene encodes a protein that is part of the opiorphin family, which acts as endogenous neutral endopeptidase inhibitors. In healthy human cells, SMR3A is involved in the regulation of salivary gland function, particularly in the secretion processes of the submaxillary glands. The protein is expressed in response to androgen hormones and is active in the extracellular space, contributing to the composition of saliva. This activity potentially influences oral health and digestion by regulating the tone of urogenital smooth muscle and erectile function through the inhibition of neutral endopeptidase, thereby prolonging the action of peptide agonists at G-protein-coupled receptors (Davies2009The).

SMR3A is also expressed in various human tissues, including the salivary glands, where it may play a role in maintaining the physiological balance of the oral cavity. The protein's expression is hormonally regulated, with higher levels observed in males, suggesting a role in male-specific physiological processes (St.2015Calciumbinding). While the precise molecular mechanisms of SMR3A in healthy cells are not fully elucidated, its involvement in salivary secretion and potential regulatory functions in smooth muscle tone highlight its importance in normal human physiology.

## Clinical Significance
The SMR3A gene has been implicated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly in the context of radiotherapy. High expression levels of SMR3A are associated with poor disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), suggesting that SMR3A may serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for survival in these patients (Rong2022Conjoint). The gene's expression is upregulated following fractionated ionizing radiation, indicating a potential role in radioresistance, which may lead to treatment failure and tumor relapse (Grünow2017Regulation; Rong2022Conjoint).

SMR3A is also linked to active estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) signaling in radioresistant tumor cells, and its co-expression with ESR2 is associated with a higher risk of treatment failure (Grünow2017Regulation). This suggests that SMR3A could be a marker for radioresistant tumor cells and might be targeted for therapeutic intervention. The combination of high SMR3A and low OPRPN expression is identified as the most unfavorable prognostic marker, further emphasizing its clinical significance in HNSCC (Rong2022Conjoint).
