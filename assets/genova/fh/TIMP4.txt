# TIMP4

## Overview
TIMP4, or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 4, is a gene that encodes the protein TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 4, which is a member of the TIMP family of proteins. This protein functions primarily as an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of enzymes involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix. TIMP4 is characterized as a non-glycosylated polypeptide and is the largest among the human TIMPs, consisting of 195 amino acids (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue). The protein is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and homeostasis by regulating MMP activity, particularly MMP-2. It is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, and adipose tissue, and plays roles in diverse physiological processes such as platelet function, apoptosis, and cell signaling (Radomski2002Identification; MelendezZajgla2008Tissue). TIMP4's interactions with cell surface receptors and its regulation by factors like promoter methylation and estrogen suggest additional roles beyond MMP inhibition, potentially influencing angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue).

## Structure
TIMP-4 is a non-glycosylated polypeptide consisting of 195 amino acids, making it the largest among the human inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue). The protein is divided into two distinct domains: a larger N-terminal domain responsible for MMP inhibitory activity and a smaller C-terminal domain that mediates non-inhibitory interactions (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue). The N-terminal domain is characterized by an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold, consisting of a five-stranded anti-parallel β-pleated sheet rolled into a β-barrel, stabilized by three disulfide bonds (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue). This domain also includes three α-helices associated with the β-barrel core (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue). The C-terminal domain features a β-hairpin plus a β-loop-β motif with two associated 3_10-helices, a fold unique to TIMPs (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue).

TIMP-4 contains twelve cysteine residues that form six conserved disulfide bridges, crucial for its structural stability (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue). The protein's interaction with MMPs involves occupying the MMP active-site cleft with a wedge-shaped inhibitor, with specificity influenced by residues at the molecular edge, particularly Ser2 in TIMP-4 (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue). TIMP-4 retains activity at more acidic pH levels compared to TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, which may be relevant in certain physiological and pathological conditions (Troeberg2002E.).

## Function
TIMP4 (TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 4) is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-2, which are involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components. This regulation is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and homeostasis. TIMP4 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, kidney, pancreas, colon, testes, and adipose tissue, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes (CabralPacheco2020The; MelendezZajgla2008Tissue).

In human platelets, TIMP4 is the predominant TIMP and is involved in modulating platelet function by inhibiting platelet aggregation induced by collagen and thrombin. It co-localizes with MMP-2 in resting platelets and is released during platelet aggregation, suggesting a role in regulating platelet recruitment and aggregation (Radomski2002Identification). TIMP4 also exhibits pro-apoptotic effects in certain cell types, such as rat vascular smooth muscle cells, highlighting its role in apoptosis regulation (Verstappen2006Tissue).

TIMP4's interaction with cell surface receptors, such as CD63, suggests it may have additional roles beyond MMP inhibition, potentially influencing cell signaling pathways related to angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue). Its expression is regulated by factors such as promoter methylation and estrogen, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the TIMP4 gene are associated with various diseases, particularly cancer. In cancer, TIMP4 expression is often dysregulated, with reduced levels observed in multiple tumor types, including adrenocortical carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, uterine carcinosarcoma, and uveal melanoma, where it is linked to poor prognosis (Wang2023An). Conversely, TIMP4 expression is upregulated in testicular germ cell tumors, indicating its involvement in both early and advanced stages of this cancer (Wang2023An). In glioblastoma, TIMP4 expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and may influence the tumor microenvironment, potentially affecting disease progression and prognosis (Han2021Comprehensive).

TIMP4 also plays a role in liposarcoma, where its expression is linked to less aggressive tumor behavior and better prognosis in well-differentiated liposarcoma. The transition from TIMP4 to TIMP1 expression is associated with more aggressive dedifferentiated liposarcoma, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for TIMP4 (Shrestha2019The). In gliomas, TIMP4 expression is higher in lower-grade tumors and decreases with increasing malignancy, indicating a potential role in tumor suppression (Groft2001Differential). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TIMP4 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TIMP4 interacts with various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), playing a significant role in inhibiting their activity. It binds to proMMP-2 and the isolated C-terminal HPX domain of MMP-2, although its affinity for proMMP-2 is about five times lower than for active MMP-2 (Troeberg2002E.). Unlike TIMP-2, TIMP-4 does not promote the activation of proMMP-2 by MT1-MMP due to differences in the C-terminal domain, which lacks key residues necessary for stabilizing interactions (WORLEY2003Sequence; MelendezZajgla2008Tissue). TIMP-4 also inhibits the catalytic domain of MMP-19 and MMP-26 and interacts with ADAM28 and ADAM33, but not ADAM10 (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue).

TIMP-4's interactions are influenced by its unique structural features, such as the AB-loop structure, which affects its binding kinetics and thermodynamics with MT1-MMP (MelendezZajgla2008Tissue). It forms less stable complexes with proMMP-2 compared to TIMP-2, attributed to weaker C-terminal interactions and the absence of certain hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (WORLEY2003Sequence). These interactions highlight TIMP-4's specificity and potential physiological roles in regulating extracellular matrix turnover and cellular signaling pathways.
