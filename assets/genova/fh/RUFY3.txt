# RUFY3

## Overview
RUFY3 is a gene that encodes the protein RUN and FYVE domain containing 3, which is a member of the RUFY protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of RUN, coiled-coil (CC), and FYVE domains, which are involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking and cytoskeleton dynamics. RUFY3 is expressed ubiquitously across different tissues, with particularly high expression in the brain, where it plays a significant role in neuronal development and function (Wang2015PAK1; KerenKaplan2021RUFY3). The protein functions as an effector of the small GTP-binding protein Arl8b, facilitating lysosomal positioning and size regulation, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kumar2022RUFY3). Additionally, RUFY3 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in gastric cancer, where it enhances cell migration and invasion through interactions with P21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1) and the transcription factor HOXD9 (Wang2015PAK1; Zhu2019HOXD9).

## Structure
RUFY3, also known as SINGAR1, RIPX, or ZFYVE30, is a member of the RUFY protein family characterized by the presence of RUN, coiled-coil (CC), and FYVE domains. The protein exists in multiple splice forms, with RUFY3.1 being the longer variant at 620 amino acids, containing all the domains typical of the RUFY family, and RUFY3.2 being a shorter variant at 469 amino acids, lacking part of the CC2 domain and the entire FYVE domain (KerenKaplan2022RUFY3; KerenKaplan2021RUFY3).

The RUN domain is involved in interactions with small GTPases and is crucial for maintaining protein solubility and interactions with motor proteins, suggesting a role in vesicular and organelle transport (Char2020The). The CC2 domain is essential for interaction with ARL8, a small GTPase, and is necessary for the protein's localization to mitochondria and vesicle association (KerenKaplan2022RUFY3). The FYVE domain, present in some isoforms, typically interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) on endosomal membranes, although in RUFY3, this domain may lack the typical histidine cluster for PtdIns(3)P binding (Char2020The).

RUFY3 is expressed in all cells and tissues, with higher expression in the brain, and is involved in neuronal development and function (Wang2015PAK1; KerenKaplan2021RUFY3). The protein's structure and domain organization contribute to its roles in intracellular trafficking and cytoskeleton dynamics.

## Function
RUFY3 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of lysosome positioning and size within cells. It acts as an effector of the small GTP-binding protein Arl8b, facilitating the recruitment of the JIP4-dynein-dynactin complex to lysosomes. This interaction is crucial for the retrograde transport of lysosomes towards the perinuclear region, maintaining their spatial organization and size, which is essential for cellular homeostasis (Kumar2022RUFY3). RUFY3's role in lysosome positioning is independent of Rab7, another protein involved in lysosomal trafficking, highlighting its unique function in lysosomal dynamics (Kumar2022RUFY3).

In healthy human cells, RUFY3 is essential for driving lysosomes to the perinuclear region, as demonstrated in various cell types, including HeLa and A549 cells. Its interaction with Arl8b is necessary for this function, and mutations that disrupt this binding prevent RUFY3 from localizing to lysosomes and altering their positioning (Kumar2022RUFY3). RUFY3 also plays a role in nutrient-dependent lysosome repositioning, particularly during nutrient starvation, although it does not affect autophagosome-lysosome fusion or autophagic cargo clearance (Kumar2022RUFY3).

## Clinical Significance
RUFY3 (RUN and FYVE domain containing 3) has been implicated in the progression of gastric cancer. Overexpression of RUFY3 in gastric cancer cells leads to enhanced cell migration and invasion, which are critical processes in cancer metastasis. This effect is mediated through its interaction with P21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1), a protein kinase involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. The PAK1-RUFY3 signaling pathway is suggested as a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer, as inhibition of PAK1 reduces RUFY3-induced cell migration and invasion (Wang2015PAK1).

RUFY3 is also a direct transcriptional target of the transcription factor HOXD9 in gastric cancer. HOXD9 overexpression increases RUFY3 expression, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This HOXD9-RUFY3 axis is associated with poor survival outcomes in gastric cancer patients and is considered a significant pathway in the disease's progression (Zhu2019HOXD9).

In the context of neuronal development, RUFY3 is essential for caspase-mediated axon degeneration. Alterations in RUFY3 expression or function can impact neuronal degeneration processes, although specific diseases are not directly mentioned (Hertz2019Neuronally).

## Interactions
RUFY3 interacts with the small G protein Arl8b, acting as an effector that binds to its wild-type and GTP-bound forms, but not the GDP-bound form. This interaction is crucial for lysosome positioning and size regulation, as RUFY3 localizes to lysosomes and its depletion leads to the redistribution of Arl8b to the cell periphery (Kumar2022RUFY3). RUFY3 also interacts with the JIP4-dynein-dynactin complex, facilitating the retrograde transport of lysosomes. This interaction enhances the colocalization of Arl8b and JIP4, and is necessary for the perinuclear clustering of lysosomes (Kumar2022RUFY3).

The interaction between RUFY3 and Arl8b is mediated by specific residues, R462 and K465, in the RUFY3 protein. Mutations in these residues disrupt the binding, highlighting their importance (Kumar2022RUFY3). RUFY3's role as a dynein adapter is further supported by its interaction with the dynein intermediate chain and the p150 Glued subunit of dynactin, which are components of the dynein-dynactin motor complex (KerenKaplan2022RUFY3). These interactions suggest that RUFY3 is integral to the coupling of endolysosomes to the dynein-dynactin complex, promoting their retrograde transport within cells (KerenKaplan2022RUFY3).
