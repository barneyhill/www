# MZT1

## Overview
MZT1, or mitotic spindle organizing protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the organization and function of the mitotic spindle, a key structure in cell division. The protein encoded by MZT1 is involved in the nucleation and stabilization of microtubules, primarily operating within the centrosome, which serves as the main microtubule-organizing center in animal cells. As a component of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC), MZT1 plays a significant role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis, thereby maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy. This function is vital for normal cell proliferation and organismal development, with implications for cancer and other diseases when disrupted (Masuda2013Fission; Cota2017MZT1).

## Function
MZT1, or mitotic spindle organizing protein 1, is a crucial component in the organization of the mitotic spindle, a structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. This protein is involved in the nucleation and stabilization of microtubules, which are critical for the proper assembly and function of the spindle apparatus. MZT1 operates primarily within the centrosome, a key cellular structure that serves as the main microtubule-organizing center in animal cells. By contributing to accurate mitosis, MZT1 plays a significant role in cell proliferation and organismal development. Its activity ensures that chromosomes are correctly segregated to daughter cells, maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy, which can lead to developmental abnormalities and diseases such as cancer. The proper function of MZT1 is therefore vital for healthy cell division and the overall growth and maintenance of tissues in the human body.

## Clinical Significance
The MZT1 gene, also known as mitotic spindle organizing protein 1, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in microtubule organization and cell division. Alterations in MZT1 expression or mutations can disrupt normal cell division processes, potentially contributing to cancer development. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MZT1 is part of a 4-gene risk signature associated with tumor budding, a process linked to cancer progression and metastasis. This signature correlates with immune cell infiltration, particularly showing a positive association with M2-like macrophages, which are known to promote tumor growth and suppress immune responses (Li2024Establish).

In Drosophila models, mutations in the MZT1 gene lead to defects in microtubule organization, specifically affecting the recruitment of γ-tubulin to basal bodies, which results in impaired sperm motility and age-related male sterility (Tovey2018γTuRC). Although these findings are in a model organism, they suggest potential implications for human fertility and microtubule-related disorders.

Additionally, MZT1 has been linked to syndromic intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder in humans, indicating its broader significance in neurodevelopmental conditions (Iglesias2024Identification). These associations highlight the importance of MZT1 in both cancer biology and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
MZT1, also known as mitotic spindle organizing protein 1, is involved in several critical interactions with components of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC), which is essential for microtubule nucleation. MZT1 directly binds to the N-termini of gamma-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs) such as GCP3, GCP5, and GCP6 through a conserved motif in their N-terminal extensions. This interaction is crucial for the proper targeting and activation of γTuRC at the centrosome (Cota2017MZT1). Mutations in the MZT1-binding motif of these GCPs disrupt their interaction with MZT1, leading to defects in centrosomal targeting and microtubule nucleation (Cota2017MZT1).

MZT1 also interacts with NEDD1 and CDK5RAP2, which are important for the activation of γTuRC's nucleation activity. It facilitates the interaction of γTuRC with NEDD1 and the CM1 domain of CDK5RAP2, which is crucial for microtubule nucleation (Cota2017MZT1). In fission yeast, Mzt1 interacts with Alp4 (GCP2/Spc97 homologue) and Alp6 (GCP3/Spc98 homologue), as well as γ-tubulin, confirming its role as a novel and essential component of the γ-tubulin complex (Masuda2013Fission). These interactions highlight MZT1's role in the spatial regulation and activation of the γTuRC.
