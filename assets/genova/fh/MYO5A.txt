# MYO5A

## Overview
MYO5A is a gene that encodes the motor protein myosin VA, which is a member of the unconventional myosin family. Myosin VA is a processive motor protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular transport by moving along actin filaments. It is involved in the transport and distribution of organelles, such as melanosomes and secretory vesicles, and is essential for various cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity and vesicle recycling. The protein's structure includes a motor domain with ATPase activity, a neck region that binds light chains, and a tail domain that interacts with cargo-binding proteins. Mutations in MYO5A are linked to disorders such as Griscelli syndrome type 1 and Lavender Foal Syndrome, highlighting its significance in both human and animal health (Ménasché2003Griscelli; Desnos2007‘Should; Brooks2010WholeGenome).

## Structure
MYO5A, or myosin VA, is a motor protein involved in intracellular transport, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of MYO5A includes a heavy chain with distinct domains: a motor domain, a neck region, and a tail domain. The motor domain contains ATPase activity essential for movement along actin filaments, while the neck region binds light chains such as calmodulin, which stabilize the lever arm for processive movement (Carew2023Differential; Trybus2008Myosin).

The secondary structure of MYO5A features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a compact motor domain, facilitating its interaction with actin and cargo (Yao2016Identification). The quaternary structure of MYO5A forms a dimer, which is crucial for its function as a processive motor protein (Trybus2008Myosin).

MYO5A also exhibits structural plasticity, particularly in its tail domain, which interacts with various cargo-binding proteins. This domain includes a globular tail domain (GTD) that interacts with Rab GTPases, playing a role in cargo recognition and recruitment (Pylypenko2013Structural). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, influencing its function and interactions (Carew2023Differential; Yao2016Identification).

## Function
MYO5A (myosin VA) is a motor protein that plays a critical role in intracellular transport processes by moving along actin filaments. It is involved in the transport and distribution of various organelles, such as melanosomes, secretory vesicles, and RNA, particularly in actin-rich regions of the cell (Salerno2008Myosin‐Va; Desnos2007‘Should). Myosin VA is recruited to organelles through interactions with Rab GTPases and forms complexes with proteins like Rab27a and melanophilin, which are essential for melanosome distribution (Desnos2007‘Should).

In neurons, myosin VA is responsible for targeting IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores to dendritic spines and transporting mRNAs, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and proper neuronal function (Salerno2008Myosin‐Va; Desnos2007‘Should). It also plays a role in synaptic vesicle recycling and replenishment, which is vital for maintaining vesicle availability for sustained synaptic release, particularly in photoreceptor synapses (Libby2004Myosin).

Myosin VA's activity is regulated by calcium ion concentrations and interactions with other proteins, which influence its conformational state and cargo binding capabilities (Desnos2007‘Should). Its function is essential for the proper distribution of organelles within cells, and its dysfunction can lead to significant cellular and physiological abnormalities (Desnos2007‘Should).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYO5A gene are associated with several disorders characterized by pigmentary and neurological abnormalities. Griscelli syndrome type 1 (GS1) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in MYO5A, leading to severe neurological impairments and pigmentary dilution. This condition is marked by developmental delays and mental retardation due to disrupted melanosome transport in melanocytes and neurons (Ménasché2003Griscelli). 

In horses, a deletion in the MYO5A gene causes Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), a lethal condition in Egyptian Arabian horses characterized by neurological abnormalities and a diluted coat color. This mutation results in a frameshift and premature stop codon, impairing the myosin Va protein's function in vesicle trafficking (Brooks2010WholeGenome).

In dogs, a frameshift variant in MYO5A has been linked to coat color dilution and neurological defects in miniature Dachshunds, resembling human GS1. This variant leads to a premature stop codon, affecting the protein's cargo-binding ability and resulting in pigmentary and neurological symptoms (Christen2021MYO5A).

Additionally, a novel MYO5A::NTRK3 fusion has been identified in a rare pediatric glioneuronal tumor, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis through altered cellular pathways (Chenoweth2024Rare).

## Interactions
MYO5A (myosin VA) is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its motor activity and cellular functions. It interacts with the globular tail domain (GTD) of other class V myosins, such as Myo5b and Myo5c, which can inhibit its ATPase activity, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism among these myosins (Yao2016Identification). The GTD of MYO5A also forms dimers that are crucial for maintaining its inhibited state, with specific residues like Arg 1490 and Lys 1491 playing a significant role in these interactions (Zhang2016The).

MYO5A interacts with melanophilin (Mlph), a cargo-binding protein, through its GTD. This interaction is modulated by specific mutations, such as R1490A/K1491A, which enhance the activation of MYO5A by Mlph-GTBDP (Zhang2016The). MYO5A also binds to microtubules and actin filaments, facilitating their cross-linking, which is crucial for cellular transport processes (Cao2004MyosinVa).

Additionally, MYO5A interacts with the cilia-centrosomal protein RPGRIP1L, which is important for ciliogenesis. This interaction occurs at the centrosome and involves the C2 domains of RPGRIP1L binding to the GTD of MYO5A (Assis2017The). These interactions highlight MYO5A's role in intracellular transport and cellular organization.
