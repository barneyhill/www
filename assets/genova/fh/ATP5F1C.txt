# ATP5F1C

## Overview
ATP5F1C is a gene that encodes the gamma subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, a key enzyme involved in cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation. The protein product, ATP synthase F1 subunit gamma, is a component of the F1 domain of the ATP synthase complex, which is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This subunit plays a crucial role in the enzyme's rotary mechanism, facilitating the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. As part of the central stalk, ATP5F1C interacts with other subunits to drive the catalytic activity necessary for ATP production, thereby maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. The proper function of ATP5F1C is essential for various cellular processes, and its dysregulation has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer, where it serves as a potential therapeutic target (Fiorillo2021Bedaquiline; Patel2020Natural).

## Structure
The ATP5F1C gene encodes the gamma subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, a crucial enzyme in cellular energy production. This subunit is part of the F1 domain of the ATP synthase complex, which is responsible for the catalytic activity of ATP synthesis. The F1 domain is composed of alternating α and β subunits, along with the central stalk that includes the γ, δ, and ε subunits, where ATP5F1C contributes to the central stalk (Tauchmannová2024Variability; Patel2020Natural).

The primary structure of the ATP5F1C protein consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its function and interaction with other subunits. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with other components of the ATP synthase complex. In terms of quaternary structure, ATP5F1C assembles with other subunits to form the complete ATP synthase complex, facilitating the enzyme's role in ATP production (Tauchmannová2024Variability; Patel2020Natural).

Post-translational modifications and potential splice variants may influence the function and regulation of ATP5F1C, although specific details on these aspects are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ATP5F1C gene encodes the gamma subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, a critical enzyme in cellular energy production. This enzyme is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is responsible for synthesizing ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate during oxidative phosphorylation. The gamma subunit, encoded by ATP5F1C, plays a pivotal role in the rotary mechanism of ATP synthase, which is essential for ATP generation. This rotary mechanism involves the rotation of the central stalk, of which the gamma subunit is a part, within the F1 catalytic head of the enzyme, facilitating the conversion of ADP to ATP (Fiorillo2021Bedaquiline; Patel2020Natural).

In healthy human cells, ATP5F1C is crucial for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis by ensuring efficient ATP production. This process is vital for supporting various cellular functions and energy-demanding processes across different tissues. The activity of ATP synthase, including the function of the gamma subunit, is integral to the overall bioenergetics of the cell, impacting processes such as cell growth, survival, and metabolism (Fiorillo2021Bedaquiline; Tauchmannová2024Variability). The proper functioning of ATP5F1C is therefore essential for the normal physiological operations of cells and the organism as a whole.

## Clinical Significance
The ATP5F1C gene, encoding the gamma subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase, plays a significant role in cancer, particularly breast cancer. Alterations in ATP5F1C expression are linked to increased mitochondrial ATP production, which is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, including enhanced proliferation, stemness, and drug resistance (Fiorillo2021Bedaquiline). High expression levels of ATP5F1C correlate with increased metastatic potential in cancer cells, especially in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, and are considered a prognostic biomarker for tumor recurrence and distant metastasis (Fiorillo2021Bedaquiline).

The FDA-approved drug Bedaquiline targets ATP5F1C, reducing its expression and thereby inhibiting mitochondrial ATP production and metastasis in vivo. This suggests that ATP5F1C is a promising therapeutic target for preventing metastatic disease progression without affecting non-tumorigenic cells (Fiorillo2021Bedaquiline). In breast cancer patients, ATP5F1C expression is higher in lymph-node metastases compared to primary tumors, indicating its role in cancer progression (Fiorillo2021Bedaquiline). Despite its significant role in cancer, mutations in ATP5F1C are not currently associated with any specific mitochondriopathies (Gaspar2018Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
ATP5F1C, also known as ATP synthase F1 subunit gamma, is a component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, which plays a crucial role in ATP production during oxidative phosphorylation. This protein is part of the F1 domain of the ATP synthase complex, interacting with other subunits such as ATP5F1A (alpha) and ATP5F1B (beta) to facilitate ATP synthesis (Patel2020Natural).

Various natural peptides and endogenous ligands interact with the F1FO ATP synthase complex, affecting its activity. For instance, efrapeptins bind to the F1 domain, inhibiting its catalytic activity by preventing the βE subunit from adopting a conformation suitable for nucleotide binding (Patel2020Natural). Yaku'amide B also interacts with the F1FO ATP synthase complex, inhibiting ATP synthesis and increasing ATP hydrolysis (Patel2020Natural). HAMLET, a proteolipid complex, binds to the α and β subunits of the F1FO ATPase, reducing cellular ATP levels and affecting the rotation rates of the molecular motor (Patel2020Natural).

Additionally, ATP5F1C is mentioned in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction in autoimmune-related kidney diseases, where it is part of a broader interaction network involving complement activation and mitochondrial proteins (Xiao2024Proteomic). However, specific physical interactions of ATP5F1C with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available excerpts.
