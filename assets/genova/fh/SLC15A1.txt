# SLC15A1

## Overview
The SLC15A1 gene encodes the solute carrier family 15 member 1 protein, commonly known as peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1), which is a member of the proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter (POT) family. This protein is primarily expressed in the small intestine and plays a critical role in the absorption of dietary dipeptides and tripeptides, as well as certain peptide-like drugs. PEPT1 is characterized as a transmembrane transporter with a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) fold, consisting of twelve transmembrane helices that facilitate substrate binding and translocation. The protein operates through a Na+-independent, pH-dependent, H+-coupled mechanism, making it essential for nutrient absorption and drug pharmacokinetics (Anderson2007Regulation; Killer2021Structural). Variations in the SLC15A1 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as dyslipidaemia and cancer, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Liu2019Association; Huang2021SLC15A4).

## Structure
The SLC15A1 gene encodes the human peptide transporter-1 (PEPT1), a member of the proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter (POT) family. PEPT1 is characterized by its major facilitator superfamily (MFS) fold, which consists of twelve transmembrane helices organized into two six-helix bundles. These bundles are connected by a long cytoplasmic linker known as the 'bundle bridge,' which is amphipathic and associated with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (Killer2021Structural). 

The protein's tertiary structure facilitates substrate binding and translocation, with the substrate binding site located between the transmembrane helices. The extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain (ECD) is situated between transmembrane helices 9 and 10, although it is not essential for substrate transport (Killer2021Structural). 

PEPT1 undergoes significant conformational changes during its transport cycle, transitioning between outward and inward-facing states. In the outward open state, the substrate binding cavity is widely exposed, allowing for solute interaction (Killer2021Structural). 

Post-translational modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation, are involved in protein folding and membrane targeting, as modeled in the ECD of PEPT1 (Killer2021Structural). These structural features are crucial for understanding the transport mechanism and potential drug interactions.

## Function
The SLC15A1 gene encodes the human peptide transporter 1 (hPepT1), a proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter primarily expressed in the small intestine. hPepT1 plays a crucial role in the absorption of dietary dipeptides and tripeptides by cotranslocating protons along the proton gradient at the brush border membrane of the small intestine (BajraktariSylejmani2022Evaluation). This transporter operates as a Na+-independent, pH-dependent, H+-coupled mechanism, facilitating the uptake of solutes across the intestinal epithelium (Anderson2007Regulation). 

hPepT1 is characterized as a high-capacity but low-affinity transporter with high substrate promiscuity, meaning it can transport nearly all physiological dipeptides and tripeptides, which is essential for the nutritional supply of amino acids (BajraktariSylejmani2022Evaluation). In addition to its role in nutrient absorption, hPepT1 is involved in the transport of various peptide-like drugs, including β-lactam antibiotics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, contributing to the pharmacokinetics of these therapeutic agents (Brecht2020Uptake; Anderson2007Regulation). The activity of hPepT1 can be modulated by changes in the transmembrane H+ gradient, which is influenced by the sodium/hydrogen exchanger NHE3 (Anderson2007Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC15A1 gene, which encodes the peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1), have been associated with various clinical implications. In the context of dyslipidaemia, specific genetic polymorphisms in SLC15A1 have been linked to altered risks of lipid disorders. For instance, the rs2297322 TT genotype and the rs1289389 T allele are associated with a lower risk of hypertriglyceridaemia, while the rs4646234 CC genotype is linked to a reduced risk of hypercholesterolaemia in a Chinese Han population (Liu2019Association).

In cancer, SLC15A1 expression is generally lower in most solid tumors, including lung cancer, compared to normal tissues, which may limit its clinical utility as a biomarker (Huang2021SLC15A4). However, SLC15A1 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in several cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer, where its expression level can influence the efficacy of treatments like doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (Huang2021SLC15A4).

The gene's role in drug absorption is also significant, as genetic variations can impact the pharmacokinetics of peptide-based drugs, potentially affecting drug efficacy and safety (Zaïr2008Pharmacogenetics).

## Interactions
The SLC15A1 gene encodes the human peptide transporter 1 (hPepT1), which is involved in the uptake of dipeptides, tripeptides, and certain peptide-like drugs. hPepT1 interacts with various proteins and inhibitors that modulate its activity. One significant interaction is with the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 (SLC9A3). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of hPepT1 activity, as NHE3 influences the transmembrane pH gradient necessary for hPepT1 function. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as caffeine, theophylline, and pentoxifylline can inhibit hPepT1 activity indirectly by inhibiting NHE3, which affects the Na+-dependent component of dipeptide uptake (Anderson2007Regulation).

hPepT1 also interacts with various substrates and inhibitors. For instance, cyclic peptides like octreotide and pasireotide can bind to hPepT1, inhibiting the uptake of the prototypical substrate Gly-Sar, although they are not transported by hPepT1 themselves. This suggests a competitive binding interaction at the transporter site (BajraktariSylejmani2022Evaluation). Additionally, tripeptides such as Met-Pro-Pro exhibit strong binding affinity to hPepT1, acting as high-affinity inhibitors without being transported, indicating a similar competitive interaction (Omkvist2010A).
