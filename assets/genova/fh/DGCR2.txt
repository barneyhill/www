# DGCR2

## Overview
The DGCR2 gene, located on chromosome 22q11.2, encodes the DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 2 protein, a single transmembrane protein involved in synaptic development and function. This protein is characterized by its extracellular domain, which facilitates interactions with cell adhesion molecules such as Neurexin1α, playing a crucial role in synapse formation and dendritic spine development (Ren2023DiGeorge). DGCR2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly during the postnatal period, and is enriched in dendrites where it co-localizes with synaptic proteins like PSD-95, indicating its role as a synaptic protein (Ren2023DiGeorge). The protein's involvement in cell adhesion and synaptic plasticity underscores its significance in maintaining normal neuronal connectivity, with dysfunction potentially contributing to neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Ren2023DiGeorge).

## Structure
The DGCR2 protein is a single transmembrane protein characterized by a specific domain structure. It comprises an amino (N)-terminal extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain, and a carboxyl (C)-terminal intracellular domain (ICD). The ICD contains a consensus motif (-TVV*) crucial for binding to PDZ domains, which are significant for protein-protein interactions (Ren2023DiGeorge). The protein's structure includes a signal peptide (SP), a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor binding domain similarity, a C-type lectin similarity, and a von Willebrand factor (VWF) type C repeat (Ren2023DiGeorge).

The extracellular domain (ECD) of DGCR2 is essential for its interaction with other proteins, such as Neurexin1 (NRXN1), facilitating synapse formation and dendritic spine development (Ren2023DiGeorge). The deletion of the last three amino acid residues (∆TVV) disrupts its interaction with synaptic PDZ proteins like PSD-95, underscoring the importance of the PDZ-interacting motif for its localization to postsynaptic densities (PSDs) in neurons (Ren2023DiGeorge).

DGCR2 is expressed in various brain regions, with higher expression during the postnatal stage, a critical period for synapse development and maturation (Ren2023DiGeorge). The protein is enriched in dendrites and co-localizes with PSD-95 puncta in primary hippocampal neurons, indicating its role as a synaptic protein (Ren2023DiGeorge). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The DGCR2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the development and function of dendritic spines, which are essential for synaptic connectivity and function in the brain. DGCR2 is a single transmembrane protein localized to the postsynaptic densities (PSDs) in neurons, where it interacts with synaptic proteins such as PSD-95 through a PDZ-interacting motif. This interaction is crucial for its synaptic localization and function (Ren2023DiGeorge). DGCR2 is enriched in dendrites, indicating its specific role in postsynaptic structures, and is not found in axons (Ren2023DiGeorge).

DGCR2 is involved in cell adhesion processes, interacting with the cell adhesion molecule Neurexin1α (NRXN1α) to promote synapse formation through its extracellular domain (ECD) (Ren2023DiGeorge). This interaction is essential for dendritic spine development and synaptic plasticity, as evidenced by impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in Dgcr2 mutant mice (Ren2023DiGeorge). DGCR2 also facilitates the interaction between NRXN1 and Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1), which is vital for synapse formation (Ren2023DiGeorge).

In healthy human cells, DGCR2 is crucial for maintaining normal dendritic spine density and proper synaptic function, with its dysfunction potentially contributing to neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Ren2023DiGeorge).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DGCR2 gene are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders, most notably schizophrenia. DGCR2 is located in the 22q11.2 region, a locus where deletions are a significant risk factor for schizophrenia. A rare missense mutation, P429R, in DGCR2 has been linked to schizophrenia, potentially causing protein insufficiency and mimicking a state of haplo-insufficiency similar to that observed in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) (MolinardChenu2018The). This mutation affects the migration and laminar positioning of cortical projection neurons, which are crucial for proper brain development (MolinardChenu2018The).

DGCR2 is also implicated in dendritic spine development, which is essential for synaptic connectivity. Reduced expression of DGCR2 leads to decreased dendritic spine density in hippocampal neurons, affecting synaptic plasticity and glutamatergic transmission. This deficiency is linked to abnormal behaviors such as anxiety in animal models, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Ren2023DiGeorge). The gene's interaction with cell adhesion molecules like NRXN1 is crucial for synapse formation, and disruptions in these interactions can impair neuronal connectivity, further contributing to schizophrenia risk (Ren2023DiGeorge).

## Interactions
The DGCR2 protein, encoded by the DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 2, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, primarily through its role as a cell adhesion molecule. DGCR2 interacts with Neurexin1α (NRXN1α) via its extracellular domain (ECD), which is crucial for synapse formation and dendritic spine development. This interaction is stronger with NRXN1α compared to NRXN2α, and there is no interaction with NRXN3α (Ren2023DiGeorge). The ECD of DGCR2 is essential for its interaction with NRXN1, as deletion of this domain abolishes the interaction, while deletion of the intracellular domain does not affect it (Ren2023DiGeorge). DGCR2 also enhances the interaction between NRXN1 and Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1), facilitating synapse formation (Ren2023DiGeorge).

DGCR2 is part of the REELIN complex, interacting with REELIN and influencing REELIN-dependent signaling pathways, including the phosphorylation of DAB1, AKT, and ERK1/2 (MolinardChenu2018The). This interaction is significant for the migration and laminar positioning of cortical projection neurons, highlighting DGCR2's role in early corticogenesis (MolinardChenu2018The). DGCR2 also interacts with PSD-95, a synaptic PDZ protein, through its PDZ-interacting motif, which is crucial for synapse development and maturation (Ren2023DiGeorge).
