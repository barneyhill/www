# MRPL54

## Overview
The MRPL54 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L54, which is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins that are essential for oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energy production (Bacon2024Mitochondrial). Synthesized in the cytoplasm, MRPL54 is transported to the mitochondria, where it contributes to the formation of peptide bonds during protein synthesis, thereby supporting cellular energy metabolism and the regulation of apoptosis (Cheong2020Expression). MRPL54's interactions with other mitoribosomal proteins and mitochondrial rRNA are crucial for the assembly and function of the mitoribosome (Potter2023Let’s). Clinically, MRPL54 has been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and basal breast cancer, where its expression levels are associated with patient prognosis (Bacon2024Mitochondrial; Bao2022Potential). Despite its recognized role in cancer, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which MRPL54 influences disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target (Bacon2024Mitochondrial).

## Function
MRPL54 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is part of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process vital for cellular energy production (Bacon2024Mitochondrial). MRPL54 is synthesized in the cytoplasm and transported to the mitochondria, where it contributes to the formation of peptide bonds during protein synthesis (Bacon2024Mitochondrial). This protein is active within the mitochondria, supporting cellular energy production and overall metabolic function (Cheong2020Expression).

In healthy human cells, MRPL54 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial function, which is critical for various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and the regulation of apoptosis (Bacon2024Mitochondrial). The proper functioning of MRPL54 is essential for the synthesis of electron transport chain complexes, which are necessary for efficient oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production (Reid2022Reducing). Dysfunction in MRPL54 or other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins can lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, potentially resulting in metabolic disorders or other cellular dysfunctions (Cheong2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
MRPL54 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma and basal breast cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma, MRPL54 is part of gene signatures used for survival risk prediction. Its overexpression is associated with better outcomes, suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor gene (Bacon2024Mitochondrial; Bao2022Potential). In estrogen receptor-negative basal breast cancer, MRPL54 is included in a six-gene signature that predicts distant metastasis, recurrence, and overall survival (Bacon2024Mitochondrial).

Bioinformatics analyses have identified MRPL54 as a hub gene in hepatocellular carcinoma, with RNA sequence data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) supporting its prognostic value (Bao2022Potential). Despite these associations, the specific mechanisms by which MRPL54 influences cancer progression remain unclear, necessitating further research (Bacon2024Mitochondrial).

While MRPL54's role in cancer is highlighted, there is no detailed information on diseases or conditions directly resulting from MRPL54 gene mutations or expression alterations beyond its involvement in cancer (Bacon2024Mitochondrial; Bao2022Potential). Further studies are needed to elucidate its broader clinical significance.

## Interactions
MRPL54 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that plays a role in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, specifically the large 39S subunit. It is known to interact with other mitoribosomal proteins, such as MRPL11, during the later stages of mitoribosome assembly. These interactions are crucial for the proper formation and function of the ribosome. MRPL54 and MRPL11 have been observed to co-migrate at molecular weights of 35 kDa and 80 kDa, suggesting the formation of a heterodimer or a complex with a fragment of mitochondrial rRNA (mt-rRNA) (Potter2023Let’s).

The interactions of MRPL54 with mt-rRNA are sensitive to RNase treatment, indicating that its association with rRNA is an integral part of its function in the mitoribosome. This sensitivity results in the formation of fragments in the 90-120 kDa range, further supporting its role in ribosomal assembly and stability (Potter2023Let’s). The use of high-resolution clear native electrophoresis (hrCNE) has improved the detection and analysis of these interactions, providing better resolution and preservation of protein-nucleic acid complexes compared to traditional methods (Potter2023Let’s).
