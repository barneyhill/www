# RNF31

## Overview
RNF31 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 31, which is a critical component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, characterized by its RING finger domain, and is involved in the formation of linear ubiquitin chains, a process essential for regulating NF-κB signaling, immune responses, and cell survival (Chen2022RBCK1; Zhu2018Ring). The protein also contains ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains and a zinc finger domain, which facilitate its interactions and functional roles in various cellular processes (Zhu2018Ring). RNF31 is implicated in the stability and function of regulatory T cells and plays a role in embryogenesis and haematopoiesis by preventing aberrant cell death (Zhu2018Ring; Wang2020RBR). Additionally, RNF31's interactions with other proteins are significant in cancer progression, making it a potential therapeutic target in oncology and immune-related conditions (Tang2021Taraxasterol; Yang2022RNF31).

## Structure
RNF31, also known as ring finger protein 31, is a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). It contains a RING finger domain, which is essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the formation of linear ubiquitin chains. The protein also features ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains and a zinc finger domain, which are crucial for its interactions and functions (Chen2022RBCK1; Zhu2018Ring).

The Q622 residue of RNF31 is located in the UBA domain, interacting with the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain of RBCK1. However, the side chain of Q622 points outside the molecule, suggesting it does not affect the RNF31-RBCK1 binding cleft, indicating that this polymorphism may not directly impact the RNF31-RBCK1 interface or LUBAC formation (Nakazawa2022Identification).

RNF31 is involved in post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, and has splice variant isoforms that may affect its function. It is known for catalyzing linear ubiquitination but also modifies proteins through non-linear ubiquitination, specifically multi-mono-ubiquitination, which stabilizes proteins like FOXP3, crucial for regulatory T-cell function (Zhu2018Ring).

## Function
RNF31, also known as ring finger protein 31, is a crucial component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which plays a significant role in the regulation of NF-κB signaling. This protein is involved in the formation of linear ubiquitin chains, a process essential for immune response, inflammation, and cell survival (Wang2020RBR; Li2021RNF31). In healthy human cells, RNF31 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes and contributes to organismal homeostasis (Wang2020RBR).

RNF31 is particularly important in the stability and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). It stabilizes the transcription factor FOXP3 through atypical ubiquitination, enhancing Treg cell function and maintaining immune tolerance (Zhu2018Ring). This stabilization is crucial for Treg cell homeostasis and immune regulation, as RNF31 deficiency can lead to impaired Treg function and altered immune responses (Zhu2018Ring).

RNF31 also plays a role in embryogenesis and haematopoiesis by preventing aberrant cell death, indicating its involvement in normal developmental processes and maintaining cell viability (Wang2020RBR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RNF31 gene, which encodes a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), have been implicated in various diseases. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), loss of RNF31 sensitizes cancer cells to T cell-mediated killing by destabilizing anti-apoptotic proteins, thereby enhancing immune cell infiltration and reducing tumor growth (Frey2022Loss). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RNF31 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, promoting metastasis and tumor progression (Chen2022RBCK1).

RNF31 mutations are also linked to immune dysregulation. HOIP deficiency, caused by RNF31 mutations, is associated with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and autoinflammation, affecting NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways (Oda2019Second). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), specific RNF31 polymorphisms enhance NF-κB activation, contributing to cancer progression (Nakazawa2022Identification; Wang2020RBR). These findings highlight RNF31's role in both oncogenesis and immune-related conditions, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target in these diseases.

## Interactions
RNF31, also known as HOIP, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes and cancer progression. It is a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), where it interacts with SHARPIN and RBCK1 (HOIL-1L) to facilitate linear ubiquitination, crucial for NF-κB signaling (Zhu2016Atypical). RNF31 also interacts with the YAP protein in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, promoting YAP's degradation through K48-linked poly-ubiquitination, which represses the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway and TNBC progression (Yang2022RNF31).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), RNF31 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which enhances CRC cell proliferation. This interaction is mediated by the PUB domain of RNF31 (Tang2021Taraxasterol). RNF31's interaction with p53 is significant in the context of CRC, as it regulates p53's stability and activity, impacting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Tang2021Taraxasterol).

RNF31 also interacts with the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in breast cancer, enhancing its stability and activity through mono-ubiquitination, which is crucial for estradiol-stimulated cell proliferation (Zhu2016Atypical). These interactions highlight RNF31's role in modulating key signaling pathways and protein stability in cancer.
