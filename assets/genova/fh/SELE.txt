# SELE

## Overview
The SELE gene encodes the protein selectin E, a type I transmembrane cell adhesion molecule primarily expressed on endothelial cells. Selectin E plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory response by mediating the adhesion and rolling of leukocytes on the vascular endothelium, facilitating their extravasation into tissues. This protein is characterized by its extracellular domains, including a C-type lectin domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and multiple short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, which are essential for its interaction with specific glycoprotein ligands such as sialyl Lewis X (sLe^x) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (Silva2018ESelectin; Aleisa2020Functional). The expression of selectin E is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines, highlighting its importance in immune responses and its potential involvement in pathological conditions such as cancer metastasis (Tvaroška2020Selectins—The; Silva2018ESelectin).

## Structure
Selectin E (SELE) is a type I transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion, particularly during the inflammatory response. The protein structure includes an extracellular domain composed of a C-type lectin domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and multiple complement control protein (CCP) or short consensus repeat (SCR) domains. The lectin domain is crucial for carbohydrate recognition and binding, interacting with glycans such as sialyl Lewis x (sLe^x) through Ca^2+-dependent interactions (Unknownauthors2007Adhesion).

The EGF-like domain contributes to ligand binding, and mutations in this domain can significantly alter binding abilities (Unknownauthors2007Adhesion). E-selectin contains six SCR domains, which are thought to promote adhesion by extending the lectin and EGF-like domains away from the cell surface (Unknownauthors2007Adhesion).

The cytoplasmic tail of E-selectin, while not homologous to other selectins, is conserved across species and plays a role in intracellular signaling (Unknownauthors2007Adhesion). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common and affect the protein's function and stability (Unknownauthors2007Adhesion). The genomic organization of selectin genes, including SELE, is similar, with separate exons for each domain, and they are tightly linked on chromosome 1 in humans (Unknownauthors2007Adhesion).

## Function
E-selectin, encoded by the SELE gene, is a cell adhesion molecule expressed on endothelial cells, particularly during inflammatory responses. It plays a critical role in the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation by mediating their adhesion and rolling on the vascular endothelium, a process essential for leukocyte extravasation into tissues (Silva2017CellSpecific; Silva2018ESelectin). E-selectin is composed of several domains, including a lectin domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and short consensus repeats (SCRs), which enhance its binding to ligands such as sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (Aleisa2020Functional).

The protein is constitutively expressed on bone marrow endothelium, where it recruits circulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) and maintains them within the niche (Aleisa2020Functional). E-selectin's expression is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-1β, which induce its mRNA transcription in endothelial cells (Silva2018ESelectin). This upregulation is mediated by NF-κB binding to regulatory domains in the E-selectin promoter, facilitating leukocyte arrest and migration into tissues (Silva2018ESelectin). The structural features of E-selectin, including its SCR domains and dimerization, are crucial for its functional binding activity, particularly under physiological flow conditions (Aleisa2020Functional).

## Interactions
E-selectin (SELE) is a cell adhesion molecule that plays a critical role in mediating interactions between endothelial cells and leukocytes. It primarily interacts with glycoprotein ligands on leukocytes, facilitating processes such as leukocyte rolling and adhesion under flow conditions. One of the key ligands for E-selectin is P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), which is involved in leukocyte rolling and recruitment (Unknownauthors2007Adhesion). E-selectin also binds to other glycoproteins, including E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1) and CD44, which are crucial for neutrophil rolling and adhesion (Zarbock2011Leukocyte). The interaction with CD44, particularly its glycoform known as HCELL, is significant for the adhesion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, as well as certain cancer cells (Tvaroška2020Selectins—The).

E-selectin's interactions are not limited to leukocytes; it also plays a role in cancer metastasis by binding to ligands on cancer cells, such as CD44v4 in metastatic breast cancer, facilitating transendothelial migration (Tvaroška2020Selectins—The). These interactions are crucial for the adhesion cascade mechanism, which is essential for both immune response and cancer progression (Tvaroška2020Selectins—The).
