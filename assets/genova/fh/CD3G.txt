# CD3G

## Overview
The CD3G gene encodes the CD3 gamma (γ) subunit, a transmembrane protein that is an integral component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex. This protein plays a crucial role in the assembly, surface expression, and signaling of the TCR complex, which is essential for T-cell development and immune response. The CD3γ subunit, along with other CD3 subunits, forms heterodimers that associate with TCR chains, facilitating the formation and transport of the TCR complex to the cell surface. The proper function of CD3γ is vital for the immune system, as it influences the expression of the γδ TCR complex more significantly than the αβ TCR complex, thereby impacting T-cell ontogenesis and function (Garcillán2021CD3G; MuñozRuiz2013Human). Mutations in the CD3G gene can lead to immunodeficiency disorders and have been associated with increased cancer risk, highlighting its clinical significance (Jiang2012A; Recio2007Differential).

## Structure
The CD3G gene encodes the gamma chain of the CD3 complex, a critical component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex. The extracellular (EC) domain of the CD3γ protein is suggested to fold as an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, characterized by two anti-parallel β-sheets, typical of an Ig C domain (Dietrich1996Role). Specific conserved regions within the EC domain, such as amino acids 17-21 and 57-60, are identified as potential interaction sites, with the 17-21 region being part of a loop containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, and the 57-60 region being highly hydrophilic and containing charged residues (Dietrich1996Role). These regions are crucial for the proper assembly and expression of the TCR complex, particularly in forming CD3γε dimers and their interaction with TCR αβ chains (Dietrich1996Role).

The transmembrane (TM) domain of CD3γ includes a charged amino acid, Glu (E100), which is important for TCR assembly. Mutations in this residue can affect TCR surface expression (Dietrich1996Role). The cytoplasmic (CY) domain, although not essential for TCR assembly, may play a role in other functional aspects of the protein (Dietrich1996Role). The CD3γ chain also contains sites for N-linked glycosylation, which influence its molecular mass but are not essential for TCR assembly (Dietrich1996Role).

## Function
The CD3G gene encodes the CD3γ protein, a critical component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex in human T lymphocytes. This protein is part of the CD3 complex, which includes the γ, δ, ε, and ζ subunits, and is essential for the assembly, surface expression, and signaling of the TCR complex (Garcillán2021CD3G; Delmonte2020Complete). The TCR complex is crucial for antigen recognition, converting ligand recognition into intracellular signals necessary for T cell ontogenesis and function (Delmonte2020Complete).

CD3γ, along with CD3δ, forms heterodimers that associate with TCR chains through intramembrane contacts, facilitating the formation of the hexameric TCR complex. This complex is then exported to the Golgi apparatus, where it interacts with the ζζ/CD247 homodimer to form an octameric complex that is sorted to the plasma membrane (Garcillán2021CD3G). Proper folding and assembly of these complexes are necessary for their transport to the cell surface, and any misfolded or incomplete receptor complexes are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum for degradation (Garcillán2021CD3G).

CD3γ is particularly important for the surface expression of the γδ TCR complex, as its availability significantly affects TCR expression in γδ T cells more than in αβ T cells (MuñozRuiz2013Human). This indicates that CD3γ plays a critical role in the proper assembly and surface expression of the γδ TCR complex, highlighting its importance in T cell development and immune response (MuñozRuiz2013Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD3G gene, which encodes the gamma chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex, are associated with various immunodeficiency disorders. A notable mutation is the homozygous A to T transversion at nucleotide 205 in exon 3 (c.205A>T), resulting in a premature stop codon (p.K69X) that truncates the CD3γ protein. This mutation is linked to selective partial T lymphocytopenia and can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in some patients, although clinical manifestations vary significantly among individuals (Recio2007Differential). 

CD3G mutations can also result in combined immunodeficiency (CID) with autoimmunity, characterized by normal absolute CD3+ T cell numbers but with CD4+ T cell lymphopenia and reduced naïve T cells. This condition is associated with recurrent infections and autoimmune symptoms (Delmonte2020Complete). 

Additionally, a functional insertion/deletion polymorphism in the CD3G gene's promoter region has been linked to an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Chinese population, particularly among individuals positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV). This polymorphism may influence HCC susceptibility by affecting CD3G expression levels (Jiang2012A). 

Overall, CD3G mutations and polymorphisms can lead to a spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from immunodeficiency to increased cancer risk.

## Interactions
The CD3G gene encodes the CD3 gamma subunit, which is a critical component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex. CD3G interacts with other CD3 subunits, including CD3 delta (CD3D) and CD3 epsilon (CD3E), as well as the TCR alpha and beta chains, to form a functional TCR complex. These interactions are essential for the assembly, stability, and surface expression of the TCR complex. The CD3 gamma subunit forms stable associations with the TCR beta chain, which helps protect the receptor from proteolytic degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Wileman1993Associations).

The interactions between CD3G and the TCR beta chain are mediated by charged residues in their transmembrane domains, which are crucial for the physical association between these proteins (Wileman1993Associations; Wucherpfennig2010Structural). The extracellular domain of CD3G also plays a role in TCR assembly, with specific sites being important for interactions with CD3E (Dietrich1996Role). Mutations in these sites can impair TCR assembly and expression, highlighting their importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the TCR complex (Dietrich1996Role).
