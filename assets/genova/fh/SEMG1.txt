# SEMG1

## Overview
SEMG1 is a gene that encodes the protein semenogelin 1, which is predominantly expressed in the seminal vesicles and plays a vital role in the coagulation of semen. Semenogelin 1 is a secreted protein that forms a gel-like matrix in seminal plasma, initially immobilizing spermatozoa post-ejaculation. This protein is categorized as a seminal plasma protein and is involved in modulating sperm motility and providing antimicrobial protection. The interaction of semenogelin 1 with proteins such as EPPIN on the sperm surface is crucial for regulating sperm motility and timing its acquisition, which is essential for successful fertilization (Silva2013Interacting; Shuvalov2021Emerging). The gene is located on chromosome 20 and consists of three exons, with its expression and mutations being linked to conditions such as male infertility and certain cancers (Shuvalov2020Cancertestis; Yu2013SEMG1).

## Structure
SEMG1, or semenogelin 1, is a protein primarily found in human semen, where it plays a crucial role in semen coagulation. The primary structure of SEMG1 consists of 461 amino acids, which are processed to 439 amino acids by the cleavage of a hydrophobic amino-terminal signal peptide, resulting in a secreted protein with a molecular weight of 52 kDa (Shuvalov2021Emerging). The gene encoding SEMG1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 and contains three exons. The first exon encodes the signal peptide, the second exon encodes the main part of the protein, and the third exon encodes the 3'-untranslated region (Shuvalov2021Emerging).

SEMG1 is known for its ability to form a matrix with fibronectin through non-covalent interactions and disulfide bridges, which initially inhibits sperm motility (Shuvalov2021Emerging). The protein undergoes proteolysis primarily by the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), leading to the liquefaction of the ejaculate (Shuvalov2021Emerging). The Cys239 residue in SEMG1 is critical for its interaction with EPPIN, a protein on the surface of spermatozoa, and mutations at this site significantly reduce binding affinity (Silva2013Interacting). SEMG1's interaction with EPPIN is essential for modulating sperm motility and providing antimicrobial protection (Silva2013Interacting).

## Function
SEMG1 (semenogelin 1) is a major protein in human seminal plasma, primarily secreted by the seminal vesicles. It plays a crucial role in the coagulation of semen immediately after ejaculation, forming a gelatinous mass that immobilizes spermatozoa by creating a physical barrier (Robert1999Semenogelin; Shuvalov2021Emerging). This coagulum is gradually liquefied by the action of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), allowing sperm to regain motility and facilitating their movement towards the ovum (Robert1999Semenogelin; Shuvalov2021Emerging).

SEMG1 also acts as a physiological sperm motility inhibitor by binding to the sperm surface, particularly on the postacrosomal sheath, midregion, and tail, affecting motility through a surface-mediated mode of action (Robert1999Semenogelin). This binding is reversible and regulated by the proteolytic activity of PSA, which cleaves SEMG1, reducing its inhibitory effect and allowing sperm motility to resume (Robert1999Semenogelin).

In addition to its role in sperm motility, SEMG1 provides antibacterial protection to sperm and regulates sperm capacitation, a process necessary for fertilization (Sakaguchi2020Human; Shuvalov2021Emerging). The protein's interaction with EPPIN on spermatozoa is significant for modulating sperm motility, which is crucial for successful reproduction (Silva2013Interacting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SEMG1 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly related to male fertility and cancer. In the context of male infertility, SEMG1 is significantly up-regulated in patients with idiopathic asthenozoospermia (AZS), a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility. This up-regulation, validated by real-time PCR, suggests that SEMG1 may inhibit sperm motility by binding to the sperm surface, contributing to AZS (Yu2013SEMG1). Specific mutations, such as the substitution of cysteine 239 with glycine, have been shown to inhibit sperm motility, indicating the critical role of this amino acid in SEMG1's function (Silva2013Interacting).

In cancer, SEMG1 is re-expressed in various tumors, including lung cancer, where it is associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhanced sensitivity to genotoxic drugs. This suggests a potential role for SEMG1 in cancer cell metabolism and apoptosis, offering a therapeutic angle for targeting SEMG1 in cancer treatment (Shuvalov2020Cancertestis). The gene's expression is linked to poor survival rates in cancer patients, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Shuvalov2020SEMG12).

## Interactions
SEMG1 (semenogelin 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in the coagulation of semen and interacts with several proteins on the surface of human spermatozoa. One of its primary interactions is with the protein EPPIN (epididymal protease inhibitor), which is crucial for modulating sperm motility. SEMG1 binds to EPPIN on the sperm surface, leading to the transient inhibition of sperm motility after ejaculation. This interaction is essential for reproductive fitness as it regulates the timing of sperm motility acquisition, which is necessary for successful fertilization (Silva2013Interacting; Gomes2023Interactions).

The binding between SEMG1 and EPPIN involves specific amino acid residues. The Cys239 residue of SEMG1 is critical for its binding to EPPIN, and mutations at this site significantly reduce SEMG1's ability to interact with EPPIN, highlighting its importance in the interaction (Silva2013Interacting). The interaction between SEMG1 and EPPIN is also being explored as a target for non-hormonal male contraceptives, as blocking the SEMG1 binding site on EPPIN can inhibit sperm motility (Gomes2023Interactions).
