# MATR3

## Overview
The MATR3 gene encodes the protein matrin 3, a nuclear matrix protein that plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism and cellular processes. Matrin 3 is characterized by its structural motifs, including RNA recognition motifs and zinc finger domains, which facilitate its interactions with RNA and DNA. This protein is involved in various cellular functions such as RNA binding, processing, stabilization, and alternative splicing regulation. It also participates in the DNA damage response and nuclear retention of hyper-edited mRNA. Matrin 3's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids underscore its significance in complex cellular networks. Mutations in the MATR3 gene have been linked to several neurodegenerative and muscular disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical importance (Salton2011Matrin; Santos2024MATR3’s; Salem2022Matrin3:).

## Structure
Matrin 3 (MATR3) is a nuclear matrix protein with a molecular weight of 125 kDa, encoded by the MATR3 gene located on chromosome 5 in humans (Salton2011Matrin; Salem2022Matrin3:). The protein is composed of 847 amino acids and features several key structural motifs, including two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) and two C2H2-type zinc finger domains (ZnF1 and ZnF2) (Coelho2015Nuclear; GallegoIradi2019Nterminal). The RRMs are structured in a βαββαβ-fold, which is crucial for RNA binding, while the zinc finger motifs adopt a ββα-fold, facilitating DNA binding and protein interactions (Salem2022Matrin3:).

Matrin 3 also contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES), which are essential for its nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (Coelho2015Nuclear). The protein is characterized by large intrinsically disordered regions, particularly between RRM2 and ZnF2, which contribute to its conformational flexibility and ability to interact with multiple binding partners (Salem2022Matrin3:). These disordered regions are significant for liquid-liquid phase separation, a process influenced by the N-terminal sequences of MATR3 (GallegoIradi2019Nterminal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, modulate the function and stability of Matrin 3, impacting its role in cellular processes and disease pathogenesis (Salem2022Matrin3:).

## Function
Matrin 3 (MATR3) is a nuclear matrix protein that plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism, including RNA binding, processing, and stabilization. It contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and two zinc finger domains, with the RRM2 domain being essential for its RNA-binding capability (Salton2011Matrin). MATR3 is involved in the stabilization of specific mRNAs, influencing their levels by affecting their stability, which is linked to sequences in the 3' UTR and the binding of RNA-binding proteins (Salton2011Matrin). It interacts with several proteins involved in RNA processing, such as DHX9 and HNRNPK, in an RNA-dependent manner (Salton2011Matrin).

MATR3 also regulates alternative splicing by binding to introns flanking repressed exons, impacting the splicing of numerous genes, particularly those encoding chromatin-binding and cytoskeletal proteins (Coelho2015Nuclear). It acts as a splicing repressor, with knockdown experiments revealing dysregulation of hundreds of alternative splicing events (Coelho2015Nuclear). MATR3 is involved in the DNA damage response, where it is phosphorylated by ATM in response to DNA double-strand breaks, suggesting a role in DNA repair (Salton2011Matrin). Additionally, MATR3 is implicated in the nuclear retention of hyper-edited mRNA, preventing its translation (Salton2011Matrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MATR3 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative and muscular disorders. One of the most notable conditions associated with MATR3 mutations is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons, leading to muscle atrophy and paralysis. The Serine-85 to Cysteine (S85C) mutation is particularly significant, initially linked to vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness with distal myopathy (VCPDM) but later reclassified as a form of ALS. This mutation can result in a spectrum of phenotypes, from pure myopathy to motor neuron disease (Santos2024MATR3’s; Cavalli2021First).

Other mutations, such as Phe115Cys (F115C) and Thr622Ala (T622A), have also been studied for their potential links to ALS. The F115C mutation has been associated with muscle weakness and atrophy in transgenic mouse models, suggesting a role in muscle pathology (Moloney2018Analysis). The T622A mutation affects MATR3 condensate dynamics and mRNA export, contributing to ALS pathology (Santos2024MATR3’s).

Beyond ALS, MATR3 mutations are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, with mutations like E436K and M548T associated with developmental disabilities and early-onset neurodegeneration (Santos2024MATR3’s). Additionally, disruptions in the 3' UTR of MATR3 have been linked to congenital heart defects, such as bicuspid aortic valve and aortic coarctation, due to altered transcript expression (QuinteroRivera2015MATR3).

## Interactions
Matrin 3 (MATR3) is a nuclear matrix protein that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and stabilization. MATR3 contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and two zinc finger domains, with the RRM2 domain being crucial for its RNA binding capability. It interacts with several proteins involved in RNA processing, such as DHX9 and HNRNPK, in an RNA-dependent manner. These interactions are disrupted by RNase treatment, indicating the necessity of RNA for maintaining these associations (Salton2011Matrin).

MATR3 is also part of a protein complex with DHX9, HNRNPK, and 7SK RNA, potentially playing a role in stabilizing mRNAs (Salton2011Matrin). In neuroblastoma, MATR3 interacts with the long noncoding RNA SNHG1, enhancing cancer progression. This interaction is validated through RNA immunoprecipitation assays and is associated with poor prognosis in patients (Yang2018RNABinding).

In thymoma cells, MATR3 co-immunoprecipitates with heat shock proteins GRP78 and GRP75, as well as glutathione S-transferase π isoform 2 (GSTπ2), suggesting a role in cellular stress responses (Osman2014Matrin). These interactions highlight MATR3's involvement in complex networks of protein and RNA interactions within the cell.
