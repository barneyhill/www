# SLC25A48

## Overview
SLC25A48 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 48, which is a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein involved in the transport of small molecules across the mitochondrial membrane. This protein is part of the solute carrier family 25, known for its role in facilitating the movement of metabolites necessary for various cellular processes, including choline import and catabolism. The SLC25A48 protein is characterized by a tripartite structure with six transmembrane alpha-helices, forming a funnel-shaped cavity essential for its transport function. It plays a significant role in choline metabolism, contributing to the synthesis of choline-derived metabolites that are crucial for one-carbon metabolism and mitochondrial function. The gene's expression is notably high in brown adipose tissue, where it supports thermogenesis and energy homeostasis. Alterations in SLC25A48 have been linked to various diseases, highlighting its importance in cellular metabolism and potential as a therapeutic target (Palmieri2013The; Verkerke2024Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The SLC25A48 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 25, which is characterized by a unique structural organization. The primary structure of SLC25A48, like other members of the mitochondrial carrier family, includes a tripartite structure with three homologous domains, each approximately 100 amino acids in length (Palmieri2013The). These domains contain two hydrophobic stretches that form transmembrane alpha-helices, resulting in a total of six transmembrane helices (Palmieri2013The). 

The secondary structure is dominated by these alpha-helices, which are arranged to form a funnel-shaped cavity that is open towards the cytosol. This configuration is crucial for the transport function of the protein, allowing it to facilitate the movement of small molecules across the mitochondrial membrane (Palmieri2013The). 

The tertiary structure involves a compact arrangement of these helices, stabilized by a network of salt bridges that are essential for the conformational changes required during the transport cycle (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). 

While specific details on the quaternary structure of SLC25A48 are not provided, it is common for mitochondrial carriers to function as dimers or interact with other mitochondrial proteins. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the protein's function and localization, although specific modifications for SLC25A48 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
SLC25A48 is a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein that plays a crucial role in choline import and catabolism within mitochondria. This gene is essential for the uptake of choline, which is necessary for the synthesis of choline-derived metabolites such as betaine and purine nucleotides. These metabolites are integral to one-carbon metabolism, which supports the methionine and folate cycles, critical for cell cycle progression and proliferation (Verkerke2024Mitochondrial).

In healthy human cells, SLC25A48 facilitates the synthesis of purine nucleotides, which are vital for the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. This function is particularly important for maintaining normal cell growth and proliferation (Verkerke2024Mitochondrial). The gene's activity is also linked to mitochondrial respiratory capacity, as it influences the levels of purine nucleotides and other metabolites necessary for efficient mitochondrial function (Verkerke2024Mitochondrial).

SLC25A48 is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue, where it contributes to thermogenesis and cold tolerance by supporting mitochondrial respiration (Verkerke2024Mitochondrial). Its role in choline metabolism and mitochondrial function underscores its importance in cellular and organismal energy homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC25A48 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. Loss-of-function variants in SLC25A48 have been linked to musculoskeletal diseases, digestive disorders, ichthyosis congenita, hereditary disturbances in tooth structure, and diverticulosis. These associations suggest that SLC25A48 dysfunction may have choline-mediated effects on these conditions (Khan2023GeneMAP:).

In cancer, the deletion of SLC25A48 leads to reduced purine nucleotide pools and cell cycle arrest, particularly affecting the G1-to-S phase transition. This indicates that SLC25A48 is crucial for cancer cell cycle progression, likely due to its role in purine nucleotide synthesis. As a result, SLC25A48 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for manipulating cell proliferation in cancer (Verkerke2024Mitochondrial).

Additionally, SLC25A48 is upregulated in brown adipose tissue following a high-fat diet, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism. Its dysfunction is implicated in poor mitochondrial cristae density and low ATP levels, which are characteristics shared with mice lacking CHDH, indicating potential involvement in fatty liver disease pathogenesis (Verkerke2024Mitochondrial).
