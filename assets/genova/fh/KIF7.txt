# KIF7

## Overview
KIF7 is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 7 protein, which is a part of the kinesin-4 superfamily. This protein is integral to the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a critical regulator of embryonic development and stem cell maintenance. KIF7 is characterized by its immotile nature, despite having a typical kinesin motor domain structure, due to specific sequence changes that affect its motility (Blasius2019Microtubule). The protein plays a pivotal role in organizing the cilium tip compartment in mammalian cells, influencing cilia length and structure by modulating microtubule dynamics (He2014The). KIF7's interactions with various proteins, including those involved in the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular signaling and structural integrity (Liem2009Mouse). Mutations in the KIF7 gene are linked to several ciliopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental disorders (Ibisler2015Novel).

## Structure
The KIF7 protein is a member of the kinesin-4 superfamily and plays a crucial role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Its molecular structure includes an N-terminal motor domain responsible for ATP binding and microtubule interaction, followed by a coiled-coil region that facilitates oligomerization, and a C-terminal globular tail domain (Klejnot2012Structural). The motor domain of KIF7 features an eight-stranded β-sheet core with three major solvent-exposed α-helices on each side, a structure typical of kinesin superfamily members (Klejnot2012Structural). 

KIF7 is characterized by an extended neck linker, which is a structural feature that typically coordinates the catalytic cycles of motor domains in kinesin proteins. However, KIF7 is immotile, and its lack of motility is attributed to sequence changes within its core motor domain (Blasius2019Microtubule). The protein's structure is further defined by specific surface loops, such as loops 5 and 10, which influence its microtubule binding properties (Blasius2019Microtubule).

KIF7 is also subject to autoinhibition, where non-motor regions, including the coiled-coil and tail domains, inhibit the motor domain's ability to bind microtubules (Blasius2019Microtubule). This autoinhibition is thought to be relieved by disease-associated mutations in the coiled-coil region (Blasius2019Microtubule).

## Function
KIF7 is a kinesin-4 family protein that plays a crucial role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is essential for embryonic development and stem cell maintenance. It is a conserved regulator of this pathway and is involved in organizing the cilium tip compartment in mammalian cells. KIF7 localizes to the tips of primary cilia, where it regulates cilia length and structure by binding to the plus-ends of microtubules, reducing their growth rate, and increasing the frequency of microtubule catastrophe (Hirokawa2015Kinesin; He2014The). This regulation is critical for the proper functioning of the Hh pathway, as it ensures the correct localization and activation of Gli/Sufu complexes at the cilia tips (He2014The).

KIF7 is not required for intraflagellar transport or the trafficking of Hh pathway proteins into cilia, but it is essential for maintaining the architecture of cilia and creating a specialized compartment necessary for Hh signal transduction (He2014The). In the absence of KIF7, cilia become longer, unstable, and twisted, leading to inappropriate activation of the Hh pathway (He2014The). KIF7's role in cilia structure and signaling is conserved across species, highlighting its importance in cellular function (He2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIF7 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including acrocallosal syndrome (ACLS), Joubert syndrome type 12 (JBTS12), and hydrolethalus syndrome type 2 (HLS2). These conditions are characterized by defects in cilia formation or function, leading to a range of developmental abnormalities (Putoux2012NovelKIF7mutations; Ibisler2015Novel). ACLS is marked by agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, polydactyly, intellectual disability, and craniofacial dysmorphisms (Ibisler2015Novel). Joubert syndrome type 12 is characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and the molar tooth sign on MRI, along with retinal dystrophy and renal anomalies (Ibisler2015Novel). Hydrolethalus syndrome type 2 presents with severe phenotypes such as hydrocephaly or anencephaly and polydactyly (Ibisler2015Novel).

KIF7 mutations can also result in macrocephaly, distinctive facial dysmorphism, and corpus callosum anomalies (Putoux2012NovelKIF7mutations). The gene plays a crucial role in the hedgehog signaling pathway, affecting GLI transcription factor targets and maintaining Golgi structure (Putoux2012NovelKIF7mutations). Genetic testing is important for accurate diagnosis and differentiation between syndromes like ACLS and Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, which involves GLI3 mutations (Putoux2012NovelKIF7mutations).

## Interactions
KIF7 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes and signaling pathways. It is involved in the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, where it interacts with Gli transcription factors and Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), regulating the activity and localization of Gli proteins. KIF7 acts as both a positive and negative regulator in this pathway, preventing inappropriate activation of Gli2 in the absence of ligand and promoting Gli activation upon pathway activation (Liem2009Mouse; Klejnot2012Structural).

KIF7 also interacts with nephrocystin-1 (NPHP1), a protein associated with Joubert syndrome, suggesting its role in multiprotein complexes that regulate cilia formation and microtubule dynamics (Dafinger2011Mutations). Additionally, KIF7 co-precipitates with histone deacetylase HDAC6, indicating its involvement in microtubule acetylation and stabilization (Dafinger2011Mutations).

The ExoS toxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa binds to the N-terminal domain of KIF7, potentially contributing to cytotoxic effects in human bronchial epithelial cells. This interaction highlights a novel pathway for ExoS-induced cytotoxicity through KIF7 (Okuda2014ExoS). These interactions underscore KIF7's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and structural integrity.
