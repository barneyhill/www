# IRF2BPL

## Overview
The IRF2BPL gene encodes the protein interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein-like, which is implicated in transcriptional regulation and potentially functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by the presence of an IRF2BP zinc finger domain and a C3HC4-type RING finger domain, which are essential for its regulatory roles (Marcogliese2018IRF2BPL). The IRF2BPL protein is predominantly nuclear, although it may also have roles outside the nucleus, and is involved in critical cellular pathways, including the WNT signaling pathway (Marcogliese2018IRF2BPL; Bauersachs2024Novel). Mutations in the IRF2BPL gene are linked to severe neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as NEDAMSS and developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, highlighting its clinical significance (Tran2019De; Bauersachs2024Novel). Despite its importance, the full spectrum of IRF2BPL's biological functions and mechanisms remains to be elucidated, posing challenges for therapeutic development (Shelkowitz2019IRF2BPL).

## Structure
The IRF2BPL protein is 796 amino acids long and contains two highly conserved domains: the IRF2BP zinc finger domain at the N-terminus and the C3HC4-type RING finger domain at the C-terminus (Marcogliese2018IRF2BPL). These domains are crucial for its function as a transcriptional regulator and potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting proteins like β-catenin for degradation (Marcogliese2018IRF2BPL; Shelkowitz2019IRF2BPL). The protein also includes polyglutamine and polyalanine tracts, as well as several putative PEST sequences, which suggest a role in post-translational regulation (Marcogliese2018IRF2BPL). 

The IRF2BPL gene is intronless, and its protein product is highly constrained, with a high probability-of-loss-of-function intolerance score, indicating that variations can lead to dominantly inherited diseases (Marcogliese2018IRF2BPL). The protein is predominantly nuclear, although it may have non-nuclear roles (Marcogliese2018IRF2BPL). Despite these insights, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available literature. The protein's architecture is similar to its fly ortholog, CG11138, despite low sequence identity (Marcogliese2018IRF2BPL).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IRF2BPL gene are associated with several severe neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. One such condition is NEDAMSS (Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Regression, Abnormal Movements, Loss of Speech, and Seizures), characterized by normal initial development followed by regression, loss of motor skills, speech, and the onset of seizures and abnormal movements. This disorder is caused by de novo mutations in the IRF2BPL gene, which is located on chromosome 14q24.23 (Bauersachs2024Novel).

IRF2BPL mutations are also linked to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), which involve severe cognitive and behavioral decline accompanied by epilepsy. These conditions are often associated with de novo truncating variants in the gene, leading to a protein lacking the crucial C-terminal RING-finger domain (Tran2019De). Patients with these mutations may experience severe epilepsy, including infantile spasms and myoclonus, along with other neurological symptoms such as hypotonia, dystonia, and cerebellar ataxia (Tran2019De).

The gene's role as a transcriptional modulator and its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system are disrupted by these mutations, contributing to the observed neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative phenotypes (Shelkowitz2019IRF2BPL). The rarity of these disorders and the limited understanding of IRF2BPL's biological function pose challenges in developing effective treatments (Bauersachs2024Novel).

## Interactions
The IRF2BPL protein is known to interact with several other proteins, particularly in the context of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. It interacts with the WNT signaling pathway, specifically with wg/wnt1/WNT1, where a reduction in IRF2BPL leads to increased wg/wnt1/WNT1 transcript and protein expression. This interaction is crucial for affecting lifespan and neurobehavioral phenotypes in model organisms like Drosophila (Bauersachs2024Novel). IRF2BPL also interacts with Casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1α), a regulator of signal transduction pathways, playing a significant role in the WNT signaling pathway through the phosphorylation of β-catenin. IRF2BPL targets β-catenin for proteasomal degradation and is implied to interact and colocalize with CSNK1A1 in the cytoplasm, promoting its entry into the nucleus where the complex acts as a strong transcriptional repressor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Bauersachs2024Novel).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, IRF2BPL protein is mislocalized as aggregates in the cytoplasm of patient astrocytes, forming dimers between truncated and full-length protein isoforms. This mislocalization is associated with altered cellular phenotypes, including abnormal mitochondrial activity and greater GFAP expression, which are linked to activated astrocytes (Bauersachs2024Novel).
