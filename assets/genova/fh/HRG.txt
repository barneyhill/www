# HRG

## Overview
The HRG gene encodes histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), a multifunctional plasma protein that plays a critical role in various physiological processes, including immune regulation, coagulation, and angiogenesis. Located on chromosome 3 at position 3q28-q29, the HRG gene gives rise to a 75-kDa protein characterized by a multidomain structure, including cystatin-like domains, a central histidine-rich region, and proline-rich regions. As an adaptor molecule, HRG facilitates interactions between different ligands on cell surfaces, influencing immune responses, blood clotting, and fibrinolysis. It also exhibits antimicrobial properties and is involved in the clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells. Alterations in HRG expression and genetic polymorphisms have been linked to various clinical conditions, such as recurrent miscarriage and gestational hypertensive disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining homeostasis and its potential as a biomarker in reproductive health (Poon2011Histidinerich; Elenis2014The; Elenis2018HRG).

## Structure
Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is a 75-kDa single polypeptide chain protein found in human plasma, encoded by the HRG gene located on chromosome 3 at position 3q28-q29. The protein consists of 507 amino acids and features a multidomain structure. It includes two N-terminal regions with homology to cystatin-like domains, known as N1 and N2, a central histidine-rich region (HRR) flanked by two proline-rich regions (PRR1 and PRR2), and a C-terminal domain (Poon2011Histidinerich; Poon2009Regulation).

HRG contains four intradomain and two interdomain disulfide bridges, which contribute to its tertiary structure by linking the C-terminal domain and the HRR to the N1N2 domain (Poon2011Histidinerich; Poon2009Regulation). The protein also has six predicted N-linked glycosylation sites and may undergo phosphorylation, which are common post-translational modifications that can influence its function (Patel2013New).

The secondary structure of HRG is characterized by a significant proportion of beta-structure, beta-turn, and polyproline 2 helix, with very little alpha-helix, reflecting its intrinsically disordered nature (Patel2013New). HRG can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure (Patel2013New).

## Function
Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is a multifunctional plasma protein involved in various physiological processes, including immune regulation, coagulation, and angiogenesis. In healthy human cells, HRG acts as an adaptor molecule, facilitating interactions between different ligands on cell surfaces, primarily through heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Jones2005Histidine‐rich). It modulates immune responses by influencing cell adhesion, particularly affecting macrophages and T-cells, and may regulate early adhesion events during immune responses (Jones2005Histidine‐rich). HRG also plays a significant role in the clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells, which is crucial for preventing autoimmune reactions (Gorgani2007Contribution).

HRG interacts with components of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, such as plasminogen and fibrinogen, influencing blood clotting and fibrinolysis (Poon2011Histidinerich). It can either inhibit or promote fibrinolysis depending on the context, highlighting its role in maintaining hemostatic balance (Jones2005Histidine‐rich). HRG also exhibits antimicrobial properties, binding to pathogens and exerting antibacterial and antifungal effects, particularly under acidic conditions or in the presence of zinc ions (Poon2011Histidinerich). These diverse functions underscore HRG's importance in maintaining homeostasis in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HRG gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. The HRG A1042G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been linked to recurrent miscarriage, with heterozygous carriers showing a decreased risk of this condition. This SNP affects the protein's anti-angiogenic capacity, which is crucial for pregnancy, suggesting a potential reproductive advantage for heterozygous carriers (Elenis2014The).

The HRG C633T SNP is associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertensive disorders, such as preeclampsia. The T allele of this SNP may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and abnormal placentation, affecting angiogenesis and vascular function during pregnancy (Elenis2018HRG).

Altered HRG expression levels have been observed in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA), where lower HRG levels in follicular fluid are linked to poorer in vitro fertilization outcomes. This suggests that HRG could serve as a biomarker for predicting IVF success in RSA patients (Sun2022Decreased).

HRG's role in immune regulation and pathogen clearance indicates that disruptions in its function could contribute to immune-related conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (Poon2011Histidinerich; Jones2005Histidine‐rich).

## Interactions
Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is known for its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in multiple biological processes. HRG specifically binds to fibrinogen in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 6.7 nM, and incorporates into fibrin clots, affecting fibrin gel formation by altering the kinetics of fibrinogen conversion to fibrin (Leung1986Interaction). It also forms complexes with thrombospondin (TSP), with a stoichiometry of 3.5 HRG:1 TSP, and retains heparin-binding properties, neutralizing heparin's anticoagulant activity (Leung1984Complex).

HRG interacts with plasminogen and thrombospondin, forming a trimolecular complex that may influence fibrin polymerization (Leung1986Interaction). It binds to DNA on apoptotic cells, facilitating their uptake by macrophages through interaction with FcγRI, enhancing the clearance of apoptotic cells (Gorgani2002HistidineRich). HRG also binds to IgG and C1q, with Zn2+ ions increasing its affinity for IgG, and inhibits the formation of insoluble immune complexes (Gorgani1997HistidineRich). These interactions highlight HRG's role as an adaptor molecule in coagulation, immune response, and cell clearance processes.
