# AP1S2

## Overview
The AP1S2 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit sigma 2, a critical component of the adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) complex involved in intracellular trafficking. This protein plays a pivotal role in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are essential for the transport of proteins between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. As a part of the AP-1 complex, the AP1S2-encoded protein is integral in selecting vesicle cargo and facilitating clathrin-lattice formation on vesicle membranes, thereby influencing synaptic vesicle cycling and neurotransmitter processing. Mutations in the AP1S2 gene have been linked to various X-linked intellectual disability syndromes, underscoring its importance in neurological development and function (Tarpey2006Mutations; Borck2008Clinical).

## Function
The AP1S2 gene encodes the sigma 2 subunit of the adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) complex, which is crucial for the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. These vesicles are involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. The AP-1 complex, including the AP1S2-encoded sigma 2 subunit, plays a significant role in selecting vesicle cargo and promoting clathrin-lattice formation on the vesicle membrane (Tarpey2006Mutations; Borck2008Clinical).

In healthy human cells, the AP1S2 protein is active at the cytoplasmic face of coated vesicles at the Golgi complex. It is involved in the recruitment of clathrin to the vesicle membrane, which is essential for endocytic processing (Tarpey2006Mutations). The AP1 complex binds specific motifs in vesicle cargo proteins, including transmembrane receptors, and interacts with synaptic vesicle proteins such as synaptophysin and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter. These interactions suggest that AP1S2 plays a critical role in normal neurotransmitter processing within the synapse (Tarpey2006Mutations).

Disruption of the AP1 complex due to AP1S2 mutations can affect synaptic vesicle cycling and the processing and trafficking of membrane proteins, including receptors and ion channels, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and neurological functions (Tarpey2006Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP1S2 gene are associated with several X-linked intellectual disability syndromes, including syndromic X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and Pettigrew syndrome. These conditions are characterized by a range of neurological and developmental symptoms. In syndromic XLMR, mutations in AP1S2 can lead to hydrocephalus, calcifications in the basal ganglia, and mild facial dysmorphism (Saillour2007Mutations). The gene is also implicated in Fried syndrome, where nonsense mutations result in similar clinical features (Saillour2007Mutations).

Pettigrew syndrome, also known as X-linked Dandy-Walker malformation, is another condition linked to AP1S2 mutations. It is characterized by intellectual disability, basal ganglia disease, seizures, and Dandy-Walker malformation. Mutations in AP1S2 can lead to exon skipping and protein truncation, affecting normal brain development and function (Cacciagli2013AP1S2).

Clinical features associated with AP1S2 mutations include hypotonia, delayed walking, speech development issues, and dysmorphic facial features. These mutations disrupt the normal function of the adaptor protein complex, potentially impairing synaptic vesicle cycling and neurotransmitter processing, which are crucial for cognitive and motor functions (Ballarati2012Deletion; Tarpey2006Mutations).

## Interactions
The AP1S2 gene encodes the σ1B subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1), which is involved in the transport of proteins between intracellular organelles, specifically between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. The AP-1 complex is composed of two large adaptin subunits (γ and β1), a medium subunit (μ1), and a small subunit (σ1), including σ1B encoded by AP1S2. These small subunits interact with large subunits to recognize leucine-based sorting signals in the cytoplasmic tails of cargo proteins, crucial for clathrin coat assembly and cargo selection (Borck2008Clinical).

Despite the importance of these interactions, the specific physical interactions of AP1S2 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unknown. Studies have shown that mutations in AP1S2, such as the p.R52X mutation, do not compromise the stability of the AP-1 complex, as evidenced by similar levels of γ and μ1A subunits in both patient and control fibroblasts (Borck2008Clinical). This suggests that while AP1S2 is a component of the AP-1 complex, its specific interactions and roles within the complex are not fully understood. The AP1S2 gene is also associated with X-linked mental retardation, indicating its potential involvement in synaptic development and function (Martinelli2014AP1S1).
