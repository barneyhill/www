# TMPRSS2

## Overview
TMPRSS2, or transmembrane protease serine 2, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane serine protease, which plays a significant role in various physiological and pathological processes. The protein, transmembrane serine protease 2, is characterized by its complex structure, including a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular region with distinct functional domains such as the LDLR-A, SRCR, and trypsin-like serine peptidase domains (Fraser2022Structure; David2020Structure). TMPRSS2 is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells of the prostate, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, where it is involved in proteolytic cascades and tissue remodeling (Thunders2020Gene). Notably, TMPRSS2 has gained attention for its role in facilitating viral entry, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2, by cleaving and activating viral proteins (Epstein2021The). Additionally, TMPRSS2 is implicated in prostate cancer through gene fusions with ETS transcription factors, influencing cancer progression and patient outcomes (Stopsack2020TMPRSS2). The gene's involvement in both cancer and viral infections underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
The TMPRSS2 protein is a type II transmembrane serine protease characterized by a complex molecular structure. It consists of a cytoplasmic domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and an extracellular region that includes several distinct domains. The extracellular region comprises a low-density lipoprotein receptor type-A (LDLR-A) domain, a Class A Scavenger Receptor Cysteine-Rich (SRCR) domain, and a C-terminal trypsin-like serine peptidase (SP) domain (Fraser2022Structure; David2020Structure).

The SP domain of TMPRSS2 features a canonical chymotrypsin/trypsin fold, consisting of two six-stranded beta barrels converging to form a central active site cleft. This domain contains a catalytic triad composed of Ser441, His296, and Asp345, which is essential for its proteolytic activity (Fraser2022Structure; Fraser2021Structure). The SRCR domain, located on the backside of the SP domain, is involved in protein-protein interactions and substrate recognition (Fraser2021Structure).

TMPRSS2 is synthesized as a zymogen and requires cleavage at a conserved Arg255-Ile256 peptide bond for activation (Fraser2022Structure). The protein also contains three disulfide bonds and a unique unpaired cysteine, Cys379, which is conserved across several species and may serve as an interaction hub (Fraser2022Structure; Fraser2021Structure). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation at specific sites (David2020Structure).

## Function
TMPRSS2 encodes a type II transmembrane serine protease involved in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, with high levels in the prostate, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract (Thunders2020Gene; Cao2021Computational). The protein is initially produced as a precursor zymogen and undergoes autoproteolytic activation to become functional (Thunders2020Gene).

In the prostate, TMPRSS2 is androgen-inducible and plays a role in proteolytic cascades that activate prostate-specific antigen, which is crucial for male reproductive capability (Thunders2020Gene). It also regulates epithelial sodium channel activity, suggesting a role in sodium homeostasis within the prostate gland (Thunders2020Gene). TMPRSS2 is involved in cleaving cell-membrane receptors, growth factors, cytokines, and components of the extracellular matrix, indicating its role in tissue remodeling and cellular signaling (Thunders2020Gene).

TMPRSS2 is also implicated in viral infections, such as those caused by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, by cleaving viral proteins to facilitate entry into host cells (Epstein2021The). This function highlights its role in pathogen defense, particularly in the respiratory tract (Cao2021Computational). Despite its involvement in these processes, TMPRSS2 knockout mice are asymptomatic, suggesting possible functional redundancy with other proteases (Kim2006Phenotypic).

## Clinical Significance
TMPRSS2 is clinically significant in both prostate cancer and viral infections, particularly COVID-19. In prostate cancer, TMPRSS2 frequently forms fusion genes with ETS family transcription factors, such as ERG, which are prevalent in about 50% of prostate cancers in men of European ancestry. This fusion is associated with androgen receptor signaling and is selected for by inflammatory oxidative DNA damage (Epstein2021The; Stopsack2020TMPRSS2). TMPRSS2 expression is higher in malignant prostate tissue compared to benign tissue, and its overexpression is linked to tumor grade and progression (Vaarala2001TheTMPRSS2; Ko2015AndrogenInduced). Mutations in TMPRSS2, such as missense mutations, are common in prostate adenocarcinoma and are associated with better survival outcomes in various cancers (Fu2022Impact).

In the context of viral infections, TMPRSS2 facilitates the entry of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 by priming the spike protein, which is crucial for viral fusion with host cells (Epstein2021The; David2020Structure). Polymorphisms in TMPRSS2, such as rs12329760, have been linked to increased severity of COVID-19, suggesting that genetic variations in TMPRSS2 can influence disease outcomes (Rokni2022Association). TMPRSS2 inhibitors, like camostat mesylate, have shown potential in reducing viral entry, highlighting the gene as a target for therapeutic intervention against COVID-19 (Stopsack2020TMPRSS2).

## Interactions
TMPRSS2 is a transmembrane serine protease that plays a crucial role in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells by interacting with the viral spike protein. This interaction involves the cleavage and activation of the spike protein at specific sites, Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816, which is essential for viral entry into host cells (Hussain2020Structural; Hussain2020Molecular). TMPRSS2 interacts with two loops of the spike protein, each containing a cleavage site, and key residues such as His296, Ser441, and Ser460 are involved in these interactions (Hussain2020Molecular).

TMPRSS2 also interacts with the human ACE2 receptor, which is the entry point for SARS-CoV-2. This interaction facilitates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, enhancing viral entry (Heurich2014TMPRSS2). TMPRSS2's activity is modulated by other proteases, such as ADAM17, although only TMPRSS2 enhances viral entry (Heurich2014TMPRSS2).

The protein's expression and stability are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasomal system, with DCAF1 identified as a key regulator of TMPRSS2 degradation. Compounds like halofuginone can reduce TMPRSS2 levels through this pathway, impacting its interaction with viral proteins (Chen2021A).
