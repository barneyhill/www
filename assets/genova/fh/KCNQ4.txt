# KCNQ4

## Overview
KCNQ4 is a gene that encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 4, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the auditory system. This protein is part of the KCNQ family of voltage-gated potassium channels, which are characterized by their six transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region essential for selective potassium ion transport (Namba2012In; Kubisch1999KCNQ4). The KCNQ4 channel is predominantly expressed in the outer hair cells of the cochlea, where it is vital for maintaining the electrochemical gradient necessary for hearing by regulating potassium ion flow and the resting membrane potential (Jentsch2000Neuronal). Mutations in the KCNQ4 gene are linked to autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, underscoring its importance in auditory physiology (Kubisch1999KCNQ4). The protein's interaction with calmodulin and KCNE β-subunits further modulates its activity, highlighting its complex regulatory mechanisms (Archer2019A; StrutzSeebohm2006Functional).

## Structure
The KCNQ4 protein is a voltage-gated potassium channel characterized by six transmembrane domains (S1-S6) and a pore-forming region between S5 and S6, typical of the KCNQ family (Namba2012In; Kubisch1999KCNQ4). The protein has a polypeptide chain of 695 amino acids with a predicted mass of 77 kDa (Kubisch1999KCNQ4). The pore region, crucial for selective potassium transport, includes a pore helix (PH) and a P-loop, with the S4 segment acting as a voltage sensor (Namba2012In).

The quaternary structure of KCNQ4 involves the formation of tetramers, which can be homomeric or heteromeric with other KCNQ subunits (Howard2007Structural). The A-domain Tail of KCNQ4 is a self-assembling, parallel, four-stranded coiled coil, essential for assembly specificity and channel function (Howard2007Structural). This domain is characterized by periodic heptad repeats, forming a tightly twisted left-handed coiled coil (Howard2007Structural).

Mutations in the pore region, such as G285S and Tyr270His, can disrupt channel function and are associated with hearing loss (Namba2012In; Kubisch1999KCNQ4). These mutations affect the electrostatic surface potential and structural stability, impacting potassium transport (Namba2012In).

## Function
The KCNQ4 gene encodes a potassium channel that plays a crucial role in the auditory system, particularly in the inner ear's sensory hair cells. These channels are involved in regulating the resting membrane potential and controlling potassium ion flow, which is essential for maintaining the electrochemical gradient necessary for hearing (Jentsch2000Neuronal). KCNQ4 channels are primarily expressed in the outer hair cells (OHCs) of the cochlea, where they facilitate potassium efflux across the basal membrane, preventing potassium overload and potential cell degeneration (Kharkovets2006Mice; Jentsch2000Neuronal).

In healthy human cells, KCNQ4 channels contribute to the repolarization phase of the action potential, which is vital for the proper function of OHCs and the amplification of sound (Kharkovets2006Mice). The channels are also involved in the recycling of potassium ions in the inner ear, a process critical for maintaining the high potassium concentration and positive potential of the endolymph, which is necessary for normal auditory function (Jentsch2000Neuronal). Mutations in KCNQ4 can lead to progressive hearing loss, highlighting its importance in auditory physiology (Kubisch1999KCNQ4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNQ4 gene are associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, specifically linked to the condition known as DFNA2A. This form of hearing loss is characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss, often affecting high frequencies (Shin2018A; Beisel2005Differential). The KCNQ4 gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel crucial for maintaining the membrane potential and potassium recycling in the cochlea's outer hair cells. Mutations in this gene lead to a reduction in potassium channel activity, which is essential for sound transduction in the inner ear (Shin2018A).

Several specific mutations have been identified, such as the c.140T>C (p.Leu47Pro) mutation, which results in decreased channel activity and fast deactivation kinetics, exerting a dominant-negative effect when co-expressed with wild-type KCNQ4 (Shin2018A). Another mutation, p.G296S, impairs channel function by reducing cell-surface expression, leading to deafness (Mencía2007A). These mutations often cluster around the pore region of the protein, leading to loss of potassium currents and hearing loss (Shin2018A; Mencía2007A).

The progressive nature of hearing loss associated with KCNQ4 mutations may be linked to an increasing mutational load expanding toward the apex in inner hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (Beisel2005Differential). The study of KCNQ4 mutations highlights the potential for therapeutic interventions, such as the use of KCNQ activators, to rescue channel activity and potentially treat or delay the progression of hearing loss (Shin2018A).

## Interactions
KCNQ4 interacts with calmodulin (CaM), a calcium-binding messenger protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating the channel's function. The interaction between KCNQ4 and CaM is mediated by calcium ions (Ca2+), which induce a conformational change in the proximal C terminus of KCNQ4, specifically in the A and B domains. These domains are intrinsically disordered in the absence of CaM but adopt an α-helical structure upon CaM binding. The N-lobe of CaM preferentially binds to the B domain, while the C-lobe interacts with the A domain, forming a stable trimeric complex (Archer2019A).

The binding affinity of CaM to the B domain is higher than to the A domain, and this interaction is essential for the functional expression and assembly of KCNQ channels in the plasma membrane. CaM is necessary to bring the A and B domains together, as no interaction is observed between them without CaM. This interaction is crucial for the channel's ability to interact with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the plasma membrane, which is essential for channel function (Archer2019A).

KCNQ4 also forms functional complexes with KCNE β-subunits, which modulate its channel activity. These interactions are important for understanding the functional properties of KCNQ4 in various physiological contexts (StrutzSeebohm2006Functional).
