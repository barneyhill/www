# AGXT

## Overview
The AGXT gene encodes the enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that plays a critical role in glyoxylate detoxification within the liver. AGT is categorized as a transferase enzyme and is primarily localized in peroxisomes, where it catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylate and alanine to glycine and pyruvate, thus preventing the accumulation of glyoxylate and its subsequent conversion to oxalate. This function is vital for maintaining normal oxalate levels and preventing the formation of calcium oxalate crystals, which can lead to kidney stones and renal failure. Mutations in the AGXT gene are associated with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), a genetic disorder characterized by excessive oxalate production. The gene is located on chromosome 2q37.3 and exhibits genetic variability, including polymorphic forms that influence enzyme stability and function (Oppici2015Liver; Williams2009Primary; Salido2006Alanine–glyoxylate).

## Structure
The AGXT gene encodes the enzyme alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), which is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme. The primary structure of AGT consists of 392 amino acids, forming a homodimer with each subunit having a molecular mass of approximately 43 kDa (Zhang2001Crystallization). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with the C-terminal domain containing three helices and a small two-stranded beta-sheet (Fodor2012Molecular).

The tertiary structure of AGT reveals a large catalytic domain and a smaller C-terminal domain, with PLP molecules bound to each protomer. The enzyme operates via a classical ping-pong mechanism, involving a Schiff base linkage with Lys209 (Oppici2015Liver). The quaternary structure is a homodimer, with the dimerization interface located in the large domain (Cellini2010Molecular).

AGT contains a non-canonical peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) motif, Lys-Lys-Leu (KKL), at its C-terminus, essential for peroxisomal translocation (Fodor2012Molecular). The AGXT gene has two main allelic forms, AGT-Ma and AGT-Mi, with the latter including polymorphisms that affect enzyme stability and localization (Cellini2011Human).

## Function
The AGXT gene encodes the enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), which plays a crucial role in glyoxylate detoxification in healthy human cells. AGT is primarily localized in the peroxisomes of liver cells, where it catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylate and alanine to glycine and pyruvate. This enzymatic activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of glyoxylate, which would otherwise be converted to oxalate, a compound that can form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals leading to kidney stones and renal failure (Williams2009Primary; Salido2006Alanine–glyoxylate).

The AGT enzyme functions as an 86-kDa homodimer, with each monomer binding one molecule of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), a cofactor necessary for its enzymatic activity (Williams2009Primary). The proper function of AGXT is crucial for maintaining normal oxalate levels in the body, thereby preventing conditions such as primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), which is characterized by excessive oxalate production due to AGT deficiency or dysfunction (Purdue1991Characterization; Tammachote2012Primary). The AGXT gene is located on chromosome 2q37.3 and consists of 11 exons spanning approximately 10 kb (Williams2009Primary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AGXT gene are primarily associated with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the overproduction of oxalate, leading to kidney stones, renal failure, and systemic oxalosis (Oppici2015Liver; CoulterMackie2004Genetic). The AGXT gene encodes the enzyme alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), which is crucial for detoxifying glyoxylate in the liver. Deficiencies in AGT due to genetic mutations result in the conversion of glyoxylate to oxalate, causing the accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals (Zhang2003Crystal; Oppici2015Liver).

The AGXT gene has two main polymorphic forms, the major and minor haplotypes, with the minor haplotype being associated with several mutations that affect enzyme stability and function, such as P11L and I340M (Oppici2015Liver). These mutations can exacerbate the effects of other pathogenic mutations like G170R and I244T, leading to mislocalization of the enzyme to mitochondria and reduced enzymatic activity (Oppici2015Liver; CoulterMackie2004Genetic).

The clinical variability in PH1 is influenced by the genetic heterogeneity of AGXT mutations, which include single nucleotide changes, frameshifts, and large deletions (CoulterMackie2004Genetic). Understanding these mutations is essential for diagnosis and treatment, as they significantly impact the clinical outcomes of affected individuals (Li2014Mutational).

## Interactions
Alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT) interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its proper localization and function. AGXT primarily interacts with the peroxisomal receptor Pex5p, which recognizes the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) motif on AGXT, facilitating its import into peroxisomes. This interaction involves the C-terminal domain of AGXT, specifically residues 283-392, which form a complex with Pex5p (MesaTorres2015Molecular; Fodor2012Molecular). The AGXT-Pex5p complex is characterized by a 1:1 stoichiometry and involves both polar and apolar surface interactions, with the binding process being primarily entropy-driven (Fodor2012Molecular).

AGXT also interacts with molecular chaperones such as Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp60 during its folding process. These interactions are particularly significant in disease-causing variants of AGXT, which are prone to misfolding and mistargeting, leading to mitochondrial mistargeting or peroxisomal aggregation (MesaTorres2015Molecular). The interaction with chaperones is more stable in mutant forms of AGXT, such as AGXT*LTM, which shows prolonged association with Hsc70 and Hsp90, leading to protein aggregation (Santana2003Primary). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions that regulate AGXT's localization and function within the cell.
