# SLCO2A1

## Overview
The SLCO2A1 gene encodes the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2A1, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the transport of prostaglandins across cell membranes. This protein, also known as the prostaglandin transporter (PGT), is integral to the regulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, a key mediator in inflammatory processes. SLCO2A1 is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains and is expressed in various tissues, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, and reproductive organs, where it influences local prostaglandin metabolism and signaling. The protein's function extends to its involvement in the Maxi-Cl channel, contributing to ATP release and purinergic signaling. Mutations in the SLCO2A1 gene are linked to several clinical conditions, such as primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and chronic enteropathy associated with SLCO2A1 gene (CEAS), highlighting its clinical significance in prostaglandin-related pathologies (Sabirov2017The; Nakanishi2021Recent).

## Structure
The SLCO2A1 protein, encoded by the SLCO2A1 gene, is a multifunctional transporter with a complex molecular structure. It consists of 644 amino acids and features 12 transmembrane domains, which are integral to its role in transporting organic anions across cell membranes (Van2009Molecular). The protein also includes 7 intracellular and 6 extracellular domains, contributing to its cationic nature due to the presence of positively and negatively charged amino acids (Van2009Molecular).

The SLCO2A1 protein contains critical prostaglandin binding sites and conserved features such as C-C disulfide bridges, N-linked glycosylation sites, and kinase phosphorylation sites, which are essential for its transport mechanism (Van2009Molecular). These post-translational modifications likely influence the protein's stability and activity. Sequence analysis reveals that 92% of the amino acids are identical to those in other mammals, indicating a high degree of conservation (Van2009Molecular).

The SLCO2A1 protein can exist in different conformations, with specific residues like R560, G222, and P219 playing crucial roles in its function. Mutations in these residues can affect channel activity, as observed in disease-causing mutants (Sabirov2017The). The protein's structure is similar to that of both selective transporters and efficient ion-conducting channels, supporting its dual functionality as a prostaglandin transporter and an anion channel (Sabirov2017The).

## Function
The SLCO2A1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a prostaglandin transporter, playing a crucial role in the regulation of prostaglandin (PG) levels in human cells. This protein is involved in the uptake and transport of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) across cell membranes, facilitating its delivery to sites of action and subsequent metabolism. This process is essential for maintaining normal physiological levels of PGE2, which is a potent inflammatory mediator (Nakanishi2021Recent).

SLCO2A1 is expressed in various tissues, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, and reproductive organs, where it influences local PG metabolism and signaling. In the lungs, it helps regulate PGE2 distribution during inflammation, contributing to lung homeostasis (Nakanishi2021Recent). In the kidneys, SLCO2A1 is involved in fluid regulation and natriuresis by facilitating PGE2 transport, which affects sodium reabsorption and water permeability (Nakanishi2021Recent).

The protein also plays a role in reproductive processes, such as ovulation and labor, by regulating PG concentrations in the uterus and ovaries (Nakanishi2021Recent). Additionally, SLCO2A1 is a component of the Maxi-Cl channel, involved in ATP release and purinergic signaling, which is important for cellular responses to stress (Sabirov2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLCO2A1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to their impact on prostaglandin metabolism. One significant condition linked to SLCO2A1 mutations is primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO), characterized by digital clubbing, pachydermia, and periostosis. These mutations lead to elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), contributing to the clinical manifestations of PHO (Zhang2012Exome; Seifert2012Mutations). 

Chronic enteropathy associated with SLCO2A1 gene (CEAS) is another condition caused by SLCO2A1 mutations. CEAS is marked by chronic nonspecific ulcers in the small intestine, leading to symptoms such as anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding. This condition is often misdiagnosed as Crohn's disease due to overlapping symptoms (Umeno2015A; Jimbo2020A). 

SLCO2A1 mutations can also result in isolated digital clubbing and familial digital clubbing, sometimes associated with colon neoplasia. These conditions are linked to inactivating mutations that disrupt prostaglandin transport, leading to elevated PGE2 levels (Guda2014Inactivating; Umair2023Homozygous). The phenotypic expression of these mutations can vary, with some cases showing gender-differentiated manifestations (Yuan2018Novel).

## Interactions
SLCO2A1, also known as the prostaglandin transporter (PGT), is involved in the transport of prostaglandins across cell membranes and participates in various interactions that influence its function. It interacts with prostaglandin receptors such as EP3 and EP4, which are involved in cellular responses to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). These interactions are crucial for assessing transport function and have been studied using label-free impedance-based assays (Mocking2024Labelfree). SLCO2A1 also facilitates the trans-cellular transport of PGE2 across epithelial cells, as demonstrated in renal and alveolar epithelial cells (Nakanishi2021Recent).

The transporter is involved in intracellular prostaglandin signaling by importing extracellular PGE2 in specific cell types, including human prostate cancer PC3 cells and endothelial cells. This function is essential for the metabolism of PGE2, a potent inflammatory mediator, to prevent persistent inflammation (Nakanishi2021Recent). SLCO2A1's interactions with proteins involved in prostaglandin signaling, such as EP receptors and PPARγ, suggest its role in complex regulatory networks, although the precise physiological functions of these interactions are not fully elucidated (Nakanishi2021Recent). These interactions highlight the importance of SLCO2A1 in modulating prostaglandin levels and influencing inflammatory responses.
