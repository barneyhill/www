# SLC25A36

## Overview
SLC25A36 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 36, a mitochondrial carrier protein involved in the transport of pyrimidine nucleotides across the mitochondrial membrane. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 25 (SLC25), which is characterized by its role in facilitating the exchange of small molecules across the mitochondrial membrane through a structure composed of six transmembrane α-helices (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). The SLC25A36 protein is essential for maintaining mitochondrial DNA replication and repair by ensuring the availability of pyrimidine nucleotides, which are crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism (Palmieri2013The; Curcio2020Drosophila). The gene is highly expressed in certain cell types, such as naive mouse embryonic stem cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining pluripotency and mitochondrial function (Xin2019Slc25a36). Alterations in the expression of SLC25A36 have been associated with various clinical conditions, including certain cancers, highlighting its potential significance in oncogenesis and mitochondrial-related diseases (Palmieri2013The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

## Structure
The SLC25A36 protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, characterized by a tripartite structure with three homologous domains. Each domain contains two hydrophobic transmembrane α-helices, separated by a hydrophilic sequence, resulting in a total of six transmembrane α-helices that form a funnel-shaped structure. This arrangement is typical of the solute carrier family 25 (SLC25), which facilitates the transport of small molecules across the mitochondrial membrane (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational).

The protein's structure includes conserved motifs that form salt bridges, crucial for the conformational changes required during the transport process. These changes allow the protein to alternate between cytoplasmic and matrix states, enabling the translocation of substrates such as pyrimidine nucleotides (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational).

While specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variants of SLC25A36 are not provided, the general structural features of the SLC25 family suggest that such modifications could influence its function and localization within the mitochondrial membrane (Palmieri2013The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

## Function
SLC25A36 is a mitochondrial carrier protein involved in the transport of pyrimidine nucleotides across the mitochondrial membrane. It primarily facilitates the exchange of cytosine and inosine, and to a lesser extent, guanine and uracil deoxynucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates. This transport activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and repair, as it ensures the availability of pyrimidine nucleotides necessary for these processes (Palmieri2013The; Curcio2020Drosophila).

In healthy human cells, SLC25A36 plays a significant role in mitochondrial biogenesis, particularly in conditions where the salvage pathway is insufficient. It is involved in the import of pyrimidine (d)NTPs into the mitochondrial matrix, which is essential for mtDNA synthesis and transcription, thereby supporting oxidative phosphorylation and energy metabolism (Curcio2020Drosophila).

The gene is highly expressed in certain cell types, such as naive mouse embryonic stem cells, where it is crucial for maintaining pluripotency by regulating mitochondrial function and glutathione levels. Its suppression can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, affecting mtDNA content and mitochondrial morphology, which in turn promotes differentiation (Xin2019Slc25a36).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC25A36 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function and nucleotide transport. Alterations in the expression of SLC25A36 have been associated with certain cancers. Notably, its expression is up-regulated in cervical cancer, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). Additionally, SLC25A36 is overexpressed in some cancer cell lines and primary prostate cancers, indicating a possible involvement in cancer biology (Palmieri2013The).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, the suppression of Slc25a36 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by decreased mitochondrial DNA content and altered mitochondrial morphology. This dysfunction results in the differentiation of stem cells, highlighting the gene's importance in maintaining pluripotency and mitochondrial integrity (Xin2019Slc25a36).

While specific diseases directly caused by mutations in SLC25A36 have not been extensively documented, its altered expression and function are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a common feature in various metabolic and degenerative diseases. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical implications of SLC25A36 mutations or expression changes.

## Interactions
SLC25A36 is involved in various interactions that influence mitochondrial function and nucleotide metabolism. Immunoprecipitation experiments have identified potential protein interactions of SLC25A36, which are enriched in focal adhesion, cell-cell adhesion, and ribosome functional clusters. These interactions suggest that SLC25A36 may play a role in cellular adhesion processes and protein synthesis (Xin2019Slc25a36).

The gene also interacts with other members of the SLC25 family, such as MTCH2 and SLC25A1, as part of a broader network of genetic interactions. These interactions highlight the redundancy and critical roles of SLC25 proteins in maintaining mitochondrial function under different metabolic conditions (Shi2022Combinatorial).

While specific protein interactions involving SLC25A36 are not extensively detailed, its role as a pyrimidine nucleotide carrier suggests it may interact with nucleic acids, particularly in the context of mitochondrial DNA and RNA synthesis. This function is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and supporting cellular energy production (Palmieri2013The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).
