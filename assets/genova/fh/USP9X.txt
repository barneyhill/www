# USP9X

## Overview
USP9X is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 9 X-linked, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein stability and function. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, USP9X plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including centrosome biogenesis, cell adhesion, polarity, and apoptosis (Murtaza2015La; Wang2017The). The protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure with distinct domains, including a catalytic domain and a CHC2-type zinc finger motif, which are essential for its deubiquitinating activity (Paudel2019Crystal). USP9X interacts with multiple proteins, such as E3 ubiquitin ligases, to modulate their stability and activity, highlighting its dynamic role in cellular homeostasis (Xie2013Deubiquitinase; Mouchantaf2006The). Clinically, mutations in the USP9X gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, where it can function as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, depending on the context (Murtaza2015La; Homan2014Mutations).

## Structure
The USP9X protein is a deubiquitinase with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. Its catalytic domain (CD) spans amino acids 1,551 to 1,970 and features a canonical USP fold comprising thumb, palm, and fingers subdomains (Paudel2019Crystal). A unique structural element is the β-hairpin insertion in the palm subdomain, which is conserved across species and plays a role in substrate recognition, particularly for proximal ubiquitin (Ub) chains (Paudel2019Crystal). The structure also includes a CHC2-type zinc finger (ZnF) motif in the fingers subdomain, crucial for binding ubiquitin chains (Paudel2019Crystal).

USP9X has three potential ubiquitin binding sites, labeled S1, S2, and S1′, which contribute to its substrate specificity and cleavage activity (Paudel2019Crystal). The protein is specific for ubiquitin and does not interact with ubiquitin-like modifiers such as ISG15 and NEDD8, due to specific polar residues at the binding interface (Paudel2019Crystal). The presence of a noncatalytic cysteine, which is involved in substrate recognition, adds another layer of complexity to its structure (Paudel2019Crystal). USP9X also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
USP9X is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of protein stability, localization, and activity by removing ubiquitin from target proteins, which affects their degradation and function (Murtaza2015La). USP9X is essential for centrosome biogenesis and function, stabilizing centrosome proteins such as PCM1 and CEP55, which are critical for proper centrosome duplication and cell division (Han2019Deubiquitylase; Wang2017The).

USP9X also maintains centriolar satellite integrity by stabilizing PCM1, preventing its proteasomal degradation, and ensuring the proper formation of centriolar satellite particles (Han2019Deubiquitylase). It is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes like cell adhesion, polarity, and apoptosis (Murtaza2015La). Additionally, USP9X is involved in translation initiation, particularly affecting cap-dependent translation, which is crucial for protein synthesis and cell proliferation (Li2017USP9X).

The enzyme's activity is context-specific, regulated by interactions with other proteins and cellular conditions, highlighting its dynamic role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and development (Murtaza2015La).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the USP9X gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). These mutations can disrupt neuronal cell migration and axonal growth, leading to intellectual disability, hypotonia, and short stature (Homan2014Mutations). In females, de novo loss-of-function mutations in USP9X cause a syndrome characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and various congenital malformations such as choanal atresia, cleft palate, and heart defects (Reijnders2016De). 

USP9X is also implicated in cancer, where it can act as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, depending on the context. It stabilizes the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1, contributing to chemotherapy resistance in some cancers, while in others, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, it functions as a tumor suppressor (Murtaza2015La). Alterations in USP9X expression levels are linked to poor outcomes in multiple myeloma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, while decreased expression is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer (Murtaza2015La). These findings highlight the complex role of USP9X in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
USP9X is a deubiquitinating enzyme that interacts with various proteins, influencing their stability and function. It interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF1, where the second WW domain of SMURF1 is essential for this interaction. USP9X deubiquitinates SMURF1, protecting it from proteasomal degradation and regulating its cellular stability and activity (Xie2013Deubiquitinase). USP9X also interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Itch, deubiquitinating it to prevent its degradation. This interaction is mediated through the WW domains of Itch, which are crucial for binding USP9X (Mouchantaf2006The).

USP9X forms complexes with multiple E3 ligases, including ITCH, SMURF1, and MARCH7, suggesting a role in controlling substrate ubiquitination and chain linkages (Paudel2019Crystal). It also interacts with TDRD3 to stabilize TOP3B by removing ubiquitin chains, preventing its proteasomal degradation (Saha2023The). In the context of viral infections, USP9X is involved in the reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) from its latent phase, influencing viral replication (Chappell2023KSHV). These interactions highlight USP9X's role in modulating protein stability and activity through deubiquitination.
