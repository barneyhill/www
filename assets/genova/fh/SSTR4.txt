# SSTR4

## Overview
The SSTR4 gene encodes the somatostatin receptor 4, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is involved in a variety of physiological processes. This receptor is primarily associated with the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, leading to decreased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and modulation of intracellular calcium concentrations. SSTR4 is expressed in several brain regions and peripheral tissues, where it plays a crucial role in neurotransmission, pain perception, and inflammation. It is particularly significant in the hippocampus, where it helps regulate seizures and neuronal excitability. The receptor's involvement in analgesic, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory functions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for various conditions, including inflammatory diseases and mood disorders (Nemes2021Human; Qiu2008Somatostatin; Lupp2021Reassessment).

## Function
The somatostatin receptor 4 (SSTR4) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. SSTR4 is primarily coupled to Gi/o proteins, which inhibit adenylate cyclase activity, leading to a reduction in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. This receptor also reduces intracellular calcium concentrations by inhibiting voltage-dependent calcium channels and activates inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) and M channels, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization (Theodoropoulou2013Somatostatin; Lupp2021Reassessment).

SSTR4 is involved in modulating neurotransmission and has been implicated in the regulation of seizures, particularly in the hippocampus. It is the predominant receptor in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and is critical for coupling to the M-current (I_M), which is important for preventing ictal events (Qiu2008Somatostatin). SSTR4 also plays a role in inhibiting and stimulating cell proliferation through various signaling pathways, including the activation of protein kinase C and MAP kinase-mediated serine phosphorylation (Lupp2021Reassessment).

In terms of organismal outcomes, SSTR4 has been associated with analgesic, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory functions, making it a potential target for drug development (Nemes2021Human). Its expression in various brain regions and peripheral tissues suggests a broad role in physiological processes, including pain perception and inflammation (Lupp2021Reassessment).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SSTR4 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Inflammatory diseases are notably affected by changes in SSTR4 activity. Studies using SSTR4 gene-deleted mice have shown that the absence of this receptor leads to increased inflammation, hyperalgesia, and airway hyperreactivity. These mice exhibit more severe symptoms in models of acute and chronic inflammation, such as carrageenan-induced paw edema and chronic arthritis, as well as enhanced airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity (Helyes2009Impaired). The SSTR4 receptor's role in modulating inflammatory responses suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs (Helyes2009Impaired).

In the context of neurological disorders, SSTR4 has been studied for its involvement in stress responses. Mice lacking the SSTR4 gene show altered behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to chronic stress, indicating a potential link to mood disorders such as depression (Scheich2017Higher). The receptor's expression in stress-related brain areas like the hippocampus and amygdala underscores its significance in emotional regulation and stress-induced behavioral changes (Scheich2017Higher).

## Interactions
Somatostatin receptor 4 (SSTR4) is known to interact with the delta-opioid receptor (dOR) to form a heteromeric complex. This interaction has been observed in various regions of the rat brain, including the cortex, striatum, and spinal cord, as well as in cultured striatal neurons and HEK-293 cells (Somvanshi2014δOpioid). The heterodimerization between SSTR4 and dOR is specific and selective, as demonstrated by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analysis, which confirmed constitutive heterodimerization in neuronal cells (Somvanshi2014δOpioid).

The interaction between SSTR4 and dOR influences several signaling pathways. It modulates the ERK1/2 and ERK5 MAPK signaling pathways, which are associated with neuropathic pain. SSTR4 activation leads to increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cells co-expressing dOR, while dOR alone does not significantly affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Somvanshi2014δOpioid). Additionally, SSTR4 and dOR negatively couple to adenylyl cyclase, inhibiting cAMP formation through a Gi protein-dependent mechanism. This results in a greater inhibition of cAMP formation when both receptors are activated together, compared to each receptor alone (Somvanshi2014δOpioid).

SSTR4 also plays a role in modulating AKT phosphorylation, a downstream effector of the PI3K signaling pathway. In cells co-expressing SSTR4 and dOR, AKT phosphorylation is predominantly influenced by dOR, indicating a complex interaction between these receptors in modulating pain signaling pathways (Somvanshi2014δOpioid).
