# MS4A4E

## Overview
MS4A4E is a gene that encodes the membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A member 4E (MS4A4E) protein, which is part of the MS4A family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their four transmembrane domains, which are integral to their role in cellular signaling, particularly within the immune system (Liang2001Identification; SilvaGomes2021Differential). The MS4A4E protein is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and is implicated in modulating immune cell activation and communication (Mattiola2021The; SilvaGomes2021Differential). Structurally, MS4A4E is similar to other MS4A family members, sharing significant sequence identity with MS4A4A, and is predicted to form oligomeric complexes that may participate in receptor signaling pathways (Mattiola2021The; Liang2001Structural). The gene has also been associated with the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Naj2011Common; Hollingworth2011Common).

## Structure
The MS4A4E protein is a member of the MS4A family, characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which are common structural features within this family (Liang2001Identification; SilvaGomes2021Differential). The protein is composed of 220 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 23,800 Daltons (Liang2001Structural). The transmembrane domains are highly conserved, particularly in the first three regions, which are crucial for the protein's function (Mattiola2021The; Liang2001Identification).

The MS4A4E protein shares a 76% identity with the MS4A4A protein, indicating a high degree of structural similarity, especially in the transmembrane domains and intracellular N- and C-terminal domains (Liang2001Structural). These domains are highly conserved between MS4A4E and MS4A4A but show divergence from other MS4A family members (Liang2001Structural).

MS4A4E is predicted to form oligomeric complexes, similar to other MS4A proteins, which may involve lateral associations with other proteins in lipid rafts (Mattiola2021The). The protein's structure allows it to participate in signal transduction processes, potentially forming part of receptor complexes (Liang2001Identification). The MS4A4E gene does not exhibit structural abnormalities that would prevent its expression, suggesting it is not a pseudogene (Liang2001Structural).

## Function
MS4A4E is a member of the MS4A gene family, which encodes proteins characterized by four transmembrane domains. These proteins are involved in cellular signaling processes, particularly within the immune system. MS4A4E is primarily expressed in myeloid cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, and is thought to play a role in modulating immune cell activation and communication (Mattiola2021The; SilvaGomes2021Differential).

The expression of MS4A4E is enhanced by dexamethasone and is broadly distributed across various tissues, with the highest levels observed in the liver. It is predominantly found in cells with macrophage morphology and polymorphonuclear cells, suggesting its involvement in normal physiological processes related to immune function (SilvaGomes2021Differential). The transcriptional regulation of MS4A4E may involve the transcription factor PU.1, which is known to regulate genes in myeloid cells (SilvaGomes2021Differential).

MS4A4E is also noted to have molecular partners such as TREM2 and CLEC7A, which are mainly expressed by myeloid cells, indicating a potential role in immune cell signaling pathways (SilvaGomes2021Differential). Despite these insights, the specific molecular functions of MS4A4E in healthy human cells remain under investigation.

## Clinical Significance
The MS4A4E gene has been implicated in the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Genetic association studies have identified common variants at the MS4A locus, including MS4A4E, that are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in the expression or mutations of the MS4A4E gene may contribute to this condition (Naj2011Common; Hollingworth2011Common).

The interaction between genetic variants in the MS4A4E and CLU genes has been shown to modulate Alzheimer's disease risk. Specifically, the interaction between rs11136000 in CLU and rs670139 in MS4A4E has a significant association with Alzheimer's disease risk, particularly in individuals who are APOEε4 negative. This interaction has a dominant effect and may play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (Ebbert2015Interaction).

Additionally, the MS4A4E gene is part of the MS4A gene cluster, which is associated with cerebrospinal fluid soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) concentrations. Variants in this gene cluster, including MS4A4E, are linked to alterations in sTREM2 levels, which are relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology (Deming2019The).
