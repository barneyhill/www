# BDH1

## Overview
BDH1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1, a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a pivotal role in ketone body metabolism. This enzyme is part of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (SC-ADH) family and is characterized by a Rossmann fold, which is typical for NAD(P)-binding proteins (Green1996Wild). BDH1 catalyzes the reversible conversion of acetoacetate to β-hydroxybutyrate, a critical reaction for energy homeostasis, especially during fasting or low-carbohydrate intake when glucose is scarce (Uchihashi2017CardiacSpecific). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining a balance between acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, supporting energy production and cellular function in tissues with high energy demands (Major2017E2F6). Beyond its metabolic role, BDH1 influences gene expression and cellular signaling pathways, impacting processes such as oxidative stress response and cardiac function (Uchihashi2017CardiacSpecific). The gene's expression and function have clinical significance, particularly in the context of acute myeloid leukemia, where its expression levels correlate with patient prognosis (Han2021AntiTumor).

## Structure
The BDH1 protein, also known as (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in ketone body metabolism. It consists of 297 amino acids in its mature form, following the cleavage of an N-terminal leader peptide (Green1996Wild). The protein is part of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (SC-ADH) family and features a Rossmann fold, which is typical for NAD(P)-binding proteins (Green1996Wild). The C-terminal domain, comprising residues 195-297, is crucial for lipid binding and substrate specificity, particularly for phosphatidylcholine (PC) (LoebHennard2000(R)3Hydroxybutyrate page 0 of 9). This domain is suggested to form a PC-selective lipid binding site, contributing to the enzyme's activation (LoebHennard2000(R)3Hydroxybutyrate page 7 of 9).

BDH1 can form homotetramers, indicating a quaternary structure (Green1996Wild). The enzyme's activity is dependent on PC, and its C-terminal domain is implicated in forming stable protein-lipid complexes (LoebHennard2000(R)3Hydroxybutyrate page 0 of 9). The protein's structure and function are influenced by specific residues, such as Cys242, which is important for substrate binding (Green1996Wild). The enzyme may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
BDH1 (3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in ketone body metabolism, specifically catalyzing the reversible conversion of acetoacetate to β-hydroxybutyrate. This reaction is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly during periods of fasting or low-carbohydrate intake, when glucose availability is limited. BDH1 operates within the mitochondria, where it facilitates the utilization of ketone bodies as an alternative energy source, supporting tissues such as the brain and muscles (Uchihashi2017CardiacSpecific).

In healthy human cells, BDH1 is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism by modulating the levels of ketone bodies, which serve as signaling molecules and energy substrates. The enzyme's activity ensures a balance between acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, which is essential for efficient energy production and cellular function. This balance is particularly important in tissues with high energy demands or during metabolic stress (Major2017E2F6).

BDH1's role extends beyond energy production, as it also influences gene expression and cellular signaling pathways. By regulating ketone body levels, BDH1 impacts processes such as oxidative stress response and cardiac function, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Uchihashi2017CardiacSpecific).

## Clinical Significance
The BDH1 gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Studies have shown that BDH1 expression is significantly lower in AML cells compared to normal hematopoietic stem cells, and this downregulation is associated with a worse prognosis in AML patients (Han2021AntiTumor). Lower BDH1 expression correlates with poor overall survival, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker for AML prognosis (Han2021AntiTumor). In contrast, higher BDH1 expression is observed in patients with CEBPA biallelic mutations, which are linked to a better prognosis in AML (Han2021AntiTumor).

Functional studies indicate that overexpression of BDH1 in AML cells reduces cell viability and proliferation, highlighting its potential anti-tumor effects. Conversely, knocking down BDH1 expression increases the proliferation rate of AML cells, further supporting its role in inhibiting tumor growth (Han2021AntiTumor). These findings suggest that BDH1 plays a critical role in the dysregulation of ketone body metabolism in AML, and targeting BDH1 could offer therapeutic potential in treating this type of leukemia (Han2021AntiTumor). The gene's involvement in ketogenesis and ketolysis underscores its importance in energy metabolism, which may be disrupted in cancerous conditions (Han2021AntiTumor).
