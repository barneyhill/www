# GOLGA6C

## Overview
GOLGA6C is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family member C, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are known for their role in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. Golgin A6 family member C is thought to be involved in vesicle tethering and membrane trafficking processes, contributing to the dynamic nature of the Golgi apparatus. The precise biological functions and interactions of GOLGA6C remain an area of active research, with implications for understanding cellular organization and potential links to various diseases.
