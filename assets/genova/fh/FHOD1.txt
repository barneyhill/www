# FHOD1

## Overview
FHOD1 is a gene that encodes the protein formin homology 2 domain containing 1, which is a member of the formin family of proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, a fundamental process for maintaining cell shape, motility, and integrity. Unlike other formins, FHOD1 functions primarily as an actin filament capping and bundling factor, stabilizing actin structures rather than nucleating or elongating them. It is activated by phosphorylation through the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell spreading, adhesion maturation, and migration. FHOD1's interactions with GTPases such as Rac and RhoA, as well as its involvement in the ERK MAP kinase pathway, underscore its importance in actin dynamics and cellular signaling (Iskratsch2013FHOD1; Schönichen2013FHOD1; Boehm2005The).

## Structure
The FHOD1 protein is a member of the Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) and plays a role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization. It contains several key domains, including the FH1, FH2, and DAD domains, which are characteristic of DRFs. The FH2 domain is crucial for actin polymerization, forming a head-to-tail dimer that interacts with actin molecules (Schulte2008The). The N-terminal region of FHOD1 includes a GTPase-binding domain (GBD) and an FH3 domain. The FH3 domain is composed of five armadillo repeats, similar to other formins, and is involved in subcellular localization and regulation (Schulte2008The). The GBD of FHOD1 shows structural similarity to the ubiquitin superfold, akin to the Ras-binding domains of c-Raf1 or PI3 kinase, and is recruited by Rac and Ras GTPases (Schulte2008The).

FHOD1 can undergo intramolecular interactions, where the N-terminal GBD interacts with the C-terminal DAD, a mechanism that can be released by GTPase binding (Madrid2004Oligomerization). The protein can also form intermolecular interactions, allowing for oligomerization, with the coiled-coil motif being essential for this process (Madrid2004Oligomerization). Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues within the DAD by the Rho-associated kinase ROCK is necessary for FHOD1 activation (Schönichen2013FHOD1). The protein's function in stress fiber formation is linked to interactions with activated RhoA or Rac1 GTPases (Schönichen2013FHOD1).

## Function
The FHOD1 protein is a member of the formin family and functions as an actin filament capping and bundling factor in healthy human cells. Unlike other formins, FHOD1 does not nucleate or elongate actin filaments but instead stabilizes and bundles them, particularly in actin arcs and stress fibers. This activity is crucial for maintaining cell shape and integrity by protecting actin filaments from depolymerization (Schönichen2013FHOD1).

FHOD1 is activated by phosphorylation through the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), which enables it to associate with actin structures and contribute to the formation of thicker stress fibers. This process is important for cell movement and morphology, as FHOD1 is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics and the stabilization of cytoskeletal structures (Schönichen2013FHOD1).

In cellular contexts, FHOD1 is recruited to early integrin clusters, where it facilitates actin assembly and organization, playing a critical role in cell spreading and adhesion maturation. It is essential for the formation of actin structures that couple myosin traction forces to adhesion sites, supporting efficient cell migration and spreading (Iskratsch2013FHOD1).

## Clinical Significance
FHOD1 is implicated in various diseases through its altered expression and interactions. In myotonic dystrophies types 1 and 2 (DM1 and DM2), FHOD1 transcripts undergo aberrant splicing, potentially contributing to impaired cardiac function, a characteristic of these conditions (LabatdeHoz2021Formins). In cancer, FHOD1 plays a significant role in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion, processes crucial for cancer metastasis. Its altered expression is linked to lung carcinoma and oral squamous carcinoma, where it regulates invasion by controlling invadopodia formation (LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

In gastric cancer, high FHOD1 expression correlates with poor overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Mansuri2021FHOD1). FHOD1 is also involved in breast cancer, where it is targeted by miR-200c, a microRNA that inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion by reducing FHOD1 expression (Jurmeister2012MicroRNA200c). These findings highlight FHOD1's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target. Its involvement in actin cytoskeletal dynamics underscores its significance in cell motility and structural integrity, contributing to disease pathogenesis when dysregulated (Koka2003The).

## Interactions
FHOD1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in actin dynamics and cellular processes. It efficiently interacts with the GTPase Rac, which is crucial for its recruitment into membrane ruffles and lamellipodia formation. The FH1 domain of FHOD1 is important for maintaining its affinity for Rac, while the FH2 domain is necessary for its association with actin filaments (Gasteier2003Activation). FHOD1 also interacts with nesprin-2G, a component of the LINC complex, which is essential for nuclear movement and centrosome orientation in fibroblasts. This interaction is necessary for the formation of TAN lines that couple the nucleus to dorsal actin cables (Kutscheidt2014FHOD1).

FHOD1 is involved in the ERK MAP kinase pathway, co-precipitating with Raf-1 and MEK, but not with p38 MAP kinase or JNK. This interaction is crucial for FHOD1-induced gene expression from the serum response element, which is dependent on ERK MAP kinase activation (Boehm2005The). Additionally, FHOD1 interacts with proteins such as protein kinase C binding protein 1 (PRKCBP1), cyclophilin B, and WISH-B, with the FH1 domain being necessary for these interactions (Westendorf2004Identification). FHOD1 also interacts with Src family kinases, which is necessary for its localization to integrin clusters and activation by ROCK, playing a role in actin polymerization during cell spreading (Iskratsch2013FHOD1).
