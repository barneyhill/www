# CMBL

## Overview
The CMBL gene encodes the enzyme carboxymethylenebutenolidase homolog, which is a member of the hydrolase family. This enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of specific substrates, playing a crucial role in various metabolic pathways. The protein encoded by CMBL is characterized by its ability to catalyze the conversion of certain chemical compounds, contributing to the regulation of biochemical processes within the cell. Its activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several physiological and pathological conditions. Understanding the function and regulation of the CMBL gene and its protein product is important for elucidating their roles in health and disease.
