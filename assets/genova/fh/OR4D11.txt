# OR4D11

## Overview
OR4D11 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily D member 11, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory system. Located on chromosome 11q12, OR4D11 is part of a gene cluster that influences olfactory sensitivity, particularly in relation to dietary preferences such as tea consumption, due to its interaction with specific odorants like β-ionone (Cole2019Comprehensive; Cole2020Comprehensive). The expression of OR4D11 in the olfactory epithelium underscores its importance in the perception of smell, while its responsiveness to environmental factors, such as ultrafine particulate matter, suggests a broader role in sensory adaptation and potential environmental susceptibility (Solaimani2017Exposure).

## Function
OR4D11 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR4D11 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (Solaimani2017Exposure).

The gene is located on chromosome 11q12 and is part of a cluster of olfactory receptor genes associated with dietary habits, particularly the consumption of tea. This association is linked to the sensitivity to β-ionone, a floral aroma compound found in tea, highlighting the role of OR4D11 in odor perception related to dietary preferences (Cole2019Comprehensive; Cole2020Comprehensive).

In addition to its role in olfactory transduction, OR4D11 has been implicated in the response to environmental factors, such as exposure to ultrafine particulate matter, which can alter its expression in human neurons. This suggests a potential susceptibility to environmental modifications (Solaimani2017Exposure).
