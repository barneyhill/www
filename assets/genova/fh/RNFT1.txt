# RNFT1

## Overview
RNFT1, or ring finger protein, transmembrane 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating the degradation of misfolded or unfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby mitigating ER stress and preventing apoptosis (Kaneko2016Genomewide). The RNFT1 protein is characterized by its RING-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is crucial for tagging proteins with ubiquitin to signal their degradation (Kaneko2016Genomewide). Localized to the ER, RNFT1 interacts with various proteins, including the ER-resident chaperone PDI, and is involved in modulating protein stability and cellular stress responses (Kaneko2016Genomewide; Tan2018TRIM59). While its role in ER stress and cancer biology is being actively explored, the full spectrum of RNFT1's physiological functions and substrates in human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Function
RNFT1 (ring finger protein, transmembrane 1) is a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It plays a crucial role in maintaining protein quality control by promoting the degradation of unfolded proteins that accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby protecting cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis (Kaneko2016Genomewide). RNFT1 exhibits RING-dependent E3 activity, which is essential for its function in the ubiquitination process, a critical step in tagging proteins for degradation (Kaneko2016Genomewide).

The protein is localized to the ER, where it partially colocalizes with the ER-resident chaperone PDI, indicating its involvement in ERAD (Kaneko2016Genomewide). Although RNFT1's expression is not significantly induced by ER stress, its activity is crucial for exporting proteins from the ER to the cytosol, a vital function in the ERAD pathway (Kaneko2016Genomewide). RNFT1's role in cellular homeostasis is underscored by its ability to confer resistance to ER stress-induced apoptosis when overexpressed in certain cell types, such as neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells (Kaneko2016Genomewide). However, its specific substrates and broader physiological roles in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Kaneko2016Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
RNFT1, a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It has been shown to partially colocalize with the ER-resident chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), indicating its localization to the ER and suggesting a role in the degradation of unfolded proteins (Kaneko2016Genomewide). RNFT1 also interacts with PDCD10, a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways. This interaction is mediated through RNFT1's ability to induce K63-linked ubiquitination of PDCD10, which targets it for p62-selective autophagic degradation. However, TRIM59, another E3 ubiquitin ligase, can block this ubiquitination, thereby stabilizing PDCD10 and affecting downstream signaling pathways in breast cancer cells (Tan2018TRIM59). These interactions highlight RNFT1's role in modulating protein stability and cellular stress responses, particularly in the context of ER stress and cancer biology. The specific mechanisms by which RNFT1 interacts with other proteins and its potential substrates in various cellular contexts remain areas of active research.
