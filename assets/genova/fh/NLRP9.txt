# NLRP9

## Overview
NLRP9 is a gene that encodes the NLR family pyrin domain containing 9 protein, which is a member of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) family. This protein is characterized by its pyrin domain (PYD), NACHT domain, and leucine-rich repeats (LRR), and it plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by participating in the formation of inflammasomes. These multi-protein complexes are essential for the activation of inflammatory responses, particularly through the maturation of cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. NLRP9 is predominantly expressed in reproductive organs and is involved in early embryonic development, as well as in the immune response to rotavirus infection in the intestine. The protein's unique structural features, including a bent N-terminal loop in its PYD, suggest an autoinhibitory mechanism that regulates inflammasome assembly, distinguishing it from other NLR family members (Mullins2020NLRP9; Amoushahi2020Maternally; Ha2020Crystal).

## Structure
The NLRP9 protein is a member of the NLR family and features a pyrin domain (PYD) at the N-terminus, a central NACHT domain, and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR) (Marleaux2020Crystal). The PYD of NLRP9 is characterized by a six antiparallel helical bundle, typical of the death domain superfamily, and is stabilized by a central hydrophobic core (Marleaux2020Crystal). This domain does not self-polymerize or promote ASC speck formation, suggesting an autoinhibitory mechanism that prevents oligomerization and activation (Mullins2020NLRP9). The NLRP9 PYD contains a bent N-terminal loop that may regulate inflammasome assembly by preventing filament formation (Ha2020Crystal). 

The NLRP9 PYD structure is monomeric in solution and does not form filaments, unlike other PYDs such as NLRP3 and NLRP6 (Marleaux2020Crystal). Structural comparisons indicate that NLRP9 PYD has charge inversions and hydrophobic insertions at key positions, which may prevent filament formation (Marleaux2020Crystal). The protein's structure is compatible with filament formation, but charge inversions might disrupt potential filament formation (Marleaux2020Crystal). The NLRP9 protein is expressed in reproductive organs and plays a role in recognizing rotavirus RNA fragments in intestinal epithelial cells (Ha2020Crystal).

## Function
NLRP9, a member of the NLR family pyrin domain containing proteins, plays a significant role in innate immunity and inflammation. It is primarily expressed in reproductive organs such as ovaries and testes, and is involved in early embryonic development. In humans, NLRP9 is highly expressed in primordial and primary follicles, suggesting a role in reproductive processes (Amoushahi2020Maternally). The protein is involved in the formation of inflammasomes, which are crucial for activating caspase-1 and the maturation of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18 (Ha2020Crystal).

Structurally, the NLRP9 pyrin domain (PYD) is characterized by a bent N-terminal loop, which may regulate inflammasome assembly by preventing the formation of helical filament structures necessary for inflammasome formation. This suggests a potential autoinhibitory role, regulating inflammasome activity in healthy cells (Ha2020Crystal). NLRP9 is also involved in the immune response to rotavirus infection in the intestine, where it interacts with viral RNA through the RNA helicase DHX9, forming inflammasomes to restrict viral replication (Mullins2020NLRP9). Despite its known functions, the specific molecular mechanisms of NLRP9 activation and its role in healthy human cells remain areas for further research (Xu2024NLRP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NLRP9 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, frameshift mutations in NLRP9 are associated with gastric and colonic cancers exhibiting high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). These mutations occur in 15.5% of MSI-H gastric cancers and 5.5% of MSI-H colonic cancers, but are absent in microsatellite stable (MSS) cancers. The presence of these mutations correlates with reduced NLRP9 expression, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of these cancers (Moon2021Somatic).

NLRP9 is also linked to acute lung injury (ALI), where its activation enhances neutrophilic inflammation and decreases survival rates. Inhibition of NLRP9b, an isoform of NLRP9, has been shown to reduce inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in ALI models, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Yanling2018Inhibition).

In autoimmune diseases, NLRP9 has been associated with multiple sclerosis, where it is expressed in microglia/macrophages at the margins of inflammatory lesions. Although specific associations with disease progression are not detailed, its involvement in inflammasome activity suggests a potential role in the disease course (GilVarea2018Exome).

## Interactions
NLRP9, a member of the NLR family, is involved in forming inflammasomes, which are crucial for initiating inflammatory responses. NLRP9 interacts with the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) to facilitate inflammasome assembly. This interaction is essential for recruiting and activating caspase-1, leading to the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Mullins2020NLRP9; Ha2020Crystal).

NLRP9b, an isoform of NLRP9, plays a protective role in the intestine by forming inflammasomes in response to rotavirus infection. It does not directly bind viral RNA but interacts with short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) through the RNA helicase DHX9, which acts as an intermediary. This interaction is crucial for distinguishing between viral and host RNA, facilitating the activation of the inflammasome (Xu2024NLRP; Mullins2020NLRP9).

The pyrin domain (PYD) of NLRP9 is involved in these interactions, although it does not self-polymerize like other NLRs, suggesting an autoinhibitory mechanism. This is attributed to a kinked N-terminal loop and charge inversions that prevent polymerization, thus regulating inflammasome assembly (Mullins2020NLRP9; Ha2020Crystal).
