# GRAMD1B

## Overview
GRAMD1B is a gene that encodes the GRAM domain-containing 1B protein, which is integral to cellular cholesterol transport and homeostasis. This protein is categorized as a membrane-associated protein, primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and active at contact sites between the ER and the plasma membrane (PM). It plays a pivotal role in sensing and transporting cholesterol, utilizing its GRAM and StART-like domains to maintain cellular lipid balance, which is crucial for various physiological processes, including steroid hormone production (Jonas2023MiR46465p). Beyond its role in cholesterol regulation, GRAMD1B is involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, suggesting a broader functional significance (Esposito2022A). The gene's clinical relevance is underscored by its association with diseases such as multiple sclerosis and melanoma, where it has been implicated in disease susceptibility and metastasis suppression, respectively (Suresh2022Identifying; Esposito2022A).

## Function
The GRAMD1B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cholesterol transport and homeostasis within cells. This protein is anchored in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is active at contact sites between the ER and the plasma membrane (PM). It senses accessible cholesterol in the PM through its GRAM domain and facilitates its transport to the ER using its StART-like domain. This transport is essential for maintaining cholesterol balance within cells, which is vital for various cellular processes, including the production of steroid hormones (Jonas2023MiR46465p).

In conditions of high cholesterol levels, GRAMD1B helps deactivate the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2), a master transcriptional regulator involved in cholesterol uptake and biosynthesis. This function underscores its role in regulating cholesterol levels and cellular lipid dynamics (Jonas2023MiR46465p).

The protein's activity is not limited to cholesterol transport; it is also implicated in the JAK-STAT signaling cascade in certain cancer cell lines, although its specific functions in healthy human cells remain less clear (Esposito2022A). The GRAMD1B protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it may play a role in central nervous system function (Esposito2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GRAMD1B gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably multiple sclerosis (MS) and melanoma. In the context of MS, a study identified a rare variant in the GRAMD1B gene (p.S601P) in a large Italian family with multiple MS cases, suggesting a potential role in MS susceptibility. This variant is located in a highly conserved region and is associated with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. GRAMD1B was found to be downregulated in affected individuals, particularly those treated with IFNβ, indicating a possible modulation by immune pathways (Esposito2022A). Although the variant was not replicated in other MS cases, the study suggests GRAMD1B's involvement in MS and highlights the need for further research (Esposito2022A).

In melanoma, GRAMD1B acts as a metastasis suppressor. Loss of GRAMD1B expression in zebrafish models led to increased primary tumor area and visceral metastasis. In human melanoma, low GRAMD1B expression was associated with poor survival outcomes. The gene's loss was linked to the upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, promoting metastasis (Suresh2022Identifying). These findings suggest that GRAMD1B plays a critical role in suppressing metastatic potential in melanoma.

## Interactions
GRAMD1B is involved in interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cholesterol transport and cellular processes. It interacts with the NPC1 protein at membrane contact sites (MCS) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and late endocytic organelles. This interaction is influenced by the sterol environment and is crucial for the regulation of cholesterol transport. The interaction between GRAMD1B and NPC1 was confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays, which demonstrated that GRAMD1B co-immunoprecipitates with NPC1, indicating a specific interaction at these contact sites (Höglinger2019NPC1).

GRAMD1B is also implicated in the regulation of the sterol environment within the endocytic pathway, suggesting its role in lipid transfer and membrane dynamics. Although the specific interactions of GRAMD1B with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its involvement in these processes highlights its potential role in cellular lipid regulation (Höglinger2019NPC1).

In the context of multiple sclerosis, GRAMD1B expression is modulated by inflammatory conditions, but specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Esposito2022A).
