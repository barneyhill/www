# SYT4

## Overview
The SYT4 gene encodes the protein synaptotagmin 4, a member of the synaptotagmin family, which is primarily involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptic function. Synaptotagmin 4 is characterized as a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic domain containing two C2 domains, C2A and C2B, which are integral to its function (Zhang2023Neuronal). Unlike other synaptotagmins, synaptotagmin 4 has a unique role in calcium-independent interactions due to a mutation in its C2A domain, affecting its calcium-binding properties (Glavan2009Synaptotagmins). This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including the modulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release in neurons and the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells (Dean2012Axonal; Huang2018Synaptotagmin). Alterations in SYT4 expression have been linked to several diseases, such as diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Huang2018Synaptotagmin; Glavan2009Synaptotagmins).

## Structure
Synaptotagmin 4 (SYT4) is a member of the synaptotagmin family, characterized by its involvement in neurotransmitter release. The primary structure of SYT4 includes a cytoplasmic domain with two C2 domains, known as C2A and C2B, which are crucial for its function (Zhang2023Neuronal). These domains are involved in calcium binding, a common feature of synaptotagmins, although SYT4's role in calcium-dependent processes is less pronounced compared to other family members.

The secondary structure of SYT4 typically involves beta-sheets and alpha-helices, which are common in C2 domains. The tertiary structure of SYT4 is defined by the overall 3D conformation of these domains, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins, such as the neuronal scaffold protein ARMS. The interaction between SYT4 and ARMS is mediated by the C2AB domain, which requires the coordinated participation of both C2A and C2B domains (Zhang2023Neuronal).

SYT4 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which may result in distinct functional roles within the cell. These structural features contribute to SYT4's role in vesicle fusion regulation and its distribution on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-carrying dense core vesicles (Zhang2023Neuronal).

## Function
Synaptotagmin 4 (SYT4) is a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neurons and pancreatic β cells. In neurons, SYT4 is localized to neurotrophin-containing dense-core vesicles and plays a role in modulating the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and neuronal function (Dean2012Axonal). Unlike other synaptotagmins, SYT4 does not bind calcium in the same way due to a mutation in its C2A domain, which affects its role as a calcium sensor (Glavan2009Synaptotagmins). It is implicated in retrograde signaling at synapses, influencing synaptic growth and neurotransmitter release (Barber2009Postsynaptic).

In pancreatic β cells, SYT4 regulates the calcium sensitivity of insulin secretion vesicles, which is essential for proper insulin release in response to glucose. This regulation is crucial for β cell maturation and function, with SYT4 expression being modulated by prolactin receptor-mediated signaling (Huang2018Synaptotagmin). SYT4's role in insulin secretion is conserved across species, although its effects can vary between humans and mice (Huang2018Synaptotagmin). Understanding SYT4's function in these processes is important for insights into diabetes therapy and β cell development (Huang2018Synaptotagmin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SYT4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of diabetes, dysfunctional islets from type II diabetic patients express lower levels of SYT4, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathophysiology (Huang2018Synaptotagmin). SYT4 is also involved in the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells, and its dysregulation could impact insulin secretion and β cell function, potentially contributing to metabolic disorders like diabetes (Huang2018Synaptotagmin).

In neurodegenerative diseases, SYT4 expression is altered in models of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease. In PD, SYT4 mRNA levels are increased in the striatum of rats treated with L-DOPA, indicating its involvement in synaptic transmission changes associated with treatment (Glavan2009Synaptotagmins). Additionally, SYT4 is upregulated in astrocytes surrounding b-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease models, suggesting a role in local inflammation and neurodegeneration (Glavan2009Synaptotagmins).

The SYT4 gene is also associated with the regulation of brain pH, particularly in the substantia nigra, a region affected in PD. Variants in SYT4, such as rs12456492, influence gene expression and pH regulation, potentially impacting PD pathology (Patel2021A).

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 4 (SYT4) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in neurotransmitter release and synaptic function. SYT4 interacts with syntaxin isoforms, including syntaxin 1a, 2, 3, and 4, through its C2A domain in a calcium-independent manner. This interaction is distinct from synaptotagmin I, which requires calcium for binding to syntaxins (Thomas1999Functional). The C2B domain of SYT4 can bind calcium, facilitating homo- and hetero-oligomerization with synaptotagmin I, which is crucial for neurotransmitter release (Thomas1999Functional).

SYT4 also interacts with the neuronal scaffold protein ARMS through its C2AB domain. This interaction is mediated by the ankyrin repeat domain of ARMS and is specific to SYT4, as ARMS does not bind with other synaptotagmins like SYT1 or SYT3 (Zhang2023Neuronal). Additionally, SYT4 is phosphorylated by JNK1 at Ser135, a modification essential for nerve growth factor-enhanced Ca2+-evoked release. This phosphorylation facilitates the translocation of SYT4 to mature secretory vesicles, where it co-localizes with synaptotagmin 1 (Mori2007JNK). These interactions highlight SYT4's role in modulating synaptic signaling and plasticity.
