# MBLAC2

## Overview
MBLAC2 is a gene that encodes the protein metallo-beta-lactamase domain containing 2, which is characterized by its metallo-beta-lactamase domain. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of extracellular vesicle biology and lipid metabolism. As an acyl-CoA hydrolase, MBLAC2 interacts with other proteins, such as the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC20, influencing endocytosis and vesicle dynamics (Lechner2021Target). The protein's role extends to being a common off-target for hydroxamate-based histone deacetylase inhibitors, implicating it in the regulation of cellular enzymatic processes (Kleymenova2024InCell). Clinically, MBLAC2 has been associated with cancer therapy outcomes and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (ContrerasSanzón2022Histone; Wang2024Identification).

## Function
MBLAC2, a metallo-beta-lactamase domain-containing protein, is involved in several cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of extracellular vesicle biology and lipid metabolism. It functions as an acyl-CoA hydrolase and interacts with proteins such as the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC20, which is involved in endocytosis-mediated EGFR internalization (Lechner2021Target). The inhibition or knockdown of MBLAC2 leads to the accumulation of extracellular vesicles, suggesting that it may act as a negative regulator of vesicle formation or a positive regulator of vesicle uptake (Lechner2021Target). This role in vesicle biology is significant, given the importance of exosome biology in various physiological and pathological contexts, including neurological diseases and cancer (Lechner2021Target).

MBLAC2 is also implicated in lipid metabolism, as its knockdown results in changes in lipid levels, such as the downregulation of hexosylceramides and the upregulation of sphingomyelins (Lechner2021Target). Although its exact ceramidase activity has not been demonstrated, these findings suggest a potential role in lipid regulation in healthy human cells (Lechner2021Target). MBLAC2's activity is essential for accurate testing of histone deacetylase inhibitors, indicating its broader involvement in cellular enzymatic processes (Kleymenova2024InCell).

## Clinical Significance
MBLAC2 has been identified as a significant off-target for various histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), which are used in cancer therapy. The inhibition of MBLAC2 by these drugs can lead to the accumulation of extracellular vesicles, suggesting a role in vesicle biology that may impact cancer progression and treatment outcomes (ContrerasSanzón2022Histone; Lechner2021Target). This off-target effect highlights the potential for MBLAC2 to influence drug efficacy and side effects in cancer therapies.

In the context of major burns, MBLAC2 has been identified as one of the top predictive genes for distinguishing between different patient clusters. Its expression levels are significantly decreased in patients with major burns, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of burn injuries and its utility as a biomarker for diagnosis or prognosis (Wang2024Identification).

Although there are limited reports on MBLAC2, it has been associated with myoclonic epilepsy, indicating its potential clinical significance in neurological disorders (Wang2024Identification). The gene's involvement in these conditions underscores the importance of understanding its interactions and expression changes in disease contexts.

## Interactions
MBLAC2, a metallo-beta-lactamase domain-containing protein, is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins. It has been identified as a common off-target for hydroxamate-based histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), which include both approved drugs and tool compounds. These interactions suggest that MBLAC2 is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes (Kleymenova2024InCell; Lechner2021Target).

MBLAC2 interacts with the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC20, a protein that regulates endocytosis-mediated EGFR internalization. This interaction indicates a role for MBLAC2 in endocytosis and possibly in the broader context of vesicle biology. The inhibition of MBLAC2 has been shown to induce the accumulation of extracellular vesicles, suggesting its involvement in vesicle regulation and lipid metabolism (Lechner2021Target).

The protein's inhibition is also linked to the induction of exosome biogenesis, which is significant in drug efflux mechanisms in cancer cells. This suggests that MBLAC2 might play a role in the cellular response to pharmacological agents, particularly in the context of cancer treatment (Kleymenova2024InCell).
