# RRP15

## Overview
RRP15 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal RNA processing 15 homolog, a nucleolar protein integral to ribosome biogenesis. This protein is involved in the transcription and processing of pre-rRNA, as well as the assembly of pre-ribosomal subunits, playing a crucial role in the maturation of both pre-40S and pre-60S ribosomal subunits, which are essential for protein synthesis (Zhao2021Inhibition; Dong2023RRP15). RRP15 is predominantly localized in the nucleolus and is vital for maintaining normal cell cycle progression and preventing apoptosis by regulating cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (Dong2023RRP15). Its interactions with various nonribosomal proteins and involvement in signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, highlight its significance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer biology (DE2005Rrp15p; Dong2023RRP15).

## Function
RRP15 is a nucleolar protein that plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis by controlling pre-rRNA transcription, rRNA processing, and the assembly of pre-ribosome subunits in healthy human cells (Dong2023RRP15). It is involved in the maturation of both pre-40S and pre-60S ribosomal subunits, which are essential for protein synthesis (Zhao2021Inhibition). RRP15 is crucial for maintaining normal cell cycle progression and preventing apoptosis, as its perturbation can activate the impaired ribosome biogenesis checkpoint (IRBC), leading to cell cycle arrest (Dong2023RRP15). 

In terms of cellular localization, RRP15 is predominantly found in the nucleolus, where it participates in rRNA transcription and processing (Zhao2021Inhibition). The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, highlighting its importance in cellular growth and maintenance (Dong2023RRP15). RRP15's involvement in these processes underscores its essential role in the proper functioning of ribosome biogenesis and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The RRP15 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and colon cancer (CC). In HCC, RRP15 is frequently overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages. This overexpression is partly due to gene copy number gain at chromosome 1q41. Functional studies have shown that RRP15 knockdown suppresses tumor growth by inducing senescence and apoptosis, particularly through the p53-p21 signaling pathway in p53-wild-type cells (Zhao2021Inhibition). In CRC, RRP15 is upregulated and associated with poor survival outcomes. It regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, crucial for CRC proliferation and metastasis. RRP15 deficiency induces ribosome stress, enhancing the expression of LZTS2, which contributes to the degradation of β-catenin, thereby inhibiting CRC cell proliferation and metastasis (Dong2023RRP15). In CC, high RRP15 expression is linked to poor survival rates and promotes tumor growth, invasion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). RRP15 knockdown reduces these oncogenic processes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Deng2023Inhibition). These findings underscore the potential of targeting RRP15 in cancer therapy.

## Interactions
RRP15 is involved in ribosomal RNA processing and participates in the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit. It is a component of early pre-60S ribosomal particles and is essential for the proper processing of 27SA2 pre-rRNA, which is crucial for the production of 5.8S and 25S rRNAs (DE2005Rrp15p). RRP15 associates with pre-ribosomes at a stage that separates precursors to the 40S and 60S subunits and remains associated with pre-ribosomal particles during the processing steps of 27SA2, dissociating at the C2 cleavage (DE2005Rrp15p).

RRP15 has been shown to copurify with several nonribosomal proteins, including Rlp7p, Rrp1p, and Nop1p, which are implicated in 60S biogenesis (DE2005Rrp15p). It also interacts with the Cka1p subunit of yeast casein kinase 2 (CK2), suggesting a potential link between ribosome assembly and cell cycle progression (DE2005Rrp15p). In the context of cancer, RRP15 interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where its deficiency induces ribosome stress, enhancing the translation of LZTS2, a negative regulator of the pathway, leading to the nuclear export and degradation of β-catenin (Dong2023RRP15).
