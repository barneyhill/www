# PLXNB1

## Overview
The PLXNB1 gene encodes the plexin B1 protein, a transmembrane receptor that is part of the plexin family, which plays a pivotal role in semaphorin signaling pathways. Plexin B1 is involved in various cellular processes, including axonal guidance, cell motility, and epithelial branching morphogenesis, through its interactions with Rho family GTPases and other signaling molecules (Korostylev2008A; Swiercz2002PlexinB1). The protein's structure is characterized by a sema domain and a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain, which are essential for its function in regulating small GTPases like R-Ras (Tong2009Structure; Siebold2013Structural). Plexin B1's involvement in critical developmental processes and its implication in diseases such as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders underscore its biological significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Wong2007PlexinB1; Yang2023Neurite).

## Structure
The PLXNB1 gene encodes the plexin B1 protein, a member of the plexin family involved in semaphorin signaling. The molecular structure of plexin B1 includes several distinct domains and features. The primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its complex architecture. The secondary structure of plexin B1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Siebold2013Structural).

The tertiary structure of plexin B1 is characterized by a sema domain, which has a distinctive β-propeller architecture. This domain is crucial for the protein's interaction with semaphorins and other signaling molecules (Siebold2013Structural). The intracellular region of plexin B1 contains a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain, which is essential for its function in regulating small GTPases like R-Ras (Tong2009Structure). The GAP domain is intertwined with a Ras-binding domain (RBD), which plays a regulatory role in plexin signaling (Pascoe2015Structural).

Plexin B1 can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with the monomeric form being more active in binding Rho GTPases (Tong2009Structure). The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (Perälä2005The).

## Function
Plexin B1 (PLXNB1) is a transmembrane protein that functions as a receptor for semaphorins, particularly semaphorin 4D (Sema4D), and plays a significant role in various cellular and molecular processes. In healthy human cells, plexin B1 is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with Rho family GTPases, such as RhoA. This interaction is crucial for processes like cell motility, axonal guidance, and epithelial branching morphogenesis (Korostylev2008A; Swiercz2002PlexinB1).

Plexin B1 mediates its effects through the activation of signaling pathways, including the RhoA-ROCK pathway, which influences cell shape and movement by modulating cytoskeletal dynamics (Korostylev2008A). The protein also interacts with Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), which are essential for Sema4D-induced RhoA activation and subsequent cellular responses such as growth cone collapse and cell migration (Swiercz2009Semaphorin).

In the context of organogenesis, plexin B1 is expressed in epithelial tissues and is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, which are critical for the development of organs like the kidney and lungs (Korostylev2008A). Its role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining proper cellular architecture and function during development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PLXNB1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly prostate cancer. In prostate cancer, mutations in PLXNB1 are frequent and contribute to tumor progression by increasing cell motility, invasion, and adhesion. These mutations often occur in the cytoplasmic domain of the gene, affecting the binding and activity of small GTPases like Rac and R-Ras, which are crucial for cell migration and invasion (Wong2007PlexinB1). Specific mutations, such as P1597L, convert Plexin-B1 from a metastasis suppressor to a driver by enhancing Ras activity, leading to increased cell motility and invasion (Garg2024The). 

In addition to cancer, PLXNB1 mutations have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. A rare Ser454Arg mutation in PLXNB1 has been associated with neurite outgrowth deficits in pediatric bipolar disorder. This mutation is a loss-of-function variant that impairs neurite outgrowth, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder (Yang2023Neurite). These findings highlight the gene's role in both cancer progression and neurodevelopmental disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
PLXNB1 (plexin B1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling. It interacts with small GTPases such as Rac1 and Rnd1, which modulate its signaling pathways. Active Rac1 increases the surface expression of PLXNB1, while Rnd1 enhances this effect when coexpressed with PDZ-RhoGEF, suggesting a role in promoting PLXNB1 and PDZ-RhoGEF interaction (Swiercz2004PlexinB1RhoGEF–mediated).

PLXNB1 also forms a complex with the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB-2. This interaction is ligand-independent and involves the extracellular domains of both proteins. PDZ-RhoGEF can coprecipitate with ErbB-2 in the presence of PLXNB1, indicating that ErbB-2 and PDZ-RhoGEF are part of a complex linked via PLXNB1 (Swiercz2004PlexinB1RhoGEF–mediated).

PLXNB1 acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for R-Ras, a process dependent on Rnd1 binding. The interaction between PLXNB1 and Rnd1 is necessary for R-Ras GAP activity, which is crucial for neurite remodeling and cell adhesion (Oinuma2004Molecular; Oinuma2004The). PLXNB1 also interacts with PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG, which are involved in RhoA activation, essential for growth cone collapse in neurons (Swiercz2002PlexinB1).
