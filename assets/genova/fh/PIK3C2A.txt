# PIK3C2A

## Overview
PIK3C2A is a gene that encodes the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 2 alpha, a member of the class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family. This protein functions as a kinase, playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes by generating specific phosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, which are crucial for endocytosis and intracellular signaling pathways (Margaria2019Class). The protein is characterized by a unique structure that includes a Ras-binding domain, helical and kinase domains, and distinct C-terminal Phox-homology and C2 domains, which facilitate its interaction with cellular membranes and other proteins (Lo2022Structural). PIK3C2A is involved in critical cellular functions, including vesicular trafficking, angiogenesis, and maintaining vascular integrity, and its dysregulation has been linked to various diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Soliman2023Various; Yoshioka2012Endothelial).

## Structure
The PIK3C2A gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 2 alpha, a member of the class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family. The protein structure includes a PI3K core with a Ras-binding domain (RBD), an N-terminal C2 domain, helical and kinase domains, and unique C-terminal Phox-homology (PX) and C2 domains specific to class II enzymes (Lo2022Structural). The PX and C2 domains form an elongated structure that facilitates cooperative lipid binding, with the C2 domain providing the primary site of membrane affinity (Chen2018Molecular). The C2 domain contains two distinct lipid-binding pockets, with a primary site essential for phospholipid binding (Chen2018Molecular).

The protein's kinase domain has a typical PI3K fold with a smaller N-lobe and a larger C-lobe linked by a hinge, and it features a conserved DRH motif in the catalytic loop (Lo2022Structural). The helical domain acts as a central hub connecting the conserved two-lobed kinase domain with the N-C2 domain (Lo2022Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions (Lo2022Structural). The presence of calcium ions inhibits the membrane recruitment of the C2 domain, suggesting a regulatory role for calcium in PI3K-C2α activity (Chen2018Molecular).

## Function
PIK3C2A encodes a class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase that plays a critical role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It primarily generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), which are enriched at the plasma membrane and in early endosomes. These phosphoinositides are crucial for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where PI(3,4)P2 facilitates the recruitment of proteins like SNX9 and Dynamin, aiding in the maturation of clathrin-coated pits into vesicles (Margaria2019Class). PIK3C2A is also involved in dynamin-independent endocytosis, regulating small GTPases such as RhoA, Cdc42, and Arf6, which are important for vesicular trafficking and cellular signaling (Margaria2019Class).

In endothelial cells, PIK3C2A is essential for angiogenesis and maintaining vascular barrier integrity. It regulates intracellular vesicular transport, particularly the delivery and recycling of membrane molecules like VE-cadherin, which is crucial for cell-cell adhesion and endothelial cell functions such as migration, proliferation, and survival (Yoshioka2012Endothelial). PIK3C2A's activity is modulated by several receptors, including tyrosine kinase receptors and G-protein coupled receptors, and is influenced by clathrin binding and calcium concentration (Margaria2019Class).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PIK3C2A gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in PIK3C2A have been identified in children from consanguineous families, leading to a novel Mendelian disorder. This syndrome is characterized by short stature, coarse facial features, cataracts with secondary glaucoma, skeletal abnormalities, and neurological issues. These mutations result in impaired cilia formation and function, as well as reduced cellular proliferative capacity (Tiosano2019Mutations).

In the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), PIK3C2A expression is significantly downregulated in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) compared to those with chronic stable angina (CSA). This downregulation suggests that PIK3C2A could serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between these conditions and may be involved in the pathophysiology of CAD (Soliman2023Various).

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), PIK3C2A expression is decreased in tumor tissues, correlating with disease progression stages. Higher expression levels are associated with better overall survival, disease-free survival, and progression-free survival, indicating its potential role as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in KIRC (Qin2023PIK3C2A).

## Interactions
PIK3C2A, a member of the class II phosphoinositide 3-kinases, participates in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms a complex with TACC3 and clathrin heavy chain (CHC), which is essential for mitotic spindle assembly and genomic stability. This interaction is crucial for maintaining microtubule stability during metaphase, and the loss of PIK3C2A leads to spindle microtubule destabilization (Gulluni2017Mitotic). PIK3C2A directly interacts with TACC3, and this association is independent of CHC, as demonstrated by experiments with truncated mutants and GFP fusion proteins (Gulluni2017Mitotic).

PIK3C2A also plays a role in endocytosis and autophagy. It colocalizes with endocytic vesicles and interacts with markers of endocytosis and autophagy, such as clathrin, EEA1, and autophagosomal membrane precursors like ATG5 and ATG9A (Merrill2017PI3KC2α). The protein is involved in the maturation of clathrin-coated vesicles and the integration of endocytic membrane sources into the autophagy pathway, interacting with proteins like AP2 and RAB5 (Merrill2017PI3KC2α). These interactions highlight PIK3C2A's role in regulating vesicular trafficking and maintaining cellular homeostasis.
