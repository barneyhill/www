# KLK14

## Overview
KLK14 is a gene that encodes the protein kallikrein-related peptidase 14, a member of the serine protease family known for its trypsin-like activity. This enzyme is involved in various physiological processes, including skin desquamation and tissue remodeling, by degrading extracellular matrix components such as collagens and laminins (Stefansson2006Kallikreinrelated; Borgoño2007Expression). KLK14 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the skin, breast, prostate, and ovary, and plays a role in activating proteinase-activated receptors, which are crucial for signaling pathways related to inflammation and tissue function (Ramachandran2012Proteinaseactivated). The activity of KLK14 is regulated by specific inhibitors and ions, reflecting its complex involvement in physiological and pathological processes (Borgoño2007Expression). Altered expression of KLK14 has been linked to various diseases, including prostate and ovarian cancers, where it serves as a potential prognostic marker (Lose2012The; Yousef2003Steroid).

## Structure
KLK14, a member of the kallikrein family of serine proteases, exhibits a trypsin-like structure characterized by two asymmetric juxtaposed 6-strand beta-barrels and two alpha-helices with a 'Greek key' topology, forming the active site (Kryza2016The). The primary structure of KLK14 includes a catalytic triad composed of His43, Asp87, and Ser180, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Solís‐Calero2017KLK14). The tertiary structure of KLK14 was modeled using homology modeling based on the structure of KLK5, due to the lack of an experimental structure. This model was validated and optimized, showing high conservation at the binding site, particularly around the catalytic triad (Solís‐Calero2017KLK14).

KLK14's electrostatic surface reveals negatively charged areas at the binding site, notably around Asp174, which is analogous to Asp189 in trypsin, influencing substrate specificity (Solís‐Calero2017KLK14). The protein can form complexes with serine protease inhibitors HAI-1 and HAI-2, with molecular dynamics simulations indicating a stronger binding affinity for HAI-1 (Solís‐Calero2017KLK14). KLK14 also exhibits dual specificity, capable of cleaving peptide bonds with both positively charged and aromatic residues (Solís‐Calero2017KLK14).

## Function
KLK14 (kallikrein-related peptidase 14) is a serine protease that plays a significant role in various physiological processes, particularly in the skin and other tissues. In the human stratum corneum, KLK14 contributes to trypsin-like proteolytic activity, accounting for up to 50% of this activity in the plantar region. It is involved in the degradation of corneodesmosomes, which are crucial for skin desquamation and maintaining skin barrier function (Stefansson2006Kallikreinrelated). KLK14 is present in its active form in the stratum corneum and is also detected in sweat ducts and glands (Stefansson2006Kallikreinrelated).

KLK14 is expressed in several tissues, including the skin, breast, prostate, and ovary, and is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components such as collagens, fibronectin, and laminin. This activity suggests a role in tissue remodeling and cellular signaling (Borgoño2007Expression). KLK14 can also activate proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), particularly PAR2, influencing signaling pathways related to inflammation and tissue function (Ramachandran2012Proteinaseactivated). The enzyme's activity is regulated by various inhibitors and ions, highlighting its complex role in physiological processes (Borgoño2007Expression).

## Clinical Significance
KLK14 (kallikrein-related peptidase 14) has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In transgenic mice, overexpression of KLK14 leads to significant hair shaft defects and epidermal abnormalities, primarily through the degradation of desmosomal components Dsg3 and Dsg4. This results in hair loss and skin abnormalities, and is associated with increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as Il-36a and Il-17c, which are linked to skin inflammation and conditions like psoriasis (Gouin2020Transgenic).

In prostate cancer, KLK14 is inversely regulated by androgens, with its expression increasing in androgen-deprived environments. This regulation suggests a role in tumor progression during hormone deprivation therapy. Genetic variations in KLK14, such as certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are associated with prostate tumor aggressiveness, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Lose2012The).

In ovarian cancer, KLK14 expression is a significant predictor of progression-free and overall survival. Higher expression levels are associated with early-stage disease and better chemotherapy response. KLK14 is regulated by steroid hormones, particularly androgens, and its expression is reduced in cancerous ovarian tissues compared to normal tissues (Yousef2003Steroid).

## Interactions
KLK14, a serine protease, engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing its activity and specificity. It interacts with serine protease inhibitors HAI-1 and HAI-2, forming stable complexes. Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that KLK14 binds more strongly with HAI-1 than with HAI-2, with van der Waals interactions being the primary driving force for these complexes (Solís‐Calero2017KLK14). Key residues such as Asp174, Ser175, Gln177, and Trp196 in KLK14 contribute significantly to binding free energy, acting as 'hotspots' in these interactions (Solís‐Calero2017KLK14).

KLK14 also interacts with the serpin vaspin, which inhibits KLK14 by targeting specific peptide bonds. This interaction is influenced by exosite interactions, although the specific exosites for KLK14 remain unidentified (Ulbricht2018Kallikreinrelated). Additionally, KLK14 exhibits dual trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activity, with a preference for cleaving after arginine residues. This specificity is crucial for its role in degrading extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin a-5 and collagen IV, which may contribute to cancer cell invasion (Felber2005Enzymatic). These interactions highlight KLK14's involvement in physiological processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
