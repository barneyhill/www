# PIGV

## Overview
The PIGV gene encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class V, which is a type of mannosyltransferase involved in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is crucial for the addition of the second mannose to the GPI precursor, a key step in the formation of GPI anchors that attach proteins to the cell membrane (Liu2021A; Wu2020The). GPI anchors play a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response (Liu2021A). The PIGV gene is essential for the proper synthesis and surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins, and its dysfunction is linked to hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome (HPMRS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability and other clinical features (Horn2013Delineation; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis).

## Function
The PIGV gene encodes the enzyme GPI-mannosyltransferase II, which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. This enzyme is responsible for the addition of the second mannose to the GPI precursor, a crucial step in the GPI biosynthesis pathway (Liu2021A; Wu2020The). The GPI anchors are glycolipids that tether proteins to the cell membrane, facilitating their localization and function in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response (Liu2021A).

In healthy human cells, PIGV is essential for the proper synthesis and surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). The knockout of PIGV in HEK293 cells results in the complete absence of surface GPI-APs, indicating its non-redundant role in this biosynthetic pathway (Liu2021A; Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). The enzyme functions within the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the transfer of mannose to GPI precursors, ensuring the correct formation of GPI anchors (Wu2020The). This process is vital for the proper attachment of GPI to proteins, which is necessary for their function and stability on the cell surface (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGV gene are primarily associated with hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome (HPMRS), also known as Mabry syndrome. This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, seizures, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and brachytelephalangy (Horn2013Delineation; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). The most common mutation, c.1022C>A, is found in about 80% of affected families (Pagnamenta2017Analysis; Horn2013Delineation). 

Patients with PIGV mutations often exhibit a range of phenotypic variability, including developmental delays, seizures, and facial anomalies such as wide-set eyes and a broad nasal bridge (Horn2013Delineation). Severe cases may present with multiple congenital malformations, including Hirschsprung disease, vesicoureteral and renal anomalies, and anorectal malformations (Horn2013Delineation). 

The mutations lead to a partial loss of function in the PIGV gene, affecting the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins, which results in the secretion of proteins like alkaline phosphatase without GPI anchoring (KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). This mechanism accounts for the elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels observed in patients with HPMRS (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role).
