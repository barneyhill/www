# SPTLC2

## Overview
The SPTLC2 gene encodes the serine palmitoyltransferase long chain base subunit 2, a crucial component of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme complex. This enzyme is integral to the de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids, which are essential components of cell membranes and play significant roles in cellular signaling and recognition. The SPTLC2 protein, categorized as an enzyme subunit, works in conjunction with other subunits such as SPTLC1 and SPTLC3 to catalyze the first and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid synthesis. This process involves the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent condensation of L-serine with palmitoyl-CoA, leading to the production of sphinganine and other sphingolipids (Rotthier2010Mutations; Lone2020Subunit). Mutations in the SPTLC2 gene have been linked to various neuropathies, including hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I (HSAN-I) and juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), highlighting its clinical significance in neurological health (Rotthier2010Mutations; Mohassel2024Serine).

## Structure
The SPTLC2 gene encodes a subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme, which is crucial for sphingolipid biosynthesis. The primary structure of SPTLC2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form part of the SPT enzyme complex, which also includes SPTLC1 and SPTLC3 (Lone2020Subunit). The secondary structure of SPTLC2 includes domains that are highly conserved, indicating their functional importance (Rotthier2010Mutations). 

In terms of tertiary structure, the SPTLC2 protein is involved in forming the SPT-ssSPT-ORMDL complex, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy studies (Syeda2023Recurrent). The quaternary structure involves its assembly with other subunits, such as SPTLC1, to form a functional enzyme complex (Lone2020Subunit). 

SPTLC2 contains specific domains crucial for its enzymatic activity, including a PLP-binding domain, which is essential for SPT activity (Rotthier2010Mutations). Mutations in these domains can significantly impact the enzyme's function and are associated with various neuropathies (Rotthier2010Mutations). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions (Suriyanarayanan2019A).

## Function
The SPTLC2 gene encodes a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), an enzyme complex crucial for the de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids. SPT catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid synthesis, which involves the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent condensation of L-serine with palmitoyl-CoA. This process is essential for producing sphingolipids, which are vital components of cell membranes and play significant roles in cell signaling and recognition (Rotthier2010Mutations).

In healthy human cells, SPTLC2 is part of the SPT enzyme complex located in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is involved in the biosynthesis of sphinganine, dihydroceramide, ceramide, and sphingomyelin, which are crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Wu2019Loss). SPTLC2 also plays a role in regulating mTORC1 activity, which is vital for T cell metabolic reprogramming and survival. It helps maintain the sustainability of mTORC1-dependent metabolic processes in antiviral effector CD8+ T cells by moderating mTORC1 activity and suppressing ER stress-induced cell death (Wu2019Loss).

Mutations in SPTLC2 can lead to altered substrate specificity, resulting in the production of neurotoxic metabolites like 1-deoxy-sphinganine, which are implicated in hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I (HSAN-I) (Rotthier2010Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPTLC2 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. Notably, pathogenic variants in SPTLC2 have been linked to hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1), a condition characterized by sensory loss and neuropathic pain. These mutations alter the enzyme's substrate preference, leading to the production of neurotoxic 1-deoxysphingolipids, which contribute to the disease pathology (Dohrn2017Frequent; Cintra2021Rare).

SPTLC2 mutations are also implicated in juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Variants such as p.E260K, p.M68R, and p.A71V result in unrestrained serine palmitoyltransferase activity, causing excess sphingolipid synthesis and early-onset motor neuron degeneration without sensory neuropathy (Mohassel2024Serine; Syeda2023Recurrent). This overactivity disrupts the normal regulation by ORMDL proteins, leading to a juvenile ALS phenotype characterized by progressive weakness and motor neuron degeneration (Syeda2023Recurrent).

In some cases, SPTLC2 mutations can lead to hereditary spastic paraplegia, where activating variants in SPTSSA, a small subunit of the enzyme complex, are involved (Mohassel2024Serine). These findings underscore the critical role of SPTLC2 in maintaining normal sphingolipid metabolism and its impact on neurological health.

## Interactions
SPTLC2, a subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase enzyme, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms part of a multisubunit enzyme complex with SPTLC1 and SPTLC3, which is crucial for sphingolipid biosynthesis (Rotthier2010Mutations). SPTLC2 has been shown to interact with MYD88, a key protein in the TLR4 signaling pathway, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction suggests that SPTLC2 and MYD88 can form a protein complex, although the exact nature of this interaction, whether direct or indirect, requires further investigation (Su2019The).

SPTLC2 is also a direct target of miR-124-3p, which binds to a conserved site in its 3'UTR, reducing SPTLC2 protein levels. This interaction was confirmed through luciferase assays and rescue experiments (Su2019The). The regulation of SPTLC2 by miR-124-3p is significant in the context of neuronal apoptosis, where miR-124-3p inhibits and SPTLC2 promotes apoptosis through the TLR4 pathway (Su2019The). These interactions highlight the role of SPTLC2 in both metabolic and signaling pathways, impacting processes such as neuronal apoptosis and immune responses.
