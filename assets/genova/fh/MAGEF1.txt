# MAGEF1

## Overview
MAGEF1 is a gene that encodes the protein MAGE family member F1, which is part of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family. This family is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including protein interactions and signaling pathways. The MAGEF1 protein is characterized by its interactions with other proteins such as PIAS1, a SUMO E3 ligase, and Nsmce1, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, suggesting its role in modulating protein sumoylation and degradation pathways (Gur2014Necdin). The structural features of MAGEF1, including a ubiquitination substrate-binding cleft, further imply its selective interaction with specific substrates, which may influence cellular processes like protein turnover (Griffith-Jones2023Structural). MAGEF1 has also been implicated in cancer biology, with its expression levels and genetic alterations linked to the progression and prognosis of various cancers, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (Li2020A; Jia2019Prognostic).

## Clinical Significance
MAGEF1 has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and genetic alterations linked to disease progression and prognosis. In breast cancer, high mRNA expression levels of MAGEF1 are associated with different prognostic outcomes depending on the subtype and genetic background. Specifically, high MAGEF1 expression correlates with improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) in basal-like breast cancer but is linked to worse RFS in both TP53-mutated and TP53 wild-type breast cancer (Jia2019Prognostic). In lymph node-positive breast cancer, high MAGEF1 expression is associated with improved RFS, whereas in lymph node-negative cases, it is linked to worse RFS (Jia2019Prognostic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MAGEF1 expression is significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. This up-regulation is associated with advanced clinical stages and higher tumor grades, suggesting a role in HCC progression (Li2020A). Genetic alterations in MAGEF1, with an alteration rate of 12%, are among the most frequent in HCC, although these alterations alone do not significantly impact prognosis (Li2020A). MAGEF1 expression is also correlated with larger tumor size and multiple tumors in HCC patients, indicating its potential as a marker for tumor aggressiveness (Li2020A).

## Interactions
MAGEF1, a member of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family, participates in several protein interactions that are significant for its function. MAGEF1 has been shown to interact with PIAS1, a SUMO E3 ligase, although the specific functional consequences of this interaction are not fully detailed. This interaction suggests a potential role for MAGEF1 in modulating the activity of PIAS1, similar to other MAGE proteins like necdin, which suppresses PIAS1-dependent sumoylation of substrates (Gur2014Necdin).

Additionally, MAGEF1 interacts with Nsmce1, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that is part of the SMC5/6 complex. This interaction indicates that MAGEF1 may be involved in protein degradation pathways, although the specific outcomes of this interaction are not detailed (Gur2014Necdin). The structural features of MAGEF1, including a ubiquitination substrate-binding cleft, suggest that it may have selective interactions with particular substrates, contributing to its role in cellular processes such as protein turnover (Griffith-Jones2023Structural). These interactions highlight the potential regulatory roles of MAGEF1 in cellular signaling and protein degradation pathways.
