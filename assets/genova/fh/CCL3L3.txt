# CCL3L3

## Overview
CCL3L3 is a gene that encodes the protein C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 like 3, which is part of the chemokine family of proteins. These proteins are known for their role in immune system signaling, particularly in mediating inflammatory responses. The CCL3L3 gene is located on chromosome 17q12 and is part of a cluster of genes that includes CCL3, CCL3L1, and CCL3L2, all of which encode proteins with high sequence similarity and are involved in the production of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α. This chemokine acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, influencing immune cell behavior through interactions with the CCR5 receptor (Kim2021CCL3L3null). The protein encoded by CCL3L3 is involved in chemotaxis, guiding immune cells to sites of inflammation, and plays a crucial role in the regulation of leukocyte trafficking and inflammatory processes (Shrestha2010Variations; Colobran2010Copy). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, where its absence has been linked to increased disease susceptibility (Kim2021CCL3L3null).

## Function
The CCL3L3 gene encodes a protein that is closely related to other CCL3-related genes, such as CCL3, CCL3L1, and CCL3L2, which are located on chromosome 17q12. These genes share over 95% sequence identity at both the genomic and amino acid levels and encode macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, a chemokine that acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine on immune cells, including CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells, via the CCR5 receptor (Kim2021CCL3L3null). MIP-1α is secreted from epithelial cells, lymphocytes, platelets, and macrophages, playing a role in immune response by promoting inflammation (Kim2021CCL3L3null).

The CCL3L3 gene is part of a gene cluster that includes CCL3L1 and CCL3L2, which are involved in host defense and inflammatory processes (Shrestha2010Variations). The proteins encoded by these genes are involved in chemotaxis, guiding the movement of immune cells to sites of inflammation or injury, and are crucial in cell signaling, influencing processes like cell activation, migration, and cytokine production (Picton2013Contribution). The CCL3L3 gene, along with its related genes, plays a significant role in the immune system by regulating the trafficking of leukocytes to areas of injury and participating in inflammatory and homeostatic processes (Colobran2010Copy).

## Clinical Significance
The CCL3L3 gene has been implicated in the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Studies have shown that a CCL3L3-null status is significantly associated with an increased risk of developing SLE, with an odds ratio greater than 17, indicating a strong correlation between the absence of this gene and the disease (Kim2021CCL3L3null). This association remains significant even after statistical corrections, highlighting the potential role of CCL3L3 as a genetic marker for SLE susceptibility (Kim2021CCL3L3null).

The CCL3L3 gene is closely related to other CCL3-related genes, which encode macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. The high sequence similarity among these genes has previously led to challenges in accurately measuring their copy numbers. However, recent advancements in assay specificity have allowed for more precise evaluations, confirming the significant association of CCL3L3-null status with SLE (Kim2021CCL3L3null).

These findings suggest that alterations in the expression or presence of CCL3L3 can influence immune responses, potentially affecting the development and progression of autoimmune diseases like SLE. The gene's role in encoding inflammatory proteins underscores its clinical significance in immune-mediated conditions.
