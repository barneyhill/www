# WFDC1

## Overview
The WFDC1 gene encodes the WAP four-disulfide core domain 1 protein, a member of the WAP-type four disulfide core domain family, which is characterized by its protease inhibitory and antimicrobial functions. This protein plays a crucial role in tissue homeostasis, immune response, and wound healing. It is expressed in various tissues, including the prostate gland, heart, retina, and optic nerves, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (Zhu2021Molecular; Ressler2011The). The WFDC1 protein is known for its interactions with components of the extracellular matrix, such as glycosaminoglycans and fibronectin, which are essential for its function in modulating immune responses and tissue repair (Hickman2016CathepsinL). Additionally, alterations in WFDC1 expression have been linked to various cancers, suggesting a potential tumor suppressive role (Liu2009Expression).

## Structure
The WFDC1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the WAP-type four disulfide core domain family, characterized by a conserved domain with eight cysteine residues forming four disulfide bonds. These bonds are located at residues 66 ↔ 96, 78 ↔ 100, 83 ↔ 95, and 89 ↔ 104, and are crucial for the protein's stability and ability to bind with other molecules (Zhu2021Molecular; SolísCalero2019Phylogenetic). The protein includes a signal sequence at amino acid residues 1-31, a WAP domain at residues 59-108, and two poly proline motifs at residues 67-70 and 109-112 (Zhu2021Molecular).

WFDC1 is expressed in two isoforms: a full-length 660 bp mRNA coding sequence translating to a 27 kDa protein, and an exon 3-truncated variant resulting in a 22 kDa protein (SolísCalero2019Phylogenetic). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including cleavage by cathepsin L, which may affect its function in processes like wound healing (Zhu2021Molecular). The structural analysis of WFDC1 has identified conserved cysteine residues forming the characteristic disulfide bonds of the WAP domain, indicating strong evolutionary conservation (SolísCalero2019Phylogenetic).

## Function
The WFDC1 gene, also known as WAP four-disulfide core domain 1, encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in tissue homeostasis and immune response. In healthy human cells, WFDC1 is expressed as a secreted protein from stromal cells, including those in the prostate gland, and is involved in regulating cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (Ressler2011The). The protein is part of the WAP family, characterized by its WAP domain, which is associated with protease inhibition and antimicrobial functions (Ressler2011The).

WFDC1 plays a significant role in modulating inflammatory and wound repair responses. It is involved in cell recruitment, migration, and extracellular matrix remodeling, contributing to tissue repair and angiogenesis (Ressler2011The). The gene is also implicated in endothelial cell migration and pericyte stabilization, which are crucial for the formation of functional vascular structures (Zhu2021Molecular). WFDC1 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, retina, and optic nerves, suggesting roles in cardiovascular and eye development (Zhu2021Molecular).

In the context of immune response, WFDC1 is involved in modulating macrophage recruitment and osteopontin expression, which are important for wound healing and inflammatory responses (Ressler2014WFDC1). The gene's expression is downregulated in various cancers, indicating a potential tumor suppressive role (Zhu2021Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WFDC1 gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly cancers. In prostate cancer, WFDC1 is often downregulated in the reactive stroma, which is associated with cancer progression. This downregulation is not due to frequent mutations but rather changes in expression levels, suggesting a role in maintaining the extracellular matrix and potentially acting as a tumor suppressor (Watson2004Molecular; Ressler2011The). In melanoma, WFDC1 is frequently downregulated, with promoter hypermethylation responsible for its silencing in about 20% of cases. Overexpression of WFDC1 in melanoma cell lines has been shown to inhibit tumor growth, possibly through the upregulation of Dkk1, an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway (Liu2009Expression).

WFDC1 is also implicated in inflammatory conditions and immune responses. It is associated with rheumatoid arthritis and may influence T-cell susceptibility to HIV infection (Ressler2011The). In a Wfdc1-null mouse model, the absence of WFDC1 led to resistance to influenza virus infection and enhanced wound repair, indicating its role in modulating immune responses and tissue repair mechanisms (Ressler2014WFDC1). These findings highlight the gene's potential clinical significance in cancer, immune response, and tissue repair.

## Interactions
WFDC1, also known as ps20, is involved in several interactions with other proteins that influence its biological functions. One significant interaction is with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are part of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This interaction is crucial for ps20's role in modulating wound healing and immune responses (Hickman2016CathepsinL). Ps20 also undergoes crosslinking to fibronectin, a major ECM component, mediated by transglutaminase 2 (TG2). This crosslinking is important for ps20's structural and functional roles in the ECM, although it does not affect its growth inhibitory properties (Hickman2016CathepsinL).

Additionally, ps20 is cleaved by cathepsin L, which alters its ability to interact with fibronectin but does not impair its ability to inhibit cell proliferation (Hickman2016CathepsinL). In the context of HIV infection, ps20 enhances the susceptibility of CD4+ T cells to the virus by upregulating CD54 integrin expression, facilitating HIV entry (Alvarez2008WFDC1ps20). This interaction highlights ps20's role as a modulator of immune responses and its potential impact on viral infections. These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of WFDC1 in tissue homeostasis and immune regulation.
