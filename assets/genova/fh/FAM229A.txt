# FAM229A

## Overview
FAM229A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 229 member A. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM229A has garnered attention due to its altered expression in certain cancers, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Notably, it has been implicated in the response to cancer therapies, such as in prostate and colorectal cancers, where its expression levels correlate with disease outcomes and treatment efficacy (Saleh2021Transcriptome; Mazumder2022Integratinga). The protein encoded by FAM229A is not yet categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, indicating that further research is necessary to understand its biochemical properties and interactions within the cell.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
FAM229A has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In prostate cancer, the NAMPT inhibitor FK866 has been shown to downregulate FAM229A, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression and response to treatment. This downregulation is observed both when FK866 is used alone and in combination with docetaxel, indicating a potential role in the therapeutic response of aggressive and taxane-resistant prostate cancer (Mazumder2022Integratinga; Mazumder2022Integrating).

In colorectal cancer, FAM229A is significantly upregulated in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of diabetic patients, particularly those with lymphatic invasion. This upregulation is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including shorter disease-specific survival, a history of polyps, and more residual tumor after therapy. These findings suggest that FAM229A may contribute to the progression of colorectal cancer and is linked to adverse prognostic factors (Saleh2021Transcriptome).

While the specific mechanisms by which FAM229A influences these diseases are not fully understood, its altered expression in cancerous tissues highlights its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and treatment response. Further research is needed to elucidate its precise role in these and possibly other conditions.
