# NFKBIZ

## Overview
NFKBIZ is a gene that encodes the protein IκBζ, a key transcriptional regulator involved in the immune response and inflammation. IκBζ is categorized as a nuclear protein that modulates the activity of NF-κB transcription factors, influencing the expression of various cytokines and playing a significant role in immune homeostasis. It is particularly important in the differentiation of T-cells and the regulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene expression. The protein's interactions within the NF-κB signaling pathway are crucial for its function, as it stabilizes NF-κB/DNA complexes rather than disrupting them, which is a unique feature compared to classical IκB proteins. NFKBIZ has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, where it can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context (Trinh2008The; Feng2023The; Xu2021Upregulation).

## Structure


## Function
The NFKBIZ gene encodes the protein IκBζ, which plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and inflammation in healthy human cells. IκBζ is primarily active in the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional regulator by interacting with NF-κB transcription factors. It modulates the expression of various cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNF, by inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB subunits like p65/p50 heterodimers and p50/p50 homodimers, with a stronger interaction with the p50 subunit (Yamazaki2001A; Feng2023The).

IκBζ is involved in the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T-cells into Th17 cells, indicating its role in adaptive immunity (Feng2023The). It also acts as a coactivator for POU transcription factors, integrating and amplifying signals from NF-κB and POU transcription factors at inducible immune genes (Alpsoy2024IκBζ). IκBζ is essential for the production of IL-6 in response to TLR/IL-1R signaling, binding specifically to the kB site in the IL-6 promoter to enhance its activity (Yamamoto2004Regulation). Through these interactions, IκBζ serves as a central regulator in balancing pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene expression, maintaining immune homeostasis in healthy human cells (Feng2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NFKBIZ gene, which encodes the protein IκBζ, are associated with various diseases and conditions. In psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, NFKBIZ acts as a transcription activator for psoriasis-related genes. A specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7637230, in NFKBIZ is linked to an increased risk of psoriasis, particularly in individuals of European descent. IkBζ-deficient mice show inhibited development of psoriasis, highlighting its role in the disease's pathogenesis (Feng2023The).

In cancer, NFKBIZ functions as an oncogene in hematologic tumors such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where it regulates cytokines and immune cell differentiation. Mutations in NFKBIZ are common in colorectal cancer and are associated with resistance to chemoradiotherapy. Conversely, in bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, NFKBIZ may act as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation linked to poor prognosis (Feng2023The).

NFKBIZ is also implicated in autoimmune diseases. IkBζ deficiency in epithelial cells can lead to Sjögren’s syndrome-like autoimmune disease, characterized by enhanced apoptosis in lacrimal glands and the presence of autoantibodies. This condition is linked to the disruption of the STAT3-IkBζ signaling pathway (Okuma2013Enhanced).

## Interactions
NFKBIZ, also known as IκBζ, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, primarily within the NF-κB signaling pathway. It specifically binds to NF-κB p50 homodimers, forming a stable ternary complex on κB DNA. This interaction is mediated by the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBζ and the dimerization domain of p50, which protects the glycine-rich region of p50 from proteolysis (Trinh2008The). Unlike classical IκB proteins, IκBζ does not disrupt NF-κB/DNA complexes but instead stabilizes them, which is attributed to the absence of a PEST domain in IκBζ (Trinh2008The).

In the context of bladder cancer, NFKBIZ has been shown to upregulate PTEN, a tumor-suppressing factor, and modulate the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby suppressing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Xu2021Upregulation). In hepatocellular carcinoma, NFKBIZ interacts with TRIM16, influencing tumorigenesis and metastasis (Guo2024NFKBIZ).

NFKBIZ also interacts with the FUS-DDIT3 fusion oncoprotein in myxoid liposarcoma, leading to the deregulation of NF-κB target genes. This interaction involves colocalization in nuclear structures and binding to the C-terminal of NFKBIZ, affecting the expression of genes such as IL8 (Göransson2008The).
