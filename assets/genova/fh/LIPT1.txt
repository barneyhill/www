# LIPT1

## Overview
LIPT1 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme lipoyltransferase 1, which is crucial for the lipoylation of mitochondrial enzyme complexes. Lipoyltransferase 1 is responsible for transferring lipoyl groups to specific lysine residues on target proteins, a process essential for the activation of several key mitochondrial dehydrogenase complexes, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α-KGDHc) (Cronan2020Progress; Soreze2013Mutations). This enzyme is not involved in the synthesis of lipoic acid but is vital for its attachment to apoenzymes, thereby ensuring proper mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Lebigot2017Impact; Soreze2013Mutations). Mutations in the LIPT1 gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as Leigh disease, characterized by deficiencies in these enzyme complexes, and have been implicated in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Soreze2013Mutations; Yan2022System).

## Function
The LIPT1 gene encodes a mitochondrial lipoyltransferase that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of lipoic acid, a vital cofactor for several mitochondrial enzyme complexes. In healthy human cells, LIPT1 is responsible for transferring lipoyl groups from the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH) to key dehydrogenase complexes, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α-KGDHc) (Cronan2020Progress; Soreze2013Mutations). This transfer is essential for the proper functioning of these enzyme complexes, which are critical for energy production and the citric acid cycle (Cronan2020Progress).

LIPT1 is not required for the synthesis of lipoic acid itself but is indispensable for the lipoylation process, ensuring the activity of lipoate-dependent enzymes (Cronan2020Progress; Soreze2013Mutations). The protein is active in the mitochondria, where it facilitates the attachment of lipoic acid to specific lysine residues on apoenzymes, thereby maintaining normal mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Lebigot2017Impact; Soreze2013Mutations). This function is critical for preventing metabolic disturbances and ensuring efficient cellular respiration.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LIPT1 gene are associated with Leigh disease, a severe neurological disorder characterized by secondary deficiencies in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH) activities. These deficiencies result from impaired lipoylation of these enzyme complexes, leading to abnormal pyruvate utilization and metabolic acidosis. Patients with LIPT1 mutations often exhibit symptoms such as delayed psychomotor development, hypotonia, hyperlactatemia, and severe neurological manifestations, including spastic tetraparesis and extrapyramidal syndrome. Brain imaging may reveal cerebellar atrophy and other anomalies (Soreze2013Mutations).

LIPT1 is also implicated in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), where its expression levels are linked to tumor progression and patient prognosis. High LIPT1 expression is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while lower expression correlates with longer overall survival. This suggests that LIPT1 could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in LIHC (Yan2022System). In cancer, LIPT1 is involved in immune cell infiltration and is associated with various tumor biological behaviors, indicating its role in cancer progression and immune response (Liu2022A).

## Interactions
LIPT1 (lipoyltransferase 1) is involved in the transfer of lipoic acid moieties to specific lysine residues on target proteins, which is essential for the activity of several mitochondrial enzyme complexes. LIPT1 interacts with the E2 subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α-KGDHc), facilitating their enzymatic activity by transferring lipoyl groups to these complexes (Cronan2020Progress; Soreze2013Mutations). This interaction is crucial for mitochondrial energy production, as these complexes play a significant role in the Krebs cycle.

Mutations in LIPT1 can lead to a reduction in the lipoylation of these complexes, resulting in decreased enzyme activities and abnormal pyruvate utilization (Soreze2013Mutations). The absence of LIPT1 leads to deficiencies in these dehydrogenases, affecting the Krebs cycle and energy metabolism (Soreze2013Mutations). LIPT1 is also suggested to be involved in a 'lipoic acid salvage pathway,' redistributing lipoyl residues from the glycine cleavage system to other complexes, indicating a potential interaction with the glycine cleavage system (Soreze2013Mutations). These interactions highlight the critical role of LIPT1 in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.
