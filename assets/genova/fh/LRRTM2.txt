# LRRTM2

## Overview
LRRTM2 (leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 2) is a gene that encodes a synaptic organizing protein involved in the development and function of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. The protein, also named LRRTM2, is a single-pass transmembrane protein characterized by its leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) modules, which are crucial for its synaptogenic activity. It plays a significant role in synaptic adhesion and specificity by interacting with presynaptic neurexins in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of synaptic components and the stabilization of AMPA receptors, thereby influencing synaptic transmission and plasticity (Ko2009LRRTM2; Liouta2024LRRTM2). Although direct mutations in LRRTM2 have not been conclusively linked to specific diseases, its involvement in synapse formation suggests potential implications in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs; Kleffmann20125q31).

## Structure
LRRTM2 is a single-pass transmembrane protein characterized by a large extracellular domain containing 10 leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) modules, a transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic domain ending with a class I-like PDZ-binding motif ECEV (Yamagata2018Structural; Liouta2024LRRTM2). The LRR domain is essential for synaptogenic activity and is flanked by N- and C-terminal caps, with a Phe spine stabilizing the structure, a feature shared with other neuronal LRR proteins (Yamagata2018Structural). The C-terminal domain is crucial for synaptic clustering and localization at glutamatergic postsynapses, interacting with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 through the PDZ-binding motif (Liouta2024LRRTM2).

The interaction between LRRTM2 and presynaptic neurexins is calcium-dependent, with a critical glutamic acid residue at position 348 (E348) facilitating this binding (Yamagata2018Structural; Liouta2024LRRTM2). Mutations at this site can disrupt neurexin binding and synaptic organization (Liouta2024LRRTM2). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, as indicated by the T59L mutation preventing N-glycan attachment at Asn57 (Yamagata2018Structural). LRRTM2 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Liouta2024LRRTM2).

## Function
LRRTM2 (leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 2) is a synaptic organizing protein that plays a significant role in the development and function of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. It is primarily active at the postsynaptic membrane, where it interacts with presynaptic neurexins to mediate synaptic adhesion and promote synapse formation (Ko2009LRRTM2; Francks2011LeucineRich). This interaction is calcium-dependent and involves specific binding to neurexins lacking an insert at splice site 4, which is crucial for synaptic specificity (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs; karimi2014assessing).

LRRTM2 is more effective than neuroligin-1 in recruiting postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 and presynaptic components such as synaptophysin and bassoon, indicating its significant role in forming the glutamatergic postsynaptic scaffold (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs; karimi2014assessing). It also stabilizes synaptic AMPA receptors by reducing their surface turnover, which is essential for maintaining synaptic transmission and plasticity (Liouta2024LRRTM2). In vivo studies have shown that knockdown of LRRTM2 decreases the strength of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, while overexpression increases excitatory synapses, highlighting its critical role in synaptic connectivity and function (karimi2014assessing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LRRTM2 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Although direct mutations in LRRTM2 have not been conclusively linked to specific diseases, its role in synapse formation and interaction with neurexins suggests potential involvement in conditions like intellectual disability (ID) and developmental delay (DD) (Kleffmann20125q31). The gene is located in the 5q31.2 microdeletion region, which has been associated with ID and DD, although no significant coding mutations in LRRTM2 were found in a study of 330 patients (Kleffmann20125q31).

LRRTM2's interaction with neurexins, which are known to be involved in synaptic differentiation, is crucial for its function. Disruptions in this interaction, such as specific mutations in LRRTM2 that affect its binding to neurexins, can impair synapse formation and are thought to contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs; Yamagata2018Structural). While LRRTM2 itself has not been directly linked to schizophrenia or autism, its family member LRRTM1 has been associated with schizophrenia, suggesting a potential relevance of LRRTM family members to these conditions (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs).

## Interactions
LRRTM2 interacts with neurexins, specifically the α and β variants of neurexins 1, 2, and 3 that lack an insert at splice site 4. This interaction is crucial for synapse formation and is calcium-dependent (Ko2009LRRTM2; Siddiqui2010LRRTMs). LRRTM2 binds to neurexins through a trans-interaction, forming intercellular junctions that promote excitatory synapse formation (Ko2009LRRTM2). The binding of LRRTM2 to neurexins is mutually exclusive with neuroligin-1, as both proteins compete for overlapping binding sites on the neurexin LNS domain (Ko2009LRRTM2; Siddiqui2010LRRTMs).

LRRTM2 is more effective than neuroligin-1 in recruiting postsynaptic PSD-95 and presynaptic vesicles, indicating a significant role in synaptic organization (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs). The interaction with neurexins is essential for LRRTM2's ability to induce presynaptic differentiation, as mutations that disrupt this binding also impair its synaptogenic activity (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs). LRRTM2's interaction with neurexins also influences AMPA receptor stabilization, with specific mutations affecting its binding capabilities and synaptic AMPAR density (Liouta2024LRRTM2). These interactions highlight LRRTM2's role in synaptic development and function through its binding with neurexins.
