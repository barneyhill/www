# CLTB

## Overview
The CLTB gene encodes clathrin light chain B, a protein that is integral to the clathrin complex, which is pivotal in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. As a component of the clathrin coat, clathrin light chain B interacts with clathrin heavy chains to form a triskelion structure, facilitating the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) that transport molecules between cellular compartments (Das2021Clathrin). This protein is involved in the regulation of clathrin lattice assembly and disassembly, impacting the flexibility and stability of the clathrin coat (Das2021Clathrin). Additionally, CLTB plays a role in receptor trafficking and is implicated in linking the endocytic machinery to the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for efficient intracellular trafficking and maintaining cellular functions (Das2021Clathrin). The gene's expression and function are critical for normal cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation is associated with various diseases, including neurological disorders, cancer, and metabolic diseases.

## Structure
Clathrin light chain B (CLTB) is a component of the clathrin complex involved in vesicle formation and trafficking. The primary structure of CLTB consists of a sequence of amino acids that share about 60% homology with clathrin light chain A (CLCA) (Das2021Clathrin). The secondary structure includes specific domains for binding to calcium, clathrin heavy chain, and calmodulin, as well as a neuron-specific insertion sequence (Das2021Clathrin). The C-terminal domain of CLTB enhances the stability of the clathrin hub and the trimerization of clathrin heavy chains, contributing to the formation of the triskelion vertex (Das2021Clathrin).

CLTB undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Das2021Clathrin). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with specific isoforms being expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues (Das2021Clathrin). The interaction of CLTB with clathrin heavy chains is essential for the regulation of clathrin lattice assembly and disassembly, affecting the flexibility and stability of the clathrin coat (Das2021Clathrin).

## Function
Clathrin light chain B (CLTB) is a crucial component of the clathrin protein complex, which plays a significant role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and intracellular trafficking. CLTB is involved in the assembly and disassembly of clathrin structures, which are essential for the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) that transport molecules between cellular compartments (Das2021Clathrin). It interacts with clathrin heavy chains to influence the flexibility and rigidity of the clathrin triskelion, impacting lattice assembly and membrane deformation (Das2021Clathrin).

CLTB is also involved in receptor trafficking, including the internalization and recycling of various receptors such as the P2Y12 receptor and transferrin receptor (Das2021Clathrin). The phosphorylation status of CLTB is crucial for these processes, affecting the internalization of specific membrane proteins and clathrin exchange (Das2021Clathrin). In addition, CLTB plays a role in linking the endocytic machinery to the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating endocytosis by recruiting actin to sites of endocytosis, particularly under conditions requiring additional mechanical force (Das2021Clathrin). This interaction is vital for maintaining cellular functions and ensuring efficient intracellular trafficking.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the CLTB gene can significantly impact cellular transport mechanisms, potentially contributing to various diseases. Altered expression of CLTB is implicated in the disruption of normal cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways, which may lead to neurological disorders. The precise mechanisms by which CLTB mutations contribute to these conditions are not fully understood, but they likely involve the impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a critical process for cellular trafficking.

In cancer progression, changes in CLTB expression levels may affect the cellular transport of growth factor receptors and other signaling molecules, potentially leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor development. The dysregulation of CLTB could also influence the metastatic potential of cancer cells by altering their ability to interact with the extracellular matrix and other cells.

Metabolic diseases may also be linked to CLTB abnormalities, as the gene plays a role in the endocytosis of nutrient transporters and receptors. Disruptions in these processes can lead to imbalances in nutrient uptake and cellular metabolism, contributing to the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. Overall, the clinical significance of CLTB lies in its essential role in maintaining cellular function and its potential involvement in various disease processes.

## Interactions
CLTB (clathrin light chain B) is involved in various protein interactions essential for its role in intracellular trafficking. It is a component of the clathrin coat, which forms a triskelion structure with clathrin heavy chains, stabilizing the formation of coated vesicles. CLTB interacts with adaptor protein complexes, such as AP-2, which are crucial for cargo selection and vesicle formation (Blue2018How).

In the context of mitosis, CLTB is part of a spindle-associated complex that includes clathrin heavy and light chain subunits, such as CLTA and CLTC. This complex is involved in targeting proteins like TACC3 to the mitotic spindle, a process that may require phosphorylation for proper localization (Hubner2010Quantitative). The interaction of CLTB with other proteins in this complex suggests its role in vesicle transport during mitosis (Hubner2010Quantitative).

CLTB is also implicated in the endocytosis pathway, as identified in studies involving the Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin B subunit (LTB) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) subunit VP1. This pathway is upregulated in response to treatments with LTB and EVP1, highlighting CLTB's involvement in receptor-mediated endocytosis and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathways (Liu2016Quantitative).
