# CFH

## Overview
The CFH gene encodes complement factor H, a regulatory protein that plays a critical role in the complement system, particularly in the alternative pathway. Complement factor H is a soluble glycoprotein composed of 20 complement control protein (CCP) domains, which are essential for its function in immune regulation. As a regulatory protein, complement factor H prevents excessive activation of the complement system, thereby protecting host tissues from damage. It achieves this by binding to C3b, a key component of the complement cascade, and facilitating its inactivation, as well as by interacting with glycosaminoglycans and sialic acid on host cell surfaces to prevent complement activation on self-cells. The CFH gene and its protein product are implicated in various diseases, including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II, and age-related macular degeneration, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining immune homeostasis (SánchezCorral2018SelfDamage; Skerka2008Complement; De2007Translational).

## Structure
Complement factor H (CFH) is a regulatory protein composed of 20 complement control protein (CCP) modules, also known as short consensus repeat (SCR) domains. Each CCP module is approximately 60 residues long and features a β-strand-rich structure with two disulfide bonds, forming a sushi domain (Makou2013Functional; Rodriguez2014New). The protein's modular architecture allows for flexibility and variation in intermodular angles, contributing to its elongated structure (Makou2013Functional).

The primary structure of CFH includes 1213 amino acid residues, with eight N-glycosylation sites predominantly occupied by nonfucosylated diantennary disialylated glycans, contributing to its molecular mass of 155 kDa (Makou2013Functional). The secondary structure is characterized by β-sheets, with conserved cysteine residues forming disulfide bridges crucial for structural integrity (Rodriguez2014New).

CFH can oligomerize in the presence of glycosaminoglycans and metal ions, forming dimers and higher-order oligomers (Makou2013Functional). The protein's quaternary structure is influenced by electrostatic interactions between its CCP modules, which vary in isoelectric point (Makou2013Functional).

CFH has a splice variant, FH-like 1, which consists of CCPs 1-7 and additional C-terminal residues, and is less effective at protecting surfaces compared to CFH (Makou2013Functional).

## Function
The CFH gene encodes complement factor H (FH), a crucial regulatory protein in the complement system, particularly the alternative pathway. FH is primarily active in the plasma and on cell surfaces, where it plays a vital role in maintaining immune homeostasis by preventing excessive complement activation that could damage host tissues (SánchezCorral2018SelfDamage; Skerka2008Complement). FH achieves this by binding to C3b, a central component of the complement system, and promoting its inactivation. It acts as a cofactor for factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and facilitates the decay of the C3 convertase enzyme, thereby inhibiting the amplification loop of the alternative pathway (Józsi2008Factor; De2007Translational).

The protein is composed of 20 complement control protein (CCP) domains, with the N-terminal domains responsible for its regulatory activity. The C-terminal domains are involved in binding to cell surfaces and ligands such as heparin and glycosaminoglycans, which helps distinguish between self and non-self surfaces (Cantsilieris2018Recurrent; Skerka2008Complement). This binding is crucial for protecting host cells from complement-mediated damage and ensuring that the immune response is directed against pathogens (Cserhalmi2019Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CFH gene are associated with several diseases, primarily due to dysregulation of the complement system. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is linked to CFH mutations that impair the regulation of the alternative complement pathway, leading to kidney damage. These mutations often affect the C-terminal region of CFH, reducing its ability to bind to C3b, heparin, and endothelial cells. Some patients also have autoantibodies that block CFH binding, further inhibiting complement regulation (Noris2010Relative; Józsi2008Factor).

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN II) is another condition associated with CFH mutations. These mutations can lead to decreased plasma levels of CFH or secretion of a dysfunctional protein, resulting in uncontrolled complement activation and glomerular damage (De2007Translational).

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is also linked to CFH variants, such as the Tyr402His polymorphism, which reduces binding to heparin and C-reactive protein, increasing disease risk. The deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes, often associated with CFH, has a protective effect against AMD (De2007Translational; Józsi2008Factor).

## Interactions
Complement factor H (CFH) is involved in various interactions with proteins and other molecules, playing a crucial role in regulating the complement system. CFH primarily interacts with C3b, a central component of the complement system, through its complement control protein (CCP) domains. The N-terminal CCPs 1-4 bind to C3b, facilitating its cleavage by factor I (FI) and inhibiting the formation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb) (Makou2013Functional; Parente2016Complement). The C-terminal CCPs 19-20 also interact with C3b, specifically recognizing the thioester-containing domain (TED) of C3b, which enhances CFH's binding to self-surfaces (Makou2013Functional; Parente2016Complement).

CFH also binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and sialic acid on host cell surfaces, which is important for its regulatory function in preventing complement activation on self-cells (Makou2013Functional; Parente2016Complement). Additionally, CFH interacts with C-reactive protein (CRP) and heparin, with these interactions being influenced by genetic variations and linked to diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Perkins2012Complement).

CFH's interactions extend to other proteins, such as complement receptor 3 (CR3) on neutrophils, where it modulates cell activation and function, and adrenomedullin (AM), enhancing AM-mediated activities (Parente2016Complement). These interactions highlight CFH's multifaceted role in immune regulation and potential therapeutic applications.
