# SCYL2

## Overview
The SCYL2 gene encodes the SCY1 like pseudokinase 2, a member of the SCY1-like family of pseudokinases, which also includes SCYL1 and SCYL3. This protein is primarily involved in cellular trafficking processes, particularly clathrin-mediated endocytosis and vesicle trafficking between the Golgi apparatus and endosomal systems. SCYL2 plays a crucial role in regulating protein trafficking along the secretory pathway and is implicated in the targeting of membrane receptors for lysosomal degradation and sorting at the trans-Golgi network (Gingras2015SCYL2). In the nervous system, SCYL2 is essential for normal neuronal function, where it helps suppress excitotoxicity, a process that can lead to neuronal death (Gingras2015SCYL2). Beyond its role in mammals, SCYL2 proteins, such as OsSCYL2 in rice, are involved in plant growth and development by interacting with key regulatory proteins like the target of rapamycin (TOR) (Xu2024OsSCYL2). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with various conditions, including a novel syndromic form of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and its involvement in cancer and severe COVID-19 (Seidahmed2020Recessive; Gusakova2023GWAS).

## Function
The SCYL2 gene encodes a protein pseudokinase that is part of the SCY1-like family, which includes SCYL1 and SCYL3. SCYL2, also known as the coated vesicle-associated kinase of 104 kDa (CVAK104), is involved in regulating protein trafficking along the secretory pathway. It interacts with components of the clathrin machinery and is implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, targeting membrane receptors for lysosomal degradation, and sorting at the trans-Golgi network (Gingras2015SCYL2). In the nervous system, SCYL2 plays a critical role in suppressing excitotoxicity, a process where excessive excitatory signaling leads to neuronal death, particularly during the functional maturation of the hippocampus (Gingras2015SCYL2).

SCYL2 is crucial for normal neuronal function, as its deficiency leads to neurodegeneration due to aberrant expression of excitatory receptors like NR1 and KA1. This results in increased levels of kainic acid and NMDA receptors at synapses, leading to neuronal damage (Gingras2015SCYL2). The protein may function independently of clathrin and lysosomal pathways, possibly by regulating the delivery of receptors to synapses (Gingras2015SCYL2). These findings suggest that SCYL2 has evolved to perform specific functions in mammals, distinct from its role in other organisms (Gingras2015SCYL2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCYL2 gene have been linked to a novel syndromic form of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), a condition characterized by joint contractures and multisystem involvement. Affected individuals from consanguineous families in Saudi Arabia and Oman exhibited neurogenic arthrogryposis, microcephaly, brain malformations such as absent corpus callosum, optic atrophy, limb fractures, profound developmental delay, and early lethality. Whole-exome sequencing identified homozygous truncating variants in SCYL2, suggesting that loss of function mutations in this gene lead to severe neurogenic arthrogryposis with brain malformations (Seidahmed2020Recessive).

In breast cancer, SCYL2 is involved in clathrin-dependent vesicle trafficking, and its variants have been associated with histologic grade, although the association is weak and statistically insignificant after correction for multiple testing (Agarwal2015Characterization). The circular RNA derived from SCYL2, circSCYL2, is downregulated in breast cancer tissues and is implicated in inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), potentially suppressing metastasis (Yuan2020EMT).

SCYL2 has also been associated with severe COVID-19, where it plays a role in clathrin-mediated vesicular transportation and may influence viral replication and immune response (Gusakova2023GWAS).

## Interactions
SCYL2 (SCY1 like pseudokinase 2) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In the context of gastric cancer, SCYL2 interacts with Glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), enhancing the activation of the WNT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction leads to the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus, promoting cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth (Liu2021EPRS/GluRS; Dulic2024Protein–Protein). SCYL2 is also known to bind with components of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway, such as the clathrin-AP1 complex, and is involved in vesicle trafficking between the Golgi apparatus and endosomal systems (Zhang2023Identification).

In plants, SCYL2 proteins, including OsSCYL2 in rice, interact with the target of rapamycin (TOR) protein, a key regulator of growth and metabolism. This interaction is confirmed through various assays, including yeast two-hybrid and split-luciferase complementation assays, indicating a role in modulating hormone levels during seed germination (Xu2024OsSCYL2). These interactions highlight SCYL2's involvement in both plant and animal cellular processes, influencing growth, development, and disease progression.
