# RASAL2

## Overview
RASAL2, or RAS protein activator like 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins. The protein product of RASAL2 functions primarily as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RAS, a small GTPase involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. RASAL2 is involved in the negative regulation of RAS signaling pathways, thereby influencing cellular dynamics and oncogenic processes. The protein has been implicated in several types of cancer, where it can act either as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the cellular context. Its interactions with other proteins, such as PRKAA, ARHGAP24, and IPO5, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular signaling and cancer progression (Feng2014RASAL2; Zhang2019IPO5; Hui2017RASAL2).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
RASAL2 has been implicated in various cancers, with its role differing depending on the cancer type. In colorectal cancer (CRC), RASAL2 is generally downregulated, and this reduction is associated with increased tumor proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis. The downregulation of RASAL2 in CRC is linked to poor clinical outcomes and advanced disease stages (Jia2017Downregulation). Conversely, in breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RASAL2 acts as an oncogene. It is overexpressed in TNBC, promoting invasion and metastasis through RAC1 activation, independent of its RAS-GAP activity (Feng2014RASAL2). High RASAL2 expression in TNBC is associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance, although it may increase sensitivity to MEK and EGFR inhibitors (Koh2021RASAL2).

In prostate cancer, RASAL2 functions as an oncogene, enhancing tumor growth via the PI3K/AKT/cyclin D1 pathway (Wang2022RASAL2). In bladder cancer, RASAL2 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation linked to increased cancer stemness and EMT through the MAPK/SOX2 pathway (Hui2017RASAL2). These findings highlight the context-dependent role of RASAL2 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RASAL2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It physically interacts with PRKAA, a key regulator in autophagy, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays in 293 T and MCF7 cells. This interaction is crucial for regulating PRKAA phosphorylation, although RASAL2 itself is not a phosphatase. Instead, it interacts with PPM1B, a metal-dependent protein phosphatase, enhancing the interaction between PPM1B and PRKAA, leading to decreased phosphorylation of PRKAA (Bao2021PRKAAAMPKα).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, RASAL2 interacts with ARHGAP24, a RAC1 GTPase-activating protein. This interaction, which requires the GAP domain of RASAL2 but not its GAP activity, negatively regulates ARHGAP24's activity, enhancing RAC1 activity and promoting cell invasiveness (Feng2014RASAL2).

RASAL2 also interacts with IPO5 in colorectal cancer cells, where it acts as a cargo protein for IPO5, facilitating its nuclear transport. This interaction is dependent on a nuclear localization signal within RASAL2, and mutations in this signal prevent its nuclear translocation, impacting RAS signaling activation (Zhang2019IPO5).

In renal cell carcinoma, RASAL2 interacts with GSK3β, potentially activating it and affecting the phosphorylation of GSK3β on Ser9, which is linked to the regulation of c-FOS and VEGFA expression involved in tumor angiogenesis (Hui2018The).
