# AKAP12

## Overview
AKAP12, or A-kinase anchoring protein 12, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional scaffolding protein known as AKAP12 or SSeCKS/Gravin. This protein is primarily involved in the spatial and temporal regulation of cellular signaling pathways by anchoring key signaling molecules such as protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and Src to specific cellular locations. As a scaffolding protein, AKAP12 plays a crucial role in modulating cell morphology, motility, and proliferation, and is implicated in various physiological processes including cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis (Carnegie2009A‐kinase; Lee2018A‑kinase). AKAP12 is also recognized for its tumor suppressor functions, particularly in inhibiting oncogenic signaling and metastasis, making it a significant focus in cancer research (Gelman2012Suppression; Akakura2008Loss). The gene's expression and alterations are associated with cancer progression and drug resistance, underscoring its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Liang2022Pancancer; Kjällquist2018Exome).

## Structure
AKAP12, also known as SSeCKS or Gravin, is a scaffolding protein with a largely unordered structure, lacking significant secondary and tertiary structures except in specific domains that serve as docking sites for signaling components (Gao2011AKAP12; Malbon2004AKAP). The protein contains multiple binding domains, including those for Src, cyclins, calmodulin, phosphatidylserine, protein kinase C (PKC), F-actin, the β2-adrenergic receptor, and the RII subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) (Gelman2012Suppression). AKAP12 also features polybasic domains for phosphoinositol binding, nuclear localization signals, and a domain for nuclear exclusion (Gelman2012Suppression).

Post-translational modifications of AKAP12 include myristoylation at the N-terminus and phosphorylation at several PKC and tyrosine sites, which influence its binding activity and function (Gelman2012Suppression). AKAP12 can form homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with other scaffolding proteins, such as AKAP5, contributing to its scaffolding activity (Gao2011AKAP12). The protein's ability to multimerize enhances its role in organizing signaling assemblies and modulating cellular signaling pathways (Gao2011AKAP12). AKAP12 is known to have several splice variant isoforms, which may vary in domain composition and function (Gao2011AKAP12).

## Function
AKAP12, also known as SSeCKS or Gravin, is a multifunctional scaffolding protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling by anchoring protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and Src to specific cellular locations. This anchoring function is crucial for the spatial and temporal regulation of signaling pathways involved in cell morphology, motility, and proliferation (Carnegie2009A‐kinase; Lee2018A‑kinase).

In healthy human cells, AKAP12 is abundantly expressed in secretory epithelial cells and is involved in suppressing metastasis by inhibiting Src-mediated oncogenic signaling and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Akakura2008Loss). It also plays a role in regulating the cell cycle by sequestering cyclin D1 in the cytoplasm, thereby acting as a checkpoint for cell-cycle arrest and preventing the G1-to-S phase transition (Burnworth2012SSeCKS; Lin2000SSeCKS).

AKAP12 is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it influences cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. It is also involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier by modulating the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing vascular permeability (Lee2003SSeCKS). The protein's tumor suppressor activity is highlighted by its ability to inhibit oncogenic and metastatic properties when overexpressed (Lee2018A‑kinase).

## Clinical Significance
AKAP12 (A-kinase anchoring protein 12) plays a significant role in cancer, particularly in relation to drug resistance and tumor progression. Alterations in AKAP12 expression are linked to resistance to anti-VEGF therapies, such as bevacizumab, in cancers like ovarian, glioblastoma, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancer. High AKAP12 expression is associated with poor prognosis in these cancers, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for resistance to anti-VEGF inhibitors (Liang2022Pancancer). 

In breast cancer, AKAP12 is often downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation or loss of its locus, and it is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor. This downregulation is linked to increased invasiveness and recurrence risk, particularly in basal-like and HER2-enriched subtypes (Kjällquist2018Exome). 

AKAP12 also influences endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, with its deficiency impairing VEGF-induced responses. This impairment is linked to its role in actin dynamics and cell motility, which are crucial for angiogenesis and endothelial cell function (Benz2019AKAP12). 

Overall, AKAP12's expression and genetic alterations are critical in cancer progression, drug resistance, and angiogenesis, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology.

## Interactions
AKAP12, also known as SSeCKS or Gravin, is a scaffolding protein that interacts with a variety of proteins to regulate cellular signaling pathways. It is known to scaffold protein kinase C (PKC), F-actin, cyclins, Src, and phosphoinositides, and has potential scaffolding domains for PKA, calmodulin, β1,4-galactosyltransferase-polypeptide-1, β2-adrenergic receptors, and cAMP-specific 3′,5′-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4D (Gelman2012Suppression). AKAP12 facilitates the translocation of proteins to different cellular compartments, affecting signaling by transporting bound proteins to sites of action or inaction (Gelman2012Suppression).

AKAP12 interacts with the β2-adrenergic receptor, playing a crucial role in receptor desensitization and resensitization. It forms complexes with protein kinases and phosphatases, such as protein phosphatase 2A and 2B, and is involved in the regulation of receptor function (Lin2000Gravinmediated; Shih1999Dynamic). AKAP12 also associates with VASP and PKA in endothelial cells, where it is essential for VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration and sprouting (Benz2019AKAP12).

In the context of cancer, AKAP12 re-expression decreases oncogenic growth and motility by suppressing MMP-2/9 expression and secretion, and it affects RhoA and Cdc42 activation levels (Gelman2012Suppression). AKAP12's interactions with these proteins highlight its role as a scaffold that modulates the activity of proteins involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and metastasis suppression (Gelman2012Suppression).
