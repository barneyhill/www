# NBPF11

## Overview
NBPF11 is a gene that encodes the NBPF member 11 protein, which is part of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family. This protein is characterized by a high degree of intrinsic disorder, facilitating dynamic protein-protein interactions through molecular recognition features (MoRFs) (Van2020Intrinsic). NBPF member 11 contains two coiled-coil regions and six Olduvai domains, which are conserved but of unknown function, and is involved in various cellular processes, including neuronal activities and signal transduction (Van2020Intrinsic). The gene is located in the 1q21.2 region, a genomic area associated with human diseases and evolutionary processes, particularly in brain development and cognitive function (O’Bleness2014Finished; O’Bleness2012Evolutionary). The NBPF11 protein is part of a highly interconnected protein-protein interaction network, indicating its crucial role in cellular interactions and its potential involvement in brain disorders (Van2020Intrinsic).

## Structure
NBPF11 is characterized by a high level of intrinsic disorder, with a predicted percentage of disordered residues (PPIDR) of 82.0 ± 10.2% and an average disorder score (ADS) of 0.690 ± 0.068. The protein is 865 residues long and contains two coiled-coil regions and six Olduvai domains, which are highly conserved but of unknown function (Van2020Intrinsic). These regions include molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are disorder-based protein-protein interaction sites that can fold upon interaction with binding partners, indicating the importance of intrinsic-disorder-based interactions for the functionality of NBPF11 (Van2020Intrinsic).

NBPF11 also has an alternative splicing-generated isoform that lacks the C-terminal region and has a modified preceding region (Van2020Intrinsic). The protein is part of the NBPF gene family, which is rich in DUF1220 domains. These domains have undergone significant evolutionary changes, particularly in primates, and are associated with human brain evolution and neurodevelopment (O’Bleness2014Finished; O’Bleness2012Evolutionary). The NBPF11 gene is located in the 1q21.2 region, a complex genomic area known for its involvement in human diseases and evolutionary processes (O’Bleness2014Finished).

## Function
NBPF11, a member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, is characterized by a high level of intrinsic disorder, with approximately 82% of its residues predicted to be disordered. This intrinsic disorder is significant for its functionality, as it facilitates protein-protein interactions through disorder-based interaction sites known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which occupy about 32.8% of the protein sequence (Van2020Intrinsic). The protein contains two coiled-coil regions and six Olduvai domains, which are conserved domains of unknown function. These structural features suggest a role in facilitating dynamic interactions with other proteins, potentially contributing to its involvement in various cellular processes (Van2020Intrinsic).

NBPF11 is part of the core duplicon gene families, which are highly expressed and involved in diverse biological processes, including neuronal activities, signal transduction, and cell proliferation. These genes are associated with brain disorders and are thought to have played a role in human evolution, particularly in the context of brain development and cognitive function (Van2020Intrinsic). The protein-protein interaction network centered on NBPF11 is highly interconnected, indicating its crucial role in cellular interactions (Van2020Intrinsic).

## Interactions
NBPF11, a member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, is characterized by a high level of intrinsic disorder, with a significant portion of its residues predicted to be disordered. This intrinsic disorder facilitates protein-protein interactions through regions known as Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs), which can fold upon interaction with binding partners. These MoRFs are crucial for the protein's functionality, allowing NBPF11 to engage in various interactions within the cell (Van2020Intrinsic).

The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for NBPF11, generated using the STRING database, includes 26 nodes and 113 edges, indicating a well-interconnected network. This network is characterized by an average node degree of 8.69 and an average local clustering coefficient of 0.86, with a PPI enrichment p-value of less than 10, suggesting a high level of interaction among the proteins in the network (Van2020Intrinsic).

NBPF11 is also implicated in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, regulated by UPF1. The regulation of NBPF11 and other NBPF family members by UPF1 suggests that these proteins are involved in brain development and are normally degraded by the NMD pathway (Boehm2024Rapid).
