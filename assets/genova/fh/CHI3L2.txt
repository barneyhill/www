# CHI3L2

## Overview
The CHI3L2 gene encodes the protein chitinase 3-like 2, also known as YKL-39, which is a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 18. Despite its structural similarity to chitinases, CHI3L2 lacks enzymatic activity due to the absence of a catalytic motif. The protein is primarily secreted by articular chondrocytes and synoviocytes and plays a significant role in cartilage homeostasis and tissue remodeling. It is involved in cell signaling pathways, particularly through the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation. CHI3L2's expression is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker (Areshkov2010Chitinase; Liu2021CHI3L2; Miyatake2013Human).

## Structure
The CHI3L2 protein, also known as YKL-39, is a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 18 and is structurally similar to chitinases but lacks enzymatic activity. The mature protein consists of 390 amino acids, following the removal of a 26-amino acid signal peptide (Hu1996Isolation; Ranok2015Structural). The primary structure includes a single amino acid variation at position 318 due to a single nucleotide polymorphism (Ranok2015Structural).

The secondary structure of CHI3L2 features a major (β/α)8 TIM barrel domain and a small α+β insertion domain. The TIM barrel domain consists of eight parallel β-strands alternating with eight α-helices, which are involved in interacting with chitooligosaccharides (Ranok2015Structural). The insertion domain contributes to stabilizing the sugar-protein complex (Ranok2015Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, CHI3L2 contains two disulfide bonds that help maintain its structural integrity (Ranok2015Structural). The protein is not glycosylated, unlike its close relative CHI3L1 (Iershov2010Homology; Hu1996Isolation). CHI3L2 is secreted from articular chondrocytes and is involved in tissue remodeling and inflammation (Ranok2015Structural).

## Function
The CHI3L2 gene encodes the chitinase 3-like protein 2, also known as YKL-39, which is part of the glycosyl hydrolase family 18. Despite its sequence similarity to chitinases, CHI3L2 lacks enzymatic activity due to the absence of a catalytic motif (Hu1996Isolation; Miyatake2013Human). CHI3L2 is primarily secreted by articular chondrocytes and synoviocytes and is involved in cartilage homeostasis. It enhances cell proliferation, colony formation, and type II collagen expression in chondrocytic cells, suggesting a role as a growth and differentiation factor (Miyatake2013Human).

CHI3L2 is known to activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation. This activation is more sustained compared to its closely related protein, CHI3L1, and is associated with the regulation of cell cycle-related genes and cell adhesion molecules (Areshkov2012Two; Areshkov2010Chitinase). The protein is predominantly found in the extracellular space, where it may play a role in cell signaling and interaction, contributing to maintaining tissue homeostasis (Iershov2010Homology). CHI3L2's involvement in these molecular processes suggests its potential role in maintaining joint health and cartilage repair.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CHI3L2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in various cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In gliomas, a type of primary brain tumor, high CHI3L2 expression is associated with poor prognosis. It is particularly upregulated in glioblastoma and IDH wild-type gliomas, correlating with shorter survival times and suggesting its role as an independent prognostic biomarker. CHI3L2 is also linked to immune infiltration in gliomas, indicating its potential involvement in tumor immune modulation (Liu2021CHI3L2).

In conventional renal cell carcinoma (RCC), CHI3L2 expression is associated with disease progression. Although most RCC tumors are negative for CHI3L2, those with strong expression show a significant correlation with tumor relapse, size, grade, and T classification. Patients with CHI3L2-positive tumors have a shorter disease-free survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker for RCC (PUSZTAI2019M2).

CHI3L2 is also upregulated in the motor cortex and spinal cord of patients with sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (sALS), with higher expression levels correlating with shorter survival times, suggesting its role in disease progression (Sanfilippo2017CHI3L1). In osteoarthritis, CHI3L2 expression is significantly enhanced in affected cartilage, indicating its involvement in the disease's pathophysiology (Steck2002Enhanced).

## Interactions
CHI3L2, also known as chitinase 3-like protein 2 or YKL-39, is involved in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/ERK2 in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and human glioblastoma (U87 MG) cells. This activation occurs in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293 cells, indicating a role in cell signaling pathways related to cell proliferation and differentiation (Areshkov2010Chitinase).

Despite its involvement in these signaling pathways, specific protein-protein interaction partners for CHI3L2 have not been identified in several protein interaction databases, including BioGRID, HPID, MIPS, MINT, IntAct, DIP, and BRITE (Iershov2010Homology). This suggests that while CHI3L2 may participate in signaling pathways, its direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely uncharacterized.

CHI3L2 also interacts with chitooligosaccharides, as demonstrated by studies using isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy. These interactions involve specific binding sites within the protein, characterized by a single-site binding model, and are influenced by the length of the chitooligosaccharide, with longer chains showing stronger binding affinity (Ranok2015Structural).
