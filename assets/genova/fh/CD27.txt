# CD27

## Overview
CD27 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system. The CD27 protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that functions primarily as a receptor involved in T cell activation, survival, and differentiation. It is predominantly expressed on T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, and interacts with its ligand, CD70, to facilitate T cell expansion and memory formation. This interaction is crucial for effective immune responses, particularly during viral infections. Additionally, CD27 is expressed on B cells and natural killer (NK) cells, influencing antibody production and NK cell function. Mutations in the CD27 gene can lead to immunological disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Hendriks2000CD27; Wu2011The; Ramakrishna2015Characterization).

## Structure
The CD27 protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. Its extracellular domain (ECD) is composed of three cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are characteristic of TNFRs. CRD1 and CRD2 each contain three disulfide bonds, while CRD3 is incomplete with only two disulfides (Teplyakov2017Crystal). The disulfide pattern in CRD1 and CRD2 follows an AABCBC pattern, typical of the TNFR superfamily (Teplyakov2017Crystal). The structure of CD27 is similar to TNFR1, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.0 Å for 74 common C atoms of the first two CRDs (Teplyakov2017Crystal).

CD27 can form a disulfide-linked homodimer through a free cysteine at position 165, which is involved in receptor dimerization (Goodwin1993Molecular; Liu2021Structural). The protein also contains an N-glycosylation site at Asn75, which is a common post-translational modification (Teplyakov2017Crystal). The interaction between CD27 and its ligand CD70 involves a 3:3 stoichiometry, with three CD27 monomers binding to a CD70 homotrimer (Liu2021Structural). The CD27 protein's structure allows for flexibility, enabling each chain of the dimer to bind a ligand, potentially binding to the same trimer of CD70 (Teplyakov2017Crystal).

## Function
The CD27 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, playing a crucial role in the immune system. CD27 is primarily expressed on T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, and is involved in T cell activation, survival, and differentiation. It functions as a co-stimulatory molecule, enhancing T cell receptor (TCR)-induced responses, which are essential for effective immune function (Hendriks2000CD27; Ramakrishna2015Characterization).

CD27 interacts with its ligand, CD70, to promote the expansion and differentiation of T cells, contributing to the formation and maintenance of T cell memory. This interaction is vital for the antigen-specific expansion of naïve T cells and supports both primary and secondary immune responses, particularly in CD8+ T cells during viral infections (Hendriks2000CD27; Grant2017The). CD27 signaling involves pathways such as JAK2, ERK1/2, and PKR, which overlap with CD28 signaling, enhancing cytokine production and T cell survival (Ramakrishna2015Characterization).

In addition to its role in T cells, CD27 is expressed on B cells and natural killer (NK) cells, where it influences antibody production and NK cell function, respectively (Wu2011The; Silva2008Application). CD27's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and effective immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD27 gene are associated with a range of immunological disorders, primarily due to its role in immune system regulation. CD27 deficiency, resulting from mutations in the TNFRSF7/CD27 gene, leads to a condition characterized by increased susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections and related complications, such as lymphoproliferative disorders and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (Alkhairy2015Novel; Salzer2012Combined). Patients with CD27 deficiency often present with severe EBV-related diseases, including chronic viremia, infectious mononucleosis, and lymphomas like Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma (Alkhairy2015Novel; Ghosh2020Extended).

The deficiency is also linked to hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, and autoimmune features such as uveitis and arthritis (Alkhairy2015Novel; Ghosh2020Extended). Genetic mutations in CD27, such as missense and nonsense mutations, impair the CD27-CD70 interaction, crucial for T-cell and B-cell function, leading to altered immune responses and increased risk of malignancies (Ghosh2020Extended; Salzer2012Combined). Treatment strategies for CD27 deficiency include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), particularly in cases with malignant transformation (Alkhairy2015Novel; Ghosh2020Extended).

## Interactions
CD27, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, primarily interacts with its ligand CD70. This interaction is crucial for T cell-T cell and T cell-B cell interactions, as well as for the generation of cytolytic T cells and enhanced IgG production in B cells (Prasad1997CD27). The CD27-CD70 complex involves significant physical interactions, with each CD27 molecule engaging two CD70 monomers. This interaction is dominated by the CRD2 and CRD3 domains of CD27, with a single residue from CRD1, F48, participating in a van der Waals interaction with CD70 (Liu2021Structural).

CD27 also interacts with the proapoptotic protein Siva, which binds to the cytoplasmic tail of CD27. This interaction can induce apoptosis, suggesting an alternative apoptotic pathway for CD27, despite its lack of a death domain (Prasad1997CD27). The interaction between CD27 and Siva was confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that CD27 coprecipitates with GFP-Siva in 293 cells (Prasad1997CD27).

Monoclonal antibodies targeting CD27 can influence its interactions. Most antibodies block CD70 binding by binding to the internal surface of a CD27 homodimer, potentially causing steric hindrance (Heckel2022Agonistic).
