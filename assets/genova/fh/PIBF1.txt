# PIBF1

## Overview
The PIBF1 gene encodes the progesterone immunomodulatory binding factor 1, a protein that plays a significant role in immunomodulation, particularly during pregnancy. This protein is categorized as a DNA-binding protein and is characterized by its leucine-zipper and nuclear localization signals, which are typical of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation (Polgar2003Molecular). The full-length PIBF1 protein is primarily located in the nucleus and centrosome, where it is involved in cell cycle regulation and immune tolerance, while smaller isoforms are secreted and interact with cell surface receptors to modulate immune responses (SzekeresBartho2021Progesterone; Lachmann2004PIBF). PIBF1 is crucial for processes such as trophoblast syncytialization and cardiovascular development, highlighting its importance in embryogenesis and pregnancy maintenance (Lee2024PIBF1). Additionally, alterations in PIBF1 expression and mutations are linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and genetic disorders like Joubert syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance (Ro2020PIBF1; Shen2020Identification).

## Structure
The PIBF1 protein is encoded by a cDNA that is 2765 base pairs long, with an open reading frame of 2271 base pairs, resulting in a protein composed of 757 amino acids (Polgar2003Molecular). The primary structure of PIBF1 includes features typical of DNA-binding proteins, such as leucine-zipper and nuclear localization signals (Polgar2003Molecular). The secondary structure is characterized as 'all α helical' (Polgar2003Molecular). 

PIBF1 has a predicted molecular mass of 89,724.5 Da and an isoelectric point of 5.73, indicating it is hydrophilic (Polgar2003Molecular). The protein contains potential post-translational modification sites, including phosphorylation and glycosylation sites, and a putative PEST sequence, which suggests a short half-life (Polgar2003Molecular). 

Alternative splicing of PIBF1 mRNA results in different protein isoforms, including a full-length 90 kDa protein and a smaller 35 kDa variant (Lachmann2004PIBF). The full-length protein is associated with the nucleus and centrosome, while the 35 kDa form is found in the cytoplasm (Lachmann2004PIBF). The N-terminal region, specifically amino acids 1-184, is crucial for its angiogenic properties (Lee2024PIBF1).

## Function
The PIBF1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in immunomodulation during pregnancy. It is involved in maintaining immune tolerance to the fetus by influencing cytokine production and natural killer (NK) cell activity. The full-length PIBF protein is associated with the nucleus and is involved in cell cycle regulation, while smaller isoforms are secreted and bind to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored PIBF receptor. This receptor forms a temporary association with the alpha chain of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor and signals via the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, contributing to a Th2 dominant cytokine pattern during normal pregnancy (SzekeresBartho2021Progesterone).

PIBF1 is also essential for trophoblast syncytialization, a process critical for forming the materno-fetal exchange interface in the placenta. It facilitates the differentiation and fusion of trophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts, which are necessary for proper placental function and successful pregnancy outcomes (Lee2024PIBF1). Additionally, PIBF1 promotes cardiovascular development by enhancing cardiomyocyte differentiation and endothelial angiogenesis, as demonstrated in human heart organoid models (Lee2024PIBF1). The protein's activity in these processes underscores its importance in both cellular and organismal contexts, particularly in supporting embryogenesis and maintaining pregnancy.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PIBF1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, PIBF1 is overexpressed in various tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This overexpression promotes tumorigenicity and cell motility, while knockdown of PIBF1 suppresses cell viability and migration by activating the ATR/CHK1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and response to DNA damage (Ro2020PIBF1). PIBF1 is also implicated in recurrent implantation failure (RIF) in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization, where decreased expression is linked to poor endometrial receptivity and impaired endometrial function (Zhou2021Decreased).

In genetic disorders, PIBF1 mutations are linked to Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy characterized by developmental delay and cerebellar malformations. Pathogenic variants in PIBF1, such as compound heterozygous mutations, disrupt normal ciliary function, contributing to the syndrome's clinical features (Shen2020Identification; Hebbar2018A). These mutations can lead to a range of symptoms, including hypotonia and the molar tooth sign, a distinctive brain malformation associated with the syndrome (Ott2019The).

## Interactions
The progesterone immunomodulatory binding factor 1 (PIBF1) protein is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in immune regulation and cellular processes. PIBF1 interacts with the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored PIBF receptor, forming a heterodimer with the alpha chain of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor. This interaction activates the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway, leading to increased production of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines (SzekeresBartho2021Progesterone; SzekeresBartho2018The).

PIBF1 is also associated with the centrosome, suggesting it acts as a microtubule-associated protein. This association is supported by its colocalization with centrosomes and its presence at the poles of the mitotic spindle, as observed in immunofluorescence studies (Lachmann2004PIBF). The full-length 90 kDa PIBF1 protein is predominantly found in tissues and cell lines, while smaller isoforms are secreted and dispersed in the cytoplasm (Lachmann2004PIBF).

Under oxidative stress, PIBF1 binding to its receptor on lymphocytes is affected, altering membrane dynamics and potentially impacting receptor structure and function. This interaction is crucial for maintaining membrane rigidity and lipid raft clustering, which are essential for effective signal transduction (de2014Oxidative).
