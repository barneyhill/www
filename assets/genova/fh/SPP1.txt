# SPP1

## Overview
SPP1, or secreted phosphoprotein 1, is a gene that encodes the protein osteopontin, a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. Osteopontin is characterized by its highly phosphorylated and intrinsically disordered structure, which allows it to participate in diverse cellular functions, including cell adhesion, signaling, and immune responses. As a member of the extracellular matrix proteins, osteopontin interacts with integrins and CD44 receptors, playing a crucial role in bone remodeling, immune regulation, and cancer progression (Weber2018The; Sun2009Secreted). The gene's expression and the protein's post-translational modifications, such as hyperphosphorylation, significantly influence its functional dynamics and interactions with other cellular components (Mateos2021Hyperphosphorylation). SPP1's involvement in various signaling pathways and its altered expression in several cancers underscore its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Cai2022The; Tu2019Association).

## Structure
The human gene SPP1 encodes the protein osteopontin, which is a highly phosphorylated glycoprotein involved in various physiological processes. Osteopontin is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, allowing for significant flexibility and structural dynamics. The primary structure of osteopontin includes integrin-binding motifs, such as the conserved GRGD(S/N) sequence, which is crucial for cell adhesion and signaling (Weber2018The). The protein also contains heparin-binding sites and a thrombin cleavage site, which are important for its interaction with extracellular matrix components (Weber2018The).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in osteopontin's function. The protein undergoes hyperphosphorylation, primarily by the Fam20C kinase, which affects its structural dynamics by increasing local flexibility and inducing structural elongation (Mateos2021Hyperphosphorylation). This modification influences osteopontin's binding affinity to molecules like heparin and integrins, impacting its role in cell-ECM adhesion (Mateos2021Hyperphosphorylation).

Osteopontin exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, such as osteopontin-b and osteopontin-c, which result from alternative splicing at the N-terminus. These variants may alter the presence of certain motifs and potentially affect the protein's function (Weber2018The). The protein's evolutionary conservation across species highlights its essential biological roles (Weber2018The).

## Function
Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), also known as osteopontin, is a multifunctional protein involved in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in cell growth, adherence, and invasion, which are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and tissue homeostasis (Tu2019Association). SPP1 is involved in bone remodeling and immune responses, as it can bind to integrins and CD44, influencing cell signaling pathways (Tu2019Association). In normal tissues, SPP1 is part of networks involved in skeletal development, signaling, biological regulation, and sequence variant processes (Sun2009Secreted). It is activated by factors such as COL11A1_1, CXCL13, and MMP11, and inhibited by genes like ASPM, COL10A1, and NEK2, indicating its role in cell adhesion, immunity, and defense, as well as cell structure and motility (Sun2009Secreted).

SPP1 is also involved in mRNA transcription activities, T-cell and MHCI- and MHCII-mediated immunity, and cell communication in normal tissues (Sun2009Secreted). These interactions reflect its multifaceted role in maintaining normal cellular functions and contributing to processes such as skeletal development and immune regulation.

## Clinical Significance
The SPP1 gene, also known as osteopontin, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In several cancers, including breast, bladder, colorectal, head and neck, liver, lung, and esophageal cancers, SPP1 is upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages (Cai2022The; Tu2019Association). In contrast, it is downregulated in kidney cancer and sarcoma (Tu2019Association). SPP1's overexpression is linked to poor outcomes in melanoma, blood, brain, breast, colorectal, and lung cancers (Tu2019Association).

In colorectal carcinoma, SPP1 is involved in tumorigenesis and is associated with specific genetic mutations, influencing its expression and downstream signaling pathways crucial for cancer progression (Assidi2019Prognostic). In bladder cancer, SPP1 expression is elevated and associated with immune modulation, impacting tumor progression and patient survival (Nedjadi2023Identification). In hepatocellular carcinoma, high SPP1 levels correlate with poor survival and are linked to macrophage interactions, suggesting a role in immune regulation (Liu2021Construction).

SPP1 also plays a role in lung adenocarcinoma, where its high expression is associated with poor prognosis and immune cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment (Guo2020Analysis). These findings highlight SPP1's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
SPP1, also known as secreted phosphoprotein 1, engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cancer progression and immune regulation. It interacts with integrin receptors such as ITGB1, ITGB3, ITGB5, ITGA5, and ITGAV, which are involved in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Tu2019Association). SPP1 also interacts with CD44, a receptor that, when engaged, is associated with aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis in cancers like non-small cell lung cancer (Wei2020The).

In colorectal cancer, SPP1 interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction leads to increased β-catenin expression and nuclear accumulation, promoting cell proliferation and tumor formation (Yi2021Secreted). SPP1 also plays a role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway, enhancing cancer cell migration and invasion by modulating the expression of proteins such as E-cadherin and Vimentin (Xu2017SPP1).

In lung adenocarcinoma, SPP1 is part of a complex network involving cytokine, cell adhesion, and receptor binding modules, interacting with proteins like CXCL13, GREM1_2, and COL11A1_2, which influence cancer cell invasion and immune response modulation (Sun2009Secreted).
