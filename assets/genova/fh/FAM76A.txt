# FAM76A

## Overview
FAM76A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 76 member A. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM76A has been associated with cancer biology, particularly through its regulation by microRNA-34a and its involvement in the WTAP-HBS1L/FAM76A axis in ovarian cancer. The protein encoded by FAM76A is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but its interactions suggest a role in oncogenic pathways, potentially influencing cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (Ito2017Identification; Zheng2022Ovarian). Further research is needed to clarify the specific mechanisms by which FAM76A contributes to these processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
FAM76A has been identified as a target of the tumor suppressor microRNA-34a (miR-34a), which plays a role in cancer biology. The regulation of FAM76A by miR-34a was demonstrated through reporter assays, showing that miR-34a directly interacts with the 3′ UTR of FAM76A, leading to its repression. This interaction suggests that alterations in FAM76A expression could be involved in cancer progression, although the specific impact on tumor growth is less significant compared to other targets like GFRA3 (Ito2017Identification).

In ovarian cancer, FAM76A is part of the WTAP-HBS1L/FAM76A axis, where WTAP acts as an oncogenic factor. Overexpression of WTAP, which promotes ovarian cancer progression, is linked to lymphatic metastasis, while its downregulation reduces cell proliferation and migration, increasing apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines. This suggests that FAM76A may play a role in the oncogenic processes mediated by WTAP (Zheng2022Ovarian).

Despite these findings, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from FAM76A mutations or expression changes are not well-documented. The gene's involvement in cancer-related pathways highlights its potential clinical significance, warranting further investigation into its role in disease mechanisms.
