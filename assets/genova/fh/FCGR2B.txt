# FCGR2B

## Overview
The FCGR2B gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIB), a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by modulating immune responses. As an inhibitory receptor, FcγRIIB is primarily expressed on B cells, basophils, and monocytes, where it functions to maintain immune homeostasis and prevent excessive inflammation and autoimmunity. The receptor achieves this by integrating signals from activating and inhibitory receptors, thereby regulating the activation threshold of immune cells. FcγRIIB contains an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory Motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain, which, upon phosphorylation, recruits phosphatases such as SHIP1 and SHIP2 to inhibit downstream signaling pathways. This receptor is also involved in the clearance of IgG immune complexes in the liver, acting as a non-inflammatory 'sink' for these complexes. Genetic variations in FCGR2B have been linked to autoimmune diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in disease susceptibility and progression (Anania2019The; Nagelkerke2019Genetic).

## Function
The FCGR2B gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIB), which is a critical component in modulating immune responses. This receptor functions as an inhibitory receptor, primarily expressed on B cells, basophils, and at lower levels on monocytes, and plays a significant role in maintaining immune homeostasis by regulating the activation of B cells and innate effector cells (Anania2019The). 

FcγRIIB contains an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory Motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic tail, which, upon phosphorylation, recruits inositol phosphatases like SHIP1 and SHIP2. This recruitment leads to the inhibition of signaling pathways such as the MAP kinase pathway, affecting cellular proliferation and survival (Anania2019The). The receptor modulates the activation threshold of immune cells by balancing signals from activating and inhibitory receptors, thus preventing excessive inflammation and autoimmunity (Anania2019The).

In the liver, FcγRIIB plays a crucial role in the removal of IgG immune complexes, acting as a 'sink' to internalize these complexes without triggering pro-inflammatory responses (Anania2019The). The receptor's function is not limited to B cells; it also affects myeloid cells and regulates the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcεRI, in mast cells (Anania2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FCGR2B gene are associated with several autoimmune diseases. The FCGR2B-p.Ile232Thr polymorphism, particularly the p.232Thr/Thr genotype, is strongly linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility. This polymorphism affects the receptor's localization and function by impairing its association with lipid rafts, leading to decreased inhibitory effects on B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which may contribute to SLE development (Nagelkerke2019Genetic; Kono2005FcγRIIB). The p.232Thr allele is also associated with increased joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has been observed in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), where it may affect treatment response (Nagelkerke2019Genetic).

In Asian populations, the Ile232Thr polymorphism is a significant risk factor for SLE, while its association is not observed in Caucasians or African Americans, possibly due to low allele frequency (Kono2005FcγRIIB). The FCGR2B promoter polymorphism 2B.4 is linked to SLE susceptibility and influences gene expression, potentially affecting disease progression (Nagelkerke2019Genetic). In the context of anti-GBM disease, the 232T allele is more prevalent in patients, suggesting a genetic predisposition (Zhou2009FCGR2B). These genetic variations highlight the role of FCGR2B in autoimmune disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
FCGR2B, also known as Fc gamma receptor IIb, is involved in various interactions with other proteins, primarily through its Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory Motifs (ITIMs). One of the key interactions is with the phosphatase SHIP (Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5'-phosphatase). SHIP binds to FCGR2B through its SH2 domain, and this interaction is crucial for the receptor's inhibitory function in B cells. The recruitment of SHIP by FCGR2B affects calcium influx from extracellular stores, highlighting its role in modulating immune responses (Verbrugge2005Signaling).

FCGR2B also interacts with other phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2 in vitro, although under physiological conditions in B cells, it primarily recruits SHIP. The phosphorylation state of FCGR2B's ITIMs is a determining factor in these interactions, influencing which phosphatases are recruited (Verbrugge2005Signaling).

In the context of IgG trafficking, FCGR2B2, an isoform of FCGR2B, interacts with members of the RAB family of proteins, including RAB3D, which is involved in the formation and dynamics of FCGR2B2 compartments in placental endothelial cells. This interaction is significant for the internalization and transcytosis of IgG (ISHIKAWA2015Fc).
