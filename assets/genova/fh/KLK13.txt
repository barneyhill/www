# KLK13

## Overview
KLK13 is a gene that encodes the protein kallikrein-related peptidase 13, a member of the serine protease family known for its role in various physiological processes, including skin physiology and tissue remodeling. The protein is characterized by a serine-type catalytic triad and is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, which undergoes specific proteolytic activation. KLK13 is expressed in several tissues, such as the trachea, cervix, and salivary glands, and is secreted into body fluids like seminal plasma and saliva. It plays a role in the desquamation process by degrading desmoglein-1, contributing to skin homeostasis (Gueugnon2015Kallikreinrelated; Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). Additionally, KLK13 is involved in interactions with viral proteins and is regulated by inhibitors such as SPINK6, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and viral infections (Kantyka2011Inhibition; Milewska2020Kallikrein).

## Structure
KLK13, a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family, is a serine protease encoded by the KLK13 gene. The primary structure of KLK13 includes a sequence of amino acids that form a serine-type catalytic triad, consisting of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine, which is conserved across the kallikrein family (Kryza2016The). The secondary structure of KLK13 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, similar to other kallikreins, although specific details for KLK13 are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of KLK13 is characterized by an extended C-terminus, a unique feature among kallikrein family members (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). This structural aspect may influence its substrate specificity and interaction with inhibitors. KLK13 is synthesized as a pre-pro-enzyme with a signal peptide that directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum for processing into an inactive zymogen, which is then activated by specific proteolysis (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated).

KLK13 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common among kallikreins, although specific modifications for KLK13 are not detailed in the context. The protein can exist in different splice variant isoforms, potentially affecting its function and localization (Kryza2016The).

## Function
KLK13, or kallikrein-related peptidase 13, is a serine protease involved in several physiological processes, particularly in skin physiology and tissue remodeling. In the skin, KLK13 is suggested to play a role in the desquamation process, which is crucial for maintaining skin homeostasis. This process involves the shedding of dead skin cells, and KLK13 may contribute by degrading desmoglein-1, a protein in the corneodesmosome, indicating its potential involvement in skin physiology (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated).

KLK13 is expressed in various normal tissues, including the trachea, cervix, breast, salivary glands, and lung, and is secreted into body fluids such as seminal plasma, saliva, and cervical-vaginal fluid (Gueugnon2015Kallikreinrelated). The protease is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and activated by specific proteolytic cleavage, a common feature among kallikrein-related peptidases (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated).

While KLK13's specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its expression pattern and involvement in proteolytic cascades suggest roles in cellular processes like proliferation and differentiation, contributing to tissue homeostasis and remodeling (Avgeris2010Kallikreinrelated; Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated).

## Clinical Significance
KLK13 (kallikrein-related peptidase 13) has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels serving as potential prognostic markers. In gastric cancer, KLK13 expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous ones. Patients with positive KLK13 expression tend to have longer disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), suggesting its role as a favorable prognostic marker. KLK13 negativity is associated with larger and more aggressive tumors, indicating that its expression could help identify tumors with relatively good differentiation grades (Konstantoudakis2010Kallikreinrelated).

In contrast, high KLK13 expression in ovarian cancer is linked to poor prognosis, with patients exhibiting shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS). This suggests that KLK13 could serve as a marker to distinguish between high- and low-grade endometrioid cancers (White2009KLK6). In breast cancer, higher KLK13 expression is associated with improved DFS and OS, particularly in certain subgroups, making it an independent favorable prognostic marker (Chang2002Human).

KLK13 expression is also significant in bladder cancer, where reduced expression correlates with aggressive disease characteristics and a higher risk of recurrence in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (Tokas2016Downregulated).

## Interactions
KLK13, a serine protease, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It acts as a priming protease for the human coronavirus HCoV-HKU1 by cleaving the viral spike (S) protein at the S1/S2 site, which is crucial for viral entry into host cells. This interaction is essential for the activation of the S protein, facilitating the virus's ability to infect previously resistant cells (Milewska2020Kallikrein).

KLK13 is also inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor of Kazal-type 6 (SPINK6), which has a strong affinity for KLK13. A molar ratio of 1:2.5 (KLK13 to SPINK6) can inhibit 85% of KLK13's enzymatic activity, indicating a significant inhibitory interaction (Kantyka2011Inhibition).

In the context of cancer, KLK13 is predicted to be targeted by 15 microRNAs (miRNAs), suggesting a substantial level of post-transcriptional regulation. These miRNAs are often dysregulated in cancer, indicating a potential role in cancer pathogenesis (Chow2008Kallikreins). These interactions highlight KLK13's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including viral infections and cancer.
