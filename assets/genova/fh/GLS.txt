# GLS

## Overview
The GLS gene encodes the enzyme glutaminase, which plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of glutamine to glutamate. This enzyme is categorized as a metabolic enzyme and is crucial for various physiological processes, including nitrogen metabolism, energy production, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Glutaminase is predominantly active in the mitochondria, where it supports cell growth and proliferation by providing glutamate for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and other biosynthetic pathways (MOCK1989A). The gene produces different isoforms, such as KGA and GAC, through alternative splicing, which affects the enzyme's stability and activity (Li2017Serial). Additionally, GLS2, a liver-type isozyme of glutaminase, is involved in maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress, highlighting its role in cellular antioxidant defense (Suzuki2010Phosphateactivated). The regulation and expression of GLS have significant implications in various diseases, including cancer, where its overexpression is associated with tumor growth and poor prognosis (Saha2019Multiomics).

## Structure
The human GLS (glutaminase) protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary elements. The primary structure consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure is composed of alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function (DeLaBarre2011FullLength).

The tertiary structure of GLS involves a three-dimensional arrangement that is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This structure includes an extended α helical domain, which contains the catalytic core of the molecule and is essential for stabilizing the protein's conformation (DeLaBarre2011FullLength). The quaternary structure of GLS is typically a homotetramer, meaning it forms a complex of four identical subunits, which is important for its enzymatic function (DeLaBarre2011FullLength).

GLS also exists in different isoforms, such as KGA and GAC, which are generated through alternative splicing. These isoforms share the same N-terminal sequence but differ in their C-terminal regions, affecting their stability and activity (Li2017Serial). The protein's structure is further influenced by specific domains and post-translational modifications, which regulate its activity and interaction with other molecules (DeLaBarre2011FullLength).

## Function
The GLS gene encodes glutaminase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, a critical step in cellular metabolism. This process is essential for various physiological functions, including nitrogen metabolism, energy production, and neurotransmitter synthesis. In healthy human cells, GLS is active in the mitochondria, where it supports cell growth and proliferation by providing glutamate for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and biosynthetic pathways (MOCK1989A).

GLS2, a liver-type isozyme of glutaminase, is involved in maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting against oxidative stress. It is a p53-inducible gene that plays a significant role in glutamine metabolism and the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. GLS2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to produce glutamate and ammonia, contributing to glutathione (GSH) synthesis, which is crucial for cellular antioxidant defense (Suzuki2010Phosphateactivated).

GLS2 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it is involved in neuronal differentiation and energy metabolism. It enhances neurite outgrowth and influences intracellular ATP levels, indicating its role in neuronal differentiation and neurotransmitter synthesis (Velletri2013GLS2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GLS gene have significant clinical implications. A de novo missense variant, Ser482Cys, in the GLS gene leads to hyperactivity of the enzyme, resulting in increased conversion of glutamine to glutamate. This hyperactivity is associated with conditions such as infantile cataract, profound developmental delay, and intracerebral glutamate excess. The elevated glutamate levels contribute to neurotoxicity and developmental delays, while the reduced capacity to detoxify reactive oxygen species is linked to cataract formation (Rumping2018GLS).

In cancer, GLS is frequently overexpressed, supporting tumor growth by providing energy and biosynthetic precursors. High GLS expression is linked to poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast, blood, soft tissue, and ovarian cancers. The differential expression of GLS and its liver-type counterpart, GLS2, plays a role in cancer progression and patient outcomes, with complex interactions affecting overall survival (Saha2019Multiomics).

In liver cancer, a switch from GLS2 to GLS expression is observed, promoting tumorigenesis and progression. Inhibition of GLS using specific inhibitors like BPTES and CB-839 has shown potential in reducing tumor growth and improving survival in preclinical models (Xiang2015Targeted).

## Interactions
GLS (glutaminase) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. It interacts with proteins involved in metabolic pathways and cellular signaling, forming part of multiprotein complexes. In the mammalian brain, GLS interacts with the glutaminase-interacting protein (GIP), a PDZ domain protein, which is found in neurons and astrocytes. This interaction suggests a role for GIP as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions with glutaminase in cellular processes (Olalla2007Expression).

GLS is also involved in the formation of filaments, which are crucial for its activation and function in mitophagy protection. These filaments are associated with maintaining mitochondrial structure and function, particularly under conditions of glutamine depletion. The filamentation process is independent of GLS's catalytic activity, indicating a structural role in cellular dynamics (Adamoski2023Molecular).

In cancer, GLS activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. For instance, phosphorylation at specific serine residues can either increase or decrease GLS activity, affecting cancer cell growth and metabolism (Masisi2020The). These interactions and modifications highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing GLS activity in different cellular contexts.
