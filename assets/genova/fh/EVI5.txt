# EVI5

## Overview
The EVI5 gene encodes the ecotropic viral integration site 5 protein, which is a member of the Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) protein family. This protein is characterized by its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, specifically targeting Rab11, a small GTPase involved in vesicular trafficking and endosome recycling (Soltani2024Drosophila; Laflamme2012Evi5). The EVI5 protein plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis, by stabilizing key regulatory proteins and facilitating cytokinesis (Didonna2015A). Additionally, EVI5 is implicated in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport and collective cell migration, through its interactions with other proteins (Laflamme2012Evi5). Clinically, EVI5 is associated with multiple sclerosis and certain cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, where it influences disease progression through its regulatory functions (Didonna2015A; Cai2020EVI5).

## Structure
The EVI5 gene encodes a protein that is 810 amino acids long and is part of the Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) protein family. This protein features a TBC domain located in its N-terminus, spanning amino acids 160-371, which is involved in GTPase-activating protein (GAP) catalytic activity, specifically modulating Rab11 functions (Didonna2015A). The C-terminal half of the EVI5 protein contains a large coiled-coil (CC) region from amino acids 404-714, which is homologous to CC regions found in myosin and ATPases of the structural maintenance of chromosomes family. This domain is implicated in specific protein-protein interactions (Didonna2015A).

The EVI5 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may regulate its activity (Mao2020The). The protein is also known to interact with Rab11, acting as a Rab11-GTPase-activating protein, which plays a crucial role in vesicle trafficking and endosome recycling (Soltani2024Drosophila; Laflamme2012Evi5). The EVI5 protein's structure and interactions are significant in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and intracellular transport.

## Function
The EVI5 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. It is a member of the Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) protein family, characterized by a TBC domain at its N-terminus and a coiled-coil (CC) region in its C-terminal half (Didonna2015A). EVI5 is involved in modulating the cell cycle by stabilizing the anaphase-promoting complex inhibitor Emi1 during early mitosis, which is crucial for proper cyclin accumulation. In late mitosis, EVI5 is essential for the completion of cytokinesis (Didonna2015A).

EVI5 also functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab11, a small GTPase involved in vesicular trafficking. This interaction is critical for regulating Rab11 activity, as EVI5 promotes the inactivation of Rab11 by accelerating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP (Laflamme2012Evi5). EVI5's GAP activity is crucial for processes such as collective cell migration, where it helps maintain active receptor tyrosine kinases at the leading edge of migrating cells (Laflamme2012Evi5). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it is recruited to Rab11-positive vesicles, indicating its role in endosomal trafficking (Laflamme2012Evi5).

## Clinical Significance
The EVI5 gene is implicated in several diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within EVI5, specifically the Q612H polymorphism, is associated with increased disease risk. This SNP affects the EVI5 interactome, potentially altering protein-protein interactions and influencing MS pathogenesis (Didonna2015A).

EVI5 is also identified as an oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Overexpression of EVI5 enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its knockdown reduces tumor growth and metastasis. EVI5 influences NSCLC progression through the regulation of cell cycle proteins and the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, which is crucial for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Cai2020EVI5).

In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), EVI5 stabilizes the c-Myc protein by preventing its degradation, promoting cancer cell proliferation. This stabilization is mediated through the interaction with the E3 ligase FBXW7, highlighting EVI5 as a potential therapeutic target in LSCC (Mao2020The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of EVI5 in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
The EVI5 protein interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. EVI5 is known to interact with Rab11, a small GTPase involved in vesicular trafficking. This interaction is specific to the GTP-bound form of Rab11, as demonstrated by coexpression experiments where EVI5 was efficiently pulled down with the constitutively active form of Rab11. EVI5 acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab11, promoting GTP hydrolysis and inactivating Rab11, which affects the distribution and size of structures containing Rab11 effectors like Sec15 and Rip11 (Laflamme2012Evi5).

In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), a non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in EVI5 affects its interactome, leading to a novel interaction with SGPL1, a protein involved in the sphingosine-1 phosphate pathway. This interaction is significant for immune cell trafficking and MS pathogenesis (Didonna2015A). EVI5 also interacts with proteins involved in intracellular iron transport, such as ferritin, suggesting a role in iron metabolism and potentially linking EVI5 to MS pathology through altered iron homeostasis (Soltani2024Drosophila).
