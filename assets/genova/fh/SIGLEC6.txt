# SIGLEC6

## Overview
SIGLEC6 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 6, a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family. This protein functions primarily as an immunomodulatory receptor, playing a crucial role in immune regulation and cell-cell interactions. It is predominantly expressed on mast cells, memory B cells, and certain placental cells, where it modulates immune responses through inhibitory mechanisms. The protein's structure includes a unique glycolipid binding pocket, allowing it to interact with glycolipids independently of the canonical arginine residue typically required for sialic acid recognition. SIGLEC6's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, such as allergic responses, placental development, and certain cancers, underscores its significance in both health and disease (Rumer2012Siglec6; Schmidt2023Siglec6; Schanin2022Discovery).

## Structure
Siglec-6 is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family, characterized by its unique molecular structure. The protein features an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like folds, specifically comprising a V-set domain and a C2 domain. These domains are crucial for its function, as they form a noncanonical glycolipid binding pocket that allows Siglec-6 to interact with glycolipids independently of the canonical arginine residue typically essential for sialic acid recognition (Schmidt2023Siglec6).

The tertiary structure of Siglec-6 includes an extended conformation with a disulfide bridge between the V-set and C2 domains, which is vital for its binding function. Mutations in the cysteine residues forming this bridge disrupt binding, underscoring its structural importance (Schmidt2023Siglec6). The protein's ability to bind glycolipids is also influenced by specific arginine residues in the V-set domain, with mutations in these residues leading to reduced binding affinity (Schmidt2023Siglec6).

Siglec-6 is expressed on various human cells, including mast cells, memory B-cells, and placental syncytiotrophoblasts, and is involved in the uptake of extracellular vesicles through its glycolipid binding pocket (Schmidt2023Siglec6).

## Function
SIGLEC6 is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family, which are involved in immune regulation and cell-cell interactions. In healthy human cells, SIGLEC6 is primarily expressed on mast cells, certain populations of trophoblasts, and memory B cells. It plays a significant role in modulating immune responses through its inhibitory functions (Schanin2022Discovery).

On mast cells, SIGLEC6 acts as an immunomodulatory receptor, inhibiting mast cell activation and degranulation. This inhibition is mediated through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which recruit inhibitory phosphatases such as Shp-1 and Shp-2, leading to reduced production of soluble mediators like tryptase and IL-8 (Yu2018Functional; Schanin2022Discovery). This function is crucial in controlling allergic and inflammatory responses.

In the placenta, SIGLEC6 is expressed on trophoblasts and is involved in regulating trophoblastic proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion, processes essential for placental development and function. Its expression is highest in early gestation and decreases as gestation progresses, suggesting a role in early placental development (Rumer2012Siglec6; Lin2021Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the SIGLEC6 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), SIGLEC6 expression is significantly higher in complete molar placentas compared to normal placentas, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker. The gene's expression in choriocarcinoma-derived cells promotes proliferation and invasion while protecting against apoptosis, indicating a role in the pathogenesis of GTD (Rumer2012Siglec6).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), SIGLEC6 is upregulated in mast cells within the tumor microenvironment. This upregulation is induced by colon cancer cells and hypoxic conditions, suggesting that SIGLEC6 may modulate immune responses in CRC. The receptor's engagement reduces IgE-dependent degranulation and GM-CSF production, highlighting its inhibitory role in immune regulation (Yu2018Functional).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SIGLEC6 is overexpressed on CLL cells and interacts with the ligand sialyl Tn, promoting cell migration and adhesion. This interaction is crucial for the activation of pathways involved in cell movement, making SIGLEC6 a potential therapeutic target. Blocking SIGLEC6 with specific antibodies has shown promise in reducing CLL cell migration and adhesion, suggesting its role in disease progression (Nunes2024Siglec6).

## Interactions
SIGLEC6, a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin family, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with the phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, which are essential for its inhibitory role in mast cells. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of SIGLEC6 at its ITIM and ITIM-like motifs, as demonstrated by studies using wild-type and mutant constructs of SIGLEC6 in mouse bone marrow mast cells (Schanin2022Discovery). 

In the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SIGLEC6 interacts with DOCK8, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. This interaction is part of a signaling pathway that involves the activation of Cdc42 and recruitment of the WASP protein, leading to actin polymerization and cell migration. The interaction between SIGLEC6 and DOCK8 is mediated by the binding of SIGLEC6 to its ligand, sialyl Tn (sTn), which is overexpressed in CLL cells (Nunes2024Siglec6).

SIGLEC6 also binds to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can modulate its function. For instance, the mAb AK04 requires Fcγ receptor interaction for SIGLEC6 internalization and mast cell inhibition, highlighting the importance of epitope-specific interactions (Schanin2022Discovery).
