# RBM18

## Overview
RBM18 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 18, which is involved in various cellular processes related to RNA metabolism. The protein is characterized by its RNA-binding domain, which allows it to interact with RNA molecules and participate in the regulation of RNA splicing, stability, and transport. As a member of the RNA-binding protein family, RBM18 plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene regulation, influencing the expression of numerous genes. Its function is essential for maintaining normal cellular activities and has been implicated in several biological pathways and disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
