# LARP4

## Overview
LARP4 (La-related protein 4) is a gene that encodes the La ribonucleoprotein 4, an RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA stability and translation. The protein is characterized by a conserved La motif (LaM) and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which facilitate its interaction with RNA molecules (Yang2011La-Related). LARP4 is distinct within the La-related protein family due to its unique variant PAM2w motif, which allows it to interact with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), playing a crucial role in mRNA metabolism (Yang2011La-Related). This protein is primarily cytoplasmic and associates with ribosomal subunits, indicating its involvement in translation initiation (Yang2011La-Related). Beyond its role in mRNA regulation, LARP4 is essential for mitochondrial function, as it binds to nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs, promoting mitochondrial translation and cellular respiration (Lewis2023LARP4). Alterations in LARP4 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and immune dysregulation, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular health (Seetharaman2016The; Tian2020Transcriptomewide).

## Structure
The LARP4 protein is characterized by a conserved La motif (LaM) and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which are integral to its RNA-binding capabilities (Yang2011La-Related). The LaM and RRM are part of the La module, a central RNA-binding unit conserved across the LARP family (Cruz-Gallardo2019LARP4A). The LaM and RRM domains are independently folded globular domains connected by a flexible linker, allowing for dynamic conformational changes in solution (Cruz-Gallardo2019LARP4A). The LaM domain in LARP4 diverges from other La proteins, lacking key side chains necessary for canonical UUU-3'OH recognition, which suggests distinct RNA targets and functions (Bayfield2010Conserved).

LARP4 also contains a variant PAM2 motif, known as PAM2w, which includes a tryptophan residue instead of the typical phenylalanine. This motif is crucial for interactions with the MLLE domain of the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), playing a significant role in mRNA stability and translation (Yang2011La-Related). The protein is cytoplasmic and associated with polysomes and 40S ribosome subunits, indicating its involvement in translation initiation (Yang2011La-Related). The structural arrangement of the LaM-RRM domain is conserved among La-related proteins, although the specific contributions to RNA binding may vary (Bayfield2010Conserved).

## Function
LARP4 (La ribonucleoprotein 4) is an RNA-binding protein that plays a significant role in mRNA stability and translation in healthy human cells. It binds to poly(A) tails of mRNAs and interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) through a unique variant PAM2w motif, which is crucial for its function in promoting mRNA stability and translation (Yang2011La-Related). LARP4 is associated with the 40S ribosomal subunits and polyribosomes, indicating its involvement in translation initiation and mRNA stability (Yang2011La-Related).

In addition to its role in mRNA metabolism, LARP4 is essential for mitochondrial function. It binds to nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs, promoting mitochondrial translation and maintaining the levels of mitochondrial ribosome proteins and oxidative phosphorylation proteins. This activity is vital for proper mitochondrial gene expression and cellular respiration (Lewis2023LARP4). The protein's function is linked to its ability to stabilize polysomes and maintain poly(A) tail length across the transcriptome, supporting efficient expression and function of mitochondrial proteins (Lewis2023LARP4). LARP4's activities are crucial for normal cell proliferation and protein translation rates, impacting overall cellular health and function (Lewis2023LARP4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LARP4 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. LARP4 is involved in regulating cancer cell morphology, migration, and invasion. Depletion of LARP4 in cancer cells, such as MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cells, leads to an elongated cell phenotype and increased invasion, suggesting that LARP4 normally suppresses these processes (Seetharaman2016The). Certain mutations in LARP4, particularly in the C-terminal region, have been shown to enhance cell circularity and reduce cell migration and invasion, potentially impacting cancer cell behavior (Seetharaman2016The).

LARP4 also plays a role in mitochondrial function by binding to nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs, which is crucial for maintaining normal cell proliferation rates. Loss of LARP4 leads to reduced cell proliferation and translation rates, which can be reversed by re-expressing LARP4, indicating its essential role in these processes (Lewis2023LARP4). Additionally, LARP4 is involved in the stabilization of NFκB1 mRNA during T cell activation, influencing immune response regulation. In Larp4 knockout mice, reduced levels of NFκB1 mRNA and cytokines such as IL2 and IFNγ have been observed, highlighting its role in immune function (Tian2020Transcriptomewide). These findings suggest that alterations in LARP4 expression or function could contribute to diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and immune dysregulation.

## Interactions
LARP4 (La ribonucleoprotein 4) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in mRNA metabolism and translation regulation. LARP4 interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) through a variant PAM2 motif known as PAM2w. This interaction is essential for LARP4's function in stabilizing mRNAs and promoting translation, as it associates with polysomes and stress granules under certain conditions (Yang2011La-Related). The interaction between LARP4 and PABP is facilitated by hydrophobic contacts, with a notable substitution of tryptophan in the PAM2w motif, which is accommodated by the MLLE domain of PABP (Yang2011La-Related).

LARP4 also interacts with RACK1, a protein associated with the 40S ribosomal subunit and mRNA, suggesting its involvement in translation processes. This interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Yang2011La-Related). Additionally, LARP4 has been shown to interact with Filamin A (FLNA), an actin cross-linking protein, which plays a role in regulating cell migration. This interaction occurs at the mechanosensing domain of FLNA and is involved in cell morphogenesis and migration (Mao2023Interaction).
