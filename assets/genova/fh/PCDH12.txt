# PCDH12

## Overview
PCDH12 is a gene that encodes the protein protocadherin 12, a member of the protocadherin family within the cadherin superfamily. Protocadherin 12 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its six extracellular cadherin domains, which facilitate calcium-dependent cell adhesion, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. Unlike many other cadherins, protocadherin 12 does not interact with catenins, indicating a unique signaling mechanism. The protein is primarily expressed in vascularized tissues, including the placenta, and plays a significant role in neurodevelopmental processes such as neuronal maturation and migration. Mutations in the PCDH12 gene are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including diencephalic-mesencephalic junction dysplasia syndrome, and are associated with a range of neurological and ophthalmic phenotypes (Philibert2012Protocadherin12; Wu2000Large; Rakotomamonjy2023Impaired).

## Structure
The PCDH12 protein is a member of the protocadherin family, characterized by its structure that includes six extracellular cadherin domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Guemez‐Gamboa2018Loss; Wu2000Large). The primary structure of PCDH12 consists of 1,184 amino acids (Wu2000Large). The protein's extracellular region is composed of repeated ectodomains, known as cadherin motifs, which are involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion (Nicolas2017Brain; Philibert2012Protocadherin12).

The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets typical of cadherin domains, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to facilitate homophilic interactions, which are crucial for its role in cell adhesion (Harrison2020Familywide). PCDH12 does not interact with catenins, which is unusual for cadherins, suggesting a unique cytoplasmic signaling mechanism (Philibert2012Protocadherin12).

Post-translational modifications of PCDH12 may include glycosylation, as it is a glycoprotein, although specific sites are not detailed in the context (Guemez‐Gamboa2018Loss). The protein is expressed in various vascularized tissues but not in the brain, indicating tissue-specific expression patterns (Philibert2012Protocadherin12).

## Function
Protocadherin-12 (PCDH12) is a member of the cadherin superfamily, primarily involved in cell adhesion and migration. In healthy human cells, PCDH12 plays a crucial role in neurodevelopmental processes, including neuronal maturation, dendritic arbor formation, axon pathfinding, and synaptic plasticity. It is part of the δ2 subgroup of non-clustered protocadherins and contains six extracellular cadherin domains that facilitate homophilic interactions, which are essential for its function in cell adhesion (Rakotomamonjy2023Impaired).

PCDH12 is involved in regulating actin polymerization through its intracellular tail, which includes the WAVE Regulatory Complex (WRC) interacting receptor sequence (WIRS). This interaction is crucial for maintaining actin turnover and proper neuronal migration, ensuring the correct balance between polymerization and depolymerization of actin, which is vital for neurogenesis (Rakotomamonjy2023Impaired).

The protein is also implicated in maintaining a balance between progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Its loss leads to premature neuronal differentiation and impaired migration, as evidenced by abnormal lamination in cerebral organoids and conditions such as microcephaly and epilepsy (Rakotomamonjy2023Impaired). PCDH12 is expressed in various tissues, including the placenta, where it is highly expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts, suggesting a role in placental development (Bouillot2011Protocadherin12).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCDH12 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in PCDH12 have been linked to diencephalic-mesencephalic junction dysplasia syndrome (DMJD), characterized by developmental delay, microcephaly, spasticity, and distinctive brain malformations (Guemez‐Gamboa2018Loss; ÜrelDemir2024Many). Patients with DMJD often exhibit brainstem malformations, including a 'butterfly' sign on MRI, and defects in white matter tracts, such as a thinned corpus callosum (Guemez‐Gamboa2018Loss). 

PCDH12 mutations are also implicated in cerebral palsy, cerebellar ataxia, and microcephaly, with affected individuals showing a range of neurological symptoms, including intellectual disability, speech impairment, seizures, and psychomotor delays (Rakotomamonjy2023Impaired). Brain imaging in these cases often reveals brainstem malformations, white matter abnormalities, and brain calcifications (Nicolas2017Brain; Rakotomamonjy2023Impaired).

Additionally, PCDH12 variants have been associated with ophthalmic phenotypes, such as exudative vitreoretinopathy, suggesting that eye abnormalities may be part of the clinical spectrum of PCDH12-related disorders (Mattioli2021Ophthalmic). The gene's role in neuronal migration and differentiation is crucial, and its dysfunction can lead to significant developmental and neurological disorders (Rakotomamonjy2023Impaired).

## Interactions
Protocadherin 12 (PCDH12) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role in cell adhesion. PCDH12 is known to engage in homophilic interactions, forming dimers with a dissociation constant (K D) of 5.4 mM, indicating a moderate affinity for homodimerization (Harrison2020Familywide). This homophilic binding is a characteristic feature of protocadherins, which typically bind to the same type of protocadherin on adjacent cells.

PCDH12 does not interact with β-catenin, a protein that is known to interact with other protocadherins such as PCDH10 and PCDH17 (de2024Proteomic). This lack of interaction with β-catenin suggests that PCDH12 may have distinct functional roles compared to other protocadherins that participate in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

In terms of heterophilic interactions, PCDH12 has shown binding to PCDH17 and PCDH18 in both orientations of analyte and surface, although these interactions are relatively weak and close to the limits of detection (Harrison2020Familywide). This suggests that while PCDH12 can engage in interactions with other protocadherins, these are not as strong or prevalent as its homophilic interactions.
