# TMEM260

## Overview
TMEM260 is a gene located on chromosome 14 that encodes the transmembrane protein 260, a protein characterized by its eight transmembrane spans and involvement in cellular adhesion and signaling processes. The protein is notable for its enzyme-active domain, the protein O-mannosyl-transferase TMEM260-like domain, which plays a role in transferring mannose to the PLEXIN family, and a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain crucial for substrate recognition and cardiac development (Inoue2024The). Mutations in the TMEM260 gene have been implicated in congenital disorders, particularly affecting the heart and kidneys, and are associated with conditions such as persistent truncus arteriosus and structural heart defects and renal anomalies syndrome (SHDRA) (Inoue2024The; Pagnamenta2021Biallelic). Despite its recognized clinical significance, the full molecular architecture and functional roles of TMEM260 remain subjects of ongoing research (Peng2023A).

## Structure
The TMEM260 protein is a transmembrane protein encoded by the TMEM260 gene, located on chromosome 14. It consists of 707 amino acids and is characterized by having eight transmembrane spans (Inoue2024The; Pagnamenta2021Biallelic). The protein includes an enzyme-active domain known as the protein O-mannosyl-transferase TMEM260-like domain, located in the N-terminal transmembrane region, spanning amino acids 52 to 211. This domain is biologically active in transferring mannose to the PLEXIN family (Inoue2024The).

The C-terminal region of TMEM260, starting from amino acid 539, includes a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which is crucial for substrate recognition and cardiac outflow tract development. Truncation of this region, as seen in certain genetic variants, is associated with congenital heart diseases such as persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) (Inoue2024The).

The TMEM260 protein is primarily located in the nucleoplasm and within focal adhesion sites, indicating its potential involvement in cellular adhesion and signaling processes (Pagnamenta2021Biallelic). The structure and function of TMEM260 are not fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its complete molecular architecture and role in human health (Peng2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM260 gene are associated with several congenital disorders, particularly affecting the heart and kidneys. The c.1617del variant of TMEM260 is a significant genetic determinant for persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA), a severe form of congenital heart disease, in the Japanese population. This variant results in a frameshift mutation, leading to a truncated protein that lacks a functional domain, specifically the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) region, and is suggested to act in an autosomal recessive manner (Inoue2024The). The c.1617del variant is also associated with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) and is considered a major genetic cause of PTA in Japanese patients, second only to the 22q11.2 deletion (Inoue2024The).

TMEM260 mutations are linked to structural heart defects and renal anomalies syndrome (SHDRA), characterized by congenital cardiac malformations and variable renal phenotypes (Pagnamenta2021Biallelic). Additionally, a novel homozygous mutation in TMEM260 has been associated with both cardiac malformations and neurodevelopmental abnormalities, indicating its role in broader developmental processes (Peng2023A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TMEM260 mutations in contributing to congenital heart defects and other developmental disorders.
