# GRIN2D

## Overview
The GRIN2D gene encodes the GluN2D subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor that plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. The GluN2D subunit is a transmembrane protein that contributes to the formation of NMDA receptor complexes, which are essential for excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain (Hansen2021Structure; Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D). These receptors are characterized by their unique electrophysiological properties, including high potency for glutamate and glycine, reduced sensitivity to magnesium block, and prolonged deactivation time, which are important for sustaining synaptic activity and neuronal communication (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D). The expression of GluN2D is widespread in the early stages of development and becomes more restricted to specific neuronal populations, such as GABAergic interneurons, as the brain matures (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D). Mutations in the GRIN2D gene have been implicated in developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D; XiangWei2019Heterogeneous).

## Structure
The GRIN2D gene encodes the GluN2D subunit of the NMDA receptor, a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor. The protein is composed of 1,336 amino acids and shares significant sequence homology with other NMDA receptor subunits, such as GluN2C, GluN2A, and GluN2B (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D). The GluN2D subunit features several key domains, including the extracellular agonist-binding domain (ABD), the transmembrane domain (TMD), and the intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD) (Hansen2021Structure; Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D).

The TMD consists of three transmembrane helices (M1, M3, and M4) and a membrane reentrant loop (M2), forming the ion channel core (Hansen2021Structure). The M3 domain is particularly important for channel gating and includes the SYTANLAAF motif, which controls channel opening (Li2016GRIN2D). The CTD is involved in receptor localization and regulation, interacting with various intracellular proteins and participating in trafficking and synaptic plasticity (Hansen2021Structure).

The GluN2D subunit can form diheteromeric and triheteromeric complexes with other GluN2 subunits, influencing receptor characteristics and function (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affect its function and interactions (Hansen2021Structure).

## Function
The GRIN2D gene encodes the GluN2D subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is a critical component of ionotropic glutamate receptors involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. In healthy human cells, the GluN2D subunit is expressed throughout the brain and plays a significant role in regulating inhibitory tone via GABAergic interneurons, contributing to the maintenance of inhibitory control in neural circuits (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D). The GluN2D subunit is involved in synaptic transmission in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, with its expression becoming more restricted to GABAergic interneurons as development progresses (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D).

GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors exhibit unique electrophysiological properties, such as high potency for glutamate and glycine, reduced sensitivity to magnesium block, and prolonged deactivation time, which allows them to sustain depolarization and potentially initiate burst-firing (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D). These receptors are involved in modulating synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability, contributing to the regulation of synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission across multiple brain regions (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D). The widespread early expression and later cell-type specificity of GluN2D indicate its potential importance in neuronal maturation and circuit function (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRIN2D gene, which encodes the GluN2D subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), are associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. DEE is characterized by intractable epilepsy, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and other neurological symptoms (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D; XiangWei2019Heterogeneous). Patients with GRIN2D variants often exhibit multiple seizure types and are largely refractory to conventional anti-epileptic drug treatment (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D). 

The GRIN2D gene has been linked to various missense mutations, such as the recurrent de novo mutation c.1999G>A (p.Val667Ile), which results in a gain-of-function effect by increasing the open probability of the NMDA receptor channel. This mutation is associated with severe epileptic encephalopathy and is treatable with NMDA receptor channel blockers (Li2016GRIN2D). 

Functional analysis of GRIN2D variants has shown both loss-of-function and gain-of-function changes, indicating their potential pathogenic roles in DEE (XiangWei2019Heterogeneous). The GRIN2D gene is less studied compared to other GRIN genes, despite its significant association with epilepsy (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D).

## Interactions
The GRIN2D gene encodes the GluN2D subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity. This subunit is part of the NMDAR complexes that include other subunits such as GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B, forming diheteromeric or triheteromeric complexes. These complexes are crucial for modulating synaptic responses and are involved in excitatory synaptic transmission, particularly in hippocampal interneurons (Perszyk2016GluN2DContaining).

GRIN2D is also associated with postsynaptic density (PSD) scaffolding complexes, interacting with proteins like Dlg4 and Dlgap1. These complexes contain NMDAR subunits, including GRIN2D, and are involved in synaptic signaling pathways. The interactions within these complexes are mediated by domains such as GKAP, GuKc, and PDZ, which facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes at synaptic sites (Li2017Spatiotemporal).

Although specific physical interactions of GRIN2D with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, the gene's role in forming receptor complexes and its involvement in synaptic functioning suggest its participation in complex protein-protein interactions that are essential for neuronal communication and plasticity (Camp2020GRIN2DGluN2D).
