# DEFB103A

## Overview
DEFB103A is a gene that encodes the protein human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3), a small antimicrobial peptide that plays a significant role in the innate immune system. This peptide is categorized as an antimicrobial protein due to its broad-spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The DEFB103A gene is located on chromosome 8p23.1, a region known for its copy-number variability, which can affect the expression levels of hBD-3 (Hardwick2011A). The protein is primarily expressed in epithelial cells and contributes to skin and mucosal immunity by disrupting microbial membranes. Beyond its antimicrobial properties, hBD-3 is involved in immunomodulation, influencing the production of chemokines and cytokines, and playing a role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Harvey2013Defensin). The gene's expression and function have clinical significance, with implications for conditions such as iatrogenic tracheal stenosis and potential links to inflammatory diseases (Martins2024Identifying; Semple2011Human).

## Structure
The DEFB103A gene encodes the human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3), a small antimicrobial peptide known for its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The primary structure of hBD-3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a peptide chain, which includes a conserved six-cysteine motif crucial for its function (Semple2003Duplication). The secondary structure of hBD-3 typically includes beta-sheets, which are stabilized by disulfide bonds formed between the cysteine residues. These disulfide bonds are essential for maintaining the stability and antimicrobial activity of the peptide (Semple2003Duplication).

The tertiary structure of hBD-3 involves the folding of these beta-sheets into a compact, stable form, allowing the peptide to interact effectively with microbial membranes. The quaternary structure is not applicable to hBD-3, as it functions as a monomer. Common post-translational modifications include the formation of disulfide bonds, which are critical for the peptide's stability and function (Hollox2008Directional). The gene is located in a copy-number variable region on chromosome 8p23.1, which can influence the expression levels of the peptide (Hardwick2011A).

## Function
DEFB103A encodes human beta-defensin 3 (hBD3), a multifunctional peptide involved in the innate immune response. This protein is primarily expressed in epithelial cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining skin and mucosal immunity by providing a barrier against pathogens. hBD3 exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, effectively disrupting microbial membranes to defend against bacteria, fungi, and viruses (Hardwick2011A; Shelley2020The).

In addition to its antimicrobial properties, hBD3 has significant immunomodulatory functions. It can modulate immune responses by influencing the production of chemokines and cytokines in human myeloid dendritic cells. DEFB103A can both enhance and attenuate these responses, depending on the context, which suggests a role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Harvey2013Defensin). This bidirectional regulation is crucial for balancing immune responses, particularly in mucosal areas exposed to numerous antigens (Harvey2013Defensin).

hBD3 also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6, contributing to the resolution of inflammation and preventing tissue damage (Semple2010Human). This dual role in antimicrobial defense and inflammation resolution highlights its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Semple2010Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DEFB103A gene, which encodes human beta-defensin 3 (hBD3), have been implicated in various clinical conditions. Increased expression of DEFB103A has been observed in iatrogenic tracheal stenosis (ITS), where it is significantly upregulated, promoting inflammation as part of the antimicrobial response. This suggests that DEFB103A could be a potential therapeutic target in ITS, with retinoic acid identified as a possible regulator of its expression (Martins2024Identifying).

DEFB103A also plays a role in modulating inflammatory pathways, particularly through its interaction with Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. It inhibits MyD88 and TRIF-dependent pathways, reducing the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes such as IL-6 and TNF-a. This modulation of immune responses suggests that variations in DEFB103A expression could influence susceptibility to inflammation-related diseases (Semple2011Human).

The gene's copy number variation has been linked to disease susceptibility, with high-expression copies potentially selected for increased resistance to infectious diseases like influenza. However, associations with conditions such as psoriasis and Crohn's disease have been inconsistent (Hardwick2011A).

## Interactions
DEFB103A, also known as human β-defensin 3 (hBD3), is involved in various interactions with proteins that modulate immune responses. It interacts with Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, specifically affecting MyD88 and TRIF pathways, which are crucial for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. hBD3 inhibits these pathways, leading to reduced NF-κB activation and subsequent inflammatory gene transcription (Semple2011Human). 

hBD3 does not bind directly to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but instead targets components of the TLR pathways, potentially binding to TLR4 and preventing its interaction with LPS. This interaction suggests that hBD3 acts between LPS-TLR4 receptor binding and transcription factor activation (Semple2011Human). 

In addition to its role in TLR signaling, DEFB103A interacts with G-protein coupled receptors such as CCR2B and CCR6, which are involved in modulating cytokine production. These interactions highlight its bidirectional regulatory role in immune responses, where it can either enhance or attenuate chemokine and cytokine responses depending on the context (Harvey2013Defensin).
