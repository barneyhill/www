# VPS16

## Overview
VPS16 is a gene that encodes the VPS16 core subunit of the CORVET and HOPS complexes, which are integral to endosomal and lysosomal trafficking in eukaryotic cells. The VPS16 protein is a soluble component that plays a pivotal role in vesicle tethering and fusion, particularly in the fusion of endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes. This process is essential for cellular homeostasis, as it facilitates the degradation and recycling of cellular components. The protein is characterized by a C-terminal domain that interacts with other proteins, such as VPS33A, within the HOPS complex, enabling SNARE-mediated membrane fusion (Wartosch2015Recruitment; Graham2013Structural). Mutations in the VPS16 gene can lead to various neurological and systemic disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and neuronal function (Cai2016Homozygous; Steel2020Loss‐of‐Function).

## Structure
The human VPS16 protein is a core component of the CORVET and HOPS complexes, which are involved in endosomal and lysosomal trafficking. The VPS16 protein is composed of 839 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 94.7 kDa (Huizing2001Molecular). It does not contain any obvious protein motifs but is predicted to be soluble (Huizing2001Molecular). The protein structure includes a C-terminal domain (CTD) that is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as VPS33A, within the HOPS complex (Baker2013Crystal; Graham2013Structural).

The CTD of VPS16 features an irregular α-solenoid structure with 17 α-helices, similar to HEAT repeat proteins (Baker2013Crystal). This domain is divided into two regions, with notable irregularities such as the absence of an antiparallel helix after the long α10 helix (Baker2013Crystal). The interaction between VPS16 and VPS33A is mediated by specific residues, particularly those in the region 642-736, which form a series of antiparallel helices (Graham2013Structural). This interaction is essential for the recruitment of VPS33A to the HOPS complex, facilitating SNARE-mediated membrane fusion (Wartosch2015Recruitment; Graham2013Structural).

## Function
The VPS16 gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the HOPS complex, which is essential for the fusion of endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes in mammalian cells. This fusion process is crucial for cellular homeostasis, as it facilitates the degradation and recycling of cellular components (Wartosch2015Recruitment; Steel2020Loss‐of‐Function). VPS16 plays a critical role in recruiting VPS33A to the HOPS complex, a necessary step for SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. Mutations in VPS16 that disrupt its interaction with VPS33A result in impaired lysosome fusion, highlighting the importance of this interaction for normal cellular function (Wartosch2015Recruitment; Graham2013Structural).

In healthy human cells, VPS16 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in endosomes and lysosomes, where it contributes to the maturation of endosomes and the delivery of cargo to lysosomes (Graham2013Structural). The proper function of VPS16 is important for preventing the toxic accumulation of aberrant proteins, which is a protective mechanism against neurodegenerative processes (Steel2020Loss‐of‐Function). Its role in vesicle tethering and fusion is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and nutrient recycling (Wartosch2015Recruitment).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS16 gene are associated with various neurological and systemic disorders. Homozygous missense mutations in VPS16, such as c.156 C > A, have been linked to adolescent-onset primary dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions and abnormal postures. This mutation was identified in a Chinese consanguineous family and is associated with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (Cai2016Homozygous). Another study identified a homozygous missense variant, c.540G>T; p.Trp180Cys, in VPS16, which is associated with a novel disease resembling mucopolysaccharidosis-plus syndrome. This condition includes symptoms such as developmental delay, severe congenital neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy, indicating that different mutations in VPS16 can lead to distinct phenotypes (Yıldız2021Homozygous).

Loss-of-function variants in VPS16 have been implicated in early-onset dystonia, often associated with lysosomal abnormalities. These variants can result in haploinsufficiency and are linked to a dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance. Patients with these mutations may exhibit progressive dystonia affecting the cranio-cervical region and upper limbs, along with neuropsychiatric symptoms and intellectual disability (Steel2020Loss‐of‐Function). These findings underscore the critical role of VPS16 in maintaining normal neuronal and lysosomal function.

## Interactions
VPS16 is a core subunit of the HOPS complex, which is essential for membrane fusion events in eukaryotic cells, particularly in the fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes. VPS16 interacts specifically with VPS33A, another subunit of the HOPS complex. This interaction is mediated by residues 642-736 of VPS16, which form a structure of two long antiparallel helices connected by a loop to a bundle of three shorter helices. The interaction between VPS16 and VPS33A is crucial for the recruitment of VPS33A to the HOPS complex, facilitating SNARE-mediated membrane fusion (Graham2013Structural).

Mutations in VPS16, such as A669D or R725E, disrupt its interaction with VPS33A, preventing the recruitment of VPS33A to the HOPS complex and inhibiting lysosome fusion with endosomes and autophagosomes (Wartosch2015Recruitment; Graham2013Structural). VPS16 does not interact with VIPAR or VPS33B, indicating a specific role in the HOPS complex distinct from other related proteins (Wartosch2015Recruitment; Graham2013Structural). These interactions highlight the critical role of VPS16 in the assembly and function of the HOPS complex, necessary for proper endocytic and autophagic pathways.
