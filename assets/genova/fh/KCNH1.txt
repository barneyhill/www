# KCNH1

## Overview
The KCNH1 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 1, also known as Eag1 or Kv10.1, which is a crucial component of the ether-à-go-go family of voltage-gated potassium channels. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane structure, comprising six transmembrane domains and a pore-lining loop, and is essential for various cellular processes, including the regulation of membrane potential and ciliogenesis. KCNH1 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and plays a significant role in intracellular signaling pathways, such as the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, which are vital for morphogenesis and development (Napoli2022Potassium). Mutations in KCNH1 are linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including Zimmermann-Laband syndrome and Temple-Baraitser syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental and physiological processes (Kortüm2015Mutations; Gripp2021Syndromic).

## Structure
The KCNH1 gene encodes the Eag1/Kv10.1 protein, a member of the ether-à-go-go family of voltage-gated potassium channels. The protein exhibits a typical Kv membrane topology with six transmembrane domains (S1-S6) and a pore-lining loop between S5 and S6. The S1-S4 segments function as voltage sensor domains, while the S5 and S6 segments form the pore module (Kortüm2015Mutations). The assembly of four subunits is required to form a functional channel, indicating a quaternary structure (Kortüm2015Mutations).

The protein's structure includes an eag domain in the amino-terminal region, which contains a PAS domain and a PAS-cap domain. The carboxy-terminal region features a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD) connected to the pore through a C-linker domain. These domains are crucial for channel gating and regulation (Haitin2013The). The eag domain interacts with the CNBHD, influencing channel gating, and mutations in these regions can lead to diseases such as LQT2 and cancer (Haitin2013The).

KCNH1 has at least four splicing variants, including Kv10.1a and Kv10.1b, with the major form Kv10.1a having a shorter exon 6. These variants can affect the channel's function and expression (CázaresOrdoñez2017Kv10.1).

## Function
The KCNH1 gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, KCNH1 is involved in regulating the resting membrane potential, which is crucial for maintaining cellular excitability and homeostasis (Napoli2022Potassium). The protein is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and is localized at the plasma membrane, inner nuclear membrane, and intracellular vesicles (Napoli2022Potassium).

KCNH1 is essential for ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, and is involved in the assembly and disassembly dynamics of primary cilia. It is localized to the primary cilium during the G2/M transition, suggesting a role in cilium disassembly and cell proliferation (Napoli2022Potassium). The channel's activity influences membrane function or vesicle transport near the transition zone or ciliary pocket, which is essential for ciliogenesis (Napoli2022Potassium).

KCNH1 also plays a role in intracellular signaling pathways, such as the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway, which is important for morphogenesis and development (Napoli2022Potassium). The gene's function is associated with cell cycle coordination and signaling pathways related to primary cilia, contributing to cell proliferation and differentiation processes (Napoli2022Potassium).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNH1 gene are associated with several syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably Zimmermann-Laband syndrome (ZLS) and Temple-Baraitser syndrome (TBS). These conditions are characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, gingival enlargement, and hypertrichosis (Kortüm2015Mutations; Gripp2021Syndromic). The KCNH1 gene encodes the Eag1 (Kv10.1) channel, a member of the ether-à-go-go family of voltage-gated potassium channels, and mutations in this gene often result in a gain-of-function effect, leading to altered potassium current activation and increased potassium conductance (Kortüm2015Mutations; Gripp2021Syndromic).

The gain-of-function mutations in KCNH1 can cause hyperactive channels that significantly disrupt developmental and physiological processes, potentially stabilizing the resting membrane potential in a more negative voltage range. This can impede the opening of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, which may explain some of the clinical features observed in ZLS, such as gingival enlargement (Kortüm2015Mutations). Additionally, KCNH1 mutations have been linked to epilepsy, with seizures or epilepsy present in a significant number of individuals with these mutations (Gripp2021Syndromic).

KCNH1 mutations also affect ciliary structures, which are linked to ciliopathies, and can alter pathways like IFT transport and SHH signaling, contributing to the neurobehavioral and epilepsy phenotypes observed in affected individuals (Napoli2022Potassium). These mutations have been implicated in the regulation of ciliogenesis and cell cycle, with potential roles in cancer progression due to their influence on cell cycle regulation and proliferation (Napoli2022Potassium).

## Interactions
The KCNH1 protein, a potassium voltage-gated channel, is involved in various interactions with other proteins that influence its function and regulation. It is localized at the plasma membrane, inner nuclear membrane, and intracellular vesicles, and has been detected in the primary cilium area in certain cell types (Napoli2022Potassium). KCNH1 participates in ciliogenesis through interactions with proteins involved in ciliary regulation, such as Rabaptin-5, cortactin, and hypoxia-inducible factors (Napoli2022Potassium). 

In the context of primary cilia, KCNH1 is localized to membrane subdomains at the base of the primary cilia, specifically in the ciliary pocket and pre-ciliary vesicles. It colocalizes with EHD proteins, which are markers of pre-ciliary membranes and the ciliary pocket (Napoli2022Potassium). Mutations in KCNH1, such as L352V and R330Q, have been shown to affect the localization of ciliary proteins, suggesting that these pathogenic variants could moderately affect protein localization to the primary cilium (Napoli2022Potassium).

KCNH1 also interacts with intracellular domains, such as the PAS domain and CNBHD, which are crucial for channel regulation and gating. These interactions are characterized by a domain-swapped arrangement, with the CNBHD of one subunit positioned beneath the adjacent subunit, forming intersubunit interactions essential for slow deactivation gating in hERG channels (Codding2020Gating).
