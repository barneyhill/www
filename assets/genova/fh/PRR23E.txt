# PRR23E

## Overview
The PRR23E gene encodes the protein PRR23 family member E, which is part of the proline-rich protein family. This protein is characterized by its abundance of proline residues, which are known to play a role in protein-protein interactions. While the specific function of PRR23 family member E is not fully elucidated, proteins in this family are often involved in cellular signaling pathways and may have roles in various physiological processes. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their potential implications in health and disease contexts.
