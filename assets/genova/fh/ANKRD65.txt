# ANKRD65

## Overview
ANKRD65 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 65 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains. These domains are known for their role in mediating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for a variety of cellular processes. The ANKRD65 protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is involved in key functions such as cell differentiation and development, impacting tissue formation and immune responses. Through its interactions, the protein integrates multiple signaling pathways, contributing to the regulation and coordination of cellular activities necessary for maintaining healthy human cells (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
ANKRD65 encodes a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat domains, which are instrumental in facilitating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are essential for various cellular processes, including cellular signaling, maintaining structural integrity, and regulating other proteins. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in influencing cell differentiation and development. This activity is crucial for organismal outcomes such as tissue formation and immune responses. By participating in these processes, ANKRD65 contributes to the proper functioning and maintenance of healthy human cells, ensuring that cellular activities are coordinated and regulated effectively. The ankyrin repeat domains within the ANKRD65 protein are particularly important for its function, as they enable the protein to interact with multiple partners, thereby integrating various signaling pathways and cellular functions. This integration is vital for the dynamic regulation of cellular activities, which is necessary for the development and maintenance of complex tissues and the immune system.
