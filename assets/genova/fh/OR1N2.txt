# OR1N2

## Overview
The OR1N2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily N member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Ieki2022Functional). The OR1N2 gene is subject to evolutionary mechanisms such as balancing selection, which may enhance olfactory acuity by increasing the diversity of odorant-binding sites (Alonso2008Overdominance). While the gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including small cell lung cancer and preeclampsia, its precise role in these conditions is not yet fully understood (Tang2022WholeExome; Vidal2022GProtein).

## Function
The OR1N2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. The binding of odorants to OR1N2 triggers neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell by activating downstream signaling pathways, ultimately leading to the generation of electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain for odor perception (Ieki2022Functional).

Research suggests that olfactory receptor genes, including OR1N2, may be subject to balancing selection, particularly in certain populations such as the African YRI population. This selection could enhance olfactory acuity by increasing the diversity of odorant-binding sites, allowing for a broader range of odor detection (Alonso2008Overdominance). The functional diversity of olfactory receptors like OR1N2 is thought to be maintained through evolutionary mechanisms such as overdominance, which preserves genetic diversity and potentially enhances the ability to discriminate between odorants with similar structures (Alonso2008Overdominance).

## Clinical Significance
The OR1N2 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although specific diseases directly resulting from its mutations are not well-documented. In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), OR1N2 has been identified as having a mutation frequency of 17.5% in the chemosensitive group, suggesting a potential role in drug resistance mechanisms (Tang2022WholeExome). However, the study does not elaborate on the functional impact of these mutations on survival outcomes.

In the context of rectal cancer, OR1N2 is included in a 15-gene combination used in the PGS-LARC model to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. This model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting treatment responses, although the specific role of OR1N2 in this context is not detailed (Xiao2021A).

Additionally, OR1N2 has been noted for its upregulation in severe preeclampsia, particularly in the chorion portion of fetal membranes. While the study highlights the upregulation of olfactory receptors, including OR1N2, it does not provide specific mechanisms or roles for these receptors in preeclampsia (Vidal2022GProtein). Overall, while OR1N2 is associated with various conditions, its precise clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated.
