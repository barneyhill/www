# HTR3E

## Overview
The HTR3E gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3E (5-HT3E), a subunit of the serotonin type 3 receptor, which is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel family. This receptor is unique among serotonin receptors as it facilitates rapid synaptic transmission by directly mediating ion flow across the cell membrane upon serotonin binding. The 5-HT3E subunit does not form functional receptors independently but can coassemble with the 5-HT3A subunit to create heteromeric receptor complexes, which exhibit distinct pharmacological properties compared to homomeric 5-HT3A receptors (Niesler2007Characterization). Predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, the 5-HT3E subunit plays a significant role in modulating gastrointestinal functions and may influence the gut-brain axis, impacting neural circuits related to emotional processing and visceral perception (Kapeller2010Serotonin; Fritz2022The). Genetic variations in HTR3E have been associated with clinical conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease susceptibility and treatment response (Fritz2022The; Celli2016The).

## Structure
The HTR3E gene encodes a subunit of the 5-HT3 serotonin receptor, which is part of the ligand-gated ion channel family. The protein structure includes a signal peptide sequence of 16 amino acids and a cysteine loop at the extracellular N-terminal part, which is involved in ligand binding (Niesler2003Cloning). The HTR3E subunit contains four transmembrane regions, with the second transmembrane region lining the ion pore, crucial for ion channel conductance (Niesler2003Cloning). The C-terminus of the protein is predicted to be extracellular (Niesler2003Cloning).

The protein also features a large intracellular loop between the third and fourth transmembrane regions (Niesler2007Characterization). The HTR3E subunit has several predicted N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites, which may influence receptor assembly and conductance levels (Niesler2003Cloning). In terms of quaternary structure, the HTR3E subunit does not form functional receptors on its own but can coassemble with the 5-HT3A subunit to form functional heteromeric complexes (Niesler2007Characterization). These complexes exhibit different serotonin efficacies compared to homomeric 5-HT3A receptors (Niesler2007Characterization).

## Function
The HTR3E gene encodes a subunit of the serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in fast synaptic transmission. This receptor is unique within the serotonin receptor family as it directly mediates ion flow across the cell membrane upon activation by serotonin. The 5-HT3E subunit, when coexpressed with the 5-HT3A subunit, forms functional heteromeric receptor complexes that contribute to the diversity of the 5-HT3 receptor system (Niesler2007Characterization).

The 5-HT3E subunit is predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the colon and intestine, where it plays a role in modulating gastrointestinal functions such as peristalsis, secretion, and visceral perception (Kapeller2010Serotonin; Fritz2022The). It is involved in the formation of heteromeric receptors that influence serotonin signaling, affecting the pharmacological properties and efficacy of serotonin in these tissues (Niesler2007Characterization). The presence of the 5-HT3E subunit in the gastrointestinal tract suggests its involvement in the gut-brain axis, potentially influencing neural circuits related to emotional processing and visceral perception (Fritz2022The).

## Clinical Significance
The HTR3E gene, encoding a subunit of the serotonin receptor 3E, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its genetic variations and altered expression levels. Notably, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) c.*76G>A in HTR3E is associated with an increased risk of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in females. This variant is located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and may affect receptor expression by interfering with microRNA binding, potentially leading to up-regulation and increased susceptibility to IBS-D (Fritz2022The; Walstab20105-HT3).

In psychiatric disorders, the HTR3E gene has been linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The c.256G allele of the rs7627615 variant is more frequently observed in OCD patients, particularly those with a high washing phenotype, suggesting a role in the disorder's expression and related cognitive dysfunctions (Celli2016The).

Additionally, the HTR3E variant c.A256G has been associated with differential responses to antipsychotic treatments, indicating that genetic variations in this gene may influence therapeutic outcomes in psychiatric conditions (Walstab20105-HT3; Celli2016The). These findings underscore the potential of HTR3E polymorphisms as biomarkers for disease susceptibility and treatment response.
