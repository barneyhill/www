# CTAG1B

## Overview
The CTAG1B gene encodes the cancer/testis antigen 1B protein, commonly referred to as NY-ESO-1, which is a member of the cancer testis antigen family. This protein is characterized by its restricted expression in normal germ cells and aberrant expression in various tumor types, making it a significant target for cancer immunotherapy (Julve2023Gene). NY-ESO-1 is a non-enzymatic protein that plays a role in transcriptional regulation and potentially in cell cycle control, as suggested by its interaction with other cancer testis antigens and transcription factors (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel). The protein's immunogenic properties, due to its unique expression pattern and ability to elicit strong immune responses, have made it a focal point in the development of cancer vaccines and other therapeutic strategies (Wei2020Cancer).

## Structure
The CTAG1B gene encodes the NY-ESO-1 protein, which is a member of the cancer testis antigen family. The protein consists of 180 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 18 kDa (Julve2023Gene). Its primary structure includes a glycine-rich, hydrophilic N-terminal region and a hydrophobic C-terminal region. The N-terminal region contains epitopes that are crucial for humoral and cellular immune responses, while the C-terminal region includes a PCC1 transcription factor domain, which is functionally significant (Julve2023Gene).

The secondary structure of NY-ESO-1 is predicted to feature a flexible loop or turn conformation in the N-terminal domain, whereas the C-terminal domain is characterized by a restrained helix conformation (Julve2023Gene). The N-terminal hydrophilic domain is exposed on the protein's surface, facilitating direct interaction with immunoglobulin molecules (Julve2023Gene).

The NY-ESO-1 protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which plays a role in its processing for MHC class I antigen presentation. This process involves non-canonical ubiquitination on non-lysine sites, regulated by ubiquitin receptors Rpn10 and Rpn13 (Golnik2016Major). The protein's expression is restricted to germ cells in normal tissue, with significant expression in various tumors, making it a target for immunotherapy (Julve2023Gene).

## Function
The CTAG1B gene, also known as cancer/testis antigen 1B or NY-ESO-1, is primarily expressed in germ cells within healthy human tissues, specifically in the testis and ovary. In males, its expression is detected in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, which are early stages of sperm development, suggesting a role in gametogenesis, although its exact function remains unclear (Julve2023Gene). The NY-ESO-1 protein contains a Pcc1p transcription factor domain located between amino acids 89 and 164, which is believed to be involved in cell cycle regulation. This domain may play a critical role in regulating the cell cycle, as mutations in the parent PCC1 gene in yeast affect the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and polarized cell growth (Julve2023Gene).

In adult female ovarian and endometrial tissue, NY-ESO-1 mRNA is present, but the protein is not, and its biological relevance in these tissues is unclear (Julve2023Gene). Additionally, NY-ESO-1 has been observed in mesenchymal stem cells, with expression decreasing as these cells mature, suggesting a potential physiological role that requires further investigation (Julve2023Gene).

## Clinical Significance
The CTAG1B gene, also known as NY-ESO-1, is clinically significant due to its expression in various cancers, making it a target for cancer immunotherapy. It is highly expressed in myxoid and round cell liposarcomas, with studies showing 88% expression in these subtypes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Hemminger2013The; Endo2015NYESO1). In synovial sarcomas, NY-ESO-1 is expressed in approximately 49% of cases, further supporting its role in cancer diagnosis and treatment (Endo2015NYESO1). The gene's expression is also noted in other malignancies, including melanoma, lung, and esophageal tumors, as well as liver, gastric, prostate, ovarian, and bladder cancers (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel).

NY-ESO-1's immunogenic properties make it a promising candidate for immunotherapy, as it can induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in patients with NY-ESO-1 positive tumors (Wei2020Cancer). Clinical trials have shown objective responses in patients with NY-ESO-1-positive tumors, highlighting its potential in cancer treatment (Endo2015NYESO1). The gene's expression is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, which may influence its role in tumor progression and response to therapy (Julve2023Gene).

## Interactions
CTAG1B, also known as NY-ESO-1, is involved in several protein interactions that suggest its role in transcriptional regulation and oncogenesis. It forms intracellular protein complexes with MAGEC1, another cancer testis antigen protein, indicating a potential function as a specialized transcription complex in developing germ cells such as spermatophytes and spermatids (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel). This interaction is supported by the presence of CTAG1B in a network enriched with transcription factors, suggesting its involvement in gametogenic germ cell transcription programs that may also support tumor growth (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel).

CTAG1B is also part of a network that includes PRAME, forming a clique where these proteins are interconnected, which further supports its role in transcriptional regulation (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel). The protein has been shown to colocalize with MAGE-C1 in melanoma cell lines, suggesting a role in chromosome segregation and microtubule formation (Julve2023Gene). However, specific details on the physical interactions of CTAG1B with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature (Julve2023Gene).
