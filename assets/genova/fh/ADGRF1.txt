# ADGRF1

## Overview
ADGRF1, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F1, is a gene that encodes a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. The protein product of ADGRF1 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an N-terminal ectodomain, a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, and a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain, classifying it as a transmembrane receptor (Jones2022Tethered). This receptor is involved in various physiological processes, particularly in the nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection by mediating signaling pathways that promote neurogenesis and suppress inflammation (Morgan2019The; Lee2016Orphan). ADGRF1's ability to interact with multiple G protein classes and its involvement in synaptamide signaling highlight its significance in maintaining cognitive function and its potential as a therapeutic target for neurological and inflammatory diseases (Park2019GPR110).

## Structure
ADGRF1, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F1, is characterized by a unique modular architecture that includes an N-terminal ectodomain with extracellular adhesive modules, a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, and a seven-transmembrane (7TM) bundle (Jones2022Tethered). The GAIN domain undergoes autoproteolysis, resulting in the separation of the protein into non-covalently attached N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (NTF and CTF) (Jones2022Tethered). The CTF acts as an intramolecular agonist to the 7TM domain, facilitating G-protein coupling (Jones2022Tethered).

The ligand binding pocket of ADGRF1 is highly hydrophobic, formed by transmembrane helices TM1, TM2, TM3, TM5, TM6, TM7, and extracellular loops ECL1, ECL2, and ECL3 (Zhu2022Structural). Aromatic residues such as W804, F747, Y668, F823, F641, W734, and W737 form the bottom and 'barrel' of the pocket, while hydrophobic residues like L744, I811, L593, V585, and V732 fill the gaps (Zhu2022Structural). Polar residues T589, T810, R729, and H820 are found on the rim of the pocket (Zhu2022Structural).

ADGRF1 can signal through all major G-protein classes, with a preference for Gαq over Gαs, due to structural features such as tighter packing at the conserved F569 of the tethered agonist and rearrangements of transmembrane helices (Jones2022Tethered). The protein's structure includes a lipid-binding site in the intracellular region, which may interact with the endogenous ligand synaptamide (Qu2022Structural).

## Function
ADGRF1, also known as GPR110, is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor involved in several critical processes in healthy human cells. It functions as a receptor for synaptamide, a metabolite derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which plays a significant role in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection. The binding of synaptamide to ADGRF1 induces conformational changes that activate the Gαs protein, leading to the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). This signaling cascade promotes the expression of genes involved in neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and synaptogenesis, while suppressing pro-inflammatory gene expression (Morgan2019The; Lee2016Orphan).

ADGRF1 is highly expressed in neural stem cells and the fetal brain, with continued expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, indicating its role in promoting neurogenesis beyond embryonic development (Morgan2019The; Lee2016Orphan). In addition to its role in neuronal development, ADGRF1 mediates anti-inflammatory effects in the brain and peripheral immune cells by suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through a cAMP-dependent mechanism (Park2019GPR110). This receptor's activity is crucial for maintaining cognitive function and reducing neuroinflammatory responses, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions (Lee2016Orphan; Park2019GPR110).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADGRF1 gene, also known as GPR110, have been associated with various diseases. In the context of neurological disorders, ADGRF1 is implicated in cognitive function and memory. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of ADGRF1 results in significant memory deficits, indicating its importance in memory function (Morgan2019The; Lee2016Orphan). The gene's role in synaptamide-mediated signaling suggests that inadequate GPR110 signaling, possibly due to insufficient dietary omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to learning disabilities and memory deficits (Lee2016Orphan).

ADGRF1 has also been linked to cancer. It was initially recognized as an oncogene implicated in lung and prostate cancers (Huang2020Synaptamide). The gene's activation can be influenced by synthetic stalk peptides, and it is recognized as an oncogene in various cancers (Qu2022Structural).

In kidney diseases, changes in the expression levels of ADGRF1 are associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and minimal change disease (mDN), with expression levels reported to be significantly altered in these conditions (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion).

## Interactions
ADGRF1, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F1, engages in various interactions with other proteins, primarily through its role in G protein signaling pathways. It forms complexes with miniG proteins, such as miniGαs and miniGαi, along with Gβ1 and Gγ2 subunits, to facilitate its signaling functions. These interactions are crucial for the receptor's ability to couple with multiple G proteins, including Gs, Gq, and Gi, allowing it to mediate diverse signaling pathways (Qu2022Structural).

The receptor's intracellular loops, particularly ICL1, ICL2, and ICL3, are involved in direct interactions with the G protein subunits, with ICL1 making close contact with the Gβ subunit and ICL2 and ICL3 forming extensive interactions with the Gα subunit (Qu2022Structural). ADGRF1 also interacts with synaptamide, a metabolite of docosahexaenoic acid, which binds to its GAIN domain, triggering a conformational change that activates downstream signaling pathways (Huang2020Synaptamide).

Additionally, ADGRF1 has a specific lipid-binding site that interacts with lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) molecules, which stabilize the receptor's conformation and may play a role in its activation (Qu2022Structural). These interactions highlight the receptor's complex role in cellular signaling and its potential involvement in various physiological processes.
