# DRC3

## Overview
The DRC3 gene encodes the dynein regulatory complex subunit 3, a critical component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) involved in the regulation of ciliary and flagellar motility. This protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of the ciliary axoneme, acting as an assembly adapter for other N-DRC subunits and facilitating the regulation of dynein motor activity, which is essential for microtubule sliding and ciliary beating (Zhou2023DRC3; Bower2018DRC2CCDC65). DRC3 is integral to maintaining the structural integrity of cilia and flagella, and its proper function is crucial for cellular locomotion and fluid movement across epithelial surfaces. Mutations in the DRC3 gene have been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function, leading to clinical manifestations such as chronic respiratory infections and reduced fertility (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein; Poprzeczko2019Rare).

## Function
DRC3 (dynein regulatory complex subunit 3) is a crucial component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), which plays a significant role in the motility of cilia and flagella. In healthy human cells, DRC3 functions as an assembly adapter for the functional subunits of the N-DRC, facilitating the proper assembly and function of the ciliary axoneme (Zhou2023DRC3). It is involved in the regulation of dynein motor activity, which is essential for microtubule sliding and ciliary beating, thereby contributing to cellular locomotion and fluid movement across epithelial surfaces (Bower2018DRC2CCDC65).

DRC3 is active within the axoneme of cilia and flagella, where it is necessary for the presence of other N-DRC components such as DRC5 and DRC7, although it does not affect the core subunits like DRC1, DRC2, and DRC4 (Zhou2023DRC3). The proper localization and function of DRC3 are critical for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cilia, as evidenced by its role in the assembly of the N-DRC and its interactions with other axonemal structures (Jeanson2016Mutations). Defects in DRC3 can lead to conditions such as asthenoteratozoospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology (Zhou2023DRC3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DRC3 gene, which encodes a component of the dynein regulatory complex, have been implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by chronic respiratory infections, reduced fertility, and situs inversus. In a mouse model, a mutation in DRC3 was shown to cause PCD, highlighting its role in this condition (Poprzeczko2019Rare). The absence of the DRC3 subunit in certain mutants leads to altered ciliary beat frequency and amplitude, which are critical for proper ciliary function (Poprzeczko2019Rare).

In humans, mutations in the DRC3 gene are associated with ciliary motility defects, contributing to the clinical manifestations of PCD. Although specific human cases directly linking DRC3 mutations to PCD are not detailed, the gene's role in ciliary function suggests that its mutations could lead to similar phenotypes observed in other N-DRC component mutations (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein). The impact of DRC3 mutations on ciliary structure and function underscores the importance of this gene in maintaining normal ciliary motility and preventing the development of PCD-related symptoms.

## Interactions
DRC3, a component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), participates in several interactions crucial for the assembly and function of the complex. It interacts with DRC4B, but shows limited interaction with DRC4A, as demonstrated by pull-down assays (Ghanaeian2023Integrated). DRC3 is also involved in interactions with the DRC9/10 coiled-coil in the distal region of the N-DRC, contributing to the structural integrity of the complex (Ghanaeian2023Integrated). 

In the context of dynein regulation, DRC3 interacts with dynein g, serving as a regulatory hub for dynein activity, which is essential for ciliary movement (Ghanaeian2023Integrated). The N-termini of DRC9 and DRC3 are specifically noted to interact with dynein e and g, respectively (Ghanaeian2023Integrated). 

DRC3 also plays a role in the assembly of the N-DRC distal domain by binding to DRC4, which facilitates the assembly of DRC9/10 heterodimers (Ghanaeian2023Integrated). Additionally, DRC3 is associated with the CCDC96/113 complex, which may function as a signal transfer bridge within the N-DRC (Ghanaeian2023Integrated).
