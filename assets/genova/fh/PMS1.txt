# PMS1

## Overview
PMS1 is a gene that encodes the PMS1 homolog 1, a protein that plays a critical role in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. This protein is categorized as a component of the DNA repair machinery and is essential for maintaining genomic stability by correcting replication errors. The PMS1 protein forms a heterodimer with MLH1, another MMR protein, to facilitate the repair of mismatched nucleotides during DNA replication. This heterodimer, known as MutL-β, acts as a "molecular matchmaker," signaling mismatch recognition to downstream repair enzymes, thereby playing a key role in mutation avoidance (Wang2013The; Modrich1996MISMATCH). Mutations in the PMS1 gene are associated with Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition that increases the risk of colorectal and other cancers (Wang1999Prevalence; Cassone2017Coexistence). The study of PMS1 and its interactions is crucial for understanding its role in cancer predisposition and for guiding genetic counseling and testing strategies (Pang1997Functional).

## Structure
The PMS1 protein is a component of the DNA mismatch repair system and exhibits a complex molecular structure. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) is characterized by two α/β domains. The first domain contains ATP binding motifs typical of the GHL superfamily of ATPases, to which MutL proteins belong, while the second domain includes a 4-stranded mixed β-sheet (Arana2010Functional). The NTD of PMS1 shares structural similarities with its homologs in E. coli MutL and human PMS2, including the ATP binding site (Arana2010Functional).

The NTD of PMS1 has a positively charged groove that is crucial for DNA binding, with key residues such as Arg188, Lys190, Lys197, and Arg198 playing significant roles in this interaction (Schorzman2011Modeling). The protein's structure allows for the independent binding of DNA by the NTDs of both Pms1 and Mlh1, without the necessity of cleft formation (Arana2010Functional).

Mutations in specific lysine and arginine residues on the surface of the NTD, such as K197E and R198E, have been shown to reduce DNA binding affinity and increase mutation rates, indicating their importance in mismatch repair (Arana2010Functional). The PMS1 protein also forms a heterodimer with MLH1, where the C-terminal domains dimerize, contributing to its function in DNA repair (Schorzman2011Modeling).

## Function
The PMS1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, which maintains genomic stability by correcting replication errors in DNA. In healthy human cells, the PMS1 protein forms a heterodimer with MLH1, another MMR protein, to facilitate the repair of mismatched nucleotides during DNA replication. This heterodimer, known as MutL-β, acts as a "molecular matchmaker," signaling mismatch recognition to downstream repair enzymes, thereby playing a key role in mutation avoidance (Wang2013The; Modrich1996MISMATCH).

The PMS1 protein is active in the nucleus, where it participates in recognizing and repairing mismatched nucleotides. This process is essential for preventing tumorigenesis, as defects in MMR genes like PMS1 can lead to increased mutation rates and the development of various cancers (Wang2013The). In yeast, the Mlh1-Pms1 heterodimer is a primary participant in MMR, similar to the MLH1-PMS2 heterodimer in humans, highlighting the conserved nature of this repair mechanism across species (Hall2003DNA). The interaction between PMS1 and MLH1 is critical for the MMR pathway, ensuring the fidelity of recombination events and maintaining genomic integrity (Pang1997Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PMS1 gene are associated with Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), an autosomal dominant condition that increases the risk of colorectal and other cancers (Wang1999Prevalence; Cassone2017Coexistence). Lynch syndrome is caused by heterozygous germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, including PMS1 (Cassone2017Coexistence). Although mutations in PMS1 are less common compared to other mismatch repair genes like MLH1 and MSH2, they still contribute to the genetic landscape of Lynch syndrome (Wang1999Prevalence).

Specific mutations in PMS1, such as a novel frameshift mutation c.1139dupA p.Y380_S381delinsX, have been identified in patients with Lynch syndrome, leading to early termination of protein synthesis (Cassone2017Coexistence). Other mutations, like those at codons 394 and 501, have been identified, but their pathogenicity remains uncertain due to limited evidence of cosegregation with disease (Wang1999Prevalence).

The presence of PMS1 mutations can result in impaired DNA mismatch repair, contributing to genomic instability and increased cancer risk. The study of these mutations is crucial for understanding their role in cancer predisposition and for guiding genetic counseling and testing strategies (Pang1997Functional).

## Interactions
PMS1, a component of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, forms a heterodimer with MLH1, which is crucial for its function in DNA repair. This heterodimer exhibits intrinsic DNA binding activity, interacting with both single-stranded (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in a mismatch-independent and sequence non-specific manner. The binding affinity is higher for longer DNA substrates, suggesting positive cooperativity, and the complex can bind in long, continuous tracts, indicating multiple DNA binding sites (Drotschmann2002DNA; Hall2001High).

The N-terminal domain (NTD) of PMS1 can independently bind to DNA, with specific residues such as Arg188, Lys190, Arg198, and Lys364 playing significant roles in this interaction. These residues form a positively charged groove that accommodates dsDNA, and mutations in these residues can disrupt DNA binding (Schorzman2011Modeling).

PMS1 also interacts with other MMR proteins, such as Msh2-Msh6, facilitating communication between strand discrimination signals and proteins bound at mismatches. This interaction is essential for marking mismatch locations and aiding in the termination of strand excision (Drotschmann2002DNA; Hall2003DNA).
