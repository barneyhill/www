# MSANTD1

## Overview
MSANTD1 is a gene that encodes the protein Myb/SANT DNA binding domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a Myb/SANT domain, which is known for its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Although the specific functions of MSANTD1 are not fully elucidated, proteins with Myb/SANT domains are typically involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The MSANTD1 gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in cellular mechanisms and potential implications in human health and disease.
