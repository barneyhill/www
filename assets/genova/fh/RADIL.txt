# RADIL

## Overview
RADIL is a gene that encodes the protein Rap associating with DIL domain, which is primarily involved in cell adhesion and migration processes. The protein is categorized as a signaling molecule due to its interactions with small GTPases, particularly Rap1 and KRas, through its Ras-association (RA) domain. RADIL plays a critical role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion, influencing cellular processes such as cell spreading, migration, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These functions are essential for normal physiological processes like wound healing, immune cell trafficking, and stem cell homing. Additionally, RADIL's interactions with other proteins, such as KIF14, further underscore its importance in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell motility and adhesion. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various cancers, where it can influence tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Fu2019Rap; Choi2021Identification; Ahmed2012KIF14).

## Function
The RADIL gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion and migration, primarily through its interaction with the Rap1 GTPase. This interaction is crucial for integrin-mediated cell adhesion, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell spreading and migration (Ahmed2012KIF14). RADIL contains several domains, including the Ras-association (RA) domain, which allows it to interact with Ras proteins, particularly KRas, although its primary interaction is with Rap1 (Choi2021Identification).

In healthy human cells, RADIL is involved in regulating cell adhesion and motility by modulating integrin activation and controlling neutrophil chemotaxis. It translocates to the plasma membrane in a Rap1a-GTP-dependent manner, promoting cell adhesion and maintaining an elongated cell morphology (Choi2021Identification). RADIL's role in cell adhesion and motility is crucial for normal biological processes such as wound healing, stem cell homing, and immune cell trafficking (Choi2021Identification).

RADIL is also implicated in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process important for development and wound healing, by influencing the expression of mesenchymal cell markers like Vimentin, Zeb1, and Snail (Choi2021Identification). Its function in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RADIL gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast, renal, liver, stomach, and pancreatic cancers. In breast cancer, RADIL is crucial for cell migration and metastasis, particularly to the lungs. Its interaction with KIF14, a protein overexpressed in several cancers, is essential for regulating integrin activation and cell-matrix adhesion, processes vital for cancer cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of RADIL impairs integrin signaling, reduces cell proliferation, and results in lighter tumor weights, highlighting its role in breast cancer progression (Ahmed2012KIF14).

In renal, liver, and stomach cancers, RADIL expression is higher in tumor tissues and is associated with poor overall survival, whereas in pancreatic cancer, higher RADIL expression correlates with better survival outcomes. This suggests that RADIL may play different roles depending on the cancer type (Fu2019Rap). RADIL's expression is also linked to immune resistance, particularly in kidney cancer, where it negatively correlates with tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, crucial for immune surveillance (Fu2019Rap). These findings indicate that RADIL could be a target for cancer therapy and a potential marker for cancer prognosis (Fu2019Rap).

## Interactions
RADIL is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in cell signaling and migration. It is known to interact with Ras proteins, particularly KRas, through its RA domain. This interaction is more efficient with the GTP-bound active form of Ras, suggesting that RADIL may act as a positive regulator or mediator of Ras activation and signaling (Choi2021Identification). RADIL also interacts with Rap1, a small GTPase involved in cell adhesion and actin structure regulation. This interaction is competitive with KRas, as increased KRas expression reduces the interaction between RADIL and Rap1 (Choi2021Identification).

In the context of breast cancer, RADIL interacts with KIF14, a kinesin family protein, through its PDZ domain. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of Rap1a-RADIL signaling, which is important for cell adhesion and spreading. KIF14 recruits RADIL to the microtubule network, suggesting a role in cell migration and invasion (Ahmed2012KIF14). The interaction between KIF14 and RADIL is specific, as KIF14 binds to the PDZ domain of RADIL, negatively regulating Rap1-mediated integrin activation by tethering RADIL on microtubules (Ahmed2012KIF14).
