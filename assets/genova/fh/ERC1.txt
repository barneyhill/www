# ERC1

## Overview
ERC1 is a gene that encodes the protein ELKS/RAB6-interacting/CAST family member 1, commonly referred to as ERC1 or ELKS. This protein functions as a scaffold protein, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as cell motility, synaptic vesicle trafficking, and neurotransmitter release. ERC1 is characterized by its ability to form dynamic networks at the cell's protruding edge, which are crucial for cell migration and invasion. These networks are assembled through phase separation, a process influenced by the intrinsically disordered regions of the protein (Sala2019The). ERC1 interacts with various proteins, including liprin-α1 and LL5, to regulate focal adhesion dynamics and integrin endocytosis, which are essential for efficient cell movement (Astro2016Liprinα1). Clinically, mutations and deletions in the ERC1 gene have been associated with developmental disorders, such as childhood apraxia of speech, and its involvement in cancer progression has been noted through genetic rearrangements like the ERC1-RET fusion (Ma2021Case; Thevenon201212p13.33).

## Structure
The ERC1 protein is characterized by its ability to form extended homodimers, as revealed by rotary shadowing electron microscopy and static light scattering. The structure of ERC1 is suggested to be a dimeric coiled-coil, although the N-terminal region (ERC1-N) is predicted to be intrinsically disordered with a low probability of forming coiled-coils. This N-terminal region is characterized by a low abundance of charged residues and a high content of disorder-promoting residues such as Gly, Pro, and Ser. The full-length ERC1 has a predicted total net charge at pH 7 of -27, while the N-terminal 147 residues have a net charge of +8 (Sala2019The).

ERC1 has two splice variants, ERC1a and ERC1b, with ERC1b being brain-specific and distributed in both cytosolic and active zone regions. Both variants share a class II PDZ domain binding motif at their C termini, which allows them to interact with the PDZ domain of RIMs (Ko2003Interaction). The protein forms dynamic networks at the protruding edge of cells, which are important for cell migration and invasion. These networks are assembled through phase separation, a process influenced by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of ERC1 (Sala2019The). 

The ERC1 protein is involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release, containing coiled-coil domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions. It is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Astro2014Liprinα1).

## Function
ERC1, also known as ELKS/RAB6-interacting/CAST family member 1, is a scaffold protein that plays a significant role in cell motility by driving the assembly of liquid-like cytoplasmic condensates. These condensates are formed at specific sites near the plasma membrane and are involved in the regulation of cell migration and invasion. ERC1, along with its partners such as liprin-α1 and LL5, forms dynamic networks at the protruding edge of cells, which are essential for the turnover of adhesions and invadosomes, thereby promoting cell protrusion (Sala2019The).

ERC1 is crucial for the dynamics of focal adhesions, which are essential for cell migration on the extracellular matrix. It is involved in the disassembly of these adhesions, a process necessary for their turnover and the speed of cell migration (Astro2016Liprinα1). The protein also plays a role in the internalization of active β1 integrins into Rab7-positive endosomes, which is essential for efficient focal adhesion disassembly (Astro2016Liprinα1).

In neurons, ERC1 interacts with liprin-α to regulate the molecular organization of presynaptic active zones, suggesting a role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release (Ko2003Interaction). ERC1's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in both cellular motility and synaptic function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deletions in the ERC1 gene have been associated with several developmental and speech-related disorders. Deletions in the 12p13.33 region, which includes ERC1, are linked to developmental delays, particularly in speech and language, and may include features of autism and ADHD. These deletions are often associated with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), a disorder characterized by inconsistent speech errors and impaired ability to repeat nonsense words (Thevenon201212p13.33).

In addition to developmental disorders, ERC1 has been implicated in cancer. The ERC1-RET fusion, a genetic rearrangement, has been identified in various cancers, including thyroid carcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This fusion acts as an oncogenic driver, promoting tumor cell migration and invasion (Ma2021Case; Astro2014Liprinα1).

ERC1 is also involved in cell migration and tumor cell invasion through its interaction with LL5β. Disrupting this interaction affects tumor cell motility, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Ribolla2023Interfering). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ERC1 in both neurological and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
ERC1, also known as ELKS, is a scaffold protein that participates in various interactions crucial for cell motility and migration. It interacts with liprin-α1 to form plasma membrane-associated platforms at the cell edge, which are essential for promoting cell protrusion and migration. This interaction is necessary for the disassembly of focal adhesions, which are critical for cell movement (Astro2016Liprinα1). ERC1 also interacts with LL5 proteins, forming a trimeric complex with liprin-α1 that localizes at the front of migrating cells. This complex is involved in stabilizing lamellipodia and promoting efficient cell migration (Astro2014Liprinα1).

ERC1's interaction with LL5β is significant in tumor cell motility. Disrupting the ERC1–LL5β interaction affects the formation of plasma membrane-associated platforms and influences cell spreading and migration (Ribolla2023Interfering). ERC1 is also implicated in integrin endocytosis and focal adhesion dynamics, colocalizing with liprin-α1 and LL5 at the front of migrating cells. These proteins are involved in the endocytic cycle of integrins, which is crucial for cell locomotion (Astro2014Liprinα1). ERC1's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in regulating cell migration and adhesion dynamics.
