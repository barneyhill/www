# SOS1

## Overview
The SOS1 gene encodes the SOS Ras/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1, a critical component of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. This protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), facilitating the activation of RAS and RAC proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. As a multidomain protein, SOS1 contains several structural regions, including histone-like folds, a Dbl-homology domain, and a pleckstrin-homology domain, which collectively regulate its activity and interactions. The protein is primarily active at the plasma membrane, where it interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases and adaptor proteins such as GRB2, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Cowan2020SOS1; Baltanás2020SOS). Mutations in the SOS1 gene are clinically significant, being implicated in genetic disorders such as Noonan syndrome and hereditary gingival fibromatosis, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Mercadante2022Cutis; Tartaglia2006Gainoffunction).

## Structure
The SOS1 protein, also known as SOS Ras/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1, is a multidomain protein involved in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region contains tandem histone-like folds (HF), a Dbl-homology (DH) domain, and a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain, which together form an autoinhibitory unit that prevents RAS binding when SOS1 is not associated with the plasma membrane (Lepri2011SOS1; Cowan2020SOS1). The C-terminal catalytic region comprises the RAS exchanger motif (REM) and CDC25 domains, which are crucial for GDP/GTP exchange and RAS binding (Cowan2020SOS1).

The protein's structure facilitates its interaction with RAS proteins, and its activity is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Membrane association is primarily driven by the interaction of the proline-rich (PR) tail with Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) (Cowan2020SOS1). Pathogenic variants in SOS1 can disrupt these interactions, leading to sustained RAS activation and contributing to disease pathogenesis (Cowan2020SOS1). The SOS1 protein also exists in different splice variant isoforms, which can affect its activity and interactions (Lepri2011SOS1).

## Function
The SOS1 gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is crucial for activating RAS and RAC proteins by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP. This activation is a key step in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for transmitting signals from extracellular growth factors to the cell's interior, influencing cell growth, differentiation, and survival (Baltanás2020SOS; Tartaglia2006Gainoffunction). SOS1 is primarily active at the plasma membrane, where it interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and adaptor proteins like GRB2, which are essential for its recruitment and activation (Baltanás2020SOS).

In healthy human cells, SOS1 plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including proliferation, migration, and redox homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of the KRAS cycle, switching between its inactive GDP-bound state and active GTP-bound state (Kessler2021Targeting). SOS1 also participates in the translocation of the SOS1-GRB2 complex to the plasma membrane, where it activates RAS by promoting GDP-GTP exchange, a critical part of the RAS-ERK signaling pathway (Baltanás2020SOS). This pathway is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation, highlighting the importance of SOS1 in maintaining normal cellular functions and development (Baltanás2020SOS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SOS1 gene are associated with Noonan syndrome (NS), a genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, congenital heart defects, and other developmental anomalies. SOS1 mutations account for approximately 10% to 17% of NS cases, making it the second most common genetic cause after PTPN11 mutations (Mercadante2022Cutis; Tartaglia2006Gainoffunction). These mutations are typically gain-of-function, leading to increased RAS-MAPK signaling due to the disruption of SOS1's autoinhibitory mechanisms (Lepri2011SOS1; Tartaglia2006Gainoffunction). Individuals with SOS1 mutations often exhibit ectodermal abnormalities such as keratosis pilaris and curly hair, and they generally do not have cognitive deficits (Lepri2011SOS1; Mercadante2022Cutis).

In addition to NS, SOS1 mutations have been implicated in other conditions. For instance, they are associated with hereditary gingival fibromatosis, a benign overgrowth of the gingiva (Mercadante2022Cutis). SOS1 variants have also been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), where they contribute to disease pathogenesis by affecting the RAS signaling pathway (Cowan2020SOS1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SOS1 mutations in a range of genetic disorders.

## Interactions
SOS1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in signal transduction pathways. It forms a complex with the adaptor protein GRB2, which contains two SH3 domains that bind to multiple polyproline motifs on SOS1. This interaction is essential for recruiting SOS1 to the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the activation of Ras by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP (Sethi2011Quantifying). The interaction between SOS1 and GRB2 is modulated by phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation at the S1178 site on SOS1 disrupts its interaction with GRB2, mediated by ERK phosphorylation, which negatively regulates SOS1 activity (Howes2018Small).

SOS1 also interacts with the CSN3 subunit of the COP9 signalosome. This interaction occurs specifically with the histone-like domain (HD) of SOS1 and is significant for the stability and homeostasis of the protein. The COP9 signalosome, involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, regulates the stability of SOS1, protecting it from proteolytic degradation (Zarich2019The). The interaction between SOS1 and CSN3 is confirmed through various experimental approaches, including yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Zarich2019The). These interactions highlight the role of SOS1 in cellular signaling and its regulation by other proteins.
