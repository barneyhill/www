# CDC42SE1

## Overview
CDC42SE1 (CDC42 small effector 1) is a gene that encodes a small scaffold protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division. The protein acts as an effector of the CDC42 GTPase, a critical regulator of cell signaling pathways that influence various cellular functions, including cell morphology and motility. CDC42SE1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and interacts with CDC42 through its CRIB domain, playing a pivotal role in modulating cellular activities such as cell proliferation, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeleton assembly. Notably, CDC42SE1 can localize to the plasma membrane independently of CDC42, enhancing E-cadherin localization and promoting cell-cell adhesion, which may reduce cancer cell invasiveness (Kalailingam2019Overexpression). The gene's expression is notably high in normal keratinocytes, indicating its importance in maintaining normal cell proliferation and morphology (Kalailingam2019Overexpression). CDC42SE1's involvement in cancer, particularly skin cancer, highlights its potential as a tumor suppressor and a target for therapeutic intervention (Kalailingam2019Overexpression).

## Structure


## Function
CDC42SE1 (CDC42 small effector 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division. It acts as an effector of the CDC42 GTPase, a key regulator of cell signaling pathways involved in various cellular functions. CDC42SE1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and influences cell morphology and motility by modulating actin filament organization (Kalailingam2019Overexpression).

In healthy human cells, CDC42SE1 is highly expressed in normal keratinocytes, suggesting its role in maintaining normal cell proliferation and morphology (Kalailingam2019Overexpression). The protein interacts with CDC42 through its CRIB domain, which is essential for its regulatory functions. This interaction is crucial for modulating cellular activities such as cell proliferation, membrane trafficking, cytoskeleton assembly, and cell motility (Kalailingam2019Overexpression).

CDC42SE1's ability to localize to the plasma membrane independently of CDC42 and its role in enhancing E-cadherin localization at the plasma membrane are associated with increased cell-cell adhesion, potentially reducing cancer cell invasiveness (Kalailingam2019Overexpression). These functions highlight CDC42SE1's importance in regulating cellular processes and maintaining cellular integrity.

## Clinical Significance
CDC42SE1 has been implicated in cancer, particularly skin cancer, due to its role in regulating cell proliferation and tumor growth. Overexpression of CDC42SE1 in A431 skin cancer cells has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and tumor growth by inhibiting the Akt signaling pathway. This is evidenced by decreased levels of phosphorylated Akt, mTOR, and other related proteins, suggesting that CDC42SE1 acts as a tumor suppressor (Kalailingam2019Overexpression). 

In human squamous cell carcinoma samples, CDC42SE1 expression is significantly reduced compared to normal tissue, and patients with lower levels of CDC42SE1 have poorer survival rates. This suggests that reduced expression of CDC42SE1 may contribute to cancer progression and could serve as a prognostic marker (Kalailingam2019Overexpression). 

Mutations that impair the interaction between CDC42SE1 and CDC42 negate the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, highlighting the importance of this interaction in its tumor-suppressive function (Kalailingam2019Overexpression). 

CDC42SE1 also affects cell motility and adhesion, as its overexpression reduces cell spreading and filopodia formation, processes that are crucial for cancer metastasis (Kalailingam2019Overexpression). These findings underscore the potential of CDC42SE1 as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancers where its expression or function is altered.

## Interactions
CDC42SE1 (CDC42 small effector 1) is a small scaffold protein that interacts with the Rho GTPase CDC42 through its CRIB domain, which is essential for its regulatory functions in cellular processes. This interaction is crucial for CDC42SE1's ability to modulate cell adhesion, spreading, and proliferation. CDC42SE1 competes with other CDC42 effector proteins, such as N-WASP, for binding to CDC42, thereby inhibiting CDC42-mediated signaling pathways, including JNK signaling and filopodia formation (Kalailingam2019Overexpression).

The CRIB domain of CDC42SE1 consists of an Î±-helical C-terminal region and two conserved cysteines at the N-terminal, which are important for its interaction with CDC42. This domain also includes a basic amino acid that binds phosphoinositide, potentially regulating CDC42SE1's activity at the cell membrane and influencing downstream signaling pathways (Kalailingam2019Overexpression).

CDC42SE1's interaction with CDC42 is also involved in the regulation of F-actin accumulation at the immunological synapse and during phagocytosis, highlighting its role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Kalailingam2019Overexpression). The protein's ability to inhibit CDC42-induced JNK activity and morphological changes further underscores its function as a modulator of CDC42 signaling (Kalailingam2019Overexpression).
