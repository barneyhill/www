# ZNF329

## Overview
ZNF329 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 329, which is involved in various biological processes, including transcriptional regulation and lipid metabolism. The protein belongs to the zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions. ZNF329 is part of a gene cluster on chromosome 19, associated with transcriptional repression through the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain (Chen2012G9aGLPdependent). The gene has been implicated in the regulation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) uptake, with genetic variants affecting its expression and function (Ryu2023Joint). Additionally, ZNF329 is involved in cancer biology, being a target of miR-27a in breast cancer cells and associated with relapse risk in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Nordlund2013Genomewide; Shah20115fluorouracil). These diverse roles underscore the gene's significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states.

## Structure


## Function
ZNF329, a zinc finger protein, plays a role in transcriptional repression in human hematopoietic stem cells (HSPCs). It is part of a zinc finger (ZNF) gene cluster on chromosome 19, which is associated with transcriptional repression through the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, a motif critical for protein-protein interactions. The activity of G9a/GLP is necessary for maintaining the expression of ZNF329 and other genes in this cluster, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation during lineage commitment in HSPCs (Chen2012G9aGLPdependent).

In liver tissue, ZNF329 is implicated in lipid metabolism. A genetic variant, rs35081008, located in the promoter of ZNF329, affects chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Editing this variant to increase ZNF329 expression enhances low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) uptake, suggesting a functional role in regulating LDL-C levels (Ryu2023Joint).

ZNF329 is also identified as a target gene of miR-27a, which is involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including programmed cell death and immune response activation, in the context of breast cancer cells treated with 5-fluorouracil (Shah20115fluorouracil).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF329 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to lipid metabolism and cancer. Variants in the ZNF329 gene, such as rs35081008, have been associated with changes in chromatin accessibility and LDL-C uptake. Editing this variant to the major allele increases ZNF329 expression, which in turn enhances LDL-C uptake, suggesting a potential role in regulating cholesterol levels (Ryu2023Joint). This finding indicates that ZNF329 may be involved in lipid metabolism, although it has not been previously linked to LDL-C uptake in other studies (Ryu2023Joint).

In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), ZNF329 is one of several zinc finger genes on chromosome 19q13 associated with relapse risk in patients with 11q23/MLL rearrangements. Hypomethylation of ZNF329 and other zinc finger genes is indicative of an increased risk of relapse, suggesting that DNA methylation levels of ZNF329 could serve as potential biomarkers for assessing relapse risk in pediatric leukemias (Nordlund2013Genomewide).

ZNF329 is also upregulated in ovarian cancer with somatic BRCA2 mutations, indicating its involvement in cancer progression and metastasis formation in BRCA-mutated cancers (Arakelyan2021Transcriptome). These associations highlight the potential clinical significance of ZNF329 in various diseases.
