# DPP6

## Overview
DPP6, or dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein involved in the modulation of neuronal activity. The protein, also referred to as DPP6, is structurally similar to the antigenic exopeptidase family member DPP4 but lacks enzymatic activity due to a critical amino acid substitution. DPP6 functions primarily as an auxiliary subunit for the Kv4 family of voltage-gated potassium channels, enhancing their surface expression and kinetics, which are crucial for regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (Clark2008DPP6; Malloy2022Neuronal). The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it influences various neuronal processes, including synaptogenesis and dendritic morphology. DPP6's interactions with extracellular matrix proteins and its role in cell adhesion further underscore its importance in synaptic development and maintenance, impacting cognitive functions such as learning and memory (Malloy2022Neuronal; Lin2013DPP6). Additionally, mutations in the DPP6 gene have been associated with several neurological and cardiac conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Bergeman2023Outcomes; Malloy2022Neuronal).

## Structure
Dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6 (DPP6) is a type II transmembrane protein with a structure similar to the antigenic exopeptidase family member DPP4, sharing 32% sequence identity and 50% sequence similarity. DPP6 has a higher sequence similarity with DPP10, with 51% amino acid sequence identity (Malloy2022Neuronal). The protein structure of DPP6 includes a short variable N-terminal and an extensive C-terminal with three distinct domains. The first domain in the C-terminal contains an eight-bladed β-propeller and an α/β hydrolase domain, which facilitates dimerization and houses seven N-glycosylation sites (Malloy2022Neuronal). The second domain is a cysteine-rich portion with four disulfide bonds, important for protein folding and membrane localization. The third domain contains an Asp for Ser substitution, resulting in a loss of peptidase activity (Malloy2022Neuronal).

DPP6 exists as a monomer with the ability to form heterodimers and co-precipitates with the Kv4 family of voltage-gated K+ channels, which regulate neuronal excitability and firing patterns (Malloy2022Neuronal). Three alternate isoforms have been identified in the adult rodent brain: DPP6-K, DPP6-S, and DPP6-L, with DPP6-S expressed at the highest levels (Malloy2022Neuronal).

## Function
DPP6 (dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6) is a type II transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in neuronal function by modulating the activity of voltage-gated potassium channels, particularly the Kv4 family. It acts as an auxiliary subunit, enhancing the surface expression and kinetics of these channels, which are responsible for the somato-dendritic A-type K+ current. This current is vital for regulating neuronal excitability, firing frequency, and synaptic plasticity (Clark2008DPP6; Malloy2022Neuronal).

DPP6 is prominently expressed in the central nervous system, including the cerebellum and hippocampus, where it influences the resting membrane potential and input resistance by modulating the I_K(SO) resting membrane current associated with the K2P channel TASK-3 (Nadin2013A). It also plays a role in synaptogenesis and dendritic morphology, promoting the formation and stability of dendritic filopodia and spines, which are essential for synaptic connections and cognitive functions (Malloy2022Neuronal; Lin2013DPP6).

DPP6's interaction with extracellular matrix proteins and its involvement in cell adhesion further contribute to its role in synaptic development and maintenance, impacting learning and memory processes (Lin2013DPP6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DPP6 gene have been linked to several neurodegenerative and neurological conditions. In Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), rare variants of DPP6, including missense mutations, have been associated with reduced RNA and protein levels in the brain, potentially serving as biomarkers for diagnosis. These mutations can lead to neuronal hyperexcitability, contributing to dementia by affecting neuronal firing homeostasis (Cacace2019Loss; Malloy2022Neuronal). DPP6 is also implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to susceptibility, although functional variants remain unidentified (Zhang2021The; Malloy2022Neuronal).

In the context of psychiatric disorders, DPP6 has been identified as a risk gene for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with mutations such as Arg322Cys potentially impairing its function. It is also associated with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and schizophrenia, where increased DPP6 mRNA transcripts have been observed in cortical neurons (Malloy2022Neuronal). Additionally, DPP6 is linked to familial idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, where its overexpression affects cardiac function, leading to sudden cardiac death (Bergeman2023Outcomes). These associations highlight the gene's significant role in both neurological and cardiac conditions.

## Interactions
DPP6, or dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6, is known for its interactions with Kv4 potassium channels, particularly Kv4.2, where it acts as an auxiliary subunit. This interaction is crucial for modulating the channels' function, including enhancing their surface expression and accelerating their kinetics. DPP6 interacts with the S1 and S2 transmembrane domains of the Kv4.2 voltage sensor through its N-terminal and transmembrane domains, which is essential for the trafficking and membrane stability of Kv4.2 channels (Malloy2022Neuronal).

DPP6 also interacts with Myosin-X, a molecular motor involved in filopodia formation, suggesting a role in transporting DPP6 to the tips of filopodia. At these tips, DPP6's large extracellular domain interacts with extracellular matrix proteins like fibronectin, promoting cell adhesion and filopodia stability (Lin2013DPP6).

The protein's interaction with the extracellular matrix is mediated through its extracellular domain, which is similar to that of DPPIV (CD26) and binds to components like collagen, fibronectin, and integrin β1. This interaction supports filopodia formation and stability, impacting synaptic development and function (Lin2013DPP6; Malloy2022Neuronal).
