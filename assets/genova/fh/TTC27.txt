# TTC27

## Overview
TTC27 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 27, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. These domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in the assembly of multi-protein complexes involved in various cellular processes such as chaperone activity, cell-cycle regulation, transcription, and protein transport (Hughes2014The; Metzger2012GenomeWide). The TTC27 protein is also a target for covalent polyphosphorylation, a post-translational modification that may influence its function and interactions (Azevedo2018Screening). The gene is conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Hughes2014The). Although specific interactions and functions of TTC27 are not fully elucidated, its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD suggests a role in transcriptional regulation and cytoskeleton-related processes (Harich2020From). Further research is necessary to fully understand the biological significance and clinical implications of TTC27.

## Structure
The TTC27 protein is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These TPR domains typically form a helical structure that facilitates the assembly of multi-protein complexes (Hughes2014The; Metzger2012GenomeWide). The TPR motifs are crucial for the functioning of multiprotein complexes involved in various cellular processes, including chaperone activity, cell-cycle regulation, transcription, and protein transport (Metzger2012GenomeWide).

In terms of post-translational modifications, TTC27 has been identified as a covalent polyphosphorylation target, which suggests that it undergoes modifications that may influence its function and interactions (Azevedo2018Screening). The protein's involvement in polyphosphorylation was demonstrated through protein mobility shift assays, indicating a clear mobility shift on Bis-Tris Gels/NuPAGE (Azevedo2018Screening).

The TTC27 gene is conserved across species, with high similarity to the C. elegans trd-1 gene, which also contains TPR domains (Hughes2014The). This conservation suggests a fundamental role in cellular processes across different organisms. However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of TTC27 are not provided in the available context.

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TTC27, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 27, is involved in protein interactions through polyphosphorylation, a process where inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) covalently attaches to proteins. This modification can influence protein mobility and function. A study by Azevedo et al. identified TTC27 as a target for covalent polyphosphorylation, which suggests that it may participate in interactions that are modulated by this post-translational modification (Azevedo2018Screening).

The role of TTC27 in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ADHD, has been explored, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids were not detailed in the context provided. The study by Harich et al. mentions TTC27 in the context of ADHD-related gene modules, indicating its potential involvement in transcriptional regulation and cytoskeleton-related processes, which are crucial for cellular interactions and signaling pathways (Harich2020From).

While the specific protein-protein interactions of TTC27 are not extensively detailed in the provided context, its involvement in polyphosphorylation and potential links to neurodevelopmental processes suggest that it may play a role in complex cellular interaction networks. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise nature of these interactions.
