# CCDC30

## Overview
CCDC30, or coiled-coil domain containing 30, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains. These domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC30 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction capabilities. Although the specific biological functions of CCDC30 remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in cancer. Notably, CCDC30 is involved in gene fusions, such as the CCDC30-ROS1 fusion observed in papillary thyroid carcinoma, which is significant for its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2021Kinase; Chu2020Clinicopathologic). Additionally, CCDC30 is part of a gene signature associated with poor prognosis in thymic epithelial tumors, highlighting its potential role in tumor progression (Tito2020LINC00174). Despite its involvement in these pathological conditions, CCDC30 does not appear to play a significant role in the response to H1N1 influenza virus infection (Choi2014Plasma).

## Clinical Significance
CCDC30 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to cancer. In thymic epithelial tumors (TETs), CCDC30 is part of a gene signature associated with the long non-coding RNA LINC00174. High expression of this gene signature, including CCDC30, is linked to poor overall survival in patients with TETs. This suggests that alterations in CCDC30 expression may contribute to the progression of these tumors (Tito2020LINC00174).

In thyroid cancer, CCDC30 is involved in a fusion with the ROS1 gene, known as the CCDC30-ROS1 fusion. This fusion has been observed in a case of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and is associated with kinase fusion-related thyroid carcinomas. Such fusions are significant because they can be targeted with specific kinase inhibitors, offering potential therapeutic options for affected patients (Liu2021Kinase; Chu2020Clinicopathologic).

While CCDC30 was analyzed in the context of H1N1 influenza virus infection, it did not show significant differential expression changes in infected patients compared to controls, indicating that its role in this condition may be limited or non-significant (Choi2014Plasma).
