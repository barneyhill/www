# UACA

## Overview
UACA, or uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to apoptosis and immune response modulation. The UACA protein is characterized by structural motifs such as coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Hahn2006Duplication). It is expressed in multiple tissues, including the thyroid and eye muscles, and its expression can be modulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (Ohkura2004Detection). Functionally, UACA interacts with key cellular components like Apaf-1 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), influencing apoptotic pathways and immune responses (Krepela2012Downregulated). Clinically, UACA is significant in the context of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and autoimmune diseases such as Graves' disease and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, where it acts as an autoantigen (Yamada2001Identification; Ohkura2004Detection; Krepela2012Downregulated). These roles underscore its importance in both cancer biology and autoimmune pathogenesis.

## Structure
The UACA protein, encoded by the UACA gene, is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions and mediate protein binding, respectively (Hahn2006Duplication). The protein consists of 1449 amino acids, with a specific C-terminal fragment of 261 amino acids being utilized in studies due to challenges in producing the full protein (Ohkura2004Detection). This fragment represents 18.0% of the entire protein and has been used in the preparation of a GST-UACA fusion protein for antibody detection assays (Ohkura2004Detection).

UACA is expressed in various tissues, including thyroid and eye muscle tissues, and its expression is influenced by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which recruits UACA into the nucleus (Ohkura2004Detection). The protein is encoded as a 160 kDa protein and shows increased expression in response to TSH stimulation (Ohkura2004Detection). Despite its known structural motifs, detailed information on the tertiary and quaternary structures of UACA is not provided in the available context. The protein's role in autoimmune diseases, such as Graves' disease, highlights its significance in clinical research (Ohkura2004Detection).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
UACA is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), UACA expression is frequently down-regulated, which may contribute to genomic instability and tumor progression by affecting apoptosome activation (Krepela2012Downregulated). The down-regulation of UACA is observed in various histopathological types of NSCLC and is more pronounced in early-stage tumors (Krepela2012Downregulated).

In autoimmune diseases, UACA is identified as a novel autoantigen. It is associated with autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Graves' disease, where anti-UACA antibodies are prevalent, particularly in patients with severe ophthalmopathy (Ohkura2004Detection). The presence of these antibodies suggests a role for UACA in the pathogenesis of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, potentially contributing to eye muscle inflammation (Ohkura2004Detection).

UACA is also linked to panuveitis, including Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, where it acts as a shared autoantigen in autoimmune responses affecting the eyes and other organs (Yamada2001Identification). These findings highlight UACA's involvement in both cancer and autoimmune conditions, underscoring its clinical significance.

## Interactions
UACA, or uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One significant interaction is with Apaf-1, a key component of the apoptosome apparatus. UACA facilitates the translocation of Apaf-1 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in response to proapoptotic stress, which may impact the activation of the apoptosome apparatus, a process often impaired in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells (Krepela2012Downregulated). This interaction suggests a role for UACA in regulating apoptosis and maintaining genomic stability.

UACA also interacts with the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor involved in immune and inflammatory responses. UACA prevents NF-κB from entering the nucleus, thereby reducing the expression of NF-κB-targeted genes (Krepela2012Downregulated). This interaction indicates a potential role for UACA in modulating immune responses and inflammation.

These interactions highlight UACA's involvement in critical cellular pathways, including apoptosis regulation and immune response modulation, which may have implications for diseases such as NSCLC and autoimmune disorders. However, specific details on other protein interactions or nucleic acid interactions involving UACA are not provided in the available context.
