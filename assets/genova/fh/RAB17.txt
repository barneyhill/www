# RAB17

## Overview
RAB17 is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein known as RAB17. This protein is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells and plays a critical role in intracellular membrane trafficking, particularly in processes such as transcytosis and receptor recycling. As a small GTPase, RAB17 is involved in maintaining cell polarity by regulating the transport of proteins and lipids within polarized epithelial cells. It is localized mainly to endosomal compartments, where it facilitates the sorting and transport of cellular materials. RAB17's interactions with other proteins, such as Rabex-5 and ALS2, further underscore its importance in endosomal maturation and neurite morphogenesis. Clinically, RAB17 has been implicated in colorectal cancer, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis (Jiang2022The; Yin2016Rab17; Lütcke1993Rab17).

## Structure
The RAB17 protein is a small GTPase specific to epithelial cells, characterized by a 214-amino acid sequence. Its primary structure includes four highly conserved regions that form the GTP-binding site, essential for its function as a GTPase (Lütcke1993Rab17). The protein also features a COOH-terminal isoprenylation motif of the CCXX type, which is a common post-translational modification aiding in membrane attachment (Lütcke1993Rab17). 

Structurally, RAB17 is most similar to the rab5-rab6 group of proteins but has distinct differences, such as a cysteine at position 53 in the effector loop and a unique histidine at position 85 in the switch II region, compared to alanine and isoleucine in rab5 and rab6, respectively. These differences suggest that RAB17 belongs to a distinct branch of the rab subfamily (Lütcke1993Rab17). 

The protein's tertiary structure is not detailed in the available context, nor is there information on its quaternary structure. However, the presence of conserved GTP-binding motifs and a COOH-terminal cysteine motif are typical features of small GTPases, indicating its role in intracellular membrane trafficking (Lütcke1993Rab17).

## Function
Rab17 is a small GTPase involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly in polarized epithelial cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cell polarity by regulating membrane trafficking pathways, including transcytosis and receptor recycling. Rab17 is predominantly localized to endosomal compartments, especially recycling endosomes, where it facilitates the transport of proteins and lipids essential for cellular homeostasis (Lütcke1993Rab17; Ono2020ALS2).

In epithelial cells, Rab17 is associated with the basolateral plasma membrane and apical-dense tubules, suggesting its involvement in specialized membrane transport pathways. It is induced during epithelial cell polarization, preceding the appearance of apical markers, indicating a role in generating apical-basolateral polarity (Lütcke1993Rab17). Rab17 is also implicated in transcytosis, a transport pathway unique to polarized epithelial cells, and is essential for receptor-mediated transcytosis and receptor recycling through the apical recycling compartment (Yin2016Rab17).

In macrophages, Rab17 mediates the differential sorting of antigens following efferocytosis and phagocytosis, directing efferocytosed materials away from the MHC class II pathway, thus maintaining an anti-inflammatory state and preventing autoimmunity (Yin2016Rab17).

## Clinical Significance
RAB17, a member of the RAS oncogene family, has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) due to its altered expression levels. Studies have shown that RAB17 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its overexpression in CRC cell lines promotes cell proliferation by regulating cell cycle progression. Specifically, RAB17 facilitates the transition from the S phase to the G2/M phase, which is associated with increased levels of cell cycle checkpoint proteins CDK2 and cyclin B1, thereby promoting tumor growth (Jiang2022The). 

RAB17 is also considered an independent prognostic marker for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in CRC patients. Its mRNA expression correlates with clinicopathological features such as pN status, pM status, and TNM stage, making it a potential marker for stratifying patients who might benefit from chemotherapy (Jiang2022The). 

Beyond cancer, RAB17 is involved in the regulation of endosomal maturation and sorting, interacting with proteins such as ALS2 and RABGEF1. These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of recycling endosomes, and disruptions in these processes could potentially contribute to other diseases, although specific clinical implications are not detailed (Ono2020ALS2).

## Interactions
RAB17, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its function in intracellular membrane trafficking. RAB17 interacts with Rabex-5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which activates RAB17 by facilitating its translocation from the cell body to dendrites in hippocampal neurons. This interaction is crucial for neurite morphogenesis, as demonstrated by the increased dendritic localization of RAB17 upon Rabex-5 overexpression (Mori2013Rabex5).

RAB17 also interacts with ALS2, another protein involved in endosomal maturation. Although ALS2 does not act as a GEF for RAB17, it regulates the localization of RAB17 to endosomes, influencing their maturation and sorting processes (Ono2020ALS2). In the context of influenza A virus trafficking, RAB17 interacts with viral proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) within lipid raft microdomains, facilitating their transport to the apical plasma membrane in host cells (Sato2019Apical).

In macrophages, RAB17 is recruited to efferosomes, where it plays a role in antigen sorting following efferocytosis and phagocytosis. This recruitment is essential for directing efferocytosed materials away from the MHC class II compartment, thus preventing autoantigen presentation and maintaining an anti-inflammatory state (Yin2016Rab17).
