# DDA1

## Overview
DDA1 (DET1 and DDB1 associated 1) is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, specifically as a component of the CRL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is involved in the regulation of protein degradation, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression. DDA1 interacts with DDB1 and CSA within the CRL4 CSA complex, playing a role in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) by modulating the ubiquitination of key substrates. Although the precise functions of DDA1 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, its involvement in critical cellular pathways underscores its importance. The protein's interactions and regulatory roles suggest potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Perea2019Association; Llerena2024The; Hrecka2007Lentiviral).

## Structure
The DDA1 protein is a component of the CRL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. Structurally, DDA1 is characterized by its interaction with DDB1, primarily through its N-terminal 28 amino acids (DDA1-NT), which are essential for binding. This interaction is mediated by conserved hydrophobic residues that anchor DDA1-NT to a hydrophobic groove on the DDB1 BPA domain, away from the CUL4A and DCAF binding sites (Shabek2018Structural).

In the context of the CRL4 CSA complex, DDA1 interacts with both DDB1 and CSA. The cryo-EM structure of the UVSSA-CSA-DDB1-DDA1 complex reveals that DDA1's C-terminal helix interacts with CSA, although this interaction is described as unstable, indicating variability in this region (Llerena2024The). The interaction with DDB1 involves residues 2-75 of DDA1, similar to previously known structures (Llerena2024The).

DDA1 is also involved in the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) process, where it modulates the activity of the CRL4 CSA complex. This modulation is crucial for the ubiquitination of RNA polymerase II and other TC-NER proteins, influencing the repair dynamics and stability of the complex (Llerena2024The).

## Function
The DDA1 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This system is responsible for targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, regulating cell cycle progression, and facilitating DNA repair (Hrecka2007Lentiviral). The DDA1 protein is involved in modulating the interactions within the DDA1-DDB1-VprBP complex, potentially recruiting additional components and altering its function (Hrecka2007Lentiviral).

In healthy human cells, the specific functions of DDA1 remain less defined, but it is known to be active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing various cellular pathways (Hrecka2007Lentiviral). The protein's involvement in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex suggests a role in the regulation of DNA repair, replication, and cell cycle progression through the ubiquitination of key substrates (Hrecka2007Lentiviral). Despite its inclusion in the complex, the normal functions of DDA1 in healthy human cells are not fully understood, highlighting an area for further research (Hrecka2007Lentiviral).

## Clinical Significance
DDA1 (DET1 and DDB1 associated 1) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. Alterations in DDA1 expression or its interactions can contribute to oncogenesis. For instance, DDA1 is associated with early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), where it is located in a chromosomal region frequently gained in these cancers, potentially influencing tumor progression through the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NFκB) (Perea2019Association). 

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DDA1 is overstimulated due to the action of long non-coding RNAs like HOTTIP, which sponges the tumor suppressor miR-608, leading to enhanced oncogenic activity (Zimta2019Long). Additionally, DDA1 is involved in the development of type II diabetes (T2D) in db/db mice, where its upregulation in liver tissues is linked to the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, affecting cell survival and glucose metabolism (Zhang2017Genomescale). These findings suggest that DDA1 plays a significant role in various pathological conditions, particularly those related to cancer and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
DDA1 (DET1 and DDB1 associated 1) is a protein that participates in several critical interactions within the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. It is a core component of the CRL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex, interacting directly with DDB1. The N-terminal 28 amino acids of DDA1 are necessary and sufficient for binding DDB1, with a high binding affinity (Kd ~45 nM). This interaction is mediated by hydrophobic and polar contacts, with several conserved residues playing critical roles (Shabek2018Structural).

DDA1 is also a component of the CRL4 CSA complex, which is involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). Within this complex, DDA1 interacts with CSA and DDB1, forming part of the substrate recognition module. The interaction with CSA is less stable and involves different conformations, suggesting a low-affinity and transient interaction (Llerena2024The). DDA1 is positioned within a cavity formed by CSA, DDB1, and CSB, and is crucial for the proper localization of CSA, as its absence results in mislocalization of CSA to the cytoplasm (Llerena2024The).

DDA1 does not associate with the CRL4 DDB2 complex, indicating a selective interaction with CRL4 CSA (Llerena2024The). It modulates the interaction between the CRL4 CSA complex and the COP9 signalosome complex, influencing the ubiquitination activity of the complex (Llerena2024The).
