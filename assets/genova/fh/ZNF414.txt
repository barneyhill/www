# ZNF414

## Overview
ZNF414 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 414, which is categorized as a zinc finger protein due to its characteristic structural motif that facilitates binding to nucleic acids. This protein is implicated in nuclear transport processes, functioning as a cargo protein that is transported to the nucleus by KPNA7, a member of the karyopherin alpha family (Vuorinen2017Search). ZNF414 contains multiple classical nuclear localization signals, suggesting its potential role as a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression (Vuorinen2017Search). The protein has been associated with cancer cell growth, particularly in pancreatic cancer, where its expression appears to promote cell proliferation (Vuorinen2017Search). The study of ZNF414 is ongoing, with research focusing on its interactions and regulatory functions within the nucleus, as well as its broader implications in cancer pathogenesis and potential clinical significance (Vuorinen2017Search).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF414 has been identified as a potential regulator of cancer cell growth, particularly in the context of pancreatic cancer. The protein is transported into the nucleus by KPNA7, a nuclear import protein that is overexpressed in some pancreatic cancer cell lines. This nuclear transport is crucial for the growth of these cancer cells (Vuorinen2017Search). Silencing ZNF414 in Hs700T pancreatic cancer cells results in a significant decrease in cell proliferation, with a 40% reduction in cell number observed 96 hours post-transfection. This suggests that ZNF414 plays a role in cancer cell growth regulation, potentially contributing to the phenotype observed when KPNA7 is silenced, which includes G1 arrest and decreased proliferation (Vuorinen2017Search).

The study by Vuorinen et al. highlights the potential involvement of ZNF414 in cancer-related processes, although its specific clinical significance requires further investigation. The research suggests that alterations in the expression or function of ZNF414 could impact cancer cell proliferation, making it a candidate for further study in cancer biology (Vuorinen2017Search). However, the clinical implications of ZNF414 in diseases other than cancer have not been extensively studied, and more research is needed to fully understand its role in human health and disease.

## Interactions
ZNF414, a zinc finger protein, is known to interact with KPNA7, a member of the karyopherin alpha family, which is involved in nuclear transport processes. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that ZNF414 is a cargo protein transported to the nucleus by KPNA7 (Vuorinen2017Search). The study identified ZNF414 as having multiple classical nuclear localization signals, suggesting its role in nuclear functions, potentially as a transcription factor (Vuorinen2017Search).

The interaction between ZNF414 and KPNA7 is significant in the context of cancer cell growth regulation. Silencing ZNF414 in pancreatic cancer cell lines resulted in a marked decrease in cell proliferation, highlighting its role in promoting cancer cell growth (Vuorinen2017Search). This suggests that ZNF414 may participate in regulatory interactions within the nucleus, possibly involving nucleic acids or other proteins, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The study underscores the importance of ZNF414 in the nuclear import process mediated by KPNA7 and its potential implications in cancer pathogenesis (Vuorinen2017Search).
