# KRT35

## Overview
KRT35 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 35, a type I keratin that plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells, particularly within hair follicles. As a member of the intermediate filament family, keratin 35 contributes to the formation of a resilient filamentous network that provides mechanical support to cells. The protein is characterized by a central alpha-helical rod domain, which facilitates the formation of stable dimeric structures through coiled-coil motifs. These dimers, often formed with type II keratins such as KRT85, are essential for the assembly of intermediate filaments that maintain the structural stability of hair and other epithelial tissues (Duchstein2015Atomistic; Ho2022Update). The expression of KRT35 is notably involved in hair follicle biology, with its downregulation linked to conditions such as alopecia areata and AEC syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in hair and skin health (Clements2012Mutations; Fuentes‐Duculan2016Biomarkers).

## Structure
Keratin 35 (KRT35) is a type I keratin protein that is part of the intermediate filament family, providing structural support in epithelial cells. Its primary structure consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains (Ho2022Update). The secondary structure is characterized by coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate the formation of stable dimeric structures. These dimers can be either homodimeric or heterodimeric, typically forming antiparallel tetramers that serve as the basic building blocks for higher-order assemblies (Ho2022Update).

The tertiary and quaternary structures of KRT35 involve its assembly into intermediate filaments through interactions with type II keratins. This assembly is crucial for the formation of the filamentous network that provides mechanical resilience to cells (Ho2022Update). The protein's structure is further stabilized by disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues, which are significant for maintaining the integrity and mechanical properties of the keratin dimer (Duchstein2015Atomistic).

Common post-translational modifications of KRT35 include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell (Ho2022Update).

## Function
KRT35 (keratin 35) is a type I keratin gene that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells, particularly within hair follicles. It is involved in the formation and maintenance of hair structure by contributing to the assembly of intermediate filaments. These filaments are essential for providing mechanical support and resilience to cells, allowing them to withstand physical stress (Ho2022Update; Zhang2023Labelfree).

KRT35 is expressed in the matrix and precortex cuticle near the bulb of hair follicles, where it is one of the early-stage hair keratins. Its expression is significantly downregulated in the lesional scalp of patients with alopecia areata (AA), a condition characterized by hair loss. However, post-treatment, KRT35 expression is significantly upregulated, suggesting its role in hair follicle recovery and regrowth (Fuentes‐Duculan2016Biomarkers).

In healthy human cells, KRT35 interacts with type II keratins to form stable heterodimers, which are the building blocks of intermediate filaments. These interactions are crucial for the proper alignment and assembly of the filaments, ensuring the structural stability of hair and other epithelial tissues (Ho2022Update).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the KRT35 gene, which encodes keratin 35, have been implicated in various hair disorders. In AEC syndrome, a condition caused by mutations in the transcription factor p63, there is a notable downregulation of KRT35 expression. This downregulation is associated with changes in hair follicle biology, contributing to clinical features such as sparse hair or alopecia (Clements2012Mutations). The study highlights that KRT35, along with other hair-associated keratins, is downregulated in both intact and eroded skin of individuals with AEC syndrome, suggesting its role in hair and nail homeostasis (Clements2012Mutations).

Although KRT35 is not directly linked to specific diseases outside of AEC syndrome, the downregulation of keratins, including KRT35, may contribute to skin fragility and hair abnormalities observed in this condition (Clements2012Mutations). The expression of KRT35 is not significantly affected by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which regulates other keratin genes, indicating a distinct regulatory mechanism for KRT35 in hair follicle biology (Ramot2011TSH). Overall, the altered expression of KRT35 in certain conditions underscores its importance in maintaining hair and skin integrity.

## Interactions
KRT35, a type I keratin protein, primarily interacts with type II keratins to form heterodimers, which are essential for the structural integrity of keratinized tissues such as hair. Specifically, KRT35 forms a dimer with KRT85, a type II keratin, to create intermediate filaments that contribute to the mechanical stability and resilience of hair fibers. This interaction is facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and protein-protein hydrogen bonding, which help maintain the coiled coil structure of the dimer in aqueous solutions (Duchstein2015Atomistic).

The presence of cysteine groups in KRT35 is significant for its interaction with KRT85, as these groups form disulfide bonds between the monomers. These disulfide bonds are crucial for the dimer's structural integrity and mechanical properties, particularly under tensile load. The study by Duchstein et al. highlights that under mechanical stress, the keratin dimer exhibits a broad elastic regime followed by a viscoelastic/creep regime, with hydrogen bonds gradually dissociating under tensile load (Duchstein2015Atomistic).

While specific interactions involving KRT35 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context, its role in forming stable keratin structures through interactions with KRT85 is well-documented.
