# ZNF335

## Overview
ZNF335 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 335, a transcription factor integral to neurogenesis and brain development. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. As a component of the H3K4 methyltransferase complex, zinc finger protein 335 plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and the regulation of gene expression, particularly in neural progenitor cells. It is essential for maintaining these cells in the cell cycle, thereby influencing neuronal differentiation and cortical development. Mutations in ZNF335 are linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including microcephaly, underscoring its critical function in neural development (Yang2012Microcephaly; Caglayan2020Biallelic).

## Structure
ZNF335, also known as zinc finger protein 335, is a protein characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein comprises 1,342 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 144,893 Da (Naveed2018Comprehensive). It features a 13 C2H2 zinc finger-repeating structure, which is part of the C2H2-ZF family, known for its role in gene transcription regulation (Wang2023Zfp335). These zinc finger domains facilitate the protein's interaction with DNA and are essential for its function in regulating gene expression.

ZNF335 is involved in the recruitment of histone methyltransferase complexes to gene promoters, playing a significant role in transcriptional activation (Naveed2018Comprehensive). The protein is part of the vertebrate-specific trithorax H3K4-methylation chromatin remodeling complex, which is crucial for controlling central nervous system gene expression and cell fate (Yang2012Microcephaly).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. ZNF335 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its function and localization (Naveed2018Comprehensive). These structural features underscore its critical role in neurogenesis and brain development.

## Function
ZNF335, also known as zinc finger protein 335, is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in neurogenesis and brain development. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with chromatin-remodeling complexes, specifically the H3K4 methyltransferase complex, which influences the expression of key developmental genes through histone modification (Yang2012Microcephaly). ZNF335 is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, maintaining these cells in the cell cycle and preventing premature cell-cycle exit, which is crucial for proper neuronal fate determination and cortical layering (Yang2012Microcephaly).

In healthy human cells, ZNF335 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and modulates the transcription of target genes essential for cell cycle progression and neuronal differentiation (Yang2012Microcephaly). It regulates the expression of REST/NRSF, a master regulator of neural gene expression and cell fate, by binding to its promoter region (Yang2012Microcephaly). The gene's expression peaks during cortical neurogenesis and is present in progenitor cells, indicating its significant role in neurogenesis and other developmental processes (Yang2012Microcephaly).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF335 gene are associated with severe microcephaly, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a significantly reduced brain size and intellectual disability. These mutations can lead to profound microcephaly, neuronal degeneration, and neonatal death, as observed in a consanguineous Arab Israeli family where affected individuals had a head circumference 9 standard deviations below the mean (Yang2012Microcephaly). The ZNF335 gene is crucial for neural progenitor self-renewal and neurogenesis, and its deficiency results in disrupted progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation, leading to severely reduced cortical size (Yang2012Microcephaly).

Specific mutations, such as the c.3332 g > a mutation, disrupt normal splicing and result in reduced levels of the ZNF335 protein, which is essential for early brain development (Yang2012Microcephaly). Biallelic mutations in ZNF335 have also been linked to basal ganglia abnormalities and progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, with symptoms including developmental delay and intellectual disability (Caglayan2020Biallelic). The gene's role in regulating histone methylation and expression of specific genes, including REST/NRSF, is critical for neural development, and its mutations can lead to abnormal neuronal morphology and incomplete neuronal differentiation (Yang2012Microcephaly).

## Interactions
ZNF335, also known as zinc finger protein 335, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in neural development. It is a component of the H3K4 methyltransferase complex, interacting with proteins such as MLL, SETD1A, CFP1, ASH2, RbBP5, and WDR5. This complex is analogous to the TrxG complex in Drosophila and the COMPASS complex in yeast, both essential for gene expression activation (Yang2012Microcephaly). ZNF335 binds to the promoter region of REST/NRSF, a master regulator of neuronal differentiation, and this interaction is crucial for its role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation (Yang2012Microcephaly).

ZNF335 also interacts with the CCR4-NOT complex, including members like CNOT6 and CNOT9, which are involved in transcription and mRNA deadenylation. Although a direct interaction with CNOT3 has not been reported, there are strong correlations between their gene expression changes in response to statins, suggesting co-regulation (Theusch2024Participantderived). These interactions highlight ZNF335's role in regulating gene expression through its involvement in multiprotein complexes and its influence on chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation.
