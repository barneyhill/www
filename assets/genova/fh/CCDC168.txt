# CCDC168

## Overview
The CCDC168 gene encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 168, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CCDC168 may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC168 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its structural characteristics imply potential involvement in intracellular signaling pathways or structural organization within the cell. Further research is needed to determine the precise role of CCDC168 in cellular physiology and its implications in health and disease.
