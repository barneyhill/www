# PLEKHA2

## Overview
PLEKHA2 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology domain containing A2, which is involved in phosphoinositide signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, enabling it to specifically bind to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), a critical phospholipid in cell membranes that functions as a second messenger in numerous cellular processes (KittelSchneider2017Lithiuminduced). The protein plays a significant role in cellular signaling, particularly in pathways involving phosphoinositides, and is implicated in the regulation of proteins such as AKT and PDK1, which are essential for processes like endocytosis, membrane morphology, cell polarization, and migration (Durrant2020Identification). PLEKHA2's high affinity for PtdIns(3,4)P2 suggests a specialized role in cellular signaling and potentially in platelet function, although its precise function in platelets is not yet fully understood (Durrant2020Identification). Additionally, PLEKHA2 has been identified as a potential interaction partner of human protein kinase D2 (PKD2), highlighting its involvement in complex protein-protein interactions that modulate cellular signaling dynamics (Häupl2016Protein).

## Structure


## Function
PLEKHA2, also known as TAPP2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in phosphoinositide signaling pathways. This protein contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which allows it to bind specifically to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), a phospholipid component of cell membranes that also acts as a second messenger in various cellular processes (KittelSchneider2017Lithiuminduced). 

In healthy human cells, PLEKHA2 is implicated in cellular signaling, particularly in pathways involving phosphoinositides. It plays a role in regulating proteins such as AKT and PDK1, which are crucial for cell signaling, endocytosis, membrane morphology, cell polarization, and migration (Durrant2020Identification). PLEKHA2, along with PLEKHA1, is known for its high affinity for PtdIns(3,4)P2, suggesting a specific role in cellular signaling and potentially in platelet function, although its exact function in platelets remains to be fully elucidated (Durrant2020Identification).

The protein's interaction with PtdIns(3,4)P2 is significant, as it may restrain AKT activity by recruiting proteins like the PTPL1 phosphatase or by directly competing with AKT for PtdIns(3,4)P2 binding (Durrant2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
PLEKHA2 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In osteoporosis, particularly in postmenopausal women, PLEKHA2 is one of the differentially methylated genes identified, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target. This highlights the importance of understanding epigenetic mechanisms in osteoporosis (Zhou2020Alterations).

In the context of bipolar disorder, lithium treatment has been shown to significantly increase PLEKHA2 expression after long-term treatment. This suggests that lithium may exert its effects by modulating phosphoinositide signaling pathways, potentially affecting downstream enzyme activity (KittelSchneider2017Lithiuminduced).

PLEKHA2 is also associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The gene is located on the 8p11.22 locus, which is frequently amplified in metastatic PDAC patients. This suggests a potential role for PLEKHA2 in cancer metastasis, although its direct clinical significance in PDAC remains to be fully elucidated (Tong2022Proteogenomic).

These findings indicate that PLEKHA2 may play a role in various diseases through its involvement in key signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PLEKHA2, also known as pleckstrin homology domain containing A2, is involved in various protein interactions that are significant for cellular signaling pathways. One notable interaction is with phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), a phosphoinositide that plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as endocytosis and cell migration. PLEKHA2 has a high affinity for PtdIns(3,4)P2, which suggests its involvement in platelet function and signaling (Durrant2020Identification).

In the context of protein-protein interactions, PLEKHA2 was identified as a potential interaction partner of human protein kinase D2 (PKD2) with a significant enrichment factor, indicating a strong interaction. This was discovered through a study using chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, which highlighted the effectiveness of this method in capturing specific binding partners (Häupl2016Protein).

PLEKHA2 is also implicated in the regulation of signaling pathways, such as insulin and PI3K signaling, where it may provide negative feedback by interacting with other proteins like PTPL1 phosphatase or competing with AKT for PtdIns(3,4)P2 binding (Durrant2020Identification). These interactions underscore the role of PLEKHA2 in modulating cellular signaling dynamics.
