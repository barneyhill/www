# DCST2

## Overview
DCST2 (DC-STAMP domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in critical cellular fusion processes, particularly in gamete fusion and skeletal growth. The DCST2 protein is essential for the fusion of sperm and egg cells, a vital step in fertilization, and is part of a conserved family of DC-STAMP-like domain-containing proteins that play a significant role in male fertility. It is predominantly expressed in the testis, especially in mid-round spermatids, and is crucial for the sperm-egg fusion process. Beyond its reproductive functions, DCST2 is implicated in skeletal growth, with genetic variants linked to variations in birth length, infant length, and adult height. The protein's role extends to bone homeostasis, although its specific functions in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated. Additionally, DCST2 has been identified as a potential biomarker in colon cancer, with its expression levels correlating with patient outcomes (Han2022Biomarkers; van2014A; Noda2022Sperm).

## Function
DCST2 (DC-STAMP domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular fusion processes, particularly in the context of gamete fusion and skeletal growth. In mammals, DCST2 is essential for the fusion of sperm and egg cells, a critical step in fertilization. This protein is part of a conserved group of DC-STAMP-like domain-containing proteins, which are important for male fertility. It is abundantly expressed in the testis, particularly in mid-round spermatids, and is crucial for the sperm-egg fusion process. In mice, knockout studies have shown that sperm lacking DCST2 can bind to the oolemma but fail to fuse with the egg, leading to male sterility (Noda2021Sperm; Noda2022Sperm).

In addition to its role in reproduction, DCST2 is associated with skeletal growth. A genetic variant in the DCST2 gene has been linked to birth length, infant length, and adult height, suggesting that DCST2 influences early growth and adult stature. However, the specific function of DCST2 in healthy human cells, particularly in bone homeostasis, remains unclear, as no phenotype has been previously associated with it (van2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DCST2 gene have significant implications for male fertility. In mice, mutations in DCST2 lead to defects in sperm-egg fusion, resulting in male sterility. Despite normal sperm morphology and motility, sperm from DCST2 mutant mice can bind to the oolemma but fail to fuse with the egg membrane, highlighting the gene's critical role in fertilization (Noda2021Sperm; Noda2022Sperm). The fertility of these mutant mice can be restored by introducing a transgene expressing DCST2, confirming its essential role in sperm function (Noda2022Sperm).

In zebrafish, similar disruptions in the dcst2 gene also lead to sterility or subfertility, suggesting a conserved function across species (Noda2022Sperm). The gene's role extends beyond reproduction; it is also involved in bone homeostasis as a regulator of osteoclast cell-fusion, although specific diseases related to this function have not been directly linked to DCST2 mutations (Hyppönen2022Genetic).

Additionally, DCST2 has been identified as a potential biomarker in colon cancer, with higher expression levels associated with worse outcomes in patients, indicating its relevance in cancer prognosis (Han2022Biomarkers).

## Interactions
DCST2 is involved in the sperm-egg fusion process, primarily through its interaction with DCST1. These two proteins form a complex that is crucial for fertilization in mice and fish. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that DCST1 and DCST2 interact with each other, as shown in HEK293T cells where FLAG-tagged DCST1 was detected in the eluted protein complex when co-expressed with DCST2-3xHA (Noda2021Sperm; Noda2022Sperm). This interaction is essential for the sperm-egg fusion process, as knockout studies in mice and zebrafish have shown that the absence of either DCST1 or DCST2 leads to defects in this process, resulting in sterility or subfertility (Noda2022Sperm).

While DCST2 does not directly interact with IZUMO1, another protein involved in sperm-egg fusion, it is suggested that DCST1 and DCST2 may help organize the presentation of other fusion-related proteins on the sperm membrane (Noda2022Sperm). In zebrafish, the levels of DCST2 are significantly reduced in SPACA6 knockout sperm, indicating a regulatory relationship between SPACA6 and DCST2, although the exact nature of this interaction remains unclear (Binner2022The).
