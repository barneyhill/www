# SEMA5A

## Overview
SEMA5A is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 5A, a member of the semaphorin family known for its role in axonal guidance and cell signaling. Semaphorin 5A is a transmembrane protein characterized by a sema domain, a PSI domain, and multiple thrombospondin type-1 (TSP-1) repeats, which facilitate its interactions with receptors such as plexin-B3 (Artigiani2004Plexin‐B3). This protein is involved in various biological processes, including neural development, cell migration, and immune responses, by influencing cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins; Fard2021Semaphorins). SEMA5A's interactions with glycosaminoglycans, such as heparan sulfate, are crucial for its function, particularly in neuronal development and progenitor cell migration (Nagy2024Structure). Alterations in the SEMA5A gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its clinical significance (MoscaBoidron2015A; Wang2019De).

## Structure
SEMA5A, or semaphorin 5A, is a transmembrane protein characterized by its unique molecular structure, which includes a sema domain, a PSI domain, and seven thrombospondin type-1 (TSP-1) repeats (Artigiani2004Plexin‐B3). The sema domain is crucial for its role in axonal guidance and cell signaling, while the TSP-1 repeats are essential for interactions with its receptor, plexin-B3 (Artigiani2004Plexin‐B3).

The protein's secondary structure includes several thrombospondin type-1 repeat (TSR) domains, with TSR3-4 forming a rod-like dimer. The TSR3 domain exhibits a typical TSR fold stabilized by disulfide bonds and tryptophan-arginine ladders, while TSR4 shows a unique 3D domain-swapped architecture (Nagy2024Structure). This structure supports two positively charged cavities crucial for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding (Nagy2024Structure).

SEMA5A undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at 11 predicted Asn-linked sites, which are important for its function and interactions (Nagy2024Structure). The protein can oligomerize, forming dimers and higher-order structures in the presence of heparan sulfate, a type of GAG (Nagy2024Structure). This oligomerization is significant for its biological activity, particularly in neuronal development and migration (Nagy2024Structure).

## Function
SEMA5A (semaphorin 5A) is a protein involved in various cellular and molecular processes, primarily influencing cell morphology, cytoskeletal organization, and neural connectivity. It plays a significant role in axon guidance, a critical process in neural development, by interacting with receptors such as plexins and neuropilins, which are essential for its signaling pathways (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). SEMA5A is also involved in cell migration and vasculature patterning, contributing to the development and functioning of the nervous system and other systems like the cardiovascular and immune systems (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins).

In the immune system, SEMA5A induces T-cell and natural killer cell activation and proliferation, promoting the release of proinflammatory cytokines and influencing lymphocyte differentiation (Fard2021Semaphorins). It also acts as a pro-angiogenic factor, promoting angiogenesis in endothelial cells (Fard2021Semaphorins). SEMA5A's interactions with glycosaminoglycans, such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, are crucial for its function in cell signaling and migration, particularly in neural development and progenitor cell migration in the hippocampus (Nagy2024Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SEMA5A gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and infantile spasms (IS). De novo microdeletions and missense mutations in SEMA5A have been identified in individuals with ASD and ID, suggesting a potential link between SEMA5A dysfunction and these conditions (MoscaBoidron2015A). The gene is also associated with infantile spasms, where specific de novo mutations have been found to be damaging, potentially affecting axonal guidance and protein stability (Wang2019De).

SEMA5A is highly expressed in brain regions such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus during early development, and its dysfunction may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders, including epileptic encephalopathies (Wang2019De). The gene's regulatory network overlaps with rare autism-specific copy number variants, indicating its involvement in ASD risk (Cheng2013An). Additionally, mutations in SEMA5A, such as the R676C mutation, have been linked to ASD and epilepsy, affecting neuronal morphogenesis and signaling pathways (Okabe2024Autism; Okabe2023RhoGBinding).

## Interactions
SEMA5A interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and axon guidance. It specifically binds to plexin-B3, a high-affinity receptor, without requiring neuropilins, indicating a unique interaction mechanism. This binding is crucial for activating intracellular signaling pathways, including those involving the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, Met. The interaction between SEMA5A and plexin-B3 can trigger Met signaling, leading to cellular responses such as invasive growth and cellular collapse in fibroblasts expressing plexin-B3. This suggests that SEMA5A can elicit multiple functional responses through its interaction with plexin-B3, influencing processes like cell migration and morphogenesis (Artigiani2004Plexin‐B3).

SEMA5A also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), particularly heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS). These interactions are essential for SEMA5A's function in axon guidance and neuronal growth. The protein exhibits a preference for binding HS over CS, which mediates its oligomerization and influences its ability to switch between promoting and inhibiting axonal growth. Specific residues in SEMA5A are critical for these interactions, and mutations can disrupt its binding ability, highlighting the importance of these interactions in neural development (Nagy2024Structure).
