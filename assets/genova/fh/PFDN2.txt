# PFDN2

## Overview
PFDN2, or prefoldin subunit 2, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the prefoldin complex, a molecular chaperone involved in the folding of newly synthesized proteins. The prefoldin complex, which includes PFDN2, plays a critical role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by stabilizing and transporting unfolded proteins to the cytosolic chaperonin complex. This process is essential for the proper folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are vital for cytoskeletal organization and function (MillánZambrano2014Nuclear; Liang2020The). Beyond its role in cytoskeletal maintenance, PFDN2 is also implicated in mitochondrial function, supporting mitochondrial biogenesis and integrity, particularly under stress conditions (Tahmaz2023Prefoldin). The protein's involvement in various cellular pathways highlights its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, including its association with cancer progression and treatment resistance (Ke2022Comprehensive; He2023PFDN2).

## Function
Prefoldin subunit 2 (PFDN2) is a component of the prefoldin complex, a molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins. This complex is involved in the stabilization and transport of unfolded proteins to the cytosolic chaperonin complex, contributing to cellular protein homeostasis (Liang2020The). PFDN2 is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for cytoskeletal organization, particularly in the folding of actin and tubulin monomers, which are critical for cytoskeleton assembly (MillánZambrano2014Nuclear).

In addition to its role in cytoskeletal maintenance, PFDN2 is implicated in mitochondrial morphology and function. It supports mitochondrial biogenesis and function, potentially through interactions with mitochondrial precursor proteins and the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) channel, which is crucial for importing precursor proteins into mitochondria (Tahmaz2023Prefoldin). PFDN2 also plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity under stress conditions, such as heat shock, by influencing the assembly of respiratory chain complexes (Tahmaz2023Prefoldin).

Overall, PFDN2 is vital for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis, cytoskeletal integrity, and mitochondrial function, which are essential for cell viability and growth under various stress conditions (Tahmaz2023Prefoldin).

## Clinical Significance
PFDN2 (prefoldin subunit 2) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In gastric cancer (GC), PFDN2 is significantly overexpressed, particularly in higher-stage tumors, and is associated with poor prognosis and lower overall survival. It promotes cell cycle progression by enhancing MYBL2 expression through the nuclear translocation of hnRNPD, which facilitates the MYBL2 transcriptional program (He2023PFDN2).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), PFDN2 shows the highest mutation frequency among the prefoldin family proteins, with 35% of samples exhibiting alterations. High mRNA expression of PFDN2 correlates with poor overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and disease-specific survival, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Dai2021Identification).

PFDN2 is also involved in breast cancer, where genetic changes may lead to resistance to taxane chemotherapeutics due to its role in tubulin folding. This resistance occurs because taxane stabilizes microtubules to inhibit cell division, and abnormal PFDN2 can cause tubulin misfolding (The; p&gt; Mo2020&lt).

Additionally, PFDN2 has been linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through the presence of autoantibodies against it, which are associated with early onset of the disease (Chang2017Autoantibodies).

## Interactions
PFDN2, a subunit of the prefoldin complex, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is part of a hexameric chaperone complex composed of two α subunits (PFDN3 and PFDN5) and four β subunits (PFDN1, PFDN2, PFDN4, and PFDN6), which assists in the proper folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin (The; p&gt; Mo2020&lt; Liang2020The). PFDN2 interacts with the cytoplasmic chaperone protein TCP-1 (CCT) to facilitate the folding of these proteins, preventing their aggregation (Liang2020The).

In gastric cancer, PFDN2 has been shown to interact with hnRNPD, a member of the hnRNP family, to regulate MYBL2 expression. This interaction is significant for promoting cell cycle progression, as PFDN2 facilitates the nuclear translocation of hnRNPD, enhancing MYBL2 transcription (He2023PFDN2). Additionally, PFDN2 is involved in protein-protein interactions in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Ke2022Comprehensive).

PFDN2 also interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), particularly the pVHL213 isoform, suggesting a role in stabilizing pVHL against aggregation and degradation (Chesnel2020The). These interactions highlight PFDN2's involvement in various cellular pathways and its potential impact on tumor progression and treatment resistance.
