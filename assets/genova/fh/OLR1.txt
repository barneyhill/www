# OLR1

## Overview
The OLR1 gene encodes the oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1), a transmembrane receptor that belongs to the C-type lectin family. This receptor is primarily involved in the recognition and internalization of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism and vascular homeostasis. LOX-1 is expressed in various cell types, including endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells, where it contributes to processes such as cellular adhesion, immune response, and redox signaling. The receptor's structure includes a lectin-like domain essential for ligand binding, and it functions as a disulfide-linked homodimer. Alterations in the OLR1 gene have been implicated in cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions like atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction (UlrichMerzenich2013The; MEHTA2006Lectinlike; Bayoglu2019Glucose).

## Structure
The OLR1 gene encodes the LOX-1 protein, a type II membrane protein that is part of the C-type lectin family. The protein is composed of 273 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 50-52 kDa (Zeya2016Lectinlike; Mehta2002Identification). The structure of LOX-1 includes four domains: a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain, a connecting neck domain, and a C-terminal lectin-like domain (Dunn2007The; MEHTA2006Lectinlike).

The lectin-like domain is highly conserved and crucial for ligand binding, particularly oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) (MEHTA2006Lectinlike). This domain features six cysteine residues forming three intramolecular disulfide bonds, which are essential for maintaining its structure (Dunn2007The). The protein forms a heart-shaped homodimer with a central hydrophobic tunnel that can accommodate cholesterol molecules and other non-polar ligands (Zeya2016Lectinlike; MEHTA2006Lectinlike).

Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation of the extracellular domain, which can be cleaved to release a soluble form of the protein (MEHTA2006Lectinlike). The LOX-1 protein also has splice variants that affect its ligand recognition and binding capabilities (Zeya2016Lectinlike).

## Function
The OLR1 gene encodes the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), a scavenger receptor involved in the binding, internalization, and degradation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) particles. In healthy human cells, LOX-1 is expressed at low levels across various cell types, including endothelial cells, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and platelets. It plays a role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by mediating the removal of oxLDL from circulation and participating in redox signaling, acting as a sensor for oxidative stress (UlrichMerzenich2013The; Bayoglu2019Glucose).

LOX-1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as a disulfide-linked homodimer, essential for its ligand-binding activity. It consists of four domains, including a C-terminal lectin-like domain crucial for ligand binding and initiating internalization and phagocytosis (Biocca2008The). The receptor is involved in various cellular processes, such as cellular adhesion, glycoprotein turnover, and quick innate immune responses against pathogens (Taye2013Lectin‐like).

In healthy conditions, LOX-1 contributes to the regulation of LDL cholesterol particles, which can become oxidized and lead to vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. It also plays a role in the internalization of apoptotic cells and inflammatory proteins, contributing to immune response regulation (UlrichMerzenich2013The; Bayoglu2019Glucose).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the OLR1 gene, which encodes the oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiovascular diseases. Variants of the OLR1 gene, such as the LOXIN isoform, are associated with a protective effect against acute myocardial infarction (MI) by reducing apoptosis in response to oxidized LDL (oxLDL) (Mango2005In). The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OLR1 gene can influence the expression of its splicing isoforms, affecting the balance between LOX-1 and LOXIN, which is crucial for cardiovascular health (Mango2005In).

The SNP rs3736234 in the OLR1 gene is linked to alternative splicing that affects exon 5 inclusion, with the T-rs3736234 variant associated with a higher risk of coronary disease due to increased exon inclusion (Tejedor2015Role). Another SNP, c.501G.C, results in the p.K167N mutation, which reduces the receptor's ability to bind ox-LDL, potentially affecting the severity of coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis (Biocca2009Functional). These genetic variations can alter LDL metabolism and contribute to cardiovascular disease risk (Tejedor2015Role).

## Interactions
OLR1, also known as oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cancer and other diseases. OLR1 encodes the LOX-1 receptor, which is known for its ability to recognize and internalize oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). This interaction is crucial in processes such as lipid metabolism and inflammation, which are linked to tumorigenesis (Khaidakov2011Oxidized; Murdocca2021LOX1).

In cancer, OLR1 interacts with several signaling pathways. It is involved in the activation of NF-kB and AP-1 transcription factors, which regulate genes associated with apoptosis, proliferation, and immune responses (Khaidakov2011Oxidized). OLR1 also influences the expression of genes like RELA, BCL2, and CCND2, which are linked to oncogenic properties such as cell survival and proliferation (Khaidakov2011Oxidized).

OLR1's role extends to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, where it interacts with pathways like the STAT3 signaling pathway, contributing to cancer metastasis and immune escape (Murdocca2021LOX1; Wu2023OLR1). These interactions highlight OLR1's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
