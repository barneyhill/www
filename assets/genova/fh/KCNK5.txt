# KCNK5

## Overview
KCNK5 is a gene that encodes the potassium two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 5, commonly referred to as TASK-2. This protein is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, characterized by its four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit, which facilitate the formation of functional dimers. TASK-2 is a pH-sensitive, noninactivating background potassium channel that plays a significant role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability across various tissues, including the liver, lung, pancreas, and kidney. It is particularly important in processes such as volume regulation, bicarbonate handling, and apoptosis. TASK-2 channels are also involved in potassium recycling in the cochlea, essential for hearing, and in stabilizing bicarbonate transport in the kidney, crucial for acid-base balance. The channel's activity is modulated by extracellular pH and cell volume changes, and it is resistant to conventional potassium channel blockers, a hallmark of the TASK family (Niemeyer2001Modulation; Brazier2005Cloning; Sepúlveda2015Molecular; Cazals2015KCNK5).

## Structure
KCNK5, also known as TASK-2, is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family. The protein is characterized by having four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit, which are arranged in tandem (Niemeyer2001Modulation; Sepúlveda2015Molecular). These structural features allow KCNK5 to form functional dimers, with each monomer contributing to the selectivity filter of the channel (Niemeyer2003Extracellular). 

The channel's quaternary structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions rather than covalent disulfide bonds, although a conserved cysteine residue, C51, can form an intersubunit disulfide bridge. This bridge is not essential for the channel's activity, indicating that KCNK5 can function without it (Niemeyer2003Extracellular). 

KCNK5 is sensitive to changes in extracellular pH, being half-maximally activated at a pH of 8.0, and is also modulated by cell volume changes (Sepúlveda2015Molecular). The channel is resistant to conventional potassium channel blockers, which is a characteristic feature of the TASK family of channels (Niemeyer2001Modulation). Common post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of KCNK5, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The KCNK5 gene encodes a two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel, known as TASK-2, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability in various tissues. TASK-2 is a noninactivating, pH-sensitive background K+ channel involved in controlling excitability, volume regulation, bicarbonate handling, and apoptosis across a range of tissues, including the liver, lung, pancreas, and kidney (Brazier2005Cloning; Reyes1998Cloning).

In the cochlea, KCNK5 channels are essential for hearing by facilitating potassium (K+) recycling, which is vital for mechano-electrical transduction, the process of converting sound into electrical signals. These channels are primarily expressed in outer sulcus cells and contribute to maintaining the endocochlear potential necessary for auditory function (Cazals2015KCNK5).

In the kidney, TASK-2 channels are involved in stabilizing bicarbonate transport by sensing changes in external pH, which is crucial for maintaining acid-base balance and proper renal function. They contribute to the hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, providing the driving force for electrogenic Na+/3HCO3- cotransport (Warth2004Proximal). TASK-2 channels are also implicated in the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) process, which helps cells maintain volume homeostasis in response to changes in tonicity (Niemeyer2001Modulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNK5 gene, which encodes the TASK-2 potassium channel, have been implicated in several clinical conditions. One notable mutation is the T108P missense variant, which is associated with Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN), a chronic renal disease prevalent in the Balkan Peninsula. This mutation results in a complete loss of function of the TASK-2 channel due to impaired trafficking and processing of the mutant subunits to the cell surface. The T108P variant also exhibits a dominant-negative effect when coexpressed with wild-type subunits, further suppressing channel function. This loss of function may contribute to the pathophysiology of BEN by disrupting renal and respiratory physiological processes, particularly those related to acid-base balance and CO2/H+ regulation (Reed2016DominantNegative).

In addition to its role in BEN, alterations in KCNK5 expression have been linked to cardiovascular conditions. The rs10947789 variant in KCNK5 is associated with increased mean platelet volume, immature platelet count, and immature platelet fraction in patients with coronary artery disease. This variant is also linked to lower thrombopoietin levels, suggesting a potential role in platelet volume regulation and thrombopoiesis, which could impact cardiovascular health (Christiansen2017The).

## Interactions
The KCNK5 gene encodes the TASK-2 potassium channel, which is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and trafficking. One significant interaction is with 14-3-3 proteins, which regulate the surface expression of the KCNK5 channel on T lymphocytes. This interaction is facilitated by a non-classical 14-3-3 consensus motif at the channel's C-terminus, specifically involving serine 266. Mutation of this serine to alanine (S266A) reduces the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, leading to decreased surface expression and impaired channel function (Fernández‐Orth201614‐3‐3).

The interaction with 14-3-3 proteins is crucial for the trafficking of KCNK5 to the plasma membrane, impacting T-cell activation and cytokine production. The application of a 14-3-3 inhibitor reduces the number of wild-type channels in the plasma membrane, highlighting the importance of this interaction in maintaining channel function (Fernández‐Orth201614‐3‐3).

Additionally, KCNK5 channels can form homodimers, with each subunit contributing to the channel's pore structure. While a conserved cysteine residue (C51) can form a disulfide bridge, it is not essential for the channel's functional assembly, suggesting that KCNK5 may rely on other forms of interactions, such as hydrophobic bonding, for oligomerization (Niemeyer2003Extracellular).
