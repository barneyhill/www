# WRAP53

## Overview
The WRAP53 gene encodes a multifunctional protein known as WRAP53β, also referred to as WD repeat-containing antisense to TP53, WDR79, or TCAB1. This protein is characterized by its WD40 repeat domains, which confer a beta-propeller structure, allowing it to function as a scaffold protein. WRAP53β is integral to several cellular processes, including the maintenance of genomic stability, telomere assembly, and DNA repair. It plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of Cajal bodies, nuclear sub-organelles involved in ribonucleoprotein maturation and spliceosome formation. Additionally, WRAP53β is involved in the DNA damage response, facilitating the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA double-strand breaks. Mutations in the WRAP53 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome and certain cancers, underscoring its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Henriksson2015On; Bergstrand2020Biallelic; Gadelha2022The).

## Structure
The WRAP53 gene encodes a protein that is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which are crucial for its function as a scaffold protein. These repeats contribute to the protein's beta-propeller structure, facilitating interactions with various molecules and enabling the assembly of large protein and RNA complexes (Henriksson2015On; Bergstrand2020Biallelic). The WRAP53 protein, also known as WRAP53β, WDR79, or TCAB1, contains a proline-rich N-terminus, a central WD40 domain with 5-7 repeats, and a glycine-rich C-terminus (Henriksson2015On). 

The WD40 domain is essential for WRAP53's role in directing factors to Cajal bodies, telomeres, and DNA double-strand breaks, supporting various biological responses (Henriksson2015On). Mutations within this domain, such as L283F and R398W, can lead to dysfunction, affecting the protein's stability and localization, and are associated with conditions like Hoyeraal–Hreidarsson syndrome (Bergstrand2020Biallelic). 

WRAP53 is known to have multiple splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their functional roles. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate its activity and interactions (Farnebo2009Wrap53).

## Function
The WRAP53 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell function. WRAP53β, a functional protein product of the WRAP53 gene, acts as a scaffolding protein involved in telomerase localization, telomere assembly, and DNA double-strand break repair, which are vital for preventing carcinogenesis (Gadelha2022The). It is also essential for the formation and maintenance of Cajal bodies, nuclear sub-organelles involved in ribonucleoprotein maturation and spliceosome formation. WRAP53β interacts with coilin and the survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex, facilitating their localization to Cajal bodies (Mahmoudi2010WRAP53).

WRAP53β is involved in the DNA damage response, where it is rapidly recruited to sites of DNA damage in an ATM-, H2AX-, and MDC1-dependent manner. It facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to double-strand breaks, enhancing the efficiency of homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining repair pathways (Coucoravas2016Phosphorylation; Henriksson2014The). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing cell survival and proliferation by maintaining telomere integrity and supporting DNA repair mechanisms (Gadelha2022The; Mahmoudi2010WRAP53).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the WRAP53 gene have significant clinical implications. Biallelic mutations in WRAP53, particularly affecting the WRAP53β protein, are linked to Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HHS), a severe form of dyskeratosis congenita. These mutations, such as L283F and R398W, lead to dysfunctional telomeres, impaired DNA repair, and disrupted Cajal body functions, resulting in symptoms like bone marrow failure and developmental defects (Bergstrand2020Biallelic).

WRAP53 is also implicated in cancer. Overexpression of WRAP53 is observed in various cancer cell lines and is associated with poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. This overexpression promotes cancer cell survival and transformation, making WRAP53 a potential target for cancer therapy (Mahmoudi2011WRAP53). In lung adenocarcinoma, WRAP53 is involved in telomerase trafficking and cell cycle regulation, with its downregulation leading to cell cycle arrest (Yuan2017Clinical).

In craniometadiaphyseal dysplasia, biallelic frameshift mutations in WRAP53 result in bone fragility and developmental abnormalities, highlighting its role in bone modeling (Hao2021Diaphyseal). These findings underscore the diverse clinical significance of WRAP53 mutations and expression alterations.

## Interactions
WRAP53, also known as WRAP53β, is a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in DNA repair and the maintenance of Cajal bodies. It interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, facilitating various cellular processes. WRAP53β binds to the forkhead-associated (FHA) domains of RNF8 and MDC1, which are essential for the recruitment of RNF8 to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This interaction is critical for the ubiquitination of damaged chromatin and the subsequent recruitment of repair factors such as 53BP1, BRCA1, and RAD51 (Bergstrand2019The; Henriksson2014The).

WRAP53β is also involved in the maintenance of Cajal bodies, where it interacts with coilin and the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. These interactions are necessary for the proper localization of the SMN complex to Cajal bodies, which is crucial for ribonucleoprotein maturation and spliceosome formation (Mahmoudi2010WRAP53). The WD40 domain and the C-terminal region of WRAP53 are important for its interactions with coilin and SMN, facilitating its localization to Cajal bodies (Mahmoudi2010WRAP53).

Additionally, WRAP53β interacts with telomerase RNA (TERC), aiding in the localization of the telomerase complex to Cajal bodies and telomeres, which is vital for telomere maintenance (Bergstrand2019The).
