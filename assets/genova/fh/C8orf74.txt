# C8orf74

## Overview
C8orf74, or chromosome 8 open reading frame 74, is a gene located on the short arm of chromosome 8. It encodes a protein of the same name, which is currently not categorized into a specific protein family due to limited functional characterization. The protein is implicated in various biological processes, particularly in neurodevelopmental pathways and lipid metabolism. Research has highlighted its differential expression in conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by lipid metabolism issues (Ding2023Biomarker; AlonsoGonzalez2019Novel). Although C8orf74 has been associated with certain genetic markers linked to suicidal behavior, its expression is not significant in cancerous tissues, suggesting a more specialized role in non-cancerous physiological processes (Galfalvy2015A; Sammut2014A). Additionally, the gene has been noted in studies of congenital heart defects, although its specific contributions remain to be fully elucidated (Tomita-Mitchell2012Human).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
C8orf74 has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies have identified C8orf74 as differentially expressed in ASD brain tissues, with a significant p-value of 0.03 in meta-analyses, suggesting its potential involvement in the disorder, particularly during prenatal development stages (AlonsoGonzalez2019Novel). The gene has also been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by lipid metabolism issues, as part of a cluster enriched for cell-cell adhesion and G-protein coupled receptor signaling, which are crucial for platelet activity regulation (Ding2023Biomarker).

In addition to its role in neurodevelopmental disorders, C8orf74 has been linked to suicidal behavior. A genome-wide association study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in C8orf74 with a suggestive association, although it did not reach genome-wide significance (Galfalvy2015A). Despite these associations, C8orf74 does not show measurable expression in cancer cells or tissues, indicating it may not play a significant role in cancer (Sammut2014A). The gene's involvement in congenital heart defects has been noted, but specific conditions directly associated with mutations or expression changes in C8orf74 remain unclear (Tomita-Mitchell2012Human).
