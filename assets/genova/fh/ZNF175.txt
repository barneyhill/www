# ZNF175

## Overview
ZNF175 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 175, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of C2H2 zinc finger domains. These domains are known for their ability to bind DNA, RNA, and other proteins, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression (Brayer2008Keep). Zinc finger protein 175 is particularly noted for its involvement in the immune response, where it has been implicated in the regulation of viral replication, including the transcriptional repression of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in macrophages (Rakhra2021Zinc). The protein's ability to interact with various molecular targets underscores its potential significance in therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling viral infections.
