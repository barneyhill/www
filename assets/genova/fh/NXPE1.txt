# NXPE1

## Overview
NXPE1 is a gene that encodes the protein neurexophilin and PC-esterase domain family member 1, which functions as an O-acetyltransferase. This protein is primarily involved in the acetylation of sialic acids in the human colon, a biochemical modification that influences the sialoglycome and modulates immune interactions. The acetylation process mediated by NXPE1 affects the binding properties of sialic acids, particularly their interaction with immune receptors such as SIGLEC-15, thereby playing a role in immune response regulation. NXPE1 is predominantly expressed in the colon and rectum, and its expression levels are associated with genetic variations that may impact conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. The gene is located on chromosome 11q23, a region linked to these diseases, underscoring its clinical significance in gastrointestinal health (Hulur2015Enrichment; Lee2024NXPE1alters).

## Function
The NXPE1 gene encodes a protein involved in the acetylation of sialic acids in the human colon, a process that significantly impacts the sialoglycome. This protein functions as an O-acetyltransferase, transferring an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to sialic acids, specifically cytidine-5-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) (Lee2024NXPE1alters). The acetylation of sialic acids by NXPE1 alters their binding properties, particularly affecting interactions with immune receptors such as SIGLEC-15. Overexpression of NXPE1 in cell models has been shown to decrease SIGLEC-15 binding, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses in the colon (Lee2024NXPE1alters).

NXPE1 is predominantly expressed in the colon and rectum, with high RNA expression levels in normal human colon tissues (Lee2024NXPE1alters). The protein's activity is linked to the absence of mild periodic acid Schiff (mPAS) staining, indicating its role in modifying sialic acids (Lee2024NXPE1alters). Genetic variations, such as SNP rs661946, influence NXPE1 expression and the acetylation patterns of sialic acids, which may have implications for conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer (Lee2024NXPE1alters).

## Clinical Significance
NXPE1 has been implicated in several diseases, particularly those affecting the colon. Alterations in NXPE1 expression or activity have been linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Genome-wide association studies have identified NXPE1 as a target gene for IBD-associated variants, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Hulur2015Enrichment). The gene is located on chromosome 11q23, a region associated with IBD, and loss of this region is observed in over 20% of colorectal cancers (Lee2024NXPE1alters).

NXPE1 is responsible for the O-acetylation of sialic acids in the human colon, a process that affects immune interactions by modifying the binding of SIGLEC-15, a receptor involved in immune response (Lee2024NXPE1alters). Variants such as rs661946 in the promoter region of NXPE1 can alter its expression, leading to changes in sialic acid modification and potentially influencing disease progression (Lee2024NXPE1alters). These findings suggest that NXPE1 or its inhibitors could be relevant in treating IBD and CRC, highlighting its clinical significance in gastrointestinal health (Lee2024NXPE1alters).

## Interactions
NXPE1 is involved in the acetylation of sialic acids in the human colon, which affects the binding of immune receptors such as SIGLEC-15. Increased expression of NXPE1 in Jurkat cells leads to decreased binding of SIGLEC-15, suggesting that NXPE1 modifies sialic acids to reduce their recognition by this receptor (Lee2024NXPE1alters). Immunohistochemical assays show that NXPE1 protein levels correlate with the staining of sialic acid-binding lectins, specifically SIGLEC-15, indicating a potential interaction through the modification of sialic acids (Lee2024NXPE1alters).

NXPE1 is also noted for its potential involvement in the gut-brain-microbiota axis, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Duek2018Exploring). The gene is part of a family of proteins that may engage in cell signaling or adhesion processes, potentially forming multiprotein complexes or engaging in transient interactions that modulate cellular functions (Duek2018Exploring). Despite these insights, detailed interactions of NXPE1 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored, and further research is needed to elucidate its specific roles and interactions.
