# SCGB2A2

## Overview
SCGB2A2, also known as mammaglobin-1, is a gene that encodes the protein secretoglobin family 2A member 2, which is part of the secretoglobin family. This protein is primarily expressed in breast tissue and is involved in the formation of heterodimers with SCGB1D2, which can further assemble into tetramers, suggesting a role in multiprotein complex formation (Heinonen2015Identification; Jackson2011Update). The SCGB2A2 gene is of particular interest in oncology due to its significant upregulation in breast cancer, where it serves as a biomarker for the disease, especially in detecting bone marrow micrometastases (Talaat2020Bone; Lacroix2006Significance). Its expression is regulated by factors such as HOXB7, which may act as a repressor (Heinonen2015Identification). While SCGB2A2 is predominantly associated with breast cancer, its expression in other tissues limits its specificity as a diagnostic marker (Zafrakas2006Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The SCGB2A2 gene, also known as mammaglobin-1, is primarily associated with breast cancer due to its high expression in breast tissue and its role as a specific marker for the disease. Alterations in the expression level of SCGB2A2 are linked to tumor progression and metastasis in breast cancer patients. The gene is significantly upregulated in advanced stages of breast cancer and is correlated with lymph node involvement and distant metastasis, particularly in cases with bone metastasis (Talaat2020Bone). SCGB2A2 expression is also associated with the luminal A breast cancer subtype and is least expressed in the basal-like subtype (Talaat2020Bone).

SCGB2A2 is used as a biomarker for early detection of bone marrow micrometastases in breast cancer patients, showing higher sensitivity and specificity compared to other markers like CA15-3 (Talaat2020Bone). Its expression is absent in normal peripheral blood and bone marrow, making it a valuable marker for detecting disseminated tumor cells in breast cancer diagnostics (Lacroix2006Significance). The gene's expression is also noted in gynecologic malignancies, although its specificity as a breast cancer marker is limited by its expression in other tissues (Zafrakas2006Expression).

## Interactions
SCGB2A2, also known as mammaglobin, is known to form heterodimers with SCGB1D2. These heterodimers can further associate to form tetramers, indicating a potential role in multiprotein complex formation (Heinonen2015Identification; Jackson2011Update). The specific interactions of SCGB2A2 with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond its heterodimerization with SCGB1D2 are not detailed in the available literature. The gene is located near a HOXB7 binding site, and its expression is upregulated upon HOXB7 knockdown, suggesting a regulatory interaction where HOXB7 may repress SCGB2A2 expression (Heinonen2015Identification). However, the precise molecular mechanisms and additional protein interactions remain to be elucidated. The context does not provide further details on SCGB2A2's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids, leaving its broader interaction network largely unexplored.
