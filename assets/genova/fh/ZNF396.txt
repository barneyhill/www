# ZNF396

## Overview
ZNF396 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 396, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs. These motifs are typically involved in binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. Zinc finger protein 396 is implicated in various biological functions, including gene expression regulation and signal transduction pathways. The protein's specific interactions and regulatory mechanisms are subjects of ongoing research, with potential implications for understanding complex genetic networks and disease pathways.
