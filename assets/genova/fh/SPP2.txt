# SPP2

## Overview
The SPP2 gene encodes the secreted phosphoprotein 24 (Spp-24), a member of the cystatin superfamily, which plays a significant role in bone metabolism and mineral complex formation. Spp-24 is characterized by its cystatin-like domain, which functions as an inhibitor of thiol proteases, and a BMP-binding loop that contributes to its involvement in bone resorption and prevention of soft tissue calcification (Liu2015SPP2; granja2009analysis). Synthesized primarily in the liver, Spp-24 is found in various tissues, including the kidney and plasma, indicating its systemic role in mineral metabolism (Liu2015SPP2). The protein's interactions with bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) and Wnt-signaling pathways highlight its influence on skeletal development and maintenance (Turner2021Secreted). Mutations in the SPP2 gene, such as p.Gly97Arg, can lead to diseases like autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, underscoring the importance of its proper folding and secretion for cellular function (Liu2015SPP2).

## Structure
The SPP2 gene encodes the Spp-24 protein, which is a member of the cystatin superfamily and is involved in bone matrix formation. The primary structure of Spp-24 consists of 211 amino acids, including a signal peptide at the N-terminus (first 29 residues) and a cystatin-like domain characterized by two conserved disulfide bonds (Cys92-Cys103 and Cys116-Cys134) (Liu2015SPP2). This cystatin-like domain is crucial for the protein's tertiary structure, which is similar to that of cystatins, functioning as an inhibitor of thiol proteases such as cathepsins (Liu2015SPP2).

The Spp-24 protein also contains a BMP-binding loop, known as the TRH1 domain, which is similar to fetuin and BMP receptor II (Liu2015SPP2). This domain is part of the cystatin-like structure and contributes to the protein's function in bone resorption and possibly in preventing soft tissue calcification (granja2009analysis).

Mutations in the SPP2 gene, such as p.Gly97Arg, can affect the protein's folding and stability, leading to intracellular retention and ER stress, which are associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (Liu2015SPP2). These mutations highlight the importance of the disulfide-bonded loops in maintaining the protein's structural integrity (Liu2015SPP2).

## Function
The SPP2 gene encodes the secreted phosphoprotein 24 (Spp-24), which is a member of the cystatin superfamily. Spp-24 is involved in bone metabolism and mineral complex formation, sharing structural similarities with proteins like fetuin-A, which inhibit vascular and soft tissue calcification (Liu2015SPP2; Turner2021Secreted). In healthy human cells, Spp-24 is secreted and plays a role in regulating protease activity, particularly as an inhibitor of thiol proteases such as cathepsins, which are involved in protein degradation and turnover (Liu2015SPP2).

Spp-24 is primarily synthesized in the liver and is found in the kidney, liver, and plasma, indicating its systemic role in mineral metabolism (Liu2015SPP2). It is a component of calciprotein particles (CPPs) and may function as an inhibitor of bone formation and ectopic vascular calcification through interactions with bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) and Wnt-signaling pathways (Turner2021Secreted). The protein's activity in the extracellular space influences cell signaling and tissue development, contributing to skeletal development and maintenance (Turner2021Secreted). Proper secretion of Spp-24 is crucial to avoid endoplasmic reticulum stress and maintain normal cellular function (Liu2015SPP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SPP2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In cancer, SPP2 is generally under-expressed in tumors, suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor gene. It is notably under-expressed in colorectal, leukemia, liver, and pancreatic cancers. The expression of SPP2 is associated with patient survival, where its overexpression is linked to reduced survival in ovarian cancer but improved survival in breast and lung cancer patients (Tu2019Association). In lung adenocarcinoma, SPP2 has been identified as a stable predictor of survival, potentially due to its role in antagonizing Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), which are involved in cancer growth and metastasis (LopezSanchez2024Patientspecific).

SPP2 mutations are also implicated in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP). A specific mutation, p.Gly97Arg, affects the Spp-24 protein, leading to its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and causing cellular stress. This mutation results in photoreceptor dysfunction, contributing to the RP phenotype (Liu2015SPP2). The mutation's dominant negative effect is characterized by both extracellular protein insufficiency and intracellular accumulation, which are toxic to photoreceptors (Liu2015SPP2).
