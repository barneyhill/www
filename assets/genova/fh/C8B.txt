# C8B

## Overview
The C8B gene encodes the complement C8 beta chain, a critical component of the human immune system's membrane attack complex (MAC). The C8β protein, categorized as part of the complement system, plays a pivotal role in the immune response by participating in the formation of the MAC, which targets and lyses pathogenic cells, particularly Gram-negative bacteria. Structurally, C8β is characterized by several domains, including the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain, which is essential for its interaction with other MAC components. The gene's function is crucial for the assembly and activity of the MAC, facilitating the binding of C8 to the C5b-7 complex and enabling the formation of a hemolytically active complex. Mutations in C8B can lead to deficiencies that increase susceptibility to infections, highlighting its clinical significance in immune defense (Musingarimi2002Interaction; Arnold2009A; BRANNEN2007Incorporation).

## Structure
The C8B gene encodes the beta chain of the complement component C8, which is part of the membrane attack complex (MAC) involved in immune response. The C8β protein is structurally homologous to C8α and contains several domains, including an N-terminal thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) module, a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDLRA) module, a central membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF) module, and a second TSP1 module at the C-terminus (Musingarimi2002Interaction; Franc2018Comprehensive). 

The quaternary structure of C8 involves the association of C8β with the disulfide-linked C8α-γ heterodimer to form the C8 complex (Kaufmann1993The). The interaction between C8β and C8α-γ is highly specific, with the TSP1 module and MACPF domain playing a principal role in binding (Musingarimi2002Interaction). 

Post-translational modifications of C8β include N-glycosylation and C-mannosylation. C8β has three potential N-glycosylation sites, with N101 and N243 being glycosylated, although N101 shows low occupancy (Franc2018Comprehensive). C-mannosylation occurs in the TSP domains, contributing to the protein's micro-heterogeneity (Franc2018Comprehensive).

## Function
The C8B gene encodes the beta subunit of the eighth component of human complement (C8), which is integral to the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the complement system. This system is a crucial part of the immune response, responsible for lysing and eliminating pathogens. The C8 protein is composed of three subunits: C8α, C8β, and C8γ, with C8β playing a pivotal role in the assembly and function of the MAC (Kaufmann1993The; Parker2002Role).

C8β is essential for binding to the C5b-7 complex, an intermediate in the MAC assembly pathway, facilitating the incorporation of C8 into the MAC. This interaction is mediated by the MACPF domain within C8β, which binds to C8α-γ and C5b-7, enabling the formation of a hemolytically active MAC (BRANNEN2007Incorporation). The MAC forms pores in the membranes of target cells, leading to cell lysis and contributing to immune defense against pathogens, particularly Gram-negative bacteria (Parker2002Role).

The C8β subunit's interaction with other MAC components is crucial for its function, with specific domains such as the thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) module and the MACPF domain playing significant roles in binding and hemolytic activity (Musingarimi2002Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C8B gene, which encodes the beta chain of the complement component C8, are associated with increased susceptibility to infections, particularly those caused by Neisseria species, such as Neisseria meningitidis. This is due to the role of C8 in forming the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is crucial for lysing gram-negative bacteria (Arnold2009A; Dellepiane2016Invasive). A common mutation in the C8B gene is the p.Arg428* mutation, which results in a premature stop codon and is responsible for most cases of C8 beta deficiency (El2019Clinical; Dellepiane2016Invasive). This mutation leads to a complete deficiency of the C8 protein, impairing the immune system's ability to combat bacterial infections (Kotnik1997Molecular).

Individuals with homozygous C8B mutations often experience recurrent meningococcal infections, while heterozygous carriers typically do not exhibit increased disease risk (Mannes2023Combined). In some cases, C8B deficiencies have been linked to non-infectious disorders, such as juvenile chronic arthritis (Wulffraat1994Deficiency). The prevalence of C8B deficiencies varies among populations, being more common in Caucasians (Kotnik1997Molecular).

## Interactions
The C8B gene encodes the complement C8 beta chain, which is a crucial component of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the human complement system. The C8β protein interacts with other subunits, specifically C8α-γ, to form the MAC, which is essential for immune defense (Musingarimi2002Interaction). The C8β chain contains a membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain, which is vital for its interactions with C8α and C5b-7, an intermediate in the MAC assembly pathway (BRANNEN2007Incorporation). 

The MACPF domain of C8β has been shown to bind C8α-γ in solution, forming a noncovalent complex that exhibits hemolytic activity. This domain also binds independently to erythrocytes carrying C5b-7, and upon the addition of C8α-γ and C9, it produces a hemolytically active MAC (BRANNEN2007Incorporation). The N-terminal thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) module and the MACPF domain in C8β are crucial for binding to C8α-γ, while the LDLRA module is essential for binding C5b-7 and facilitating C8 incorporation into the MAC (Musingarimi2002Interaction). These interactions highlight the complex network within the protein structure that facilitates its function in the immune response.
