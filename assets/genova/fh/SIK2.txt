# SIK2

## Overview
Salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is a member of the SNF1/AMPK family. The protein product of the SIK2 gene, also referred to as SIK2, plays a pivotal role in regulating metabolic processes and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with notable expression in adipose and neural tissues, where it influences glucose and lipid metabolism (Sun2020The). SIK2 is involved in several cellular signaling pathways, including those related to insulin signaling and gluconeogenesis, and it interacts with multiple proteins to modulate these pathways (Patel2014The; Dai2020SIK2). The kinase activity of SIK2 is regulated through phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications, which are crucial for its function in cellular processes (Sun2020The). Additionally, SIK2 has been implicated in various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor promoter or suppressor, depending on the context, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Dai2020SIK2; Chen2019SaltInducible).

## Structure
Salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the SNF1/AMPK family. The SIK2 gene is located on chromosome 11 and encodes a protein consisting of 931 amino acids (Chen2019SaltInducible). The molecular structure of SIK2 includes three main domains: a kinase domain near the N-terminal (residues 20-271), a central SNF1 protein kinase homology (SNH) domain (residues 293-346), and a phosphorylation domain near the C-terminal (residues 577-623) (Chen2019SaltInducible). These domains are similar to those found in other SIK isoforms, such as SIK1 and SIK3 (Chen2019SaltInducible).

The kinase domain contains an activation loop, which is crucial for SIK2's activity. Autophosphorylation within this loop is essential for its kinase activity, and the catalytic activity depends on phosphorylation by LKB1 (Taub2019Salt). The C-terminal domain of SIK2 contains numerous unique phosphorylation sites, allowing it to transmit various stimulation signals involved in biological processes like cell growth and apoptosis (Chen2019SaltInducible). SIK2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by various protein kinases such as CaMK1 and PKA, which can increase its kinase activity (Taub2019Salt).

## Function
SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating various metabolic processes in healthy human cells. It is part of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family and is involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. SIK2 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with significant expression in adipose and neural tissues (Sun2020The).

In glucose metabolism, SIK2 acts as a positive regulator by upregulating GLUT4 expression, which is essential for glucose uptake in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. It achieves this by interacting with downstream substrates such as HDAC4, CRTC2/3, and PP2A (Sun2020The). SIK2 also plays a role in lipid metabolism by repressing lipogenic genes and promoting fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (Sun2020The).

SIK2 is involved in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis, acting as a repressor in this metabolic pathway. It modulates the phosphorylation of transcription co-activators, influencing gluconeogenic gene expression (Patel2014The). In adipocytes, SIK2 promotes insulin signaling and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, enhancing glucose uptake (Säll2016Saltinducible).

SIK2's activity is regulated by phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications, which affect its stabilization and function in cellular processes (Sun2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In ovarian cancer, SIK2 is overexpressed and promotes tumorigenesis by enhancing the PI3K-Akt pathway, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and survival (Chen2019SaltInducible). In gastric cancer, SIK2 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation associated with increased migration, invasion, and poor prognosis. SIK2 suppresses gastric cancer progression by inhibiting the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process (Dai2020SIK2).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SIK2 is part of the LKB1-HDAC signaling axis, crucial for AML proliferation. Co-inhibition of SIK2 and SIK3 could be a strategy for potent MEF2C inhibition in AML (Chen2019SaltInducible). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, SIK2's role varies, acting as a tumor suppressor by maintaining cell homeostasis and energetic metabolism, although it can also promote tumor growth in certain contexts (Chen2019SaltInducible).

SIK2 is also involved in metabolic reprogramming in cancer, enhancing glycolysis and lipogenesis, which are crucial for tumor growth and survival (Feng2023Roles). These diverse roles highlight SIK2's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with protein phosphatases PHLPP2 and PP2A, which are crucial for the dephosphorylation of AKT, thereby indirectly modulating AKT activity in gastric cancer cells (Dai2020SIK2). SIK2 also interacts with FGFR2 in the FGF2 signaling pathway, where it acts as a negative feedback regulator. This interaction is enhanced upon FGF2 induction, although SIK2 is not a direct target of FGFR due to the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation (Kuser‐Abali2024SIK2:).

SIK2 phosphorylates Gab1 at Ser266, affecting its interaction with partners like Grb2 and Shp2, which may alter the stability of the signaling complex and facilitate Gab1 degradation (Kuser‐Abali2024SIK2:). In the context of cancer, SIK2 is known to phosphorylate the p85α subunit of the PI3K complex, enhancing PI3K activity and Akt phosphorylation, which are important for cancer cell metabolism and growth (Chen2019SaltInducible). These interactions highlight SIK2's role in modulating key signaling pathways involved in cell growth and cancer progression.
