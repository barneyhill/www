# MICALL2

## Overview
MICALL2 is a gene that encodes the protein MICAL like 2, which is a member of the MICAL family involved in cytoskeletal dynamics. Unlike other MICAL proteins, MICAL like 2 lacks the flavoprotein monooxygenase domain, which is typically responsible for actin depolymerization through methionine oxidation (Zhou2011MICALs; Wen2022MICALL2). The protein is characterized by a calponin homology (CH) domain, a LIM domain, and a coiled-coil (CC) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins, such as Rab GTPases (Nishimura2008Identification). MICAL like 2 plays a significant role in the assembly and maintenance of tight and adherens junctions by interacting with Rab8 and Rab13, thereby coordinating the transport of junctional proteins to the plasma membrane (Yamamura2008The). Additionally, it is involved in the recycling of proteins like E-cadherin and occludin, which are crucial for cell-cell adhesion and junctional integrity (Yamamura2008The). The protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms are also implicated in cancer progression, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it influences cell growth and migration through pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Wen2022MICALL2).

## Structure
The MICALL2 protein, encoded by the MICALL2 gene, is a member of the MICAL family and is involved in cytoskeleton dynamics. It lacks the flavoprotein monooxygenase domain found in other MICAL proteins, which is responsible for actin depolymerization through methionine oxidation (Zhou2011MICALs; Wen2022MICALL2). The protein structure includes a calponin homology (CH) domain at the N-terminus, a LIM domain in the middle, and a coiled-coil (CC) domain at the C-terminus (Nishimura2008Identification). These domains facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as Rab13, which binds specifically to the GTP-bound form of Rab13 via the C-terminal region of MICALL2 (Nishimura2008Identification).

MICALL2 is involved in the assembly of tight junctions and adherens junctions by interacting with Rab8 and Rab13, coordinating the transport of proteins like claudins and occludin to the plasma membrane (Yamamura2008The). The protein is also a substrate for ubiquitination by the E3 ligase TRIM21, which regulates its degradation and affects its role in tumorigenesis (Wen2022MICALL2). The absence of the monooxygenase domain distinguishes MICALL2 from other MICAL proteins, highlighting its unique functional role in cellular processes.

## Function
MICALL2 (MICAL like 2) is a protein involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly in the organization of actin filaments. It plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as cell shape regulation, migration, and intracellular trafficking. MICALL2 is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with membrane structures, influencing cell signaling pathways and contributing to tissue development and maintenance (Yamamura2008The).

In healthy human cells, MICALL2 is involved in the assembly of tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs), which are essential for maintaining cell polarity and tissue integrity. It interacts with Rab8 and Rab13, small GTPases involved in membrane trafficking, to coordinate the transport of key junctional proteins like E-cadherin, claudin-1, and occludin to the plasma membrane (Yamamura2008The). This coordination is crucial for the polarization of epithelial cells and the formation of functional TJs and AJs (Yamamura2008The).

MICALL2 also plays a role in the recycling of E-cadherin and occludin to the plasma membrane, a process important for the maintenance of cell-cell adhesion and junctional integrity. This recycling is mediated through its interaction with Rab8 and Rab13, forming complexes that facilitate the transport of these proteins back to the plasma membrane after endocytosis (Yamamura2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MICALL2 gene have been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). MICALL2 is up-regulated in CRC tissues, and its overexpression is associated with poorer overall survival rates in patients. The gene promotes CRC cell growth and migration, partly through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumorigenesis. MICALL2 overexpression leads to increased β-catenin levels and its downstream targets, enhancing cancer cell proliferation and migration (Wen2022MICALL2).

MICALL2 interacts with the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIM21, which mediates its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. This interaction negatively correlates with MICALL2 levels, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that influences its tumorigenic activity. TRIM21 knockdown can partially restore the migration and proliferation of CRC cells with depleted MICALL2, highlighting the significance of this interaction in cancer progression (Wen2022MICALL2).

These findings suggest that MICALL2 plays an oncogenic role in CRC and could serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Its expression levels and interactions with proteins like TRIM21 are critical in understanding its role in cancer development and progression (Wen2022MICALL2).

## Interactions
MICALL2, also known as JRAB/MICAL-L2, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for cellular processes. It interacts with Rab GTPases, specifically Rab8 and Rab13, to coordinate the assembly of tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs). These interactions are essential for the recycling of junctional proteins like E-cadherin and occludin to the plasma membrane (Yamamura2008The). MICALL2 forms distinct complexes with Rab8 and Rab13, but these interactions are competitive, as Rab8 can inhibit the binding of Rab13 to MICALL2 and vice versa (Yamamura2008The).

MICALL2 also interacts with actin-binding proteins, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics. It undergoes a conformational change upon binding with Rab13, which allows it to interact with filamin through its calponin homology domain, promoting the formation of peripheral ruffles (Miyake2019Actin). The LIM domain of MICALL2, particularly its zinc finger domains, plays a role in binding actin and inhibiting its depolymerization, affecting cell migration and adhesion (Miyake2019Actin).

In cancer contexts, MICALL2 interacts with ACTN4 and stabilizes it by repressing its ubiquitination, which is crucial for cancer progression and metastasis (Du2024High). It also interacts with EGFR, enhancing its stability and promoting gastric cancer cell migration (Min2019MICAL‐L2).
