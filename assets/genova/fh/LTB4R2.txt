# LTB4R2

## Overview
The LTB4R2 gene encodes the leukotriene B4 receptor 2 (BLT2), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various physiological and pathological processes. As a member of the GPCR family, BLT2 is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, which facilitates its role in signal transduction across cell membranes (Yokomizo2000A). The receptor is primarily recognized for its interaction with leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT), mediating responses related to inflammation, immune function, and epithelial barrier integrity (Hirakata2020Leukotriene; Nakamura2011Leukotriene). BLT2 is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the spleen, liver, and epithelial cells, and plays a significant role in processes such as wound healing and tumorigenesis (Sinha2023Hepatic; Hirakata2020Leukotriene). The receptor's involvement in cancer, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal squamous cell cancer, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Sinha2023Hepatic; Venerito2016Leukotriene).

## Structure
The leukotriene B4 receptor 2 (BLT2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs (Yokomizo2000A). The human BLT2 protein consists of 358 amino acids, while the mouse version has 360 amino acids, with a high amino acid identity of 92.7% between the two species, indicating evolutionary conservation (Yokomizo2000A). The receptor shares 45.2% amino acid identity with BLT1, another leukotriene B4 receptor, particularly in the transmembrane regions (Yokomizo2000A).

The BLT2 receptor includes specific amino acids in the transmembrane domains that are crucial for its function, such as Tyr271 and Asn275, which are important for receptor activation and ligand binding (Kim2020Elucidation). These residues are involved in forming hydrogen bonds with agonists, acting as activation triggers for BLT2 (Kim2020Elucidation). The receptor's structure also features a unique promoter region arrangement, with the promoter region of BLT1 found within the open reading frame of BLT2 (Yokomizo2000A).

BLT2 exists in two distinct forms: the short-form BLT2 (hSFBLT2) and the long-form BLT2 (hLFBLT2), with the latter having 31 additional amino acids at the N-terminal (Wei2023Two). The N-terminal domain of hLFBLT2 contains cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges with extracellular loops, crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation (Wei2023Two).

## Function
The LTB4R2 gene encodes the BLT2 receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor involved in various cellular processes. BLT2 is a low-affinity receptor for leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and a high-affinity receptor for 12-HHT, a natural lipid agonist. It is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, including the spleen, liver, ovary, and leukocytes, and is particularly abundant in epithelial cells of the cornea, skin, and intestine (Hirakata2020Leukotriene; Nakamura2011Leukotriene).

In healthy cells, BLT2 plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity, which is essential for protecting tissues from environmental insults and maintaining homeostasis. The receptor is involved in intracellular signaling pathways, such as the Rac-ERKs pathway, which is associated with reactive oxygen species-mediated chemotaxis (Nakamura2011Leukotriene). BLT2 also mediates LTB4-dependent chemotaxis through G-proteins, influencing immune and inflammatory responses (Yokomizo2000A).

The 12-HHT/BLT2 axis is significant for epithelial wound healing, as evidenced by delayed healing in BLT2 knockout mice. This suggests that BLT2 is important for corneal and skin wound healing and maintaining intestinal barrier function (Hirakata2020Leukotriene).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LTB4R2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LTB4R2 is involved in the activation of YAP1 and CTNNB1 pathways, which are crucial for tumorigenesis. Inhibition of LTB4R2 has been shown to reduce the growth of HCC cells, indicating its role in promoting liver cancer (Sinha2023Hepatic). The gene is also linked to the regulation of oxylipin ligands, which are implicated in malignancies, suggesting a broader role in cancer progression (Sinha2023Hepatic).

In esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC), LTB4R2 expression is up-regulated, although specific transcripts do not differ between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues. This up-regulation is associated with cancer spread, and pharmacological inhibition of LTB4R2 is suggested as a potential treatment option (Venerito2016Leukotriene).

In lung cancer, LTB4R2 has been identified as a druggable vulnerability, particularly in squamous-cell carcinoma, a subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeting LTB4R2 could offer new therapeutic strategies for lung cancer treatment (Sauta2021CSNK1A1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LTB4R2 in cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
LTB4R2, also known as leukotriene B4 receptor 2, is involved in several interactions that play a role in liver tumorigenesis. It is activated by the ligand 12-HHTrE, which is produced by hepatic stellate cells expressing CYP1B1. This activation promotes liver tumors through the CTNNB1 (β-catenin) and YAP1 pathways, indicating a significant role in cell growth and tumor progression (Sinha2023Hepatic). LTB4R2 mediates the activation of YAP1 and CTNNB1, which are crucial for cell proliferation. The receptor's expression is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to normal liver tissue, and its inhibition can reduce tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sinha2023Hepatic).

The interaction between LTB4R2 and CTNNB1 involves CTNNB1 binding to TCF4, which is recruited to the YAP1 intronic enhancer, further promoting YAP1 transcription. This interaction is part of a positive feedback loop where 12-HHTrE upregulates LTB4R2 mRNA and protein levels (Sinha2023Hepatic). The receptor is also involved in a paracrine signaling mechanism, where CYP1B1-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts interact with LTB4R2-expressing HCC cells, highlighting its role in the tumor microenvironment (Sinha2023Hepatic).
