# DKK3

## Overview
DKK3, or dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 3, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein belonging to the Dickkopf family, which is involved in the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. The DKK3 protein is characterized by its signal peptide and two cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are essential for its function in cellular signaling (Krupnik1999Functional; Wen2023Molecular). Unlike other members of the Dickkopf family, DKK3 does not significantly inhibit the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, suggesting a unique role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Niehrs2006Function). DKK3 is expressed in various human tissues, with high levels in the heart, brain, and spinal cord, indicating potential tissue-specific functions (Krupnik1999Functional). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Krupnik1999Functional). DKK3 has been implicated in development, cellular homeostasis, and cancer, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression frequently downregulated in malignancies (Niehrs2006Function).

## Structure
The DKK3 protein, a member of the Dickkopf family, is characterized by its primary structure, which includes a signal peptide and two cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) known as CRD1 and CRD2. These domains are crucial for its function in Wnt signaling inhibition (Krupnik1999Functional; Wen2023Molecular). The secondary structure of DKK3 comprises beta-sheets and alpha-helices, stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are typical of the cysteine-rich domains (Krupnik1999Functional).

In terms of tertiary structure, DKK3 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation, which affects its mobility and processing, as observed in SDS-PAGE analyses (Krupnik1999Functional). This glycosylation is conserved across species, indicating its importance in the protein's function (Krupnik1999Functional).

DKK3 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which can influence its function and localization within tissues. These isoforms are expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in the heart, brain, and spinal cord (Krupnik1999Functional). The protein's structural diversity and modifications suggest a complex role in cellular signaling and regulation.

## Function
DKK3, a member of the dickkopf family, is a secreted protein involved in modulating the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Unlike other members of the Dkk family, DKK3 does not significantly inhibit the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, suggesting it may have a distinct role or mechanism of action (Krupnik1999Functional; Niehrs2006Function). 

DKK3 is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, with particularly high levels in the heart, brain, and spinal cord, indicating potential tissue-specific functions (Krupnik1999Functional). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Krupnik1999Functional). 

In terms of organismal outcomes, DKK3 has been implicated in development and cellular homeostasis. Although its precise role in healthy human cells remains unclear, it is suggested to act as a tumor suppressor, as its expression is often downregulated in various cancers (Niehrs2006Function). DKK3's involvement in immune cell regulation and physiological parameters has also been observed in knockout mouse models, which display altered immune cell frequencies and hyperactivity (Niehrs2006Function).

## Clinical Significance
The DKK3 gene, known as dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 3, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its altered expression and epigenetic modifications. In gallbladder cancer, DKK3 acts as a potential tumor suppressor, with its overexpression reducing cell proliferation and invasiveness. However, its expression is often reduced in tumor samples, particularly in more advanced cancer grades, potentially due to promoter hypermethylation (Gondkar2019Dickkopf).

In glioblastoma, low DKK3 expression is associated with poorer survival outcomes, while alterations in DKK3, such as mutations and changes in mRNA expression, correlate with improved median survival, suggesting a protective effect (Caffo2024DKK3). In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, DKK3 is transcriptionally silenced by CpG hypermethylation, which is linked to lower overall survival and higher relapse rates (RomanGomez2004Transcriptional).

In breast cancer, DKK3 is frequently suppressed due to promoter hypermethylation, contributing to cancer pathogenesis (Veeck2008Wnt). Similarly, in papillary thyroid carcinoma, DKK3 downregulation is primarily due to promoter hypermethylation, correlating with aggressive tumor characteristics (Yin2013DKK3). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DKK3 in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis.

## Interactions
DKK3 interacts with several proteins, influencing the Wnt signaling pathway and other cellular processes. It does not bind to LRP6 or Kremen-2 co-receptors due to the absence of specific amino acids in its CRD2 domain necessary for these interactions. However, some studies suggest DKK3 can inhibit Wnt signaling by interacting with Kremen receptors, particularly affecting the extracellular kringle and CUB domains of Kremen, which impacts cell behavior (Mourtada2023The). DKK3 also interacts with CKAP4, a type II transmembrane protein, which is the only known receptor for DKK3. This interaction is thought to trigger the internalization of CKAP4 in a clathrin-dependent manner (Mourtada2023The).

DKK3 interacts with β-TrCP, a protein involved in the degradation of β-catenin. This interaction has been confirmed through various assays, including co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy, and is relevant to the inhibition of β-catenin signaling (Lee2008Dkk3). DKK3's interaction with β-TrCP enhances its inhibitory effect on β-catenin, leading to decreased β-catenin levels and blocking its nuclear translocation (Lee2008Dkk3). These interactions highlight DKK3's role as a negative regulator of β-catenin, particularly in the context of cancer (Lee2008Dkk3).
