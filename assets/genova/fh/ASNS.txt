# ASNS

## Overview
The ASQ (Answer) is a protein that is involved in various biological processes, including the synthesis of essential amino acids. It is a key player in maintaining the balance of amino acids in the body, which is crucial for healthy development and function. The protein is particularly important for brain development and function, and it plays a significant role in the body's response to stress and other environmental factors. The ASQ is also involved in various other processes, such as the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of healthy immune function. Overall, the ASQ is a vital protein that plays a crucial role in many aspects of human health and well-being.

## Structure
The human asparagine synthetase (ASNS) protein is composed of 561 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of approximately 65 kDa (Lomelino2017Asparagine). The protein structure is organized into two main domains: the N-terminal glutaminase domain (residues 1-202) and the C-terminal synthetase domain (residues 203-560) (Zhu2019Highresolution). The N-terminal domain features a sandwich-like α/β/β/α topology typical of N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) amidotransferases, with a two-layer antiparallel β-sheet core surrounded by four α-helices (Lomelino2017Asparagine; Zhu2019Highresolution). The C-terminal domain is primarily composed of α-helices and includes a five-stranded parallel β-sheet, which is crucial for ATP binding (Lomelino2017Asparagine).

The ASNS protein forms a head-to-head dimer in its quaternary structure, with monomers linked by a disulfide bond (Zhu2019Highresolution). The active sites of human ASNS and its bacterial counterpart are highly conserved, with minor differences in specific residues (Zhu2019Highresolution). The structure also reveals a hydrogen bond network involving conserved residues that mediate substrate recognition and thioester stabilization in the hydrolysis reaction (Zhu2019Highresolution). The presence of a chloride anion at the interface of the N- and C-terminal domains has been noted, although its functional importance is not yet established (Zhu2019Highresolution).

## Function
The ASNS gene encodes the enzyme asparagine synthetase, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of aspartate and glutamine into asparagine and glutamate. This enzymatic activity is crucial for protein synthesis and cellular metabolism, as asparagine is an essential amino acid for these processes (Balasubramanian2013Asparagine; Kilberg2005NUTRITIONAL). Asparagine synthetase is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, with the highest levels found in the exocrine pancreas, although the pancreas does not release significant amounts of asparagine into circulation, indicating its primary use for local protein synthesis (Balasubramanian2013Asparagine).

In healthy human cells, ASNS plays a role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis and responding to cellular stress. The enzyme's activity is regulated by nutrient availability and stress responses, such as the amino acid response (AAR) and the unfolded protein response (UPR), which are activated under conditions of amino acid deprivation and endoplasmic reticulum stress, respectively (Gjymishka2009Transcriptional; Balasubramanian2013Asparagine). ASNS is involved in the regulation of intracellular amino acid levels, influencing pathways like mTORC1, which is critical for cell growth and metabolism (Krall2016Asparagine). This regulation ensures that cells can adapt to fluctuations in amino acid availability, maintaining protein synthesis and cellular function (Balasubramanian2013Asparagine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASNS gene, which encodes the enzyme asparagine synthetase, are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as asparagine synthetase deficiency (ASNSD). This condition is characterized by severe neurological symptoms, including congenital microcephaly, progressive encephalopathy, intellectual disability, intractable seizures, and spastic quadriplegia (Alfadhel2015Asparagine; BenSalem2014Asparagine; Wang2020A). ASNSD is caused by either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ASNS gene, leading to a loss of function of the enzyme, which is critical for brain development (Lomelino2017Asparagine; Sprute2019Clinical).

The disorder was first reported in 2013, and since then, numerous mutations have been identified, including missense mutations and frameshift mutations that affect the protein's structure and function (Schleinitz2018Novel; Staklinski2022Analysis). These mutations often result in reduced enzymatic activity, insufficient to support normal cellular function, particularly in the brain (Staklinski2022Analysis).

Altered ASNS expression is also linked to cancer cell survival and chemotherapy resistance, particularly in the context of asparaginase therapy used in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Lomelino2017Asparagine). Elevated ASNS expression can confer resistance to this therapy, highlighting the gene's role in cancer biology.
