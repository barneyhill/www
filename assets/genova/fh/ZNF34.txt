# ZNF34

## Overview
ZNF34 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 34, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, playing a critical role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences through its zinc finger motifs. These motifs are essential for the protein's structural integrity and function, highlighting their evolutionary conservation and importance in DNA binding (Lorenz2010The). Zinc finger protein 34 is predominantly active in the nucleus and is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the cerebellum, indicating its potential involvement in brain development and function (Lorenz2010The). The gene is located on chromosome 8q24.3, within a cluster of related zinc finger proteins, and is characterized by regulatory features such as TATA-less promoters and CpG islands, which may influence its expression patterns (Lorenz2010The).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF34 is a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor. It is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences through its zinc finger motifs. These motifs are crucial for maintaining the protein's structure and function, as they are under strong purifying selection, indicating their importance in DNA binding (Lorenz2010The).

ZNF34 is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in the cerebellum, suggesting a role in brain development and function (Lorenz2010The). The gene is part of a cluster on chromosome 8q24.3, which includes other closely related zinc finger proteins. These proteins share common regulatory features, such as TATA-less promoters associated with CpG islands, which may contribute to their similar expression patterns (Lorenz2010The).

In healthy human cells, ZNF34 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape by modulating the expression of target genes. This activity is essential for various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, particularly in tissues with high differentiation, such as the fetal brain (Lorenz2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF34 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. A novel point mutation in ZNF34, specifically the replacement of proline at position 17 with arginine (P17R), has been identified in a family with early-onset major depressive disorder (MDD). This mutation is located in the KRAB-A domain of ZNF34, which is crucial for its repressive transcriptional activity, suggesting that defective transcriptional regulation by the mutant protein may contribute to the development of MDD (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). ZNF34 is also associated with bipolar affective disorder (BAD), as its mRNA was differentially expressed in postmortem brain samples from BAD patients. Common variants of ZNF34 have been linked to BAD, and the gene is located on chromosome 8p24.3, a region associated with this disorder (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

An X-SNP in ZNF34, known as ZNF34-Q56X, may lead to mRNA degradation via nonsense-mediated decay, potentially resulting in loss of gene function. If nonsense-mediated decay does not occur, the protein products may be truncated, significantly altering protein structure and function. The allele frequency of this SNP is reported to be 27% (Savas2006Human).
