# ADAM30

## Overview
ADAM30 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 30 protein, a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family. This family of proteins is characterized by a metalloproteinase domain, which confers proteolytic activity, and a disintegrin domain, which facilitates interactions with integrin molecules (Rocks2008Emerging). The ADAM30 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which are crucial for inflammation and tissue remodeling (Rocks2008Emerging). In the nervous system, ADAM30 is implicated in the cleavage of cell surface proteins, playing a role in neural development and synaptic transmission (Hsia2019Functions). The gene's expression and function have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, where alterations in ADAM30 expression correlate with amyloid load and amyloid-beta peptide levels, suggesting its involvement in amyloid precursor protein metabolism (Letronne2016ADAM30). Additionally, ADAM30's interaction with cathepsin D (CTSD) highlights its role in proteolytic processes that may influence both neurological and metabolic disorders (Letronne2016ADAM30).

## Function
ADAM30, a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its proteolytic activity. These proteins are characterized by a metalloproteinase domain, which is responsible for their catalytic activity, and a disintegrin domain, which facilitates interactions with integrin molecules (Rocks2008Emerging). ADAM30 is noted for its proteolytic activity, which suggests a role in modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, influencing processes such as inflammation and tissue remodeling (Rocks2008Emerging).

In the context of the nervous system, ADAM family proteins, including ADAM30, are implicated in the cleavage of cell surface proteins, which is crucial for processes like neural development and synaptic transmission (Hsia2019Functions). Although specific functions of ADAM30 in healthy human cells are not detailed extensively, its involvement in these processes suggests a role in maintaining cellular communication and tissue integrity. ADAM30, along with other ADAM proteins, is considered a potential drug target for neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential impact on disease states (Hsia2019Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADAM30 gene have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Transcriptomic analyses have shown a significant decrease in ADAM30 expression in the brains of AD patients, which inversely correlates with amyloid load, a hallmark of the disease (Letronne2016ADAM30). This underexpression is associated with increased levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, specifically Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42, suggesting that ADAM30 may play a role in modulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and Aβ production (Letronne2016ADAM30).

The study also indicates that ADAM30 influences APP metabolism through the activation of cathepsin D (CTSD), a lysosomal enzyme involved in protein degradation. This interaction appears to be crucial for the degradation of APP, and alterations in ADAM30 expression or function could disrupt this process, contributing to the accumulation of amyloid plaques in AD (Letronne2016ADAM30). The potential link between ADAM30 and insulin resistance, as well as its genetic association with Type 2 diabetes, suggests that ADAM30 may also have broader implications in metabolic disorders, which could further influence AD pathology (Letronne2016ADAM30).

## Interactions
ADAM30 interacts with cathepsin D (CTSD), a lysosomal protease, playing a significant role in its activation. This interaction is crucial for the proteolysis of pro-CTSD to its active form, as demonstrated in both cellular and animal models. Proximity ligation assays confirmed the physical interaction between ADAM30 and CTSD, highlighting their proximity and functional interaction in SKNSH-SY5Y-APP 695WT cell lines and transgenic mouse models (Letronne2016ADAM30). 

ADAM30 enhances CTSD activity, suggesting that it acts as a CTSD maturation enzyme. This interaction is linked to the degradation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), as ADAM30's activation of CTSD leads to a decrease in both amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic APP catabolites (Letronne2016ADAM30). The study also found that pharmacological inhibitors like pepstatin, an aspartyl protease inhibitor, can negate the effects of ADAM30 on APP metabolism, further implicating CTSD in this process (Letronne2016ADAM30).

While ADAM30 is known to have proteolytic activity, specific details on its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond CTSD are not provided in the available context (Rocks2008Emerging).
