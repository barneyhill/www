# TEAD2

## Overview
TEAD2 is a gene that encodes the TEA domain transcription factor 2, a member of the TEAD family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its TEA DNA-binding domain and YAP binding domain, which are crucial for its role in gene regulation. TEAD2 functions as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of genes associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, primarily through its interaction with co-activators such as YAP and TAZ. It plays a significant role in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is vital for controlling organ size and maintaining tissue homeostasis. TEAD2 is particularly important in neural stem cell maintenance and cortical development, as well as in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it has been implicated in tumor progression and serves as a potential therapeutic target (Kaneko2007Transcription; Joo2020TEAD2; Mukhtar2020Tead).

## Structure
TEAD2 is a member of the TEAD family of transcription factors, characterized by a highly conserved TEA DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a YAP binding domain (YBD) (Holden2018Targeting). The DBD features a helix-turn-helix homeodomain fold, which directs specificity towards DNA, particularly binding to muscle-specific cytidine-adenosine-thymidine (MCAT) sequences (Holden2018Targeting). The YBD is composed of a β-sandwich fold with four α-helices and is post-translationally modified by palmitic acid, essential for proper folding and cellular expression (Holden2018Targeting).

The internal pocket of TEAD2 is divided into a hydrophobic sub-pocket and a hydrophilic sub-pocket, which interact with fatty acids like palmitate and myristate, stabilizing the protein by interacting with conserved cysteine and lysine residues (Liberelle2022Toward). TEAD2 also features a non-conserved tryptophan at the bottom of its internal pocket, which could be targeted for selective ligand binding (Liberelle2022Toward).

TEAD2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation, which is necessary for its stability and interaction with YAP/TAZ (Sturbaut2021Discovery). The protein's structure includes a cryptic site at interface 2, which is a potential target for inhibitors (Sturbaut2021Discovery).

## Function
TEAD2 (TEA domain transcription factor 2) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is essential for controlling organ size and maintaining tissue homeostasis. TEAD2 functions by binding to DNA and interacting with co-activators such as YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) to modulate transcriptional activity (Mukhtar2020Tead; Sawada2008Redundant).

In the context of neural stem cells (NSCs) and cortical development, TEAD2 is involved in maintaining NSC populations and inhibiting their premature differentiation. It achieves this by regulating the expression of target genes like ApoE and Dab2, which are implicated in neuroblast migration and NSC behavior (Mukhtar2020Tead). TEAD2's interaction with YAP is particularly significant, as it helps stabilize YAP protein levels, thereby influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and survival (LiuChittenden2012Genetic; Sawada2008Redundant). This interaction is crucial for proper embryonic development, including notochord formation and mesoderm patterning (Sawada2008Redundant).

## Clinical Significance
TEAD2 (TEA domain transcription factor 2) has significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer biology. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TEAD2 expression is markedly elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This increased expression is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor overall survival rates, suggesting that TEAD2 could serve as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in HCC (Joo2020TEAD2).

TEAD2 also plays a role in neural development, where its inactivation in mice leads to neural tube defects such as exencephaly, analogous to anencephaly in humans. The risk of these defects is influenced by genetic background and maternal genotype, with folic acid shown to reduce the incidence, highlighting a potential preventive measure (Kaneko2007Transcription).

In the context of liver cancer, TEAD2 interacts with the YAP protein, a key player in the Hippo signaling pathway. Disruption of the TEAD-YAP complex can suppress YAP-induced liver overgrowth and tumorigenesis, indicating that targeting this interaction could be a viable therapeutic strategy (LiuChittenden2012Genetic). These findings underscore the importance of TEAD2 in both cancer progression and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
TEAD2 interacts with several proteins, most notably YAP (Yes-associated protein), which functions as a transcriptional coactivator. The interaction between TEAD2 and YAP is crucial for TEAD-dependent transcriptional activity. YAP binds to the carboxy-terminal half of TEAD2, and this interaction is necessary for the transcriptional activation of specific genes (Vassilev2001TEADTEF). The binding domain of YAP is located near its amino terminus, specifically between amino acids 32-139, and involves spatial relationships between specific amino acid residues (Vassilev2001TEADTEF).

TEAD2 also forms complexes with other proteins, such as actin and MUPP1, identified through mass spectrometry (Vassilev2001TEADTEF). The interaction with YAP is highly specific and involves three major interfaces: a β strand, an α helix, and an Ω-loop motif. These interactions are essential for the growth-promoting activity of YAP (Santucci2015The). TEAD2's interaction with YAP can be disrupted by small molecules that target these interfaces, highlighting the potential for therapeutic interventions in diseases where YAP/TEAD interactions are implicated (Pobbati2020ProteinProtein; Zhao2023Leveraging).
