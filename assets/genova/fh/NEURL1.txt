# NEURL1

## Overview
NEURL1 is a gene that encodes the protein neuralized E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, which is a member of the Neuralized family of proteins. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a category of enzymes that play a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, thereby regulating protein degradation and signaling pathways. NEURL1 is particularly significant in the modulation of the Notch signaling pathway, where it targets the Notch ligand Jagged1 for ubiquitination, influencing cellular differentiation and development (Koutelou2008Neuralizedlike). Additionally, NEURL1 is involved in synaptic plasticity and memory storage by ubiquitinating proteins such as CPEB3, which enhances synaptic function and cognitive processes (Pavlopoulos2011Neuralized1). The protein's activity is dependent on its structural domains, including Neuralized Homology Repeat (NHR) domains and a RING domain, which facilitate its interactions and enzymatic functions (Taal2019Neuralized; Koutelou2008Neuralizedlike).

## Structure
NEURL1, a member of the Neuralized family, is characterized by its structural domains that are crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The protein contains two Neuralized Homology Repeat (NHR) domains and a C-terminal RING domain. The NHR domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, specifically mediating the binding to substrates such as PDE9A, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (Taal2019Neuralized). The RING domain is essential for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the ubiquitination process (Taal2019Neuralized; Koutelou2008Neuralizedlike).

NEURL1 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as N-terminal myristoylation, which targets the protein to the plasma membrane, a localization necessary for its function in regulating Notch ligand Jagged1 (Koutelou2008Neuralizedlike). The protein's subcellular localization can vary, being found in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane, depending on the cellular context (Taal2019Neuralized). While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of these domains suggests a complex structure facilitating its interactions and functions.

## Function
NEURL1, also known as neuralized E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, plays a critical role in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for cellular differentiation and development. NEURL1 functions as a RING-dependent ubiquitin ligase, specifically targeting the Notch ligand Jagged1 for monoubiquitination. This process leads to the down-regulation and lysosomal degradation of Jagged1, thereby modulating Notch signaling activity in cells (Koutelou2008Neuralizedlike). NEURL1's activity is dependent on its localization to the plasma membrane, facilitated by N-terminal myristoylation, which is crucial for its interaction with Jagged1 (Koutelou2008Neuralizedlike).

In addition to its role in Notch signaling, NEURL1 is involved in synaptic plasticity and memory storage. It ubiquitinates the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3), enhancing its activity and promoting the translation of GluA1 and GluA2 mRNAs. This process is vital for synaptic function and memory formation, as it increases the protein synthesis necessary for synaptic growth and plasticity (Pavlopoulos2011Neuralized1). NEURL1's activity in neurons is linked to increased synaptic connections and cognitive enhancements, highlighting its importance in maintaining long-term potentiation and synaptic efficacy (Pavlopoulos2011Neuralized1).

## Interactions
NEURL1, a neuralized E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element-Binding Protein 3 (CPEB3), promoting its ubiquitination. This interaction enhances the translation of AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2, which are crucial for synaptic plasticity and memory storage (Pavlopoulos2011Neuralized1).

NEURL1 also interacts with the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE9A. This interaction, mediated by NEURL1's Neuralized Homology Repeat (NHR) domains, leads to the polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of PDE9A, primarily through lysine residues K27, K29, and K33 of ubiquitin (Taal2019Neuralized).

In the context of the Notch signaling pathway, NEURL1 interacts with the Notch ligand Jagged1. It supports the monoubiquitination of Jagged1, which affects its stability and signaling activity. This interaction is facilitated by the adaptor protein Fe65, forming a trimeric complex that promotes Jagged1's degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Lee2015Fe65; Koutelou2008Neuralizedlike). These interactions highlight NEURL1's role in regulating protein stability and function through ubiquitination.
