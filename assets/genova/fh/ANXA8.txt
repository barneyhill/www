# ANXA8

## Overview
ANXA8 is a gene that encodes the protein annexin A8, a member of the annexin family known for its calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding properties. Annexin A8 is categorized as a cytosolic protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal organization. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind to phospholipids and F-actin, which is crucial for its involvement in the maturation of Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells and the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. ANXA8's expression is notably altered in several cancers, such as pancreatic, ovarian, and gastric cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and disease progression. This makes ANXA8 a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Gerke2016Annexins; Hata2012Involvement; Goebeler2006Annexin).

## Structure
Annexin A8 (ANXA8) is a member of the annexin family, characterized by its ability to bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. The primary structure of ANXA8 includes a conserved annexin repeat domain, which is a hallmark of the annexin family. These domains are composed of four annexin repeats, each consisting of 70-80 amino acids with sequence homologies (Goebeler2006Annexin).

The secondary structure of ANXA8 typically features alpha-helices, which are common in annexin proteins. These helices contribute to the formation of a compact, globular tertiary structure, which is a characteristic feature of annexins (Goebeler2006Annexin).

In terms of quaternary structure, annexins often form symmetric dimers, although specific details about ANXA8's quaternary structure are not provided in the context. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, influencing the protein's function and interactions. ANXA8 may also have splice variant isoforms, which could lead to different functional roles within the cell (Goebeler2006Annexin).

ANXA8 is noted for its unique phospholipid and F-actin binding properties, which are regulated by calcium levels, highlighting its role in cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and signal transduction (Goebeler2006Annexin).

## Function
Annexin A8 (ANXA8) is a member of the annexin family, known for its calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding properties. In healthy human cells, ANXA8 plays a crucial role in the organization of membrane domains, particularly at sites of membrane-cytoskeleton interactions. It binds to F-actin and phospholipids like phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), which is essential for intracellular membrane trafficking and endocytosis regulation (PrietoFernández2022Pathobiological; Goebeler2006Annexin).

ANXA8 is involved in the maturation of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) in endothelial cells, which are lysosome-related organelles. It facilitates the transport of CD63 from endosomes to maturing WPBs, crucial for the proper presentation of CD63 on the cell surface following endothelial stimulation and WPB exocytosis. This process is vital for stabilizing P-selectin, which is important for leukocyte rolling and adhesion to endothelial cells (Gerke2016Annexins).

ANXA8 is also implicated in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and trafficking. It interacts with phosphatidylinositides and F-actin, influencing the morphology and function of the late endosomal/pre-lysosomal compartment, affecting lysosomal targeting of EGFR and signal output (Grewal2009Annexins).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ANXA8 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In pancreatic cancer, ANXA8 is ectopically expressed, contributing to cancer progression by enhancing cell viability, migration, and resistance to nutrient deprivation. This overexpression is linked to the transcriptional activation of HIF-1a and subsequent upregulation of VEGF, which is associated with poor prognosis (Hata2012Involvement). ANXA8 expression in pancreatic cancer is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, specifically the hypomethylation of CpG islands in its promoter region (Hata2012Involvement).

In ovarian cancer, ANXA8 is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor overall and progression-free survival. Its expression is associated with advanced FIGO stages and TP53 mutations, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target (Gou2019Annexin). ANXA8 also plays a role in gastric carcinoma, where its overexpression is linked to advanced TNM stages and poor prognosis, serving as an independent prognostic marker (Ma2020Prognostic).

ANXA8's involvement in various cancers highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention and as a biomarker for disease prognosis.

## Interactions
Annexin A8 (ANXA8) is involved in several cellular processes through its interactions with lipids and proteins. ANXA8 binds to F-actin and phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner, which is crucial for cytoskeletal reorganization in osteoclasts, facilitating their function in bone resorption (Crotti2011Bone). This interaction is essential for the formation of actin rings, a key feature of osteoclast activity (Crotti2011Bone).

ANXA8 also plays a role in the maturation of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) in endothelial cells by stabilizing CD63 in the limiting membrane of late endosomes, preventing its partitioning into intraluminal vesicles. This stabilization is crucial for the proper presentation of P-selectin on the cell surface, affecting leukocyte adhesion (Gerke2016Annexins).

In the context of cholesterol homeostasis, ANXA8 is recruited to cholesterol-rich membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. This recruitment is enhanced by the presence of cholesterol, indicating a cooperative binding mechanism. ANXA8's role in cholesterol regulation is highlighted by its ability to prevent cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes/lysosomes, a condition resembling NPC1 deficiency (Heitzig2018Cooperative). These interactions suggest that ANXA8 may modulate cholesterol transport efficiency by interacting with NPC1-containing microdomains (Heitzig2018Cooperative).
