# RBFOX1

## Overview
RBFOX1 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding fox-1 homolog 1 protein, a critical RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing. This protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM), which allows it to bind specifically to the (U)GCAUG sequence in RNA, thereby influencing the inclusion or exclusion of exons during mRNA processing (Sun2011Mechanisms; Mukherjee2023To). RBFOX1 plays a significant role in neuronal development and function, as well as in muscle tissue, by regulating splicing programs essential for maintaining structural and functional homeostasis (Fogel2012RBFOX1; Mukherjee2023To). The protein's interactions with other splicing regulators and its involvement in stress-dependent ribonucleoprotein granules underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Kucherenko2018Stressdependent; Mukherjee2023To). Alterations in the RBFOX1 gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (O’Leary2022Behavioural; AntónGalindo2024Pleiotropic).

## Structure
RBFOX1 is a protein characterized by a highly conserved RNA-Recognition Motif (RRM), which is central to its structure and function. This motif is nearly invariant across species, including humans, mice, zebrafish, fruit flies, and nematodes, and is crucial for binding to the RNA element UGCAUG, regulating alternative splicing in a position-dependent manner (Sun2011Mechanisms). The RRM is involved in protein-protein interactions essential for exon repression, particularly when tethered to the upstream intron (Sun2011Mechanisms).

The C-terminal domain of RBFOX1 is vital for its nuclear localization and exon inclusion activity. This domain contains a putative nuclear localization signal (hPY-NLS) recognized by karyopherin b2, which is conserved in both RBFOX1 and RBFOX2 across species (Sun2011Mechanisms). The C-terminal domain is also crucial for exon activation when tethered to the downstream intron, and it interacts with proteins such as hnRNP H1, RALY, and TFG, which modulate the splicing activity of RBFOX1 (Sun2011Mechanisms).

RBFOX1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with diversity in the N- and C-terminal domains, which may lead to different splicing activities or a lack of splicing functions (Sun2011Mechanisms). The C-terminal domains of RBFOX1 and RBFOX2 are 58% identical, rich in Ala, Tyr, and Gly residues, and have an overall positive charge, suggesting similar interacting partners and functions (Sun2011Mechanisms).

## Function
RBFOX1, also known as RNA binding fox-1 homolog 1, is a crucial splicing factor involved in the regulation of alternative splicing in human cells. It binds specifically to the (U)GCAUG sequence in RNA, influencing the inclusion or exclusion of exons during mRNA processing. This binding is facilitated by its RNA recognition motif (RRM), which is essential for its function in splicing regulation (Mukherjee2023To).

In the nucleus, RBFOX1 primarily associates with introns in nascent RNA, affecting the splicing of alternative exons. It plays a significant role in neuronal development by regulating the splicing of genes involved in synaptic transmission and neuronal differentiation (Fogel2012RBFOX1). RBFOX1 also influences transcriptional networks, coordinating the expression of genes critical for neurodevelopmental pathways (Fogel2012RBFOX1).

RBFOX1 is active in differentiated neurons, where it is essential for neuronal migration and synapse network formation. Its deficiency can lead to defects in axon length, dendrite structure, and spine density, potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders (Mukherjee2023To). In muscle tissues, RBFOX1 regulates alternative splicing programs necessary for muscle function and development, maintaining structural and functional homeostasis (Mukherjee2023To).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RBFOX1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Variants in RBFOX1 have been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder (O’Leary2022Behavioural; AntónGalindo2024Pleiotropic). Copy number variations (CNVs) in RBFOX1 are more frequent in patients with psychiatric conditions, particularly ASD and schizophrenia, suggesting a significant burden in these disorders (O’Leary2022Behavioural). These CNVs may affect RBFOX1 function by altering its expression, as evidenced by decreased RBFOX1 mRNA levels in specific brain regions of ASD and schizophrenia patients (O’Leary2022Behavioural).

RBFOX1 is also implicated in epilepsy, with partial deletions of the gene linked to idiopathic generalized epilepsy and rolandic epilepsy (Lal2013RBFOX1). The gene's involvement in regulating neuronal splicing networks is crucial, and disruptions can lead to neurodevelopmental diseases (Fogel2012RBFOX1). In addition, RBFOX1 variants have been associated with aggressive behavior and anxiety disorders, highlighting its role in emotional and behavioral regulation (FernàndezCastillo2020RBFOX1). The gene's pleiotropic effects contribute to a broad spectrum of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes (AntónGalindo2024Pleiotropic).

## Interactions
RBFOX1, a key RNA-binding protein, participates in various interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in alternative splicing and transcriptional regulation. It binds to RNA sequences containing the (U)GCAUG motif, influencing the splicing of alternative exons by interacting with the spliceosome complex (Darnell2013RNA; Fogel2012RBFOX1). RBFOX1 forms part of a large assembly of splicing regulators (LASR), interacting with proteins such as HNRNPM, HNRNPH1, and DDX5/17, which are crucial for splicing activation (Kucherenko2018Stressdependent; Mukherjee2023To).

RBFOX1 also engages in stress-dependent interactions, forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. It localizes to nuclear structures like the nucleolus and Cajal bodies, and in the cytoplasm, it is found in processing bodies and stress granules, particularly under stress conditions (Kucherenko2018Stressdependent). These interactions are mediated by its low-complexity domains, which facilitate phase separation into liquid-like organelles (Kucherenko2018Stressdependent).

RBFOX1's interactions extend to its role in neuronal development, where it regulates transcriptional networks and splicing events crucial for synapse formation and function (Fogel2012RBFOX1). These interactions underscore RBFOX1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its impact on various physiological and pathological conditions.
