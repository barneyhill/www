# C8orf76

## Overview
C8orf76 is a gene located on chromosome 8 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 8 open reading frame 76. This protein is currently uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms of action are not fully understood (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). However, it has been implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer. The gene is known to be upregulated in several types of cancer, including bladder and breast cancer, where its expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased cell proliferation (Chen2022Comprehensive). Additionally, C8orf76 is involved in pathways related to viral infections, suggesting a potential role in immune-related cancer pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite its associations with cancer, further research is needed to elucidate the precise functions and clinical implications of the C8orf76 protein.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
C8orf76 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression and genetic amplifications being associated with disease progression and prognosis. In certain cancers, such as bladder cancer (BLCA) and breast cancer (BRCA), C8orf76 is upregulated, and its expression correlates with worse overall survival rates (Chen2022Comprehensive). The gene is also associated with cell proliferation, and its amplification may serve as an independent risk factor for enhanced cell proliferation in cancers (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

In gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC), C8orf76 is positively regulated by the long non-coding RNA ZFPM2-AS1, which is overexpressed in tumors and linked to poor prognosis. This regulation suggests a role for C8orf76 in cancer progression and patient prognosis (Chen2022Comprehensive). Additionally, C8orf76 is involved in pathways related to Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection and Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection, indicating its potential involvement in immune-related cancer pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

Chromosomal instability studies have identified C8orf76 as having copy-number amplification on chromosome 8q, which is associated with increased expression of proliferative gene markers in breast cancer (Endesfelder2014Chromosomal). Despite these associations, specific clinical outcomes directly linked to C8orf76 remain under investigation.
