# XKR4

## Overview
XKR4 is a gene that encodes the XK related 4 protein, which is a member of the XK family of proteins. This protein functions as a phospholipid scramblase, playing a critical role in the translocation of phospholipids across the cell membrane, thereby maintaining membrane asymmetry and facilitating various cellular processes such as apoptosis and synaptic pruning. Structurally, XK related 4 is characterized by eight transmembrane helices and is primarily expressed in the brain, where it is involved in synaptic regulation. The protein's activity is modulated by extracellular calcium and specific protein-protein interactions, which are essential for its function in cellular processes. Mutations in the XKR4 gene have been associated with neurological and autoimmune conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Shook2017XKR4; Chakraborty2024Structure; Zhang2023Extracellular).

## Structure
The XKR4 protein is a member of the XK family and is involved in phospholipid scrambling. Structurally, XKR4 is characterized by eight transmembrane (TM) helices and three short intramembrane helices. The TM3 helix is divided into two segments, TM3a and TM3b, connected by a loop with a negatively charged side chain (Chakraborty2024Structure). The protein's structure includes two internal repeats, ND and CD, which undergo significant rearrangements to facilitate its function. These repeats contribute to the formation of a wide-open C1 cavity, which is exposed to the hydrocarbon core of the lipid bilayer (Chakraborty2024Structure).

The ND vestibule of XKR4 is crucial for its activity, resembling the hydrophilic groove found in TMEM16 proteins. This region is involved in modulating scrambling activity by promoting membrane thinning, a key feature for its function as a scramblase (Chakraborty2024Structure). The protein's C-terminus is longer and more dynamic compared to its homologues Xkr8 and Xkr9, suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism (Chakraborty2024Structure).

XKR4 does not require caspase cleavage or oligomerization for its activity, functioning effectively as a monomer (Chakraborty2024Structure). The protein can bind to specific lipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), without forming higher-order oligomers (Chakraborty2024Structure).

## Function
The XKR4 gene encodes a protein that functions as a phospholipid scramblase, playing a crucial role in the translocation of phospholipids across the cell membrane. This activity is essential for maintaining membrane asymmetry and facilitating cellular processes such as apoptosis and synaptic pruning in neurons. In healthy human cells, XKR4 is activated by extracellular calcium, which acts as a molecular glue to facilitate the interaction between transmembrane helices TM1 and TM3, necessary for its scramblase activity (Zhang2023Extracellular).

XKR4 is primarily expressed in the brain, where it may contribute to synaptic regulation by exposing phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of neurons, marking them for removal during synaptic pruning (Zhang2023Extracellular). The protein's activity is also regulated by caspase cleavage, which is part of the apoptotic signaling pathway, highlighting its role in apoptosis and efferocytosis, the process by which apoptotic cells are cleared by macrophages (Chakraborty2024Structure).

The structure of XKR4 includes specific charged residues that create an electronegative surface, promoting membrane thinning, which is crucial for its scrambling activity (Chakraborty2024Structure). This structural feature suggests a complex regulatory mechanism involving both protein-protein interactions and calcium binding.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the XKR4 gene have been associated with several neurological and autoimmune conditions. XKR4 is linked to Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) through a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), specifically rs2939678, which affects cerebellar development. Children with ADHD have been observed to have decreased gray matter volumes in specific cerebellar regions, although the effects of the XKR4 SNP on cerebellar development are not exclusive to ADHD (Shook2017XKR4).

XKR4 is also implicated in autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, asthma, and lung cancer, due to its role in phosphatidylserine externalization, which is crucial for apoptotic cell clearance and preventing inflammation (Chakraborty2024Structure). Mutations in XKR4 have been associated with neurological disorders such as substance abuse and cognitive deficits, particularly in the context of McLeod syndrome (Shook2017XKR4).

The gene's activation involves complex mechanisms, including caspase cleavage and interactions with proteins like XRCC4, which are essential for its function in lipid scrambling and cell death regulation. These processes are significant in brain function and development, potentially linking XKR4 to synaptic elimination and DNA damage pathways (Maruoka2021Caspase).

## Interactions
XKR4 interacts with several proteins and ions that influence its function as a scramblase. It is activated by caspase-mediated cleavage, which leads to dimer formation. The binding of the C-terminal fragment of XRCC4 to the XKR4 dimer is crucial for its activation, suggesting a significant interaction between these proteins (Zhang2023Extracellular). Extracellular calcium (Ca2+) plays a critical role in XKR4 activation by acting as a molecular glue that facilitates the interaction between transmembrane helices TM1 and TM3. This interaction is essential for the activation of XKR4 and is also observed in other Xkr family members like XKR8 and XKR9 (Zhang2023Extracellular).

The study also notes that XKR4 is strongly expressed in the brain, where it may play a role in synaptic function, indicating potential interactions with other neuronal proteins (Zhang2023Extracellular). Additionally, the ND vestibule of XKR4 can bind both mono- and divalent cations, although Ca2+ binding is more stable and promotes membrane bending, which is crucial for its scrambling activity (Chakraborty2024Structure). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving XKR4 in cellular processes.
