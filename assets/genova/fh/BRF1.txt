# BRF1

## Overview
BRF1 is a gene that encodes the BRF1 RNA polymerase III transcription initiation factor subunit, a critical component of the transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the initiation of RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription, which is essential for the synthesis of small structural RNAs, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA, crucial for protein synthesis and cellular function (Rollins2007Human; Wang2022TFIIBrelated). The BRF1 protein is characterized by its zinc ribbon and cyclin fold domains, which facilitate interactions with various components of the transcription machinery, including RNA polymerase III, TBP, and Bdp1, thereby stabilizing the transcription complex at the promoter site (Khoo2014Mapping; Han2018Structural). Mutations in the BRF1 gene are linked to cerebellar-facial-dental syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, and alterations in its expression are associated with cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Xu2024Downregulation; Borck2015BRF1).

## Structure
The BRF1 protein is a component of the TFIIIB complex, essential for RNA polymerase III transcription initiation. It contains several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal domain of BRF1 includes a zinc ribbon (ZR) domain, which interacts with the dock of RNA polymerase III and is involved in the transcription cycle by stabilizing the RNA exit channel and extending the transcription bubble (Han2018Structural). This domain is flexible, allowing it to adapt during transcription (Han2018Structural).

BRF1 also features a cyclin fold domain in its N-terminal region, which contacts RNA polymerase III at the wall and protrusion, playing a role in transcription bubble propagation (Han2018Structural). The C-terminal half of BRF1 interfaces with TBP and Bdp1, forming part of the TFIIIB complex. This region contains conserved homology blocks that are crucial for stabilizing interactions with TBP and Bdp1, and it acts as a scaffold for TFIIIB subunits (Khoo2014Mapping).

The BRF1 protein's structure is characterized by its ability to interact with multiple components of the transcription machinery, facilitating the recruitment and stabilization of RNA polymerase III at the promoter site (Khoo2014Mapping).

## Function
BRF1 is a crucial component of the transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB) complex, which is essential for RNA polymerase III (Pol III)-mediated transcription in human cells. It plays a significant role in the transcription of small structural RNAs, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA, which are vital for protein synthesis and cellular function (Rollins2007Human; Wang2022TFIIBrelated). BRF1 is predominantly active in the nucleoli, where it co-localizes with nucleolar proteins and is involved in the assembly of the Pol III transcription machinery at the rDNA promoter (Wang2022TFIIBrelated).

BRF1 also interacts with various components of the Pol I transcription machinery, influencing the expression and stability of specific subunits, such as TBP and TAF1A, which are crucial for the proper assembly of the Pol I transcription machinery and the transcription of rDNA (Wang2022TFIIBrelated). This dual role in both Pol I and Pol III transcription processes highlights BRF1's importance in coordinating ribosomal RNA synthesis and overall cellular homeostasis (Wang2022TFIIBrelated).

In addition to its role in transcription, BRF1 is implicated in promoting cell proliferation and tumor growth, as its expression levels correlate with Pol I product levels and tumor cell growth (Wang2022TFIIBrelated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BRF1 gene are associated with cerebellar-facial-dental syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and dental anomalies. These mutations are typically biallelic and lead to a partial loss of function, affecting RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription (Borck2015BRF1). Specific missense mutations such as p.Ser226Leu, p.Thr259Met, p.Arg223Trp, and p.Pro292His have been identified in affected individuals, impacting conserved amino acids crucial for protein function (Borck2015BRF1). 

In zebrafish models, suppression of the brf1b gene mimicked the syndrome's key features, indicating an isoform-specific effect (Borck2015BRF1). The pathomechanism may involve reduced tRNA levels, impairing translation elongation and leading to growth defects (Borck2015BRF1). 

Alterations in BRF1 expression are also linked to cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Downregulation of BRF1 in liver cells induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor progression, suggesting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Xu2024Downregulation). These findings highlight the critical role of BRF1 in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
BRF1, a subunit of the RNA polymerase III transcription initiation factor complex, engages in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is a component of the TFIIIB complex, which also includes the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and Bdp1. BRF1 interacts with TBP through its C-terminal half, which provides significant affinity by binding along the convex surface and N-terminal lateral face of TBP (Kassavetis2005Reconfiguring). This interaction is crucial for the formation of a functional TFIIIB-DNA complex, necessary for the recruitment of RNA polymerase III to the promoter and the initiation of transcription (Kassavetis2005Reconfiguring).

BRF1 also interacts with the Tfc4 subunit of TFIIIC, a key step in assembling the RNA polymerase III initiation factor TFIIIB. The interaction between BRF1 and Tfc4 is dynamic, involving multiple binding sites and is essential for the assembly of TFIIIB by TFIIIC (Liao2006Interactions). The N-terminal domain of BRF1 contains a zinc ribbon fold and a cyclin fold repeat subdomain, which are involved in interactions with the Pol III active center, specifically with the C34 subunit (Khoo2014Mapping). These interactions facilitate transcription initiation by Pol III, highlighting BRF1's role in the transcriptional machinery.
