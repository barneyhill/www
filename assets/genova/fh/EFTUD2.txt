# EFTUD2

## Overview
EFTUD2 is a gene that encodes the protein elongation factor Tu GTP binding domain containing 2, which is a critical component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. This protein functions as a GTPase and is integral to the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, playing a pivotal role in the dynamics and remodeling of the spliceosome during the splicing process (Wood2021The; Wood2019Disease). The EFTUD2 protein is involved in the dissociation of U4 and U6 snRNAs and regulates the ATPase activity of Brr2p, which is necessary for the first catalytic step of splicing (Wood2019Disease). Mutations in the EFTUD2 gene are associated with Mandibulofacial Dysostosis with Microcephaly (MFDM), a genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial anomalies and developmental delays (Huang2015Mandibulofacial; Voigt2013Otofacial). The gene's role in ribonucleoprotein metabolism underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its involvement in various disease phenotypes when disrupted (Wood2019Disease; Jacob2020A).

## Function
The EFTUD2 gene encodes a GTPase that is a critical component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. This process involves the removal of introns from pre-mRNA to produce mature mRNA, which is essential for proper gene expression and protein synthesis (Wood2019Disease). EFTUD2 is part of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex and interacts with proteins such as SNRNP200 and PRPF8, playing a role in the dynamics and remodeling of the spliceosome during splicing (Wood2021The). It is involved in the dissociation of U4 and U6 snRNAs, regulating the ATPase activity of Brr2p, which is necessary for the first catalytic step of splicing (Wood2019Disease).

In healthy human cells, EFTUD2 is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions, including cell proliferation and response to stress. Reduced expression of EFTUD2 leads to decreased cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to endoplasmic reticulum stress, highlighting its role in cell division and growth (Wood2019Disease). The gene is also involved in the regulation of the immune system, particularly in the splicing of interferon-stimulated genes, which suggests its role as a regulator of the innate immune response (Wood2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EFTUD2 gene are associated with Mandibulofacial Dysostosis with Microcephaly (MFDM), a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial anomalies, microcephaly, and developmental delays. This condition is linked to various types of mutations in the EFTUD2 gene, including missense, nonsense, splice site, and frameshift mutations, as well as deletions (Huang2015Mandibulofacial; Voigt2013Otofacial). These mutations often result in haploinsufficiency, which is believed to be the primary pathogenic mechanism (Gandomi2013Array‐CGH; Voigt2013Otofacial).

Clinical features of MFDM include microcephaly, malar and mandibular hypoplasia, conductive hearing loss, and distinctive facial features (Jacob2020A). Other associated anomalies can include esophageal atresia, zygomatic anomalies, and intellectual disability (Voigt2013Otofacial). The phenotypic spectrum of EFTUD2 mutations is broad, with some individuals experiencing mild symptoms potentially due to somatic and germline mosaicism (Voigt2013Otofacial).

The EFTUD2 gene encodes a spliceosomal GTPase, and its mutations can disrupt normal splicing processes, leading to the clinical manifestations observed in MFDM (Jacob2020A; Voigt2013Otofacial). The gene's role in ribonucleoprotein metabolism is crucial, and disruptions can lead to similar craniofacial anomalies seen in other related disorders (Huang2015Mandibulofacial).

## Interactions
EFTUD2 is a GTPase that plays a crucial role in the spliceosomal cycle, interacting with several proteins and nucleic acids within the spliceosome complex. It physically interacts with SNRNP200 and PRPF8, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays, and these interactions have been confirmed by cryo-EM structures of the human U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP (Wood2021The; Wood2019Disease). EFTUD2 is involved in the dissociation of U4 and U6 snRNAs by regulating the activity of Brr2, a function critical before the first catalytic step of splicing (Wood2021The; Wood2019Disease).

EFTUD2 also interacts with TXNL4A through PRPF8 and the U5 snRNA loop I, suggesting a complex network of interactions within the spliceosome (Wood2021The). An interface between EFTUD2 and EIF4A3 has been identified, indicating a connection between the exon junction complex and the spliceosome (Wood2019Disease). EFTUD2's interaction with SF3B4 promotes the recruitment of the tri-snRNP to the spliceosome via the U2 snRNP (Wood2019Disease). These interactions are essential for the proper functioning of the spliceosome and the splicing process, and disruptions can lead to various disease phenotypes (Wood2021The).
