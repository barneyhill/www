# RALA

## Overview
The RALA gene encodes the RAS like proto-oncogene A, a small GTPase that is part of the Ras superfamily of proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cytokinesis, and transcriptional regulation. As a molecular switch, RALA cycles between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, facilitating its interactions with multiple effector proteins such as Sec5 and Exo84, which are components of the exocyst complex involved in exocytosis and cell polarity maintenance (Fukai2003Structural; Jin2005Exo84). RALA's function is regulated by RalGEF proteins, which integrate signals from diverse pathways, underscoring its role as a signaling hub (Cascone2008Distinct). Clinically, alterations in RALA expression and function have been implicated in various cancers and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2022Brain; Thies2021The).

## Structure
The RALA protein, encoded by the RALA gene, is a small GTPase involved in various cellular processes. Its primary structure consists of 206 amino acids, with specific truncations used in studies to improve crystallization without affecting binding properties (Fukai2003Structural). The secondary structure of RALA includes α-helices and β-strands, as observed in its complex with Sec5, a subunit of the sec6/8 complex (Fukai2003Structural). The tertiary structure of RALA is characterized by a GTP-binding domain, which undergoes conformational changes between GDP- and GTP-bound states, crucial for its function as a molecular switch (Fukai2003Structural; Frech1990Guanine).

In terms of quaternary structure, RALA interacts with other proteins such as Sec5 and C3bot, forming complexes that are essential for its role in membrane trafficking and inhibition of nucleotide exchange, respectively (Fukai2003Structural; Pautsch2005Crystal). The interaction with Sec5 involves a unique β-sandwich fold, distinct from other Ras-binding domains, highlighting the specificity of RALA's interactions (Fukai2003Structural). Post-translational modifications like prenylation are crucial for RALA's membrane localization, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
RalA, a member of the Ras family of GTPases, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in vesicle trafficking, particularly in the polarized delivery of membrane proteins to the basolateral surface of epithelial cells. This function is mediated through its interaction with the exocyst complex, a multiprotein assembly essential for vesicle targeting and secretion (Moskalenko2001The; Shipitsin2004RalA). RalA is also critical for cytokinesis, where it facilitates the formation of the intracellular bridge during cell division by tethering the exocyst to the cytokinetic furrow (Cascone2008Distinct).

RalA's activity is regulated by RalGEF proteins, which integrate signals from both Ras-dependent and independent pathways, highlighting its role as a signaling integration node (Cascone2008Distinct). In addition to its role in vesicle trafficking and cytokinesis, RalA is involved in the regulation of transcriptional activity in a cell density-dependent manner, interacting with the transcription factor ZONAB to modulate gene expression (Frankel2004RalA). RalA's functions are crucial for maintaining cell polarity, proper cell division, and transcriptional regulation, contributing to overall cellular organization and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RALA gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases, particularly in cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RALA is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. High RALA expression is associated with poor survival outcomes, making it a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. The small molecule inhibitor BQU57, which targets RALA, has shown promise in reducing TNBC growth (Thies2021The).

In bladder cancer, RALA and RALB have divergent roles, with RALA inhibiting migration, contrasting with RALB's promotion of it. This suggests that RALA's interactions can influence cancer progression differently depending on the context (Richardson2022The). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RALA is overexpressed and linked to poor survival, with its silencing reducing cell proliferation and invasion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jin2022Systematic).

RALA mutations are also implicated in neurological disorders. A somatic variant, RALA c.G482A, has been associated with focal cortical dysplasia type II, a condition linked to drug-resistant epilepsy. This mutation activates the mTOR pathway, affecting neuronal migration and contributing to the disorder's pathogenesis (Xu2022Brain).

## Interactions
RalA, a small GTPase, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with Sec5 and Exo84, subunits of the Sec6/8 complex, also known as the exocyst complex. These interactions are GTP-dependent and are essential for the tethering of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, a key step in exocytosis. The binding of RalA to Sec5 and Exo84 is competitive, with both proteins forming distinct subcomplexes within the Sec6/8 complex. This competitive binding suggests a dual-effector mechanism that regulates the assembly of the Sec6/8 complex, which is involved in processes such as synapse formation and cell polarity maintenance (Jin2005Exo84).

RalA also interacts with filamin, a cytoskeletal protein, in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the formation of actin-rich filopodia, as RalA targets filamin to induce filopodia formation. The binding site for RalA on filamin includes the carboxyl-terminal last repeat and the subunit dimerization domain. This interaction highlights RalA's role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Ohta1999The).
