# SDF4

## Overview
The SDF4 gene encodes the stromal cell-derived factor 4 protein, also known as Cab45, which is a calcium-binding protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its multiple EF-hand motifs, which facilitate calcium ion binding, and is primarily localized within the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in the secretory pathway and protein trafficking (Scherer1996Cab45; Honoré2009The). SDF4 is expressed ubiquitously across different tissues and is involved in calcium-dependent processes essential for cellular homeostasis, including cell migration and proliferation, particularly in cancer contexts (Gong2020Location). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms with distinct functions, such as Cab45-G, Cab45-C, and Cab45-S, which are involved in processes like calcium-induced secretion and cargo sorting at the trans-Golgi network (Zhu2021SDF4). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), further underscore its role in complex cellular signaling pathways, including angiogenesis and protein secretion (Chi2021Fibroblast).

## Structure
The SDF4 gene encodes the SdF-4 protein, also known as Cab45, which is a calcium-binding protein with a molecular weight of 45 kDa. The protein consists of 361 amino acids and is encoded by a gene with seven exons located on chromosome 1p36.33 (Gong2020Location). The primary structure of SdF-4 includes a signal sequence and six EF-hand motifs, which are known for their role in calcium binding. Additionally, the protein features a HEEF motif at the C-terminal (Gong2020Location).

SdF-4 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in three isoforms: cab45-G, cab45-c, and cab45-S. Cab45-G is localized in the Golgi complex, cab45-c is found in the cytosol due to the absence of a signal sequence, and cab45-S is secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum (Gong2020Location). These isoforms have distinct functions, such as participating in calcium-induced amylase secretion and regulating cargo sorting at the trans-Golgi network (Zhu2021SDF4).

The protein is involved in calcium-dependent secretory pathways and plays a role in cell migration and proliferation, particularly in cancer (Gong2020Location). However, specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SdF-4 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The SDF4 gene encodes the protein Cab45, which is involved in calcium ion binding and plays a significant role in the secretory pathway. Cab45 is a member of the CREC protein family, characterized by multiple EF-hand motifs that facilitate calcium binding. This protein is primarily localized to the Golgi lumen, where it is involved in calcium-dependent processes essential for protein processing and secretion (Scherer1996Cab45; Honoré2009The).

Cab45 is expressed ubiquitously across tissues, with a notable presence in adipose tissue, and is involved in cellular processes related to calcium signaling and protein trafficking within the Golgi apparatus (Scherer1996Cab45). It is not an integral membrane protein but is instead a soluble protein within the Golgi, suggesting a role in the processing and modification of proteins in this compartment (Scherer1996Cab45).

The protein has several splice variants, including Cab45-G, which is involved in calcium entry into the trans-Golgi network, and Cab45-C, which participates in the exocytosis process in pancreatic cells by forming complexes necessary for membrane fusion (Honoré2009The). These functions highlight Cab45's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating efficient protein secretion.

## Clinical Significance
The SDF4 gene, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 4, has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers, due to alterations in its expression levels. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SDF4 expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, including CD4+ T cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment (Ning2023Expression). Although SDF4 mRNA levels are decreased in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, its protein expression is elevated, indicating a potential role in CRC progression (Ning2023Expression). Genetic alterations such as amplification and deep deletions of SDF4 have been observed, which may contribute to its dysregulation in cancer (Ning2023Expression).

In pancreatic cancer, the secreted splice variant of SDF4, known as Cab45-S, is overexpressed, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for this type of cancer (Honoré2009The). The elevated expression of SDF4 in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues highlights its potential as a therapeutic target and a prognostic marker in cancer treatment and management (Ning2023Expression). However, specific mutations in the SDF4 gene and their direct clinical implications in diseases other than cancer are not well-documented in the provided context.

## Interactions
SDF4, also known as Cab45, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), forming a complex that plays a significant role in angiogenesis, particularly in the context of chemotherapy-induced angiogenesis and metastasis in lung cancer. This interaction leads to the induction of VEGFD expression through the activation of ERK and p38 signaling pathways in endothelial cells (Chi2021Fibroblast).

SDF4 also interacts with proteins involved in the secretion process. Specifically, the Cab45-C variant of SDF4 interacts with Munc18a and Munc18b, which are proteins that play a role in membrane fusion, a critical step in the secretion process. This interaction is calcium-dependent and involves the formation of a ternary complex with Munc18b and syntaxin 3, a SNARE protein involved in pancreatic secretion (Honoré2009The).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SDF4 in cellular signaling and trafficking, influencing processes such as angiogenesis, protein sorting, and secretion. The presence of multiple isoforms of SDF4, each with distinct functions, further underscores its complex involvement in cellular activities (Gong2020Location).
