# PCDH10

## Overview
Protocadherin 10 (PCDH10) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the δ-protocadherin subfamily, specifically categorized within the d2-protocadherins. The protein, protocadherin 10, is a transmembrane protein characterized by its six extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, which are crucial for mediating cell-cell adhesion. PCDH10 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, where it plays a vital role in synapse elimination, dendritic spine regulation, and axon growth, contributing to neural development and synaptic plasticity (Redies2005δProtocadherins:; Keeler2015Protocadherins). Beyond its neural functions, PCDH10 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression frequently downregulated in various cancers through promoter hypermethylation, highlighting its significance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Shan2016Aberrant; Yu2009Methylation).

## Structure
Protocadherin 10 (PCDH10) is a member of the δ-protocadherin subfamily, specifically classified within the d2-protocadherins. The primary structure of PCDH10 includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the PCDH10 gene, which features six extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (Redies2005δProtocadherins:). The secondary structure is characterized by these cadherin repeats, which form the extracellular domains essential for cell-cell adhesion (Harrison2020Familywide).

The tertiary structure of PCDH10 involves the linear arrangement of its EC domains, stabilized by calcium ions, which is crucial for maintaining its structural integrity and function (Harrison2020Familywide). The quaternary structure of PCDH10 is defined by its ability to form antiparallel trans dimers, with specific interfaces between EC1:EC4 and EC2:EC3 contributing to its homophilic binding specificity (Harrison2020Familywide).

Post-translational modifications of PCDH10 include N-linked glycosylation on the B-strand of EC3 and O-linked glycans on the EC2 G-strand, which may influence protein stability and function (Harrison2020Familywide). PCDH10 is expressed in multiple splice forms, primarily differing in their cytoplasmic domains, which may result in distinct functional properties (Redies2005δProtocadherins:).

## Function
PCDH10, also known as protocadherin 10, is a member of the non-clustered protocadherin family, primarily expressed in the nervous system. It plays a significant role in synapse elimination and dendritic spine regulation, which are crucial for maintaining synaptic plasticity and function in neurons. PCDH10 is involved in the ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of the spine protein PSD-95, a process essential for synapse regulation (Keeler2015Protocadherins). 

PCDH10 is also implicated in axon growth and synapse dynamics, with its expression detected along axon fibers, suggesting a role in axon development. Knockout studies in mice have shown defects in the formation of axon tracts, such as the thalamocortical and corticospinal tracts, although results vary between different studies (Hayashi2015Emerging). 

In terms of molecular interactions, PCDH10 interacts with Nap1 and WAVE1, affecting actin assembly and promoting cell migration. This interaction suggests that PCDH10 functions as a regulator of cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling, rather than merely serving as a physical connector between cells (Kim2011Nonclustered). PCDH10's role in these processes highlights its importance in neural development and connectivity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PCDH10 gene have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as several types of cancer. In the context of neurological conditions, PCDH10 is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), where mutations can disrupt synapse elimination, leading to altered social behaviors and communication (Zhen2023The). It is also linked to other neurological conditions such as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression, and schizophrenia, where it is considered a susceptibility gene (Zhen2023The).

In cancer, PCDH10 functions as a tumor suppressor and is frequently downregulated through promoter hypermethylation in various cancers, including colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, and breast cancers (Shan2016Aberrant; Kleinberger2022Innovative). This downregulation is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Yu2009Methylation; Zhong2017Epigenetic). In gastric cancer, PCDH10 methylation is linked to shorter survival times, and its re-expression can suppress tumor growth and metastasis (Yu2009Methylation). In colorectal cancer, PCDH10 silencing is an early event in carcinogenesis, contributing to tumor growth and invasion (Zhong2017Epigenetic). The gene's methylation status serves as a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis (Zhen2023The).

## Interactions
Protocadherin 10 (PCDH10) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell-cell adhesion and signaling. PCDH10 forms a WAVE regulatory complex by interacting with proteins such as Nck-associated protein 1 (Nap1), Sra-1/PIR121/cytoplasmic interacting FMR1 protein 2 (CYFIP2), Abl interactor 1 (Abi-1), hematopoietic stem/cell progenitor protein 300 (HSPC300), and WAVE1. This complex is recruited to inter-axonal contact sites, leading to the reorganization of F-actin and redistribution of N-cadherin, which influences cell migration (Zhen2023The).

PCDH10 also interacts with post-synaptic scaffolding protein 95 (PSD-95), which is ubiquitinated by Murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) in response to myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) activation. This interaction results in the degradation of PSD-95, playing a role in synapse elimination (Zhen2023The).

Structurally, PCDH10 forms dimers through its EC1-EC4 domains, which are crucial for its homophilic binding interactions. These interactions are characterized by a canonical dimer arrangement and involve conserved hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions at the EC1:EC4 and EC2:EC3 interfaces (Harrison2020Familywide).
