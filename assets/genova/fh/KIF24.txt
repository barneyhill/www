# KIF24

## Overview
KIF24 is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 24, which is part of the kinesin-13 subfamily of motor proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, playing a crucial role in ciliogenesis and cilium disassembly. Kinesin family member 24 is characterized by its conserved motor domain, which facilitates ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, essential for its microtubule-depolymerizing activity (EmsMcClung2010Kinesin13s; Friel2018Parts). The protein interacts with centrosomal proteins such as CP110 and Cep97, and its activity is modulated by phosphorylation through the kinase Nek2, which enhances its function in cilium disassembly (Kobayashi2011Centriolar; Kim2015Nek2). KIF24's role in cellular processes makes it significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Venturelli2010Is; Kim2015Nek2).

## Structure
KIF24 is a kinesin protein characterized by a conserved motor domain that facilitates ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, essential for its microtubule depolymerizing activity (EmsMcClung2010Kinesin13s; Friel2018Parts). The motor domain includes a P loop or Walker A motif, which is crucial for ATPase activity (Kobayashi2011Centriolar). KIF24 also contains a SAM domain, which is a putative protein interaction domain (Kobayashi2011Centriolar).

Structurally, KIF24 has a longer C-terminal region compared to other Kinesin-13 family members, which may influence its specific functions (Friel2018Parts). The protein includes an N-terminal domain, a positively charged neck region, a centrally located motor domain, and a C-terminal domain, typical of Kinesin-13 proteins (Friel2018Parts). The C-terminal domain is involved in dimerization, enhancing its depolymerization efficiency (EmsMcClung2010Kinesin13s).

KIF24 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by the kinase Nek2, which induces conformational changes necessary for its function in cilium disassembly (Kim2015Nek2). This phosphorylation occurs at specific residues, including T621/S622, and is crucial for activating KIF24's microtubule-depolymerizing activity (Kim2015Nek2).

## Function
KIF24 is a kinesin motor protein that plays a critical role in microtubule dynamics, particularly in the regulation of ciliogenesis and cilium disassembly in healthy human cells. It is part of the kinesin-13 subfamily and interacts with centrosomal proteins CP110 and Cep97, which are involved in controlling centriolar length and ciliogenesis (Kobayashi2011Centriolar; Hirokawa2015Kinesin). KIF24 localizes primarily to the mother centriole and is crucial for proper cilia assembly by remodeling centriolar microtubules without significantly affecting cytoplasmic microtubules (Kobayashi2011Centriolar).

KIF24 exhibits microtubule-depolymerizing activity, which is essential for suppressing the growth of elongated centrioles and inhibiting cilia formation (Kobayashi2011Centriolar). This activity is regulated by phosphorylation through the kinase Nek2, which enhances KIF24's ability to depolymerize microtubules, particularly during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (Sánchez2016Cilium; Kim2015Nek2). This regulation ensures that ciliary axonemes are disassembled, preventing inappropriate cilium assembly in proliferating cells and maintaining a deciliated state necessary for mitosis (Sánchez2016Cilium; Kim2015Nek2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KIF24 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cancer, KIF24 is overexpressed in breast cancer cells, where it plays a role in cilium disassembly, contributing to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The overexpression of KIF24, along with Nek2, suppresses cilia formation, which is a hallmark of cancer cell proliferation (Kim2015Nek2). In gastric cancer, KIF24 has been identified as a prognostic marker, with higher expression levels associated with better prognosis, suggesting its potential role in tumor suppression (Zhong2023Multiple).

KIF24 has also been studied in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in KIF24, rs17350674, has been associated with an increased risk of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD), particularly in female patients and those with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (Venturelli2010Is).

In reproductive health, a duplication involving the KIF24 gene has been linked to ovarian failure, suggesting its role in ovarian physiology and potential implications for fertility (Jaillard2016ArrayCGH). Additionally, KIF24 mutations have been associated with distant metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Wu2021Driver).

## Interactions
KIF24, a kinesin motor protein, interacts with several proteins to regulate cilia disassembly and centrosome function. It specifically binds to centrosomal proteins CP110 and Cep97, which are involved in controlling centriolar length and ciliogenesis. KIF24 localizes to mother centrioles and its absence leads to the disappearance of CP110 from these centrioles in cells capable of forming cilia (Hirokawa2015Kinesin).

KIF24 is also a substrate for the serine/threonine kinase Nek2. Nek2 phosphorylates KIF24, enhancing its microtubule-depolymerizing activity, which is crucial for cilium disassembly during the cell cycle. This interaction is particularly important during the S/G2 phases, where Nek2 and KIF24 co-localize, indicating a coordinated role in preventing cilia formation (Kim2015Nek2). The phosphorylation of KIF24 by Nek2 induces a conformational change that enhances its ability to depolymerize microtubules, ensuring the disassembly of the ciliary axoneme necessary for mitotic spindle formation (Kim2015Nek2).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, KIF24 interacts with CP110 and CEP97 to suppress primary cilia assembly. It also forms a complex with MPP9, CP110, and CEP97 to inhibit ciliogenesis (Mashima2022KIF24a).
