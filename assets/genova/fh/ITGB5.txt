# ITGB5

## Overview
The ITGB5 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 5, a critical component of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors. These receptors are pivotal in mediating cell adhesion and signaling processes. The integrin subunit beta 5, when paired with the alpha V subunit, forms the αVβ5 integrin heterodimer, which is involved in various cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). This interaction is essential for processes such as cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as for maintaining tissue integrity and function (Cheng2024Integrin; Holmes2011Comparative). ITGB5 is also implicated in physiological processes like angiogenesis and wound healing, and it plays a role in immune cell trafficking. Furthermore, ITGB5 has been associated with pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Velho2019Expression; Xu2021Expression).

## Structure
The ITGB5 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 5, which is part of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The primary structure of ITGB5 consists of a sequence of amino acids, including a signal peptide of 24 amino acids that directs the nascent protein to the secretory pathway (Holmes2011Comparative). The secondary structure includes a central helical domain with anterior and posterior coiled motifs, which are common features among integrin beta subunits (Holmes2011Comparative).

The tertiary structure of ITGB5 is characterized by a folded three-dimensional shape, stabilized by disulfide bonds, which is typical for integrin proteins. The quaternary structure involves pairing with an alpha subunit, such as alpha V, to form a functional heterodimer. This pairing is crucial for its role in binding to ligands like fibronectin and vitronectin (Holmes2011Comparative).

ITGB5 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which are important for its stability and function. The gene may also produce splice variant isoforms, contributing to structural and functional diversity (Holmes2011Comparative). The cytoplasmic domain of ITGB5 contains conserved motifs, such as NPXY and NXXY, which are essential for interactions with intracellular proteins (Holmes2011Comparative).

## Function
Integrin subunit beta 5 (ITGB5) is a component of the integrin family, which are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion and signaling. ITGB5 pairs with the alpha V subunit to form the αVβ5 integrin, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ITGB5 is involved in cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, which are essential for maintaining tissue structure and function (Xu2021Expression). These interactions influence cell behavior, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation, by activating signaling pathways such as the PI3K-Akt pathway (Liu2022Comprehensive).

ITGB5 is also implicated in processes like angiogenesis and wound healing, where it facilitates cellular responses to environmental cues (Velho2019Expression). The protein is active in the ECM, where it contributes to the regulation of collagen metabolism and the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway, which are vital for tissue integrity (Xu2021Expression). Additionally, ITGB5 is involved in leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, highlighting its role in immune cell trafficking and immune response regulation (Xu2021Expression). These functions underscore the importance of ITGB5 in maintaining normal cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The ITGB5 gene, encoding integrin subunit beta 5, plays a significant role in various cancers, including gastric cancer (GC), glioblastoma (GBM), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). In gastric cancer, ITGB5 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced clinical stages. Its high expression is linked to increased immune cell infiltration, particularly M2 macrophages, and is associated with immune checkpoint-related mRNA, impacting immunotherapy efficacy. Patients with lower ITGB5 expression tend to have better outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Cheng2024Integrin).

In glioblastoma, ITGB5 is highly expressed in the mesenchymal subtype, associated with poor survival outcomes. It influences tumor progression by promoting cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, and is linked to immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment (Zhang2019Integrin).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ITGB5 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and contributes to radiation resistance by enhancing DNA damage repair and activating the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Knockout studies show that reducing ITGB5 expression decreases tumor growth and proliferation (Wen2022ITGB5).

Mutations in ITGB5 have also been implicated in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), where a missense mutation affects protein function and is linked to disease pathogenesis (Cheng2021ITGB5).

## Interactions
ITGB5, or integrin subunit beta 5, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. ITGB5 forms a heterodimer with integrin αV to create the integrin αVβ5 complex, which is involved in cell adhesion and signaling. This complex primarily binds to extracellular matrix proteins such as vitronectin, facilitating cell migration and adhesion (Zhang2002p21activated).

ITGB5 also interacts with P21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4), which binds to a conserved region in the integrin β5 cytoplasmic domain. This interaction is significant for αVβ5-mediated cell migration, particularly on vitronectin, and suggests a role in modulating the extracellular motility machinery (Zhang2002p21activated).

In the context of bacterial infections, ITGB5 has been identified as a receptor for Escherichia coli F4ac, with the FaeG protein of the bacteria binding directly to ITGB5. This interaction is crucial for the adhesion of ETEC F4ac to intestinal cells, highlighting ITGB5's role in bacterial adhesion processes (Wang2019ITGB5).

In cancer, ITGB5 interacts with β-catenin, enhancing its stability and promoting tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma. This interaction is part of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is involved in cancer cell proliferation and migration (Lin2018RETRACTED).
