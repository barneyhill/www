# RPS19BP1

## Overview
RPS19BP1, or ribosomal protein S19 binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and function. The protein, categorized as a ribosomal binding protein, plays a critical role in the assembly and stability of ribosomal subunits, which are essential for efficient protein synthesis. RPS19BP1 is predominantly active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to ribosome production, thereby influencing cell growth and proliferation (Vuong2019Proteome). Beyond its fundamental role in ribosome assembly, RPS19BP1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein folding and the unfolded protein response, which are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions (Klyosova2023Differentially). The gene's expression and interactions have been linked to significant clinical conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Klyosova2023Differentially; Luo2021Systematic).

## Structure


## Function
RPS19BP1, or ribosomal protein S19 binding protein 1, is involved in ribosome biogenesis and function. It interacts with ribosomal protein S19, playing a role in the assembly and stability of ribosomal subunits, which is crucial for efficient protein synthesis. This protein is active in the nucleolus, where ribosome production occurs, impacting cell growth and proliferation (Vuong2019Proteome).

In the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus, RPS19BP1 is up-regulated in pancreatic beta cells of diabetic patients. It is part of the small subunit processome that directly regulates SIRT1, a protein that optimizes metabolic adaptation to insulin resistance by improving hepatic insulin sensitivity and decreasing whole-body energy requirements. This suggests that RPS19BP1-mediated activation of SIRT1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (Lu2020Identification; Klyosova2023Differentially).

RPS19BP1 is also involved in protein folding and the unfolded protein response (UPR), processes that are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions. Its altered expression in type 2 diabetes indicates its involvement in these cellular processes, potentially affecting insulin sensitivity and beta cell function (Klyosova2023Differentially).

## Clinical Significance
RPS19BP1, also known as ribosomal protein S19 binding protein 1, has been implicated in several clinical conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), RPS19BP1 is differentially expressed in pancreatic beta cells, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis. It is involved in regulating SIRT1, a protein that optimizes metabolic adaptation to insulin resistance, indicating that RPS19BP1 may influence insulin sensitivity and energy requirements in T2DM patients (Lu2020Identification; Klyosova2023Differentially). 

In cancer research, RPS19BP1 has been identified as a potential prognostic marker. It is part of a 12-RBP signature model for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is associated with cancer cell survival and prognosis (Luo2021Systematic). Additionally, RPS19BP1 is involved in breast cancer as part of a fusion transcript, JOSD1!RPS19BP1, which may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Asmann2012Detection).

While specific diseases directly caused by RPS19BP1 mutations are not detailed, its dysregulation is linked to significant metabolic and oncological conditions, highlighting its clinical relevance.

## Interactions
RPS19BP1, also known as ribosomal protein S19 binding protein 1, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. In human embryonic stem cells, RPS19BP1 is part of endogenous retrotransposon-associated complexes, where it potentially interacts with other proteins or nucleic acids, as identified in a proteomic study (Vuong2019Proteome). 

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RPS19BP1 is included in a prognostic model based on RNA-binding protein signatures. It is identified as a risk gene with a positive regression coefficient, indicating its involvement in RNA-related processes and interactions with other RNA-binding proteins (Luo2021Systematic). RPS19BP1 is also known to regulate SIRT1, a protein that modulates p53-mediated growth regulation, suggesting its role in cancer cell survival and interaction with the p53 pathway (Luo2021Systematic).

In type 2 diabetes mellitus, RPS19BP1 shows differential expression in pancreatic beta cells and is part of the small subunit processome that regulates SIRT1. This interaction is implicated in metabolic adaptation to insulin resistance, highlighting its role in cellular processes related to diabetes (Klyosova2023Differentially).
