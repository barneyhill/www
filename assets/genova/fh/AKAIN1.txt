# AKAIN1

## Overview
AKAIN1 (A-kinase anchor inhibitor 1) is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. The protein, also named A-kinase anchor inhibitor 1, functions primarily as an inhibitor of PKA anchoring, thereby playing a critical role in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and metabolic pathways. The AKAIN1 protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, where it modulates cellular responses to hormonal signals, influencing broader physiological functions like metabolism and growth. Notably, AKAIN1 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, where it is differentially expressed in the entorhinal cortex, a brain region affected early in the disease. This suggests its potential utility as an early diagnostic marker or therapeutic target (Liu2023The). Despite its recognized role in disease contexts, further research is needed to elucidate its functions in normal cellular physiology.

## Function
AKAIN1 (A-kinase anchor inhibitor 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of protein kinase A (PKA) activity by inhibiting its anchoring. This regulation is crucial for various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle control, and metabolic pathways. The AKAIN1 protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular responses to hormonal signals, impacting organismal functions such as metabolism and growth.

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, AKAIN1 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene in the entorhinal cortex, a region affected early in the disease. The gene is involved in inflammatory pathways, suggesting its potential role as an early diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (Liu2023The). The gene's expression has been associated with a strong diagnostic utility, as indicated by its area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.90 in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (Liu2023The).

Despite its involvement in these processes, specific details about the function of AKAIN1 in healthy human cells remain limited, as the available studies primarily focus on its role in disease contexts.
