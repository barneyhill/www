# DCAF1

## Overview
DCAF1, also known as DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein, often referred to as VprBP, functions primarily as a substrate receptor within the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a pivotal role in protein ubiquitination and degradation pathways. Characterized by structural domains such as the WD40 domain, helix-loop-helix motif, and Lis1-homology domain, DCAF1 facilitates critical protein-protein interactions necessary for its function (Wu2016The; Schabla2018DCAF1). It is integral to processes such as ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA replication, and is implicated in the modulation of p53 activity, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis (Guo2016DCAF1; Han2020CRL4). Clinically, alterations in DCAF1 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Clothier2022Identification; Ghate2023Phosphorylation).

## Structure
The DCAF1 protein, also known as VprBP, is a substrate receptor for E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function. It contains a WD40 domain, which consists of sequences resembling WD40 repeats, forming a seven-bladed β-propeller structure that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This domain includes a 'WDXR' motif crucial for binding to DDB1, a component of the CRL4 complex (Wu2016The; Schabla2018DCAF1). 

DCAF1 also features a helix-loop-helix motif, known as the H-box, which inserts into the BPA-BPC cleft of DDB1, stabilizing the interaction (Wu2016The; Schabla2018DCAF1). The protein contains a Lis1-homology (LisH) domain required for dimerization, with residues 845-873 forming an alpha-helical structure essential for oligomerization (Ahn2011The). 

Beyond these motifs, DCAF1 has a large N-terminal domain with Armadillo (ARM)-like folds, a casein kinase (CK)-like domain, and a chromo-like domain, providing additional interfaces for protein interactions (Schabla2018DCAF1). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, such as isoform 3, which lacks certain domains and shows impaired interaction with DDB1 (Schabla2018DCAF1).

## Function
DCAF1, also known as VprBP, is a crucial component of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in ribosome biogenesis by regulating the ubiquitylation of PWP1, a ribosome assembly factor, which is essential for proper rRNA processing and ribosome assembly (Han2020CRL4). DCAF1 is also critical for cell proliferation and development, as its deletion leads to the selective elimination of proliferating cells and increased apoptosis, particularly in T cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Han2020CRL4).

In the context of T-cell function, DCAF1 is essential for T-cell growth and cell cycle entry, operating through both p53-dependent and independent mechanisms. It regulates the stability of the p53 protein, facilitating MDM2-mediated p53 poly-ubiquitination, which is crucial for T-cell proliferation (Guo2016DCAF1). DCAF1 also influences the transcriptional activity of p53 by interacting with it and being recruited to the promoters of p53 target genes, thereby modulating gene expression (Schabla2018DCAF1).

DCAF1's role extends to the regulation of cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and cell division, where it is involved in S-phase progression and mitotic entry by targeting specific proteins for degradation (Schabla2018DCAF1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DCAF1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A de novo variant in the DCAF1 gene, specifically c.137 C > T (p.Thr46Ile), has been identified in a patient with autism and intellectual disability. This variant is considered a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) but is suggested to have a deleterious effect on protein structure or function. The study highlights the potential role of DCAF1 in neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting it may be a newly identified molecular cause of autism and intellectual disability (Clothier2022Identification).

In cancer biology, DCAF1 is overexpressed in colon cancer and is involved in the phosphorylation of EZH2, a process that contributes to oncogenic transformation by silencing growth regulatory genes. This interaction suggests that DCAF1 plays a significant role in tumor growth and progression, making it a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment (Ghate2023Phosphorylation).

DCAF1 also plays a critical role in T-cell function, where its deletion leads to impaired cell cycle entry and increased apoptosis due to the stabilization of the p53 protein. This suggests that alterations in DCAF1 expression or interactions could impact immune function, potentially affecting clinical outcomes in conditions involving immune responses (Guo2016DCAF1).

## Interactions
DCAF1, also known as VprBP, is a substrate receptor for the DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and is involved in various protein-protein interactions. It interacts with DDB1 through its WD40 domains, which are crucial for forming the CRL4 complex. The WD40 domains facilitate protein-protein interactions through a planar, solvent-exposed structure, and the H-box motif within DCAF1 inserts into the BPA-BPC cleft of DDB1, stabilizing the interaction (Schabla2018DCAF1). Mutations in the WDxR motifs of DCAF1 can disrupt its binding with DDB1, and a double mutation in these motifs completely disrupts DDB1 recruitment (Gérard2014Defining).

DCAF1 also interacts with HIV-1 Vpr, forming a ternary complex with DDB1. The C-terminal region of DCAF1, specifically the WD-40 motifs, is sufficient for this interaction (Gérard2014Defining). The LisH motif within DCAF1 is critical for its oligomerization, which is essential for forming the DDB1-DCAF1 complex (Ahn2011The). DCAF1 is also part of a larger mega-complex that includes components of the CRL4 complex and the COP9 signalosome in T cells (Guo2016DCAF1). These interactions highlight DCAF1's role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, influencing protein stability and cellular processes.
