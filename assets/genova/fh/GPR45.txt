# GPR45

## Overview
GPR45 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 45, a member of the GPCR family, which is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in regions such as the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, and hypothalamus, where it plays a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis and metabolic processes (Cui2016Disruption; Marchese1999Discovery). The GPR45 protein is involved in the modulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, influencing the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), a neuropeptide essential for maintaining energy balance (Cui2016Disruption). Disruptions in GPR45 function have been linked to metabolic disorders, such as obesity and insulin resistance, as well as neurological conditions, including cone-rod dystrophy and Alzheimer's disease, underscoring its significance in both metabolic and neurological health (Cui2016Disruption; Vélez2016Mutations; Astuti2018Identification).

## Structure
The GPR45 protein is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a primary structure consisting of 372 amino acids. It exhibits the typical seven-transmembrane domain architecture that is characteristic of GPCRs (Marchese1999Discovery). The protein includes three consensus sequences for potential glycosylation sites at the amino-terminal end, specifically at Asn4, Asn17, and Asn20, and a putative palmitoylation site at Cys336 within the carboxyl-terminal end (Marchese1999Discovery). These post-translational modifications are common in GPCRs and can influence receptor function and signaling pathways.

The GPR45 gene is expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, with notable expression in the brain, including regions such as the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and brain stem (Cui2016Disruption; Marchese1999Discovery). Despite its structural similarities to a putative lysophosphatidic acid receptor from Xenopus laevis, functional assays have not supported GPR45 as an LPA receptor (Marchese1999Discovery). The secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as specific domains and prominent folds of GPR45, are not detailed in the available literature.

## Function
GPR45, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a role in regulating energy homeostasis and metabolic processes. The protein encoded by the GPR45 gene is involved in the regulation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) expression, a critical neuropeptide for energy balance. Disruption of GPR45 in mice leads to reduced hypothalamic POMC expression, resulting in obesity and metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis (Cui2016Disruption).

GPR45 influences energy expenditure by interacting with the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is essential for the activation of STAT3, a transcription factor involved in POMC expression. This interaction affects neuronal activity, as evidenced by hyperpolarized membrane potentials and reduced firing rates in POMC-expressing neurons of GPR45 mutant mice (Cui2016Disruption). The receptor's role in these pathways suggests its involvement in maintaining energy balance and body weight regulation. Although the specific function of GPR45 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its expression in the brain and potential regulatory roles in metabolism indicate its importance in neurological and metabolic functions (Marchese1999Discovery).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPR45 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. Disruption of GPR45 in mice leads to obesity, hepatic steatosis, and impaired glucose homeostasis. This is primarily due to reduced expression of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which affects energy expenditure and body weight regulation (Cui2016Disruption). The study suggests that GPR45 plays a critical role in regulating body weight and energy balance, and its disruption is linked to decreased energy expenditure rather than increased energy intake (Cui2016Disruption).

In humans, a homozygous missense variant in GPR45, c.4G>A (p.(Ala2Thr)), has been identified in individuals with cone-rod dystrophy (CRD), a retinal degenerative disease. This variant is predicted to destabilize the GPR45 protein, potentially affecting its function in the neurological system (Astuti2018Identification).

Additionally, GPR45 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). A specific mutation in GPR45 is noted to accelerate the age of onset in sAD patients, suggesting that GPR45 could be a potential therapeutic target for this neurodegenerative condition (Vélez2016Mutations). These findings highlight the significance of GPR45 in various metabolic and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
GPR45, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. In the brain of adult HA-GPR45 transgenic mice, GPR45 interacts with JAK2, a protein-tyrosine kinase crucial for activating STAT3. This interaction was confirmed through immunoprecipitation analysis and in vitro binding assays, which demonstrated that JAK2 binds to the carboxyl terminus (GPR45-C tail) of GPR45, but not to the third intracellular loop (GPR45-i3) (Cui2016Disruption).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using an anti-STAT3 antibody revealed reduced recruitment of STAT3 to the Pomc promoter in the hypothalami of GPR45 mutants, suggesting a regulatory role of GPR45 in Pomc expression through its interaction with STAT3 (Cui2016Disruption). These findings indicate that GPR45 may influence energy homeostasis and metabolism by modulating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, impacting the transcriptional regulation of POMC, a neuropeptide involved in energy balance (Cui2016Disruption).
