# CEP126

## Overview
CEP126 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 126, a critical component involved in the organization and function of the centrosome, which serves as the primary microtubule-organizing center in animal cells. The protein plays a pivotal role in cell division by contributing to the formation and stabilization of the mitotic spindle, essential for accurate chromosome segregation and genome stability (Chadourne2021Structural; Hori2016Regulation). Additionally, centrosomal protein 126 is involved in maintaining the integrity of centriolar satellites, which are crucial for protein delivery to the centrosome and primary cilium. Its interactions within the centrosome and association with microtubules underscore its importance in cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and neurodevelopment (Hung2023PTEN; Hori2016Regulation). Mutations or alterations in CEP126 expression have been linked to various diseases, including Hirayama Disease and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Gao2020Genomic; Baddam2024A).

## Function
CEP126, also known as centrosomal protein 126, is a crucial component in centrosome function and microtubule organization within human cells. It is localized at the centrosome, which is the primary microtubule-organizing center in animal cells, playing a significant role in cell division by contributing to the proper formation and stabilization of the mitotic spindle (Chadourne2021Structural; Hori2016Regulation). During mitosis, CEP126 is associated with γ-tubulin on the centriole, indicating its involvement in microtubule dynamics and organization (Chadourne2021Structural).

CEP126 is also implicated in maintaining the integrity of centriolar satellites, which are cytoplasmic granules that facilitate the delivery of proteins to the centrosome and primary cilium. Depletion of CEP126 impairs the pericentriolar patterns of centriolar satellite localization, suggesting its role in the structural organization of these satellites (Hori2016Regulation). The protein's interactions within the centrosome and its association with microtubules are essential for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division, thereby maintaining genome stability (Chadourne2021Structural). Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms of CEP126's function in these processes remains an area of active research.

## Clinical Significance
CEP126 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In Hirayama Disease (HD), a rare disorder affecting lower motor neurons, CEP126 mutations have been identified as potential susceptibility factors. The onset of HD is significantly correlated with homozygosity for the CEP126 mutation or heterozygosity for both CEP126 and C5orf42 variants, suggesting these genes may act together in the development of monomeric amyotrophy associated with HD (Baddam2024A).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, CEP126 is involved in nervous system-related phenotypes. It has been associated with abnormalities in nervous system physiology, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and morphological abnormalities of the central nervous system in studies of the Chongming White Goat breed, indicating its potential role in similar human conditions (Gao2020Genomic).

CEP126 is also involved in ciliogenesis, as evidenced by its upregulation in PTEN knockout models of lung cancer, which suggests a role in bronchial cell hyperplasia during cancer progression (Hung2023PTEN). Additionally, reduced expression of CEP126 has been linked to ciliary defects and photoreceptor degeneration in zebrafish models, indicating its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Jia2022Tulp1).
