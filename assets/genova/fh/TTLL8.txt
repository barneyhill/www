# TTLL8

## Overview
TTLL8 (tubulin tyrosine ligase like 8) is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin, a key component of the cytoskeleton. The protein product of TTLL8 functions as a glycyl initiase, catalyzing the addition of monoglycines to the C-terminal tails of α- and β-tubulin, which is a critical step in the glycylation process. This modification is essential for the stability and function of microtubules, particularly in the formation and maintenance of primary cilia, which are important for cell proliferation and tissue homeostasis (Rocha2014Tubulin; Cummings2024The). TTLL8 operates primarily in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with microtubules to influence their stability and function, playing a vital role in cellular processes such as cell division and intracellular transport (Cummings2024The). The enzyme's activity is crucial in tissues where it is expressed, supporting the proper function of cilia and flagella (Rocha2014Tubulin).

## Function
TTLL8 (tubulin tyrosine ligase like 8) is an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin, specifically through the process of glycylation. It functions as an initiase, adding monoglycines to unmodified microtubules by targeting glutamate residues on both alpha and beta-tubulin tails. This activity is crucial for initiating the glycylation process, which is a precursor step for further modifications by other enzymes, such as TTLL10, which elongates these monoglycine chains (Cummings2024The).

In healthy human cells, TTLL8 plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of primary cilia, which are essential for cell proliferation and tissue homeostasis. Glycylation by TTLL8 is necessary for the stability of ciliary axonemes, contributing to the proper function of cilia and flagella (Rocha2014Tubulin). The enzyme's activity is particularly important in tissues where it is expressed, as it supports the formation and maintenance of primary cilia, which are crucial for various cellular processes (Rocha2014Tubulin).

TTLL8 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with microtubules, influencing their stability and function. This activity is vital for proper cell division, intracellular transport, and maintaining cell structure (Cummings2024The).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TTLL8 is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin through glycylation, a process crucial for microtubule function. TTLL8 acts as a glycyl initiase, adding monoglycines to the C-terminal tails of both α- and β-tubulin, which is essential for initiating glycylation on microtubules (Cummings2024The). This enzyme specifically targets glutamates on tubulin tails, adding branch-point glycines without forming polyglycine chains (Cummings2024The).

TTLL8 interacts functionally with TTLL10, another enzyme in the tubulin modification pathway. TTLL10 is a polyglycylase that elongates polyglycine chains from pre-existing monoglycines, but it requires prior monoglycylation by TTLL8 to function effectively. This indicates a sequential enzymatic process where TTLL8 initiates glycylation, and TTLL10 subsequently elongates the glycyl chains (Cummings2024The). TTLL10's activity is stimulated by tubulin glutamylation and inhibited by polyglycylation, suggesting a regulatory mechanism involving multiple post-translational modifications (Cummings2024The).

The interaction between TTLL8 and TTLL10 highlights the importance of TTLL8 in the initial stages of microtubule glycylation, setting the stage for further modifications by other enzymes in the pathway (Cummings2024The).
