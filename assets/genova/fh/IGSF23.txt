# IGSF23

## Overview
The IGSF23 gene encodes the protein immunoglobulin superfamily member 23, which is a part of the immunoglobulin superfamily known for its roles in cell-cell recognition, adhesion, and communication. This gene is primarily involved in osteoclastogenesis, a critical process for bone resorption and homeostasis. IGSF23 is expressed in osteoclasts and osteoblasts, indicating its significant role in maintaining bone density and remodeling. The protein's function is essential for the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts, and its absence or mutation can lead to skeletal disorders such as osteopetrosis, characterized by increased bone density due to impaired osteoclast function (Yuan2019Osteoclastogenesis). Additionally, IGSF23 is implicated in immune response processes, as evidenced by its regulation in response to infections, suggesting a broader role in cellular interactions and signaling pathways (Hempel2016Transcriptional).

## Structure


## Function
The IGSF23 gene is involved in the process of osteoclastogenesis, which is crucial for bone resorption. In healthy individuals, IGSF23 is expressed in osteoclasts and osteoblasts, indicating its role in bone homeostasis. The gene is necessary for the formation of osteoclasts from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) when induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL) (Yuan2019Osteoclastogenesis). IGSF23 is expressed in bone and small intestine tissues, suggesting its involvement in cellular interactions and signaling pathways in these areas (Yuan2019Osteoclastogenesis).

The protein encoded by IGSF23 is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is known for roles in cell-cell recognition, adhesion, and communication. These functions are essential for maintaining cellular interactions and signaling pathways, contributing to the regulation of bone density and resorption activities. The expression of IGSF23 in osteoclasts is critical for their differentiation and function, which are necessary for normal bone remodeling and homeostasis (Yuan2019Osteoclastogenesis). The absence or mutation of IGSF23 can lead to conditions such as osteopetrosis, characterized by increased bone density due to impaired osteoclast function (Yuan2019Osteoclastogenesis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IGSF23 gene have been linked to osteopetrosis, a rare inherited skeletal disorder characterized by increased bone mineral density and impaired osteoclast function. A study identified a nonsense mutation (c.295C>T) in exon 2 of the IGSF23 gene in a 41-year-old woman with osteopetrosis. This mutation results in a truncated protein and was found to be associated with the disease in her family. All affected individuals were homozygous for the mutation, while unaffected family members were either heterozygous or normal. The mutation was absent in 180 unrelated normal samples, suggesting its pathogenic role in osteopetrosis (Yuan2019Osteoclastogenesis).

The IGSF23 gene is expressed in bone and small intestine, and its expression is necessary for osteoclast formation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the proband with the IGSF23 mutation exhibited reduced osteoclast formation and bone resorption activity compared to those from unaffected family members. Overexpression of IGSF23 in mutant PBMCs was able to rescue these defects, highlighting the gene's crucial role in osteoclastogenesis. The mutation in IGSF23 disrupts normal osteoclast differentiation and function, leading to the development of osteopetrosis (Yuan2019Osteoclastogenesis).

## Interactions
IGSF23, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is involved in immune response processes, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not well-documented. In studies involving Holstein dairy cows infected with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), IGSF23 was identified as one of the most highly regulated genes, suggesting its role in immune responses, potentially through interactions typical of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins, which often act as co-receptors or co-stimulators on immune cells like T and natural killer (NK) cells (Hempel2016Transcriptional).

A CRISPRa enrichment screening study identified IGSF23 as a high-ranking hit in interactions with the ligand SMOC1, which is overexpressed in brain tumors. This suggests a potential interaction between IGSF23 and SMOC1, although the specific nature of this interaction remains to be elucidated (Siepe2022Identification). Despite these findings, detailed mechanisms or specific partners for IGSF23 interactions are not provided in the available literature. The role of IGSF23 in cell adhesion and immune responses is inferred from its classification within the immunoglobulin superfamily, which includes proteins known for their involvement in cell-cell recognition and adhesion processes (AlonsoHearn2019RNASeq).
