# ENO2

## Overview
The ENO2 gene encodes the protein enolase 2, also known as neuron-specific enolase (NSE), which is a glycolytic enzyme predominantly expressed in neural tissues. As a member of the enolase family, enolase 2 plays a crucial role in the glycolytic pathway by catalyzing the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, a key step in cellular energy production (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). The protein is characterized by its homodimeric structure and requires divalent cations such as Mg2+ for its enzymatic activity (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). Beyond its metabolic functions, enolase 2 is involved in various cellular processes, including neural development and function, and has been implicated in hypoxia tolerance and tumor suppression (Horvat2024Multifunctional; Holmes2011Bioinformatic). The ENO2 gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential biological roles (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). Additionally, alterations in ENO2 expression have been associated with several cancers, where it often serves as a biomarker for poor prognosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Lv2022ENO2; Shi2023ENO2).

## Structure
ENO2, also known as neuron-specific enolase, is a glycolytic enzyme primarily expressed in neural tissues. The protein is a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure composed of two identical subunits (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). Each subunit of ENO2 contains two major domains: the C-terminal domain forms an α/β barrel structure, which includes the active site, while the N-terminal domain has a flexible loop that folds over the active site (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). This α/β barrel is a characteristic fold of enolases, facilitating the enzyme's catalytic activity.

ENO2 requires two Mg2+ ions for its catalytic function, which bind at distinct sites to facilitate the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including acetylation and phosphorylation, which are significant for the regulation of cellular metabolism (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). These modifications may influence the enzyme's activity and stability.

The ENO2 gene is highly conserved and shares a common evolutionary origin with other enolase genes, such as ENO1 and ENO3 (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). While specific details on splice variant isoforms of ENO2 are not provided, the gene's conservation suggests functional importance across species.

## Function
ENO2, also known as neuron-specific enolase, is a glycolytic enzyme that plays a critical role in energy metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the glycolytic pathway. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, where it contributes significantly to neuronal energy metabolism (Keller2007Interactions; Holmes2011Bioinformatic). ENO2 is part of a family of enolase genes that have evolved through gene duplication events, and it is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential biological functions (Holmes2011Bioinformatic).

In addition to its role in glycolysis, ENO2 is involved in various cellular processes beyond energy production. It requires divalent cations such as Mg2+ for its catalytic activity, which involves a conformational change to facilitate the reaction (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). ENO2 is also implicated in hypoxia tolerance and tumor suppression, suggesting multifunctional roles in cellular physiology (Holmes2011Bioinformatic). The gene structure of ENO2 includes 12 exons, and its promoter region lacks canonical TATA and CAAT boxes, consistent with its role as a housekeeping gene (Holmes2011Bioinformatic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ENO2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often serves as a biomarker for poor prognosis. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high ENO2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis, as it promotes cell migration and invasion (Lv2022ENO2). Similarly, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ENO2 is linked to poor outcomes, with its deacetylation at lysine 394 enhancing glycolytic metabolism and metastasis (Zheng2020Insulinlike).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ENO2 is overexpressed and correlates with worse overall survival. It is involved in energy metabolism and glycolysis, contributing to tumor progression (Shi2023ENO2). ENO2 also plays a role in papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), where its overexpression is linked to higher tumor stages and grades, enhancing glycolytic signaling and tumor aggressiveness (Sun2020Overexpression).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ENO2 expression is elevated and associated with poor survival. It promotes cell growth and glucose metabolism, influencing cell cycle progression through interactions with PKM2 and the AKT signaling pathway (Gao2023Mediation). These findings highlight ENO2's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Enolase 2 (ENO2), also known as neuron-specific enolase (NSE), is involved in several protein interactions that influence neural development and function. ENO2 interacts with phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Pgk1) on the neural cell membrane, enhancing neurite outgrowth in motor neurons. This interaction reduces the phosphorylation of Cofilin, a process associated with improved neurite outgrowth, by modulating the P38/Limk1/Cofilin signaling pathway (Fu2023Extracellular). The specific interaction domain of ENO2 with Pgk1 is located at the 405th to 431st amino acid residues, which is crucial for this interaction (Fu2023Extracellular).

ENO2 also interacts with the centrosome and proteasome within the cytosol and is involved in axonal transport as part of the slow component b complex (Horvat2024Multifunctional). It binds with γ1-syntrophin through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, facilitating its translocation to the plasma membrane and promoting neurotrophic signaling (Horvat2024Multifunctional). ENO2's interaction with the tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) family is necessary for its neurotrophic activities, which include promoting neuronal survival and differentiation (Horvat2024Multifunctional). These interactions highlight ENO2's multifunctional role in the central nervous system.
