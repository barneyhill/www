# SYNM

## Overview
The SYNM gene encodes synemin, a type VI intermediate filament protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular structure and integrity. Synemin is predominantly expressed in muscle tissues, where it functions as a crosslinker, connecting intermediate filament networks to costameres, which are crucial for force transmission and mechanical stability in muscle cells. The protein is characterized by its unique molecular structure, consisting of a central rod domain, a short N-terminal head domain, and a long C-terminal tail domain. Synemin exists in multiple isoforms, including α-synemin and β-synemin, due to alternative splicing, and it forms heteropolymeric filaments with other intermediate filament proteins like desmin and vimentin. Beyond its structural role, synemin is involved in various signaling pathways and interacts with numerous cytoskeletal and signaling proteins, indicating its multifaceted functions in cellular processes (Russell2020Synemin; Sun2024Molecular).

## Structure
The human gene SYNM encodes the intermediate filament protein synemin, which is characterized by a unique molecular structure. Synemin consists of a central rod domain, a short N-terminal head domain, and a long C-terminal tail domain. The rod domain is approximately 312 amino acids long and forms alpha-helical coiled-coils, typical of intermediate filament proteins (Russell2020Synemin; Sun2024Molecular). The head domain is unusually short, comprising only 10 amino acids, while the tail domain is significantly longer, with the α-synemin isoform containing an additional 312 amino acid insert near the end of the C-terminal tail (Russell2020Synemin; Sun2024Molecular).

Synemin exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including α-synemin (~180 kDa) and β-synemin (~150 kDa) in humans (Titeux2001Human; Sun2024Molecular). The α-synemin isoform's additional insert is hypothesized to interact with proteins such as vinculin and metavinculin, suggesting a role in cell adhesion (Sun2024Molecular). Synemin cannot form homopolymeric filaments but instead forms heteropolymeric filaments with other intermediate filament proteins like desmin and vimentin, indicating its quaternary structure (Titeux2001Human; Sun2024Molecular). The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, including potential N-glycosylation and myristoylation sites (Titeux2001Human).

## Function
Synemin, encoded by the SYNM gene, is a type VI intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure and integrity. It is predominantly expressed in muscle tissues, where it acts as a crosslinker, connecting intermediate filament networks to costameres, which are essential for force transmission and mechanical integrity in muscle cells (Russell2020Synemin). Synemin interacts with various cytoskeletal proteins, including α-actinin, vinculin, and metavinculin, facilitating its role in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (Sun2024Molecular).

In muscle cells, synemin is involved in linking heteropolymeric intermediate filaments to adhesion-type junctions, such as costameres, which are critical for maintaining muscle cell integrity and morphology (Sun2024Molecular). It also interacts with proteins like zyxin and plectin, influencing cell adhesion and migration (Russell2020Synemin). Synemin's ability to bind with non-intermediate filament proteins suggests additional functions beyond structural support, including roles in signaling pathways like protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, particularly in bone and muscle tissues (Russell2020Synemin).

In non-muscle tissues, synemin is expressed in astrocytes, where it is upregulated in response to trauma or disease, indicating its role in reactive astrocytes (Russell2020Synemin). It is also involved in cell motility and may function as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) in cardiac muscle cells (Sun2024Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYNM gene, which encodes the intermediate filament protein synemin, have been implicated in several human diseases, particularly affecting the heart and skeletal muscles. Specific mutations, such as missense mutations and frameshift mutations, have been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition that can lead to heart failure (Maggi2021Skeletal; Paulin2020Syneminrelated). These mutations may disrupt synemin's ability to bind with other proteins, such as dystrophin and utrophin, affecting muscle integrity and function (Paulin2020Syneminrelated).

Synemin mutations have also been associated with rare syndromic conditions like ulnar-mammary-like syndrome, which involves cardiac and limb abnormalities (Zlotina2018Rare; Paulin2020Syneminrelated). In some cases, these mutations are involved in signaling pathways that affect cardiac contractility, such as the VEGF-PLC gamma 1 pathway (Paulin2020Syneminrelated).

Alterations in synemin expression have been observed in various pathological conditions, including neurotrauma and myofibrillar myopathies, suggesting a broader role in disease processes (Paulin2020Syneminrelated). Synemin's involvement in maintaining cellular integrity and its interactions with cytoskeletal proteins underscore its clinical significance in muscle-related diseases (GarcíaPelagio2019The).

## Interactions
Synemin (SYNM) is an intermediate filament protein that interacts with various cytoskeletal and signaling proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining cell structure and integrity. Synemin binds to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin, two other proteins in the intermediate filament network, but not to actin. This binding occurs with unpolymerized GFAP and vimentin under nondenaturing conditions, suggesting synemin's role in the structural organization of the intermediate filament network in astrocytes, particularly in the context of neurotrauma (Jing2007Synemin).

Synemin also interacts with cytoskeletal proteins at adhesion sites, such as zyxin, vinculin, and talin. The α-synemin isoform, which includes a unique 312 amino acid insert (SNTIII), interacts specifically with vinculin, metavinculin, and the talin rod domain. This interaction suggests additional functions not present in β-synemin, which does not interact with these proteins (Sun2024Molecular). Synemin's interactions with these proteins indicate its role in linking intermediate filaments to adhesion-type junctions, such as costameres in muscle cells (Sun2024Molecular).

In muscle cells, synemin interacts with dystrophin and utrophin, colocalizing with dystrophin at the cell edges. This interaction supports synemin's role in forming heteropolymeric intermediate filaments with desmin (Bhosle2006Interactions).
