# CCL15

## Overview
CCL15, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 15, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CC chemokine family, which plays a pivotal role in immune response regulation and cell migration. The protein product of CCL15, also known as HCC-2, functions primarily as a chemoattractant, guiding immune cells such as monocytes and lymphocytes to sites of inflammation by interacting with chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR3 (Richter2006Increase). The CCL15 protein is characterized by a unique structure, including an unusually long N-terminal domain and a third disulfide bond, which are critical for its interaction with receptors and subsequent signaling pathways (escher2004functional). Alterations in CCL15 expression have been implicated in various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Inamoto2016Loss; Hochstrasser2011Two).

## Structure
The CCL15 protein, also known as HCC-2, is a human CC chemokine with a unique primary structure characterized by an unusually long N-terminal domain of 31 amino acids preceding the first cysteine residue. This structure includes a third disulfide bond, a feature shared with only a few other CC chemokines like CCL23/CKb-8 and CCL1/I-309 (escher2004functional). The mature protein consists of 92 amino acid residues, as predicted from cDNA (escher2004functional).

The secondary structure of CCL15 includes a flexible NH2-terminal region, a first loop region (N-loop), three antiparallel beta-strands, and a COOH-terminal alpha-helix (escher2004functional). The tertiary structure is maintained by disulfide bonds, and the loss of the COOH-terminal alpha-helix results in a complete loss of tertiary structure and CCR1 agonistic activity (escher2004functional).

The quaternary structure is not explicitly discussed, but the study suggests that specific protein residues in chemokines, which contribute to receptor-ligand interaction, vary significantly between chemokines (escher2004functional). The NH2-terminal domain is crucial for receptor activation, with truncation experiments showing that a single amino acid residue in the exocyclic N-terminal region is sufficient for efficient CCR1 activation (escher2004functional).

## Function
CCL15, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 15, is a chemokine involved in the regulation of immune responses and cell migration. In healthy human cells, CCL15 functions primarily as a chemoattractant, guiding the movement of immune cells such as monocytes and lymphocytes to sites of inflammation. It exerts its effects by binding to chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR3, which are expressed on the surface of target cells (Richter2006Increase).

CCL15 is involved in the adhesion and migration of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). It enhances the CXCL12-induced migration of these cells and increases their adhesion to the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) under shear stress conditions. This process is mediated through Gαi proteins and the Rac GTPase pathway, indicating its role in cell signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangement (Richter2014BetaChemokine).

In addition to its role in immune cell recruitment, CCL15 is implicated in the regulation of colony formation in hematopoietic cells, affecting the growth of colonies in CFU-A assays. This suggests a role in the maintenance and differentiation of progenitor cells, which is crucial for effective hematopoiesis and immune function (Richter2014BetaChemokine).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL15 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), CCL15 levels are significantly altered, with increased plasma levels and decreased levels in monocytes. This suggests that CCL15 may be released into the blood, contributing to the inflammatory processes associated with AD. The combination of CCL15 levels with other biomarkers, such as p21 and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), has been shown to differentiate AD patients from healthy individuals with high specificity and sensitivity (Hochstrasser2011Two).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), CCL15 expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. The loss of the SMAD4 gene in CRC leads to increased CCL15 expression, which recruits CCR1+ myeloid cells to the tumor site, facilitating tumor invasion and metastasis. This mechanism highlights the potential of CCL15 as a biomarker for CRC progression and a target for therapeutic intervention, particularly in cases with SMAD4 loss (Inamoto2016Loss).

In autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CCL15 has been studied for its genetic associations. However, significant associations with MS were not confirmed, although some haplotypes showed borderline associations in previous studies (Vyshkina2008CCL).

## Interactions
CCL15, a human CC chemokine, primarily interacts with the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR3. It has a unique structure characterized by an unusually long N-terminal domain and a third disulfide bond. The interaction with CCR1 involves complex binding modes, with the CCL15 L-CCR1 complex serving as a model. The binding includes two main interaction sites: CRS1, where the N terminus of CCR1 interacts with the globular core of CCL15, and CRS2, where the N terminus of CCL15 interacts with the transmembrane binding pocket of CCR1. A third recognition site, CRS3, involves interactions between the β1-β2 strands and the 30s loop of CCL15 L with ECLs 2-3 and TMs 5-6 of CCR1, characterized by hydrophobic effects and hydrogen bonds (Shao2021Identification).

Truncating 24 amino acids from the N-terminal of CCL15 enhances its activity as a CCR1 agonist, while other derivatives do not activate CCR3, suggesting CCR1 as the major receptor for CCL15 in vivo (escher2004functional). The interactions of CCL15 with CCR1 are crucial for the receptor's activity and signaling, influencing pathways such as G protein activation and β-arrestin recruitment (Shao2021Identification).
