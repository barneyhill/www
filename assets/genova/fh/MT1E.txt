# MT1E

## Overview
Metallothionein 1E (MT1E) is a gene that encodes the protein metallothionein 1E, a member of the metallothionein family known for its role in metal ion homeostasis and detoxification. The MT1E protein is characterized by its high cysteine content, which facilitates the binding of heavy metals such as zinc and cadmium, thereby playing a crucial role in cellular metal ion regulation and protection against metal toxicity (Wong2020Interplay). As a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein, MT1E modulates the activity of zinc-dependent regulatory proteins, influencing processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis (RYU2012Role). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in various cancers, where alterations in MT1E expression are associated with tumor progression and response to chemotherapy (Faller2010Metallothionein; Krizkova2018An). Consequently, MT1E is of interest as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology.

## Structure
Metallothionein 1E (MT1E) is a member of the metallothionein family, characterized by its small size and high cysteine content, which facilitates metal ion binding and detoxification. The primary structure of MT1E consists of a sequence rich in cysteine residues, allowing for the coordination of metal ions such as zinc and cadmium (Wong2020Interplay). This cysteine-rich composition is crucial for forming stable metal-thiolate clusters, which are essential for the protein's function in metal ion storage and detoxification (Wong2020Interplay).

The secondary structure of MT1E typically lacks extensive alpha-helices or beta-sheets, instead forming a unique structure that supports the metal-thiolate cluster formation. The tertiary structure of MT1E is characterized by a compact, globular shape, which is stabilized by the binding of metal ions (Wong2020Interplay). Metallothioneins, including MT1E, generally do not form quaternary structures.

Common post-translational modifications of MT1E include metal ion binding, which influences the protein's conformation and function. This binding is crucial for the protein's role in cellular metal ion homeostasis and protection against metal toxicity (Wong2020Interplay). The specific structural details of MT1E, such as prominent folds or specific domains, are not extensively detailed in the available literature.

## Function
Metallothionein 1E (MT1E) is a protein involved in metal ion homeostasis and detoxification, primarily binding heavy metals such as zinc and copper. This binding capability allows MT1E to play a crucial role in regulating metal ion concentrations within cells, protecting against metal toxicity, and maintaining cellular zinc metabolism (Laukens2009Human; Li2008Human). MT1E is part of the metallothionein family, which is known for its involvement in stress responses and inflammation, acting as a scavenger of free radicals and participating in immune regulation (Laukens2009Human).

MT1E is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates the activities of zinc-dependent regulatory proteins, including enzymes and zinc-finger transcription factors, by facilitating the removal and transfer of zinc (RYU2012Role). This modulation is essential for various cellular processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. MT1E's ability to bind essential metals like zinc and copper is linked to its role in cell proliferation processes, potentially acting as a zinc donor to transcription factors and protecting cells from oxidative stress and metal toxicity (RYU2012Role). These functions highlight MT1E's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against environmental and physiological stressors.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MT1E gene have been implicated in various cancers. In glioblastoma, MT1E is targeted by microRNAs, with its expression influenced by the cellular micro-environment (Krizkova2018An). In thyroid cancer, MT1E is down-regulated, partly due to promoter methylation (Krizkova2018An). Similarly, in renal cell carcinoma, MT1E is down-regulated, with methylation being tumor-specific and associated with advanced disease features (Maleckaite2019DNA). In bladder cancer, MT1E expression varies and is linked to higher cancer stages and cell migration (Krizkova2018An). In endometrial cancer, MT1E down-regulation is due to promoter hypermethylation (Krizkova2018An). In ovarian cancer, its down-regulation is associated with low malignant potential and improved progression-free survival in chemotherapy-treated patients (Krizkova2018An).

In melanoma, MT1E is frequently methylated, which increases sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting a role in chemoresistance (Faller2010Metallothionein). In colorectal cancer, MT1E is one of the most repressed isoforms, with significant down-regulation observed in tumor tissues (Arriaga2012Metallothionein). These findings highlight the potential of MT1E as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
Metallothionein 1E (MT1E) is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes, particularly in the context of glioma cell migration and invasion. MT1E has been shown to interact with nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), a transcription factor involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Specifically, MT1E expression affects the translocation of the NF-κB p50 subunit to the nucleus, which in turn influences the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an enzyme that plays a role in extracellular matrix degradation and tumor invasion (RYU2012Role).

MT1E may also act as a zinc donor to transcription factors, which could be crucial for their activation and function. This interaction is significant because zinc is a cofactor for many transcription factors and enzymes, including those involved in oxidative stress response and cellular proliferation (RYU2012Role). The modulation of NF-κB and MMP-9 activity by MT1E suggests that it may enhance glioma cell migration and invasion through these interactions, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression (RYU2012Role). These interactions underscore the importance of MT1E in cellular processes related to tumor growth and metastasis.
