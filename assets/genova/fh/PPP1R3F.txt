# PPP1R3F

## Overview
The PPP1R3F gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3F, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a significant role in glycogen metabolism, particularly within the brain. This protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit and is primarily expressed in brain astrocytes, where it modulates glycogen levels in response to glucose availability. The protein contains several functional domains, including a PP1-binding motif, a glycogen-binding domain, and a glycogen synthase-binding domain, which facilitate its role in targeting PP1 to dephosphorylate enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis (Kelsall2011R3F; Liu2023Hemizygous). Additionally, PPP1R3F is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane through a transmembrane domain, directing PP1 activity to the ER surface (Liu2023Hemizygous). Mutations in PPP1R3F have been linked to a novel X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Liu2023Hemizygous).

## Structure
The PPP1R3F gene encodes a protein that serves as a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), primarily involved in glycogen metabolism. The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and contains several key structural domains. It includes a PP1-binding motif, a glycogen-binding domain, and a glycogen synthase-binding domain, which are crucial for its function in targeting PP1 to dephosphorylate key enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis (Kelsall2011R3F; Liu2023Hemizygous).

The molecular structure of PPP1R3F features a hydrophobic region at the C-terminus, suggesting its association with membranes. This region includes a transmembrane domain that anchors the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, allowing it to direct PP1 enzymatic activity to the ER surface (Kelsall2011R3F; Liu2023Hemizygous). The protein is larger than other glycogen-targeting subunits, indicating a unique structural complexity (Kelsall2011R3F).

PPP1R3F exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with six identified isoforms ranging from 799 to 433 residues in length. These isoforms may have different functional roles and tissue distributions (Casamayor2020Controlling). The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, underscoring its importance in glycogen metabolism (Kelsall2011R3F).

## Function
The PPP1R3F gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which plays a crucial role in glycogen metabolism, particularly in the brain. PPP1R3F is primarily expressed in brain astrocytes, where it regulates glycogen levels in response to changing glucose conditions. This regulation is essential for maintaining a readily releasable glycogen pool, which supports astrocyte-dependent neural plasticity and is critical for higher brain functions such as learning and memory (Liu2023Hemizygous).

PPP1R3F interacts with glycogen synthase (GS) and influences its phosphorylation state, thereby modulating glycogen synthesis. It is involved in the dephosphorylation and activation of GS, which is crucial for glycogen synthesis in astrocytoma cells (Kelsall2011R3F). Unlike other glycogen-targeting subunits, PPP1R3F increases glycogen synthesis during low glucose conditions, preventing glycogen depletion in the brain (Liu2023Hemizygous).

The protein is associated with membranes, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it directs PP1 enzymatic activity to the ER surface. This localization is facilitated by a C-terminal tail anchor, allowing PPP1R3F to interact with ER-associated proteins and regulate glycogen metabolism (Liu2023Hemizygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP1R3F gene are associated with a novel X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder. This disorder is characterized by developmental delay, mild intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and other neurological abnormalities such as tone, gait, and cerebellar issues. The disorder has been identified in 13 unrelated male individuals who inherited hemizygous variants from their heterozygous carrier mothers. These variants include nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutations, with some predicted to result in loss of function (Liu2023Hemizygous).

Functional studies have shown that these mutations can lead to defects in PP1 binding, protein stability, subcellular localization, and regulation of glycogen metabolism. Specifically, variants such as p.Asp41Tyr and p.Pro47Gln negatively impact PP1 binding, while p.Gly212Ter results in an unstable protein (Liu2023Hemizygous). The inability of astrocytes to respond to glucose fluctuations due to dysfunctional PPP1R3F may underlie the disorder, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining steady brain glycogen levels under changing glucose conditions (Liu2023Hemizygous).

Additionally, PPP1R3F has been identified as a potential master regulator in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), with significant overlaps between its regulons and known ASD candidate genes. This suggests its relevance to ASDs and its involvement in pathways such as endocytosis, which are altered in these conditions (Doostparast2018Transcriptional).

## Interactions
PPP1R3F is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and is involved in glycogen metabolism. It interacts with the catalytic subunit of PP1, modulating its activity. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that the wild-type PPP1R3F can co-immunoprecipitate with both PP1 and glycogen synthase (GS), indicating a physical interaction with these proteins (Liu2023Hemizygous). Certain variants of PPP1R3F, such as Phe39Ala, p.Asp41Tyr, and p.Gly212Ter, fail to co-immunoprecipitate with PP1, suggesting that these mutations disrupt the interaction (Liu2023Hemizygous). Other variants, like p.Pro47Gln and p.Gln304Ter, show reduced or no interaction with PP1 but retain interaction with GS (Liu2023Hemizygous).

PPP1R3F is also localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via its C-terminal anchor, where it may interact with ER-associated proteins. This localization is crucial for its function in directing PP1 activity to the ER surface (Liu2023Hemizygous). Variants in PPP1R3F can lead to mislocalization, potentially affecting its interactions with other proteins (Liu2023Hemizygous). The gene's role in regulating glycogen levels in brain astrocytes under low glucose conditions further underscores its importance in protein interactions related to glycogen metabolism (Liu2023Hemizygous).
