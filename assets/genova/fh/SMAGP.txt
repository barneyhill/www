# SMAGP

## Overview
The SMAGP gene encodes the small cell adhesion glycoprotein, a transmembrane protein that is integral to maintaining cell structure and integrity, particularly within epithelial tissues. This protein is primarily localized at the lateral membranes of polarized epithelial cells, where it plays a significant role in stabilizing cell-cell contacts and organizing cell polarity (Tarbé2005Overexpression). SMAGP interacts with various cellular components, including band 4.1 proteins and the PDZ domain of membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologues (MAGUKs), which are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling (Tarbé2005Overexpression). Additionally, SMAGP is involved in the biogenesis of type III transmembrane proteins, relying on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex (EMC) for proper membrane integration (O’Keefe2021An). The gene's expression and function have been linked to several cancers, where it may influence tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhang2022CD8+; Ni2020SMAGP).

## Function
SMAGP (small cell adhesion glycoprotein) is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell structure and integrity, particularly in epithelial cells. In healthy cells, SMAGP is predominantly localized at the lateral membranes of polarized epithelial cells, where it contributes to cell-cell contact stabilization and polarization (Tarbé2005Overexpression). It contains potential binding sites for band 4.1 proteins and the PDZ domain of membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologues (MAGUKs), which are involved in organizing cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion structures (Tarbé2005Overexpression). This suggests that SMAGP is involved in facilitating cell signaling at epithelial cell junctions, thereby playing a role in maintaining tissue organization and stability (Tarbé2005Overexpression).

SMAGP is also involved in the biogenesis of type III transmembrane proteins, where it is integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane through a pathway involving the endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex (EMC) and the Sec61 complex (O’Keefe2021An). This integration is essential for its function in cell adhesion and communication, impacting cellular signaling pathways and potentially influencing developmental processes and tissue repair (O’Keefe2021An).

## Clinical Significance
The SMAGP gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell adhesion and potential involvement in tumor progression and metastasis. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), SMAGP is part of a fusion transcript, SMAGP-TFCP2, identified specifically in androgen-independent cell lines like PC3. This fusion may contribute to resistance to hormone treatment, highlighting its potential clinical relevance in understanding and treating CRPC (Ma2017Identification).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SMAGP is included in a 10-gene signature associated with CD8+ T cells, which correlates with prognosis and immunotherapy response. This gene signature is linked to the p53-signaling pathway, suggesting that SMAGP may play a role in tumor invasion and metastasis, and could serve as a prognostic marker for LUAD (Zhang2022CD8+).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SMAGP has been studied in the context of oncolytic virus therapy. Although its expression is upregulated in HCC tumors, the specific role of SMAGP in enhancing therapeutic efficacy was not significant in the context of oncolytic virus-mediated anti-tumor responses (Webb2024Expression).

## Interactions
SMAGP (small cell adhesion glycoprotein) is involved in several interactions that influence cellular functions such as adhesion and migration. It has potential binding sites for band 4.1 proteins and the PDZ domain of membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologues (MAGUKs), which are involved in cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion structures (Tarbé2005Overexpression). These interactions suggest a role in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and stabilization of cell-cell contacts, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully explored (Tarbé2005Overexpression).

In the context of glioblastoma, SMAGP is associated with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Knockdown of SMAGP in glioblastoma cells leads to reduced phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt proteins, indicating that SMAGP may promote malignancy through activation of this pathway (Ni2020SMAGP). This suggests a functional interaction where SMAGP influences signaling pathways critical for cancer progression.

SMAGP also requires the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC) for efficient membrane insertion, indicating a dependency on this complex for its proper localization and function within the cell (O’Keefe2021An). This interaction is crucial for its role as a transmembrane protein.
