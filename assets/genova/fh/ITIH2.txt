# ITIH2

## Overview
The ITIH2 gene encodes the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 2, a protein that is part of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (IαI) family, which plays a crucial role in extracellular matrix stabilization and inflammation modulation. This protein is characterized by the presence of specific domains, including the von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain, which is involved in cell adhesion and other cellular processes, and the vault protein inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (VIT) domain, whose function remains less understood (Zhuo2008Structure). ITIH2 is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to cell migration and wound healing by forming complexes with hyaluronan (Zhuo2008Structure). The gene's expression is notably altered in various pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in immune response regulation (Garantziotis2007InterαTrypsin; Hamm2008Frequent).

## Structure
The ITIH2 gene encodes the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 2, which is part of a family of proteins involved in extracellular matrix stabilization and inflammation. The protein structure includes specific domains such as the von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain and the vault protein inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (VIT) domain. The vWA domain is involved in various functions, including transcription, DNA repair, and cell adhesion, and is found in many extracellular proteins (Zhuo2008Structure). The VIT domain is less common and is part of the vault particle, whose function is not well understood (Zhuo2008Structure).

The ITIH2 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including the cleavage of C-terminal prodomains by furin before attachment to the chondroitin sulfate chain (Lord2020The). Alternative splicing and point mutations contribute to the diversity of ITIH2, with splicing variants identified that may lack one or more domains (Zhuo2008Structure). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of ITIH2 are not provided in the available literature (Lord2020The; Zhuo2008Structure).

## Function
The ITIH2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (IαI) family, which plays a significant role in stabilizing the extracellular matrix and modulating inflammation. In healthy human cells, ITIH2 is involved in various molecular processes, including the inhibition of proteases and the suppression of complement activation, which are crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and modulating immune responses (Garantziotis2007InterαTrypsin; Zhuo2008Structure). The protein is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to processes such as cell migration and wound healing by forming complexes with hyaluronan, a key component of the extracellular matrix (Zhuo2008Structure).

ITIH2 also plays a role in the body's response to inflammatory stimuli. During acute inflammation, the expression of ITIH2 in the liver is downregulated, suggesting its involvement in the inflammatory response (Zhuo2008Structure). The protein's anti-inflammatory effects are thought to involve protease inhibition and complement suppression, which can protect tissues from damage during inflammation (Garantziotis2007InterαTrypsin). These functions highlight ITIH2's importance in maintaining homeostasis and protecting against disease progression.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ITIH2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. ITIH2 is frequently downregulated in multiple solid tumors, including breast, lung, and renal cancers, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor gene. In breast cancer, ITIH2 expression is reduced in approximately 70% of cases, and this downregulation is associated with estrogen receptor status, indicating a possible hormonal regulation mechanism (Hamm2008Frequent). Despite its downregulation, there is no significant association between ITIH2 expression loss and overall or recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients (Hamm2008Frequent).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, a synonymous variant in ITIH2 has been associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in certain populations, suggesting that genetic variations in ITIH2 may influence disease risk (Tang2020Synonymous). Additionally, ITIH2 expression is reduced in gastric cancer with bone metastasis, highlighting its potential involvement in cancer progression and metastasis (Oh2024Genomic).

In central nervous system tumors, ITIH2 expression is typically lost in high-grade tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme, where it may act as an anti-invasive protein by inhibiting cell invasion and downregulating AKT signaling (WEIDLE2018Potential).
