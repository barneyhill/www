# ORAI1

## Overview
The ORAI1 gene encodes the ORAI calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in calcium signaling within cells. This protein is a key component of the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, which are essential for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a process critical for maintaining calcium homeostasis and facilitating various cellular functions, including immune responses (Parekh2010Storeoperated; Soboloff2006Orai1). ORAI1 is predominantly located in the plasma membrane, where it forms a hexameric complex that constitutes the pore of the CRAC channel, allowing selective calcium ion influx following the depletion of calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (Frischauf2017Transmembrane; Cai2016The). The interaction of ORAI1 with the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is crucial for its activation and function, as STIM1 senses calcium depletion and triggers ORAI1-mediated calcium entry (Lee2009An). Mutations in the ORAI1 gene can lead to various clinical conditions, including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and tubular aggregate myopathy, underscoring its significance in human health (Lacruz2015Diseases; SilvaRojas2020STIM1ORAI1).

## Structure
The ORAI1 protein is a critical component of calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, which are essential for calcium influx in cells. Structurally, ORAI1 is composed of four transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-termini located intracellularly (Frischauf2017Transmembrane). The protein forms a hexameric complex, which is crucial for its function as a calcium channel. This hexameric structure is supported by studies showing that ORAI1 functions as a hexamer, with all subunits contributing to its channel activity (Cai2016The).

The primary structure of ORAI1 includes specific serine residues, such as S27 and S30, which are phosphorylated by PKCβ. This phosphorylation plays a role in regulating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (Srikanth2013Regulation; Srikanth2013Molecular). Additionally, ORAI1 undergoes glycosylation, although this modification is not essential for its function in calcium influx (Gwack2007Biochemical).

The protein's quaternary structure involves the assembly of ORAI1 into a hexamer, which is necessary for its role in forming the pore of the CRAC channel. This assembly is influenced by interactions with STIM1, a Ca2+-binding protein that activates ORAI1 upon ER Ca2+ depletion (Srikanth2013Molecular).

## Function
The ORAI1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, which are essential for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in human cells. ORAI1 is predominantly expressed in the plasma membrane and forms the pore of the CRAC channel, allowing selective calcium ion influx following the depletion of calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (Parekh2010Storeoperated; Soboloff2006Orai1). This calcium entry is crucial for various cellular functions, including the activation of transcription factors such as NFAT, which are important for immune responses (Parekh2010Storeoperated; Gwack2007Biochemical).

In immune cells, particularly T cells, ORAI1 plays a vital role in cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. It is necessary for the nuclear translocation of NFAT, which is essential for T cell function and the adaptive immune response (Gwack2007Biochemical). Mutations in ORAI1 can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to impaired CRAC channel function, highlighting its importance in immune cell function (Parekh2010Storeoperated; Hogan2010Molecular). ORAI1 interacts with STIM1, an ER calcium sensor, to mediate SOCE, which is crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis in cells (Soboloff2006Orai1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ORAI1 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions due to their impact on calcium homeostasis. Recessive loss-of-function mutations in ORAI1 lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-like disease, characterized by recurrent infections, autoimmunity, muscular hypotonia, and ectodermal dysplasia. These mutations typically result in impaired or abolished CRAC channel function and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), affecting immune cell activation and function (McCarl2009ORAI1; Lacruz2015Diseases). Specific mutations, such as the p.R91W, introduce structural changes that block calcium ion passage, leading to significant immunodeficiency and related symptoms (McCarl2009ORAI1; Lacruz2015Diseases).

Dominant gain-of-function mutations in ORAI1 cause conditions like tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM) and Stormorken syndrome. These mutations result in excessive calcium entry due to over-activation of SOCE, leading to symptoms such as muscle weakness, thrombocytopenia, and miosis (Böhm2017ORAI1; SilvaRojas2020STIM1ORAI1). The gain-of-function mutations often involve missense mutations affecting conserved amino acids in ORAI1's transmembrane domains, such as G98S and V107M, which alter channel activity independently of STIM1 (Böhm2017ORAI1).

ORAI1 mutations also impact dental health, as seen in hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta, where enamel mineralization is compromised due to defective calcium uptake in ameloblasts (Lacruz2015Diseases).

## Interactions
ORAI1 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for calcium signaling. It is known to interact with STIM1, a sensor of calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum, which activates ORAI1 to facilitate calcium influx through calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels (Lee2009An). The interaction between ORAI1 and STIM1 involves the coiled-coil domains of STIM1 and the C terminus of ORAI1, with the SOAR domain of STIM1 being sufficient to fully activate ORAI channels (Lee2009An).

ORAI1 also interacts with TRPC channels, forming a heteromeric complex that regulates store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and calcium release-activated calcium (Icrac) channels. This interaction suggests that ORAI1 does not function independently but rather in conjunction with TRPCs and STIM1 to modulate calcium entry (Liao2008Functional). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have shown that ORAI1 can bind to TRPC3 and TRPC6, indicating a physical interaction that may confer responsiveness to store depletion (Liao2007Orai).

The interactions between ORAI1, STIM1, and TRPCs are dynamic and can be influenced by cellular conditions, such as calcium store depletion, which enhances the interaction between ORAI1 and TRPC6 (Jardin2009Dynamic). These interactions are essential for the regulation of calcium entry pathways in various cellular contexts.
