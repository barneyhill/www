# GUCD1

## Overview
The GUCD1 gene encodes the protein guanylyl cyclase domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. Although the specific functions of the GUCD1 protein are not fully elucidated, it is categorized as a guanylyl cyclase-related protein, suggesting a potential role in cyclic GMP signaling pathways. The protein's involvement in critical cellular mechanisms, such as cell invasion and migration, highlights its significance in pathological conditions, including cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Research indicates that GUCD1 expression is modulated by microRNAs and transcriptional shifts, which can influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Wragg2023Intrapromoter; Wilson2020Heme; He2019MicroRNA370).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GUCD1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GUCD1 expression is significantly increased in cancerous tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This overexpression is associated with more aggressive tumor characteristics and poorer patient prognosis. GUCD1 is a direct target of microRNA-370 (miR-370), which is downregulated in HCC. The miR-370/GUCD1 axis plays a crucial role in regulating cell invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes that are vital for cancer metastasis (He2019MicroRNA370).

In the context of COPD, particularly in patients with cachexia, GUCD1 expression is downregulated. This downregulation is linked to impaired iron metabolism, potentially leading to iron overload and oxidative stress, which contribute to muscle wasting and dysfunction in COPD patients (Wilson2020Heme). Additionally, in colorectal cancer (CRC), a shift in transcription initiation of GUCD1 from canonical to non-canonical sites is observed, which is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression (Wragg2023Intrapromoter). These findings suggest that GUCD1 could serve as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target in these diseases.
