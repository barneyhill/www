# LGALS14

## Overview
LGALS14 is a gene that encodes the protein galectin-14, a member of the galectin family known for its carbohydrate-binding properties. Galectin-14 is categorized as a proto-type galectin, characterized by a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that facilitates its interaction with specific glycans. This protein is predominantly expressed in the placenta and eosinophils, where it plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses and promoting maternal-fetal tolerance during pregnancy. Galectin-14 is involved in various biological processes, including trophoblast migration, immune cell regulation, and apoptosis, primarily through interactions with signaling pathways such as Akt and MAPKs. The gene is located on chromosome 19 and is part of a cluster of primate-specific placental galectins. Its expression has been linked to several cancers, particularly high-grade serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary, where it is associated with poor prognosis (Menkhorst2021Medawar’s; Oliveira2019Galectin14; Blois2019Pregnancy).

## Structure
LGALS14, also known as galectin-14, is a member of the galectin family characterized by a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) typical of proto-type galectins. This CRD has a 'jelly-roll' structure, which is a common fold among galectins, allowing it to bind specific carbohydrates (Menkhorst2021Medawar’s; Blois2019Pregnancy). The galectin-14 protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 19, which is part of a cluster of primate-specific placental galectins that includes LGALS13 and LGALS16 (Blois2019Pregnancy).

Galectin-14 is known to form non-covalently linked homodimers, a common quaternary structure among proto-type galectins, which enhances its ability to bind multivalent glycans (Menkhorst2021Medawar’s). The protein's CRD has undergone adaptive evolution, resulting in unique sugar-binding capabilities compared to other galectins (Menkhorst2021Medawar’s). Although specific post-translational modifications for galectin-14 are not detailed in the provided context, galectins in general can undergo modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence their function and stability. The evolutionary development of galectin-14 suggests it shares structural similarities with other placental galectins, although specific details on its molecular structure are limited (Günther2023A; Blois2019Pregnancy).

## Function
Galectin-14, encoded by the LGALS14 gene, is a member of the galectin family primarily expressed in the placenta and eosinophils. In healthy human cells, galectin-14 plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and facilitating maternal-fetal immune tolerance during pregnancy. It is involved in the regulation of trophoblast migration and invasion, crucial processes for placental development and function. Galectin-14 promotes these processes by upregulating the expression of N-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), which are associated with cell migration and invasion. This regulation is mediated through the Akt signaling pathway, where Akt phosphorylation is necessary for MMP-9 expression (Wang2021Galectin14).

Galectin-14 also contributes to immune adaptation during pregnancy by inducing apoptosis in activated T lymphocytes, thereby reducing maternal immune attacks on the fetal semi-allograft. This function supports immune tolerance mechanisms in anthropoid primates (Menkhorst2021Medawar’s). Additionally, galectin-14 is involved in angiogenesis and immune cell interactions at the maternal-fetal interface, potentially influencing vascular remodeling and immune balance (Menkhorst2021Medawar’s).

## Clinical Significance
LGALS14, encoding galectin-14, is significantly associated with various cancers, particularly high-grade serous adenocarcinoma (HGSA) of the ovary. Elevated expression of LGALS14 mRNA in ovarian cancer cells correlates with shorter patient survival, suggesting its role in cancer progression and poor prognosis (Kruk2023Galectin; Oliveira2019Galectin14). This gene is preferentially expressed in HGSA, the most aggressive subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and its expression is notably higher in EOC tissues compared to normal tissues (Oliveira2019Galectin14; Fuselier2023Placental).

LGALS14 expression is cancer-type specific, with higher levels observed in ovarian, liver, breast, and uterine cancers, but lower levels in prostate, uveal, and pancreatic cancers (Oliveira2019Galectin14). Genetic alterations, particularly amplifications of LGALS14, are frequently observed in serous ovarian carcinoma and are associated with poorer survival outcomes (Oliveira2019Galectin14). Despite detectable mRNA levels, galectin-14 protein is not observed in these cancer cells, possibly due to low protein expression levels or translational repression mechanisms (Oliveira2019Galectin14).

The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as Nf-kB, Sp-1, and c/EBP, and it may play a role in cell death processes, potentially indicating a pro-apoptotic function that is cell type-specific (Oliveira2019Galectin14).

## Interactions
Galectin-14 (LGALS14) is involved in several interactions that influence immune cell regulation and apoptosis. It has been shown to bind to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells, with varying degrees of affinity. This binding is associated with increased cell viability and reduced apoptosis, particularly in T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes (Oravecz2022Placental).

Galectin-14 also interacts with signaling pathways, enhancing the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38 MAPKs, and NF-kB, which are crucial for modulating immune responses and cytokine production. These interactions suggest that galectin-14 plays a role in activating these pathways to promote cell survival and cytokine production (Oravecz2022Placental).

In the context of cancer, galectin-14 expression is up-regulated by the modified AS1411 aptamer, which is associated with the suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation. This suggests a potential interaction between galectin-14 and the aptamer, contributing to its anti-tumor effects (Cho2016Modified). Additionally, galectin-14 may interact with transcription factors such as NF-kB, Sp-1, and c/EBP, which could regulate its expression and function in cancer cells (Oliveira2019Galectin14).
