# PRDM8

## Overview
PRDM8 is a gene that encodes the PR/SET domain 8 protein, which is a transcription factor involved in chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by the presence of a PR domain and zinc finger repeats, with a SET domain that functions as a histone methyltransferase (HMTase), specifically methylating histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) to mediate transcriptional repression (Ross2012Bhlhb5; Eom2009Histone). PR/SET domain 8 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and plays a critical role in the development and survival of specific retinal cells, as well as in broader neuronal differentiation and hematopoietic processes (Jung2015Transcription; Cypris2020PRDM8). The protein's interaction with other transcription factors, such as Bhlhb5, is essential for its function in transcriptional repression and neural circuit assembly (Ross2012Bhlhb5). Alterations in PRDM8 expression or function have been linked to clinical conditions, including congenital stationary night blindness and premature aging syndromes (Jung2015Transcription; Cypris2020PRDM8).

## Structure
PRDM8 is a protein characterized by the presence of a PR domain at the N-terminus, followed by zinc finger repeats. It contains a SET domain, which is a histone methyltransferase (HMTase) catalytic module, located in the N-terminal region of the protein. This domain is crucial for its HMTase activity, specifically methylating histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), which is associated with transcriptional repression (Ross2012Bhlhb5; Eom2009Histone). The protein also includes zinc finger domains, which are involved in DNA binding and are necessary for directing PRDM8 to the nucleus (Eom2009Histone).

PRDM8 exists in multiple isoforms, including a full-length version with a molecular weight of approximately 70 kDa and a shorter isoform of 34 kDa, which lacks amino acids 215 to 602. Both variants retain intact SET domains (Eom2009Histone). The zinc finger domains are of the C2H2 type, which are common in DNA-binding transcription factors (Di2021The). The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, as observed in transfected COS-7 cells (Eom2009Histone). The molecular structure of PRDM8, including its SET and zinc finger domains, is essential for its role in chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation (Eom2009Histone).

## Function
PRDM8 is a transcription factor involved in the development and survival of specific retinal cells, including rod bipolar (RB) and type 2 OFF-cone bipolar (CB) cells, as well as certain amacrine cell (AC) subtypes. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the identity of these cells, which are essential for proper visual signaling. In the absence of PRDM8, there is a significant reduction in these cell types, leading to disrupted postphotoreceptor signal transduction and a phenotype similar to congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) in humans (Jung2015Transcription).

PRDM8 functions as part of a transcriptional repressor complex, potentially involving histone methylation, which influences gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. This activity is crucial for the differentiation and survival of retinal interneurons, contributing to normal visual processing (Ross2012Bhlhb5; Jung2015Transcription). PRDM8 is expressed in various retinal cells, including bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells, indicating its broad role in retinal development and function (Jung2015Transcription).

In addition to its role in the retina, PRDM8 is implicated in neuronal differentiation and hematopoietic processes, suggesting its involvement in broader cellular differentiation pathways (Cypris2020PRDM8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PRDM8 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In the retina, PRDM8 is essential for the survival and differentiation of rod bipolar and type 2 OFF-cone bipolar cells, as well as for the identity of certain amacrine cell subtypes. The absence of PRDM8 leads to significant defects in retinal circuitry, resulting in nonprogressive b-wave deficits in electroretinograms, which suggests that PRDM8 could be a candidate gene for human congenital stationary night blindness (Jung2015Transcription).

In the context of premature aging syndromes, PRDM8 is hypermethylated in conditions such as dyskeratosis congenita and idiopathic aplastic anemia. This aberrant DNA methylation is proposed as a potential biomarker for these syndromes, although it does not correlate with accelerated epigenetic aging or telomere attrition. The loss of PRDM8 impairs hematopoietic and neuronal differentiation, indicating its significant role in these processes (Cypris2020PRDM8).

PRDM8 also forms a repressor complex with Bhlhb5, crucial for neuronal circuit assembly. Disruption of this complex can lead to abnormal neural development and associated behavioral abnormalities, highlighting the importance of PRDM8 in maintaining proper neural function (Ross2012Bhlhb5).

## Interactions
PRDM8 is known to form a repressor complex with the transcription factor Bhlhb5 (also known as Bhlhe22), which is crucial for neuronal circuit assembly. This complex is involved in transcriptional repression, where Bhlhb5 binds to specific DNA elements and recruits PRDM8 to mediate the repression of target genes. The interaction between Bhlhb5 and PRDM8 is essential for the repression of genes such as Cdh11, which is implicated in neural development and axon guidance. In the absence of Bhlhb5, PRDM8 cannot bind to DNA, indicating that PRDM8 requires Bhlhb5 for proper targeting to genetic loci (Ross2012Bhlhb5).

PRDM8 also interacts with other proteins and transcription factors in different contexts. In virus-negative Merkel cell carcinoma (VN-MCC), PRDM8 binds to the promoter of the transcription factor EGR1, and this binding is significantly reduced when PRDM8 is depleted. This suggests that PRDM8 may function through EGR1, as EGR1 expression levels correlate with PRDM8 levels. PRDM8 is also associated with the heterochromatin mark trimethylated H3K9, which is linked to transcriptional repression, indicating its role in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation (Orouji2020Unique).
