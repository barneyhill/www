# NPIPB13

## Overview
NPIPB13 is a gene that encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member B13, which is involved in cellular processes related to the nuclear pore complex. This protein is categorized as a nuclear pore complex interacting protein, suggesting its role in the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Although the precise biological functions of NPIPB13 are not fully elucidated, it has been implicated in various pathological conditions, particularly in cancer. The protein's involvement in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and its association with structurally damaging mutations in cancer highlight its potential as a candidate driver gene in oncogenesis (Mikhaylenko2022Computational; Pino2024Protein). Further research is necessary to clarify the functional mechanisms of NPIPB13 and its broader implications in human health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
NPIPB13 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and potential mutations. In T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), NPIPB13 is consistently up-regulated across all identified molecular subgroups, suggesting its role as a potential major regulator in distinguishing T-PLL subgroups from normal controls. This up-regulation may contribute to the molecular characterization of T-PLL and could inform targeted treatment strategies (Mikhaylenko2022Computational).

In cancer research, NPIPB13 has been identified as significantly enriched in structurally damaging mutations, indicating a potential role in cancer development. Although its normal biological function is not well understood, the presence of these mutations suggests that NPIPB13 and its homologues could be novel candidate driver genes in cancer (Pino2024Protein).

Additionally, NPIPB13 expression has been weakly associated with microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma, further supporting its potential involvement in cancer-related processes (Pino2024Protein). Despite these associations, the clinical significance of NPIPB13 mutations or expression alterations remains under investigation, and further research is needed to fully understand its role in disease.
