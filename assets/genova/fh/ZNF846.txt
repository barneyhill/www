# ZNF846

## Overview
ZNF846 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 846, a member of the KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) zinc-finger protein family, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, binding to DNA and modulating gene expression through interactions with cofactors such as KAP1. ZNF846 is located on chromosome 19 and is part of a gene cluster that has undergone positive selection in certain human populations, suggesting its evolutionary significance. The gene's expression is influenced by human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which can enhance its promoter activity, particularly in the context of cancer. This interaction is associated with tumor suppression, as increased expression of ZNF846 correlates with improved disease outcomes in various cancers (Ito2020Endogenous; Ito2020Endogenousa; Marzano2023WholeExome; Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF846, a member of the KRAB zinc-finger protein family, plays a role in tumor suppression through its interaction with human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). The activation of HERVs in tumors can enhance the expression of ZNF846, which is associated with better disease outcomes in various cancers. This upregulation is linked to the suppression of cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion, suggesting a tumor-suppressive function (Ito2020Endogenousa). 

The expression of ZNF846 and other KZFPs is influenced by the presence of HERVs near their genomic loci, which can enhance promoter activities and lead to increased expression levels in cancer cells. This interaction forms a feedback loop where HERV activation leads to KZFP expression, potentially suppressing tumor progression (Ito2020Endogenous; Ito2020Endogenousa).

While the clinical significance of specific ZNF846 mutations is not detailed, the gene is located in a region on chromosome 19 that shows signs of positive selection, indicating its potential role in adaptation and disease (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic). However, the direct impact of ZNF846 mutations on specific diseases remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
ZNF846, a member of the KRAB zinc-finger protein family, is involved in DNA-binding transcription repressor activity. It is predicted to play a role in the negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Marzano2023WholeExome). The protein is part of a gene cluster on chromosome 19 that exhibits patterns of variation consistent with positive selection in certain human populations. These genetic variations may influence the interaction of ZNF846 with DNA, RNA, or cofactors like KAP1, which interacts with the KRAB domain to promote repressor activity (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

In the context of cancer, ZNF846 is transcriptionally modulated by adjacent human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which can enhance its promoter activities. This interaction suggests a regulatory role of HERVs in the expression of ZNF846, potentially contributing to tumor suppression by altering gene expression related to the cell cycle and cell-matrix adhesion (Ito2020Endogenous; Ito2020Endogenousa). The coordinated induction of ZNF846 expression, driven by HERVs, is associated with better disease conditions in multiple cancer types, indicating its involvement in suppressing tumor progression (Ito2020Endogenousa).
