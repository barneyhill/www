# DIPK1B

## Overview
DIPK1B is a gene that encodes the protein divergent protein kinase domain 1B, which is categorized as a kinase due to its involvement in phosphorylation processes. This protein is implicated in various cellular functions, including signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation. Although the precise biological roles of DIPK1B are not fully elucidated, alterations in its expression and methylation patterns have been associated with pathological conditions, particularly in cancer. For instance, DIPK1B has been identified as a differentially expressed gene in gastric cancer, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis (Wang2023Cadherin). Additionally, studies have observed significant methylation changes in the gene, which may influence its expression and contribute to disease development (Pertille2024GBSMeDIP:). Further research is necessary to fully understand the functional implications of DIPK1B in health and disease contexts.

## Clinical Significance
The DIPK1B gene has been implicated in various conditions through alterations in its expression and interactions. In gastric cancer, DIPK1B is identified as a differentially expressed gene in CDHR2 mutant samples, showing downregulation with a log 2 fold change of -1.1. This suggests that changes in DIPK1B expression may be associated with the pathogenesis of gastric cancer (Wang2023Cadherin).

In a study using the GBS-MeDIP method, DIPK1B was found to have significant methylation changes in the intronic region, with a log fold change of 4.8 and a false discovery rate of 0.005. These methylation changes could potentially influence gene expression and contribute to tumor development, although specific diseases were not detailed (Pertille2024GBSMeDIP:).

Research on spaceflight's impact on gene expression noted DIPK1B for its differential expression in rodent mammary tissue, although it narrowly missed the cutoff in one comparison group. The study did not provide specific disease associations but highlighted the need for further research to understand the implications of these expression changes (Arnold2024Spaceflight). 

Overall, while DIPK1B's role in disease is not fully understood, its altered expression and methylation patterns suggest potential involvement in cancer and other conditions.
