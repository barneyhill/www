# CHAC1

## Overview
The CHAC1 gene encodes the protein ChaC glutathione specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 1, which is a member of the γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the degradation of glutathione, a critical antioxidant, by cleaving its γ-glutamyl bond to produce 5-oxoproline and cysteinyl-glycine. The CHAC1 protein plays a significant role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and managing oxidative stress, which are vital for cell survival and function (Kumar2012Mammalian). It is localized in the cytosol and is implicated in the unfolded protein response, acting as a proapoptotic factor regulated by the ATF4-ATF3-CHOP signaling cascade during endoplasmic reticulum stress (Mungrue2009CHAC1MGC4504). The protein's interaction with MIA3 in hepatocellular carcinoma highlights its role in disease progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Wanbiao2023MIA3).

## Structure
The CHAC1 protein is a member of the γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase (γ-GCT) family and exhibits a BtrG/γ-GCT fold, characterized by unique beta barrels surrounded by alpha helices (Kumar2012Mammalian). Despite no sequence similarity in their primary sequences, the homology models of CHAC1 and its yeast homologue YER63c show high structural similarity to the γ-GCT (C7orf24) structure (Kumar2012Mammalian). Specific residues in CHAC1, such as 39 YGSL 42 and E 116, are equivalent to critical residues in γ-GCT involved in substrate binding and catalysis (Kumar2012Mammalian). The protein specifically acts on glutathione, producing 5-oxoproline and cys-gly, but does not significantly act on γ-glutamyl amino acids (Kumar2012Mammalian).

The CHAC1 protein was modeled using the PHYRE server, and its homology model was superimposed on the crystal structure of γ-GCT (C7orf24) using PyMOL molecular graphics software (Kumar2012Mammalian). The putative active site residues of CHAC1 (39 YGSL 42 and E 116) were identified and superimposed on the corresponding active site residues of γ-GCT (22 YGSN 25 and E 98), suggesting a similar structure and catalytic mechanism (Kumar2012Mammalian). The study involved mutating the catalytic glutamate residue of CHAC1 (E 116) to glutamine, which resulted in a loss of activity against glutathione, confirming the role of this residue in catalysis (Kumar2012Mammalian). The study provides insights into the secondary and tertiary structures of CHAC1, but does not detail its quaternary structure (Kumar2012Mammalian).

## Function
The CHAC1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase, specifically targeting glutathione, a critical antioxidant in cells. This enzyme catalyzes the degradation of glutathione by cleaving its γ-glutamyl bond, resulting in the production of 5-oxoproline and cysteinyl-glycine (cys-gly) (Kumar2012Mammalian). This activity is significant in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and managing oxidative stress, as glutathione is a major redox buffer in cells (Kumar2012Mammalian).

CHAC1 is primarily localized in the cytosol and does not contain an ER-targeting signal peptide, indicating its cytosolic activity (Mungrue2009CHAC1MGC4504). The protein is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response related to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it acts as a proapoptotic factor. It is regulated by the ATF4-ATF3-CHOP signaling cascade, which is activated during ER stress (Mungrue2009CHAC1MGC4504). The depletion of glutathione by CHAC1 is linked to the promotion of apoptosis, as reduced glutathione levels are an early hallmark of this process (Kumar2012Mammalian). This function is crucial for the regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis, impacting cell survival and function.

## Clinical Significance
The CHAC1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases and conditions through its role in glutathione metabolism and cellular stress responses. Overexpression of CHAC1 is linked to the depletion of glutathione, which can lead to oxidative stress and apoptosis. This mechanism is implicated in several health conditions, including atherosclerosis, cancer, liver metabolism disorders, viral infections, and retinal axonal damage (Crawford2015Human).

In prostate cancer, CHAC1 overexpression reduces cell viability and increases sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug docetaxel by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and promoting ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (He2021ChaC). CHAC1 is also associated with gastric cancer development, as its overexpression in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells leads to TP53 mutations through increased oxidative stress (Wada2018Helicobacter).

In muscle wasting conditions such as cachexia, CHAC1 expression is upregulated, contributing to glutathione depletion and oxidative stress. However, inactivation of CHAC1, while preserving glutathione levels, is insufficient to prevent muscle wasting, indicating its complex role in these conditions (Li2023CHAC1). These findings highlight CHAC1's potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
CHAC1 (ChaC glutathione specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 1) is known to interact with MIA3 (melanoma inhibitory active protein 3), also known as TANGO1, in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This interaction promotes the degradation of glutathione, which is crucial for the progression of HCC. The binding of MIA3 to CHAC1 facilitates the cleavage of glutathione, thereby supporting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells while inhibiting apoptosis (Wanbiao2023MIA3). The interaction between MIA3 and CHAC1 has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated the formation of protein complexes between these two proteins (Wanbiao2023MIA3). Confocal microscopy has also been used to visualize the colocalization of MIA3 and CHAC1 in HCC cells, further supporting their interaction (Wanbiao2023MIA3). CHAC1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with MIA3, contributing to the degradation of glutathione and influencing cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell proliferation (Wanbiao2023MIA3). This interaction highlights the potential of targeting the MIA3-CHAC1 axis for therapeutic intervention in HCC.
