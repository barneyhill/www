# IFT81

## Overview
IFT81 is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 81 protein, a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex B, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia in eukaryotic cells. The IFT81 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including coiled-coil domains and a calponin-homology domain, which facilitate its interactions with other IFT proteins and its role in tubulin transport. This protein is integral to the anterograde transport of molecular cargo to the ciliary tip, a process vital for proper ciliogenesis and ciliary function. IFT81's interactions within the IFT-B complex are critical for maintaining ciliary architecture, influencing cellular signaling pathways such as the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway, and contributing to various cellular processes. Mutations in the IFT81 gene have been linked to rare ciliopathies, underscoring its importance in cellular and developmental homeostasis (Bhogaraju2013Molecular; Perrault2015IFT81; Duran2016Destabilization).

## Structure
IFT81 is a protein encoded by a gene consisting of 19 exons, resulting in a 676-residue protein. It contains four coiled-coil domains and a calponin-homology NDC80 NUF2 Calponin Homology (NN-CH) domain at its N-terminus, which serves as a tubulin-binding site essential for cilia assembly and maintenance (Perrault2015IFT81). The coiled-coil domains facilitate interaction with other proteins such as IFT74, IFT52, and the IFT27/IFT25 complex (Perrault2015IFT81). A linker region between the N-terminal and C-terminal coiled coils serves as a binding site for the small GTPase IFT22/RABL5 (Perrault2015IFT81).

The IFT81 protein forms a tubulin-binding module with IFT74, which is crucial for the transport of tubulin within cilia. The IFT81N domain binds the globular domain of tubulin, providing specificity, while IFT74N binds the acidic tail of β-tubulin, enhancing the binding affinity (Bhogaraju2013Molecular). The crystal structure of the IFT81N domain reveals a positively charged surface patch that is crucial for tubulin binding (Bhogaraju2013Molecular). The protein's structure and interactions are vital for its role in intraflagellar transport and ciliogenesis, although specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
IFT81 is a core component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex B, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia in human cells. The protein encoded by the IFT81 gene is involved in the anterograde transport of tubulin and other molecules to the ciliary tip, a critical step in ciliogenesis. IFT81, along with IFT74, forms a tubulin-binding module that facilitates the transport of tubulin within the cilium, ensuring proper cilia formation and function (Bhogaraju2013Molecular).

IFT81 contains a calponin-homology domain at its N-terminus, which is a tubulin-binding site necessary for cilia assembly. The protein also has coiled-coil domains that enable interactions with other IFT proteins, such as IFT74, IFT52, and the IFT27/IFT25 complex, contributing to the structural integrity of the IFT-B complex (Perrault2015IFT81). In healthy cells, IFT81 is crucial for the proper formation and function of cilia, which are involved in various cellular processes, including signaling pathways like the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway (Perrault2015IFT81). The protein's role in maintaining ciliary architecture is vital for cellular signaling and sensory functions, influencing development and homeostasis (Duran2016Destabilization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT81 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathy-related conditions, although they are considered very rare. Ciliopathies are disorders caused by defects in the structure or function of cilia, and IFT81 is a core component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex B, essential for ciliary assembly and maintenance. The study by Perrault et al. identified mutations in IFT81 in individuals with reno-ocular ciliopathies, including nephronophthisis and polydactyly, as well as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis-1, which presents with retinal dystrophy and brain lesions (Perrault2015IFT81). 

Functional testing has shown that mutations in IFT81 lead to decreased ciliation and defects in ciliogenesis or cilia maintenance, although the protein's abundance and localization in cilia remain unchanged (Perrault2015IFT81). These mutations can disrupt ciliary function and potentially affect signaling pathways, such as the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway, contributing to the development of ciliopathy phenotypes (Perrault2015IFT81). The rarity of IFT81 mutations in causing ciliopathies is likely due to the essential role of IFT-B core proteins in ciliary assembly (Perrault2015IFT81).

## Interactions
IFT81 is a protein that plays a significant role in intraflagellar transport (IFT) by forming part of the IFT-B complex. It interacts with several other proteins to facilitate its function in ciliogenesis and cilia maintenance. IFT81 contains coiled-coil domains that mediate interactions with proteins such as IFT74, IFT52, and the IFT27/IFT25 complex (Perrault2015IFT81). It forms a heterotetrameric complex with IFT74, with a 2:1:1 ratio of IFT81 to IFT74/72, which is crucial for tubulin transport within cilia (Bhogaraju2013Molecular; Lucker2010Direct). This interaction is enhanced by the basic N-terminal domain of IFT74, which increases the affinity for tubulin (Taschner2016Intraflagellar).

IFT81 also interacts with the small GTPase IFT22/RABL5 through a linker region between its N-terminal and C-terminal coiled coils (Perrault2015IFT81). In addition, IFT81 is part of an octameric complex with IFT88, IFT74, IFT70, IFT52, IFT46, IFT27, and IFT25, indicating its involvement in a stable sub-complex within the IFT-B complex (Taschner2012Architecture). These interactions are essential for the transport of molecular cargo along ciliary axonemes, highlighting the critical role of IFT81 in ciliary function.
