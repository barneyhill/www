# NSUN2

## Overview
NSUN2 is a gene that encodes the NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2, an enzyme that belongs to the family of RNA methyltransferases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the methylation of cytosine-5 in various RNA molecules, including tRNAs and mRNAs, which is crucial for RNA stability and processing. The protein encoded by NSUN2 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as mRNA stability, miRNA maturation, and mRNA nuclear export, thereby influencing protein synthesis and translation (Chellamuthu2020The; Hussain2013NSun2Mediated). NSUN2 is active in the nucleolus and cytoplasm, where it modifies tRNAs to protect them from cleavage, thus ensuring efficient protein synthesis and cellular metabolism (Gkatza2019Cytosine5). Additionally, NSUN2 is involved in cell cycle regulation and acts as a sensor under stress conditions, impacting cellular senescence and differentiation (Sun2018Effects; Chellamuthu2020The). Dysregulation of NSUN2 is associated with various neurological disorders and cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development.

## Function
The NSUN2 gene encodes an RNA methyltransferase that plays a critical role in the methylation of cytosine-5 in various RNA molecules, including tRNAs and mRNAs. This methylation is essential for RNA stability and proper processing, impacting several cellular processes. In healthy human cells, NSUN2-mediated methylation enhances mRNA stability, influences miRNA maturation, and facilitates mRNA nuclear export, thereby promoting protein synthesis and translation (Chellamuthu2020The; Hussain2013NSun2Mediated).

NSUN2 is predominantly active in the nucleolus and cytoplasm, where it modifies tRNAs to protect them from endonucleolytic cleavage, ensuring efficient protein synthesis. This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular metabolism and responding to stress conditions (Gkatza2019Cytosine5). NSUN2 also acts as a sensor under stress conditions, regulating cellular senescence and differentiation, particularly in testis differentiation and early embryogenesis (Chellamuthu2020The).

The gene is involved in cell cycle regulation by affecting the expression and translation of key cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which is important for cell growth and division (Sun2018Effects). NSUN2's role in RNA methylation and cellular stress response highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the NSUN2 gene are associated with several neurological and cancer-related conditions. In the context of intellectual disabilities, NSUN2 mutations are linked to intellectual disability type 5 (MRT5), characterized by developmental delays, microcephaly, short stature, and facial dysmorphism. These mutations often result in loss-of-function variants, leading to reduced protein production and mRNA levels, contributing to a range of neurodevelopmental disabilities (Yang2024A; Sun2020Further). NSUN2 mutations have also been implicated in Dubowitz-like syndrome, where a splicing mutation leads to altered mRNA levels and a significant reduction in protein expression (Martinez2012Whole).

In cancer, NSUN2 is frequently overexpressed, particularly in breast and colorectal cancers, where it is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and poor prognosis. In colorectal cancer, NSUN2 regulates miR-125b through methylation, affecting cancer cell migration (Chellamuthu2020The). In lung adenocarcinoma, high NSUN2 expression is linked to better overall survival, while in head and neck squamous carcinoma, its upregulation is associated with shorter survival and higher mortality risk (Chellamuthu2020The). These findings highlight NSUN2's significant roles in both neural and cancer pathologies.

## Interactions
NSUN2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. During mitosis, NSUN2 is phosphorylated at Ser139 by Aurora-B kinase, which affects its interaction with nucleolar proteins such as NPM1 and nucleolin. This phosphorylation reduces NSUN2's association with NPM1, a process that can be inhibited by Aurora-B inhibitors like Hesperadin. The phosphorylation state of NSUN2 is crucial, as the unphosphorylated mimic NSUN2-S139A maintains its association with NPM1, while the phosphorylated mimic NSUN2-S139E shows reduced interaction (SakitaSuto2007AuroraB).

NSUN2 also interacts with mRNA, where it binds to specific sequences enriched in exosomal mRNAs, suggesting a role in mRNA sorting into exosomes. It is involved in the methylation of cytosine residues, impacting mRNA stability and translation. NSUN2's interaction with Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1) contributes to mRNA stabilization and sorting into exosomes (Kossinova2022Reorganization).

In the context of mRNA export, NSUN2 interacts with ALYREF, an mRNA export adaptor. NSUN2's methyltransferase activity is essential for ALYREF's RNA-binding affinity, facilitating mRNA export from the nucleus. This interaction is crucial for the proper subcellular distribution of ALYREF and the regulation of mRNA export processes (Yang20175methylcytosine).
