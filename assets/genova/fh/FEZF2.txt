# FEZF2

## Overview
FEZF2 (FEZ family zinc finger 2) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in various biological processes, particularly in the development of the nervous and immune systems. The protein product of FEZF2 is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the differentiation and specification of neurons within the cerebral cortex, especially in the formation of corticospinal motor neurons (Bensaid2019Multihit; Chen2008The). It is crucial for determining the fate of subcortical projection neurons and ensuring proper axonal targeting (Chen2008The). Beyond its neurological functions, FEZF2 is also significant in the immune system, where it regulates gene expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells, contributing to immune tolerance by facilitating the negative selection of autoreactive T cells (Qi2022Aire; Lammers2024Ehf). The multifaceted roles of FEZF2 underscore its importance in both neurodevelopment and immune regulation, with implications for various clinical conditions, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and autism spectrum disorder (Bensaid2019Multihit; Shu2013FEZF2).

## Function
FEZF2 (FEZ family zinc finger 2) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and differentiation of neurons in the cerebral cortex. It is essential for the specification of corticospinal motor neurons, influencing their molecular identity, dendritic development, and axon targeting, particularly in layer 5 of the cerebral cortex (Bensaid2019Multihit). FEZF2 regulates the fate choice between subcortical and callosal projection neurons, ensuring proper axonal projections to subcortical targets such as the spinal cord, tectum, and pons (Chen2008The). It acts upstream of Ctip2 in the genetic pathway that determines the fate of subcortical projection neurons, influencing axon targeting and neuronal differentiation (Chen2008The).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, FEZF2 is involved in the development of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and thymic tuft cells, where it regulates gene expression crucial for immune tolerance (Lammers2024Ehf). FEZF2 directly binds to tissue-specific autoantigen promoters in mTECs, contributing to the negative selection of autoreactive T cells and the establishment of central tolerance (Qi2022Aire). This dual role in neurodevelopment and immune regulation highlights the diverse functions of FEZF2 in human biology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FEZF2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), FEZF2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. It is frequently silenced due to promoter methylation, leading to the overexpression of oncogenes such as EZH2 and MDM2, which contribute to tumor progression. Restoring FEZF2 expression in NPC cells can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shu2013FEZF2).

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a 12bp deletion in the FEZF2 gene has been identified in consanguineous families, suggesting a role in the disorder's genetic architecture. Although this mutation does not lead to significant brain abnormalities, it may affect neuronal development and connectivity, contributing to ASD phenotypes (Bensaid2019Multihit).

FEZF2 is also involved in the regulation of tissue-specific antigens in medullary thymic epithelial cells, playing a role in immune tolerance. Deficiencies in FEZF2 can lead to autoimmune diseases, as it is crucial for the elimination of autoreactive T cells (Qi2022Aire).

## Interactions
FEZF2 (FEZ family zinc finger 2) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the cerebral cortex by regulating the fate of subcortical projection neurons. It interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to modulate gene expression and neuronal differentiation. One of the key interactions of FEZF2 is with the transcription factor Ctip2, which acts as a major downstream effector in the regulation of corticospinal tract formation. In Fezf2-deficient mice, Ctip2 expression is disrupted, leading to defects in axon targeting, but restoring Ctip2 expression can rescue these defects (Chen2008The).

FEZF2 also interacts with the transcription factor Lmo4, which enhances its ability to reprogram upper-layer cortical neurons into deep-layer neuron identities. This interaction is particularly effective in the motor cortex, where Lmo4 acts as a chromatin modifier, potentially altering the epigenetic landscape to facilitate FEZF2's function (Felske2023Lmo4).

Additionally, FEZF2 is involved in a regulatory network with other transcription factors such as SATB2 and SOX5. SOX5 directly represses FEZF2 in certain cortical layers, while SATB2 promotes its expression, indicating a complex interplay that influences neuronal identity (Estruch2018Proteomic).
