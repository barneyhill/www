# ZG16

## Overview
ZG16 is a gene that encodes the protein zymogen granule protein 16, which is a member of the Jacalin-related lectin family. This protein is characterized by its β-prism fold structure and is primarily involved in carbohydrate-binding functions, particularly recognizing mannose and interacting with glycosaminoglycans. Zymogen granule protein 16 is secreted and plays a significant role in the secretion and transport of glycoproteins, as well as in modulating immune responses through interactions with proteins such as PD-L1. It is predominantly expressed in the liver and the gastrointestinal tract, including the colon, jejunum, and ileum. The protein's involvement in cellular processes related to secretion and immune regulation underscores its biological importance, with alterations in its expression linked to clinical conditions such as colorectal cancer (Zhou2007hZG16; Meng2022ZG16; Meng2018Loss).

## Structure
ZG16, or zymogen granule protein 16, is characterized by a β-prism fold structure, which is a common feature among Jacalin-related lectins. This fold consists of three β-sheets and is similar to the mannose-binding Jacalin-related lectins found in plants (Mito2017Lectin; Kanagawa2011Crystal). The protein contains a Jacalin-like lectin domain, which is crucial for its carbohydrate-binding function, particularly in recognizing mannose and interacting with glycosaminoglycans (Meng2018Loss; Mito2017Lectin).

ZG16 has a flexible structure, with notable flexibility at the carboxy terminus and in the glycan-binding region. The CXXC motif at the carboxy terminus is involved in redox reactions and can form an intramolecular disulfide bond (Javitt2021Conformational). The protein also features a dynamic nonproline cis peptide bond between Gly28 and Glu29, which can switch to a trans configuration, affecting nearby side chains (Javitt2021Conformational).

ZG16 is primarily a monomeric protein, as indicated by its small contact areas in crystal structures and elution profiles (Kanagawa2011Crystal). The protein is secreted and contains a signal peptide at its N-terminus, which is typical for secretory proteins (Zhou2007hZG16).

## Function
The ZG16 gene encodes a novel human secreted protein, hZG16, which is primarily expressed in the liver and moderately in the colon and other parts of the gut, such as the jejunum and ileum (Zhou2007hZG16). This protein is involved in the secretion of glycoproteins, a process that appears to occur independently of glycan synthesis, as its role in glycoprotein secretion was not significantly affected by inhibiting glycan synthesis (Zhou2007hZG16). hZG16 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, suggesting it may facilitate the transport of glycoproteins from the Golgi to the extracellular space (Zhou2007hZG16).

The presence of a Jacalin domain in hZG16 indicates that it may function as a lectin, binding to specific carbohydrates, which could be relevant to its role in glycoprotein secretion (Zhou2007hZG16). In healthy human cells, hZG16 is found in the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix, highlighting its involvement in cellular processes related to secretion and possibly in maintaining normal liver function (Zhou2007hZG16). The evolutionary conservation of the ZG16 gene across species underscores its importance in biological functions (Zhou2007hZG16).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZG16 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). ZG16 is notably downregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, with studies showing an average 130-fold decrease in tumor tissues (Meng2018Loss). This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival and recurrence-free survival (Meng2018Loss). ZG16's expression is also linked to the regulation of PD-L1, a protein involved in immune evasion by tumors. Overexpression of ZG16 can lead to the degradation of PD-L1, enhancing T-cell mediated immunity and potentially improving the efficacy of immunotherapy in CRC (Meng2022ZG16; Meng2021ZG16).

ZG16 also plays a role in inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis. Its overexpression in CRC cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, mediated through the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway (Liu2024Identification). The loss of ZG16 is an early event in CRC development and is associated with worse prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for CRC diagnosis and prognosis (Meng2018Loss; Liu2024Identification).

## Interactions
ZG16, or zymogen granule protein 16, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and molecules. It directly binds to glycosylated PD-L1 through its lectin domain, leading to PD-L1 degradation. This interaction has been confirmed in colon cancer cell lines, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses by affecting PD-L1 expression (Meng2022ZG16).

ZG16 also interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in pancreatic zymogen granules. It specifically binds to the heparan sulfate chains of these proteoglycans, a process crucial for the organization of the submembranous matrix and the packing of digestive enzymes during granule formation. This binding is mediated by specific carbohydrate-binding sites on ZG16, which are essential for its interaction with heparan sulfate (KumazawaInoue2011ZG16p).

Additionally, ZG16 interacts with mycobacterial phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), particularly PIM1 and PIM2. These interactions are mediated through mannose residues, suggesting a role in the mucosal immune response by recognizing glycans of pathogens (Hanashima2015Defining). These interactions highlight ZG16's involvement in immune regulation and cellular processes related to protein sorting and secretion.
