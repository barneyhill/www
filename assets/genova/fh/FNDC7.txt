# FNDC7

## Overview
The FNDC7 gene encodes the protein fibronectin type III domain containing 7, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by the presence of fibronectin type III domains. These domains are commonly involved in cell adhesion and receptor binding, suggesting a potential role in cellular communication and structural integrity. While the specific biological functions of the FNDC7 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in various cellular processes is indicated by its association with DNA methylation changes and genetic variants linked to health conditions such as cancer and autoimmune disorders (ZeberLubecka2023Exome; Goodrich2021Per; Hoang2022DNA). The gene's expression and regulation may therefore be critical in understanding its contribution to disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The FNDC7 gene has been implicated in various health conditions through its association with DNA methylation changes and genetic variants. In the context of cancer, methylation of FNDC7 in circulating leukocytes has been linked to smoking-induced lung cancer, suggesting a role in carcinogenesis and immune system regulation (Goodrich2021Per). Additionally, DNA methylation patterns at FNDC7 sites have been observed to vary among different ethnic and racial groups, potentially contributing to differences in lung cancer risk (Hoang2022DNA).

In the realm of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, FNDC7 has been identified as a significant genetic variant in predicting susceptibility to the joint occurrence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). The SNP rs4484951 in FNDC7 is notably associated with differentiating between patients with both PCOS and HT and those with only PCOS, indicating its potential role in the etiology of these conditions (ZeberLubecka2023Exome).

Despite these associations, FNDC7 was not highlighted in studies focusing on neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting that its role may be more specific to certain conditions rather than broadly implicated across various disease categories (BenMahmoud2022A).
