# ARAP3

## Overview
ARAP3 is a gene that encodes the protein ArfGAP with RhoGAP domain, ankyrin repeat, and PH domain 3, which is a multifunctional GTPase-activating protein (GAP). This protein is involved in the regulation of small GTPases, such as RhoA and Arf6, and plays a critical role in cellular processes like actin cytoskeleton dynamics, membrane trafficking, and cell signaling. ARAP3 is regulated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, which influences its localization and activity within the cell. The protein's structure includes multiple domains, such as ArfGAP and RhoGAP domains, a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, a Ras-associating (RA) domain, and several pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and lipids (Zhang2023Structural; Bao2016Structural). ARAP3 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune response regulation, angiogenesis, and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Yagi2010ARAP3; Gambardella2010PI3K).

## Structure
The ARAP3 protein is a multi-domain protein that includes ArfGAP and RhoGAP domains, a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, a Ras-associating (RA) domain, and five pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (Zhang2023Structural; Bao2016Structural). The RhoGAP domain of ARAP3, consisting of residues 906-1107, exhibits a canonical RhoGAP structure with nine long α-helices and two short α-helices arranged in an anti-parallel fashion (Bao2016Structural). This domain is crucial for its interaction with RhoA, where it enhances GTPase activity through a conserved motif containing an arginine finger (Bao2016Structural).

The PH1 domain of ARAP3 adopts a canonical PH domain fold, characterized by a seven-stranded β-barrel capped by a long C-terminal α-helix. This domain is involved in binding phosphoinositides, such as PI(3,4,5)P3, which is essential for ARAP3's recruitment to the plasma membrane (Zhang2023Structural). The PH1 domain's interaction with phosphoinositides involves key residues that form hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups of PI(3,4,5)P3 (Zhang2023Structural).

ARAP3 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at tyrosine residues Y1403 and Y1408, which are recognized by the Vav2 SH2 domain (Wu2012Identification). These modifications play a role in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways (Wu2012Identification).

## Function
ARAP3 is a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, primarily through its activity as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPases RhoA and Arf6. It is regulated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, which controls its catalytic activity and subcellular localization. Upon activation of PI3K, ARAP3 translocates to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with its substrates RhoA-GTP and Arf6-GTP, modulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and membrane trafficking (Kartopawiro2013Arap3; Gambardella2010PI3K).

In healthy human cells, ARAP3 is involved in regulating cell adhesion, motility, and invasion processes. It influences the formation of lamellipodia and growth factor signaling, which are essential for normal cell movement and interaction with the extracellular matrix (Yagi2010ARAP3). ARAP3 also plays a significant role in angiogenesis, particularly during embryonic development, by regulating the activity of small GTPases that are crucial for cellular proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Gambardella2010PI3K).

ARAP3's function is essential for maintaining normal immune responses, as it modulates integrin activity in neutrophils, preventing excessive activation and ensuring proper chemotaxis and adhesion-dependent processes (Gambardella2011The). Its activity is crucial for effective immune responses and preventing excessive inflammation (Gambardella2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the ARAP3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and vascular disorders. In scirrhous gastric carcinoma, ARAP3 is underexpressed, and its overexpression has been shown to reduce peritoneal dissemination by inhibiting cell adhesion and invasion. This suggests its potential role as a tumor suppressor and a therapeutic target in gastric cancer (Yagi2010ARAP3). In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), ARAP3 has been identified as a novel oncogene. Mutations in ARAP3 were found in a subset of PTC patients, and its downregulation in cell lines led to reduced proliferation and invasion, indicating its oncogenic role in thyroid cancer (Wang2016Nextgeneration).

ARAP3 also plays a critical role in vascular development. Its deletion in mice results in embryonic lethality due to defects in angiogenesis, highlighting its essential function in vascular development (Gambardella2010PI3K). In lymphatic vascular development, ARAP3 is crucial for normal lymphangiogenesis, and its dysregulation is associated with lymphatic disorders such as hypotrichosis–lymphedema–telangiectasia (Kartopawiro2013Arap3). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ARAP3 in both cancer progression and vascular development.

## Interactions
ARAP3 interacts with several proteins through its various domains, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. One of the key interactions is with the SHIP2 protein, mediated by the Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domains of both proteins. This interaction is specific and involves the formation of a heterodimer, which does not affect the phosphatase activity of SHIP2 and is not modulated by the activation of ARAP3 by PI3K or Rap1, indicating a constitutive interaction (Raaijmakers2007The).

ARAP3 also forms a multimeric protein complex with SHIP2 and the SH3 domain-containing adaptor proteins CIN85 and CMS. This complex is involved in endocytosis and the regulation of PI3K signaling pathways (Raaijmakers2007The). The interaction with CIN85 is mediated through a proline-arginine motif specific for the CIN85 SH3 domain (Raaijmakers2007The).

In addition to SHIP2, ARAP3 interacts with the first SAM domain of Odin, adopting a similar Mid-Loop/End-Helix topology as with SHIP2. This interaction is characterized by electrostatic contacts and has been studied using techniques like NMR spectroscopy and ITC (Mercurio2012Heterotypic). These interactions highlight ARAP3's role as a scaffold protein, potentially binding proteins that depend on their enzymatic activities (Raaijmakers2007The).
