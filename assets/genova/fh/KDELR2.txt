# KDELR2

## Overview
KDELR2 is a gene that encodes the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 2, a transmembrane receptor involved in the retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins from the Golgi apparatus. This receptor is a member of the KDEL receptor family and plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis by ensuring that ER-resident proteins are returned to the ER, thus preventing their secretion and ensuring proper protein folding and function (van2020Interaction; Bräuer2019Structural). The KDELR2 protein is characterized by a transporter-like architecture with seven transmembrane alpha helices, which facilitate its function in protein trafficking (Bräuer2019Structural). It is involved in various cellular processes, including the unfolded protein response and autophagy, and has been implicated in disease pathogenesis, such as osteogenesis imperfecta and certain cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and prognosis (Meng2022KDELR2KIF20A; van2020Interaction; Cela2022KDEL).

## Structure
The KDELR2 protein is part of the KDEL receptor family, which is involved in the retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins from the Golgi apparatus. It is an integral membrane protein with a transporter-like architecture, featuring seven transmembrane alpha helices arranged in a hexagonal configuration (Bräuer2019Structural). These helices form a compact structure that undergoes conformational changes upon binding to the KDEL signal peptide, which is crucial for its function in protein retrieval (Bräuer2019Structural).

KDELR2 belongs to the PQ-loop superfamily, sharing structural similarities with solute carrier (SLC) proteins and SWEET sugar transporters, which typically have a seven-transmembrane topology (Newstead2020Molecular). The protein's structure includes inverted topology repeats or proto-domains, essential for its role as a trafficking receptor (Newstead2020Molecular).

The binding of the KDEL signal involves specific interactions, such as salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which are pH-dependent. Key residues involved in this process include Arg 159, Arg 47, Glu 117, and Tyr 158, with His 12 potentially acting as a pH sensor (Bräuer2019Structural). The protein's structure suggests an evolutionary relationship to secondary active transporters, indicating its complex role in cellular transport mechanisms (Bräuer2019Structural).

## Function
KDELR2, a member of the KDEL receptor family, plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis within healthy human cells by facilitating the retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins from the Golgi apparatus back to the ER. This retrieval process is essential for the proper folding and functioning of newly synthesized proteins, as it prevents the secretion of ER-resident proteins and maintains cellular function (van2020Interaction; Bräuer2019Structural). KDELR2 specifically recognizes and binds to proteins with a C-terminal KDEL-like motif in a pH-dependent manner, with maximal binding occurring in the acidic environment of the Golgi (van2020Interaction; Bräuer2019Structural).

KDELR2 is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular reaction to stress that impairs protein folding. It is upregulated through the IRE1/X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) branch of the UPR to manage the increased burden of misfolded proteins (Wires2021The; Cela2022KDEL). Additionally, KDELR2 is implicated in the regulation of membrane transport between the ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane, and is involved in autophagy, contributing to cellular homeostasis and stress response (Cela2022KDEL).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KDELR2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. Bi-allelic pathogenic variants in KDELR2 are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones. These mutations impair the retrograde transport of the collagen chaperone HSP47 from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), disrupting collagen fibril formation and leading to the clinical manifestations of OI (van2020Interaction). Specific mutations, such as p.His12Asp and p.Pro133Leu, prevent KDELR2 from binding the KDEL peptide, resulting in a progressively deforming form of OI (van2020Interaction).

In cancer, KDELR2 is highly expressed in glioma and bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), where it is associated with poor prognosis. In glioma, KDELR2 expression correlates with higher tumor grades and shorter survival, suggesting its role as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker (Mao2020KDELR2). In BLCA, KDELR2 expression is linked to advanced clinical stages and poor overall survival, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Ma2023KDELR2). KDELR2 also plays a role in bladder cancer progression by regulating the expression of proteins involved in tumorigenesis, such as MMP2 and MMP9 (Meng2022KDELR2KIF20A).

## Interactions
KDELR2, a KDEL receptor, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with HSP47, an ER-resident collagen chaperone, which is essential for proper collagen secretion. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of osteogenesis imperfecta, where KDELR2 mutations lead to mislocalization of HSP47, affecting collagen biosynthesis and secretion (van2020Interaction).

In cancer biology, KDELR2 has been shown to interact with proteins involved in tumor progression. It regulates the expression of KIF20A, which in turn influences the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9, promoting tumor growth and metastasis in bladder cancer (Meng2022KDELR2KIF20A). KDELR2 also interacts with POC5 in breast cancer, where it upregulates POC5 protein levels, influencing cell cycle progression and tumor growth (Wei2021KDELR2).

Additionally, KDELR2 is involved in interactions with proteins such as COPA, ARFGAP1, and ARF1, which are implicated in processes like extracellular matrix degradation and immune infiltration in bladder urothelial carcinoma (Ma2023KDELR2). These interactions highlight KDELR2's role in both normal cellular functions and disease pathogenesis.
