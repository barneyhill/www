# IQCJ

## Overview
The IQCJ gene encodes the protein IQ motif containing J, which is primarily involved in the nervous system. This protein is characterized by its IQ motif, which facilitates interactions with calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein, in a calcium-independent manner. IQ motif containing J is notably enriched at axon initial segments (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier (NRs), where it plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these neuronal domains. The protein's interactions with ankyrin G (AnkG) and βIV-spectrin are essential for its localization and function, contributing to the stability of AIS and NRs. Additionally, the phosphorylation of IQ motif containing J by CK2 is crucial for its proper accumulation at the AIS, highlighting its regulatory role in neuronal signaling pathways (Papandréou2015CK2‐regulated; Martin2008SchwannominInteracting).

## Structure


## Function
The IQCJ gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the nervous system, particularly in the maintenance and function of axon initial segments (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier (NRs). These structures are crucial for the proper conduction of action potentials in neurons. IQCJ-SCHIP-1, an isoform of the protein, is highly enriched at AISs and NRs, where it interacts with key proteins such as ankyrin G (AnkG) and βIV-spectrin, contributing to the structural integrity and stability of these axonal domains (Martin2008SchwannominInteracting).

The interaction between IQCJ-SCHIP-1 and AnkG is regulated by CK2 phosphorylation, which is essential for the protein's accumulation at the AIS. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the AIS structure, which is vital for neuronal function (Papandréou2015CK2‐regulated). IQCJ-SCHIP-1 also binds calmodulin in the absence of calcium ions, suggesting a role in calcium-mediated signaling pathways (Martin2008SchwannominInteracting). The protein's localization and function are dependent on the presence of AnkG and βIV-spectrin, indicating its involvement in the long-term stabilization and function of AISs and NRs (Martin2008SchwannominInteracting).

## Clinical Significance
The IQCJ gene, primarily expressed in the nervous system, has been studied for its potential role in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Although it is not directly linked to specific diseases, research suggests that variations in the IQCJ gene may influence plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, particularly in response to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IQCJ have been associated with gene-diet interactions that affect TG levels, possibly through mechanisms involving RNA splicing and DNA methylation (Vallée2017Plasma).

The gene is part of a transcriptional unit with schwannomin-interacting protein 1 (SCHIP1), which is implicated in the nervous system. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) has suggested that IQCJ-SCHIP1 might be associated with TG levels and the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, which are crucial for maintaining normal blood TG levels. Dysfunctional VLDL hydrolysis can lead to increased TG-rich lipoprotein remnants, which are associated with atherosclerosis risk (Vallée2017Plasma).

While the IQCJ gene is poorly expressed in tissues directly related to lipid metabolism, its potential regulatory role in plasma TG levels through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms highlights its significance in cardiovascular health (Vallée2017Plasma).

## Interactions
IQCJ-SCHIP-1, an isoform of the SCHIP-1 protein, is involved in several key interactions within the nervous system. It is highly enriched at axon initial segments (AISs) and nodes of Ranvier (NRs), where it interacts with ankyrin G (AnkG) and βIV-spectrin. The localization of IQCJ-SCHIP-1 at these sites is dependent on AnkG, as demonstrated by its absence in mice lacking AnkG expression in the cerebellum (Martin2008SchwannominInteracting). IQCJ-SCHIP-1 directly interacts with the membrane binding domain of AnkG, and this interaction is crucial for its proper localization (Martin2008SchwannominInteracting). 

IQCJ-SCHIP-1 also binds to calmodulin in the absence of calcium ions, a process mediated by its N-terminal IQ motif. This interaction is disrupted when the IQ motif is mutated, indicating its importance for calmodulin binding (Martin2008SchwannominInteracting). CK2 phosphorylation regulates the interaction between IQCJ-SCHIP-1 and AnkG, with CK2-phosphorylated IQCJ-SCHIP-1 binding AnkG with high affinity. This phosphorylation is essential for the protein's localization at the AIS (Papandréou2015CK2‐regulated). IQCJ-SCHIP-1 can also bind to AnkB, another ankyrin protein, but it preferentially accumulates in AnkG-positive domains (Papandréou2015CK2‐regulated).
