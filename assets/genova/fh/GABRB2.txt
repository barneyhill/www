# GABRB2

## Overview
The GABRB2 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor subunit beta2, a critical component of the GABA-A receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS) (Hernandez2021Dravet). This receptor is part of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel receptor superfamily and is characterized by its pentameric structure, typically comprising two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunit (Chen2024Proteome). The beta2 subunit plays a vital role in the assembly, trafficking, and function of the GABA-A receptor, contributing to the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic inhibition (Hernandez2021Dravet). Mutations in the GABRB2 gene have been associated with various neurological disorders, including Dravet syndrome and other neurodevelopmental conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal brain function (Hernandez2021Dravet; Vallim2023Neurodevelopmental).

## Structure
The GABRB2 gene encodes the beta2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. The primary structure of the GABRB2 protein consists of amino acid sequences that form four transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel receptor superfamily (Chen2024Proteome). The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are common in transmembrane proteins. The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the membrane, contributing to the formation of the chloride-ion channel (Chen2024Proteome).

The quaternary structure of the GABA-A receptor, including the beta2 subunit, is a pentameric assembly typically composed of two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunit, with the (α1)2(β2)2(γ2) configuration being the most abundant (Chen2024Proteome). The intracellular domain between the third and fourth transmembrane regions is involved in phosphorylation, a common post-translational modification that can influence receptor function (Chen2024Proteome).

GABRB2 also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as the short form β2S and the long form β2L, the latter of which includes an additional 38-amino acid exon with a potential phosphorylation site (Zhao2009AlternativeSplicing). These isoforms are differentially expressed in the brain and are associated with psychiatric disorders (Zhao2009AlternativeSplicing).

## Function
The GABRB2 gene encodes the beta-2 subunit of the GABA A receptor, which is a critical component of the most common inhibitory neurotransmitter system in the central nervous system (CNS) (Hernandez2021Dravet). GABA A receptors are heteropentameric ion channels that mediate fast synaptic inhibition by allowing chloride ions to enter the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane (Hernandez2021Dravet). The most abundant form of the GABA A receptor in the CNS is the α1β2γ2 receptor, composed of two alpha-1, two beta-2, and one gamma-2 subunits (Hernandez2021Dravet). These receptors are predominantly expressed in cortical and thalamic neurons, which are involved in the regulation of seizures (Hernandez2021Dravet).

In healthy human cells, the GABRB2 gene product contributes to the proper assembly, trafficking, and function of the GABA A receptor, ensuring effective inhibitory neurotransmission and maintaining neuronal excitability balance (Hernandez2021Dravet). The GABRB2 subunit is part of the main GABAergic receptor in the brain, GABAARα1β2γ2, which is associated with parvalbumin (PVALB) interneurons, indicating its role in the formation or function of GABAergic receptors crucial for inhibitory neurotransmission (Lukow2021Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GABRB2 gene, which encodes the beta2 subunit of the GABA A receptor, have been implicated in several neurological disorders. In Dravet syndrome, a severe epileptic encephalopathy, variants in GABRB2, such as de novo missense mutations (c.992T>C, p. F331S; c.542A>T, p. Y181F) and an autosomal dominant variant (c.990_992del, p.330_331del), have been identified. These mutations are associated with fever-sensitive seizures and an average seizure onset age of 7 months. They impair the function of the a1b2c2 GABA A receptors, contributing to the pathogenesis of Dravet syndrome by affecting receptor function (Hernandez2021Dravet).

In a separate case, a heterozygous variant c.228A>T (p. Glu76Asp) in the GABRB2 gene was linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder initially considered as a differential diagnosis for Angelman syndrome. This variant is associated with symptoms such as neuropsychomotor delay, hypotonia, and refractory epilepsy, although it is classified as of uncertain significance (Vallim2023Neurodevelopmental). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GABRB2 mutations in contributing to various neurological conditions by disrupting normal inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain.

## Interactions
The GABRB2 gene encodes the beta-2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is a component of the predominant GABA-A receptor subtype in the mouse brain cortex, composed of two α1, two β2/3, and one γ2 subunit (Chen2024Proteome). This subunit is involved in forming functional receptor complexes that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission. The β2 subunit, as part of the GABA-A receptor, interacts with other subunits such as α1 and γ2 to form these complexes (Chen2024Proteome).

While specific interactions of GABRB2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, the study highlights the close connection of β2/3 subunits with other GABA-A receptor subunits and known interactors (Chen2024Proteome). The β2 subunit is also implicated in the biogenesis and trafficking of GABA-A receptors, with certain mutations affecting its surface levels and potentially altering receptor assembly and function (Hernandez2021Dravet).

The proteome analysis suggests that GABRB2 may interact with proteins involved in receptor trafficking and synaptic localization, although specific interactions are not fully detailed and require further validation (Chen2024Proteome).
