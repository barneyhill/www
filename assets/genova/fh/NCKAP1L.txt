# NCKAP1L

## Overview
The NCKAP1L gene encodes the NCK-associated protein 1-like, a critical component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, particularly within hematopoietic cells. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as migration, activation, and the formation of cellular contacts, which are essential for immune cell function and response (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). NCKAP1L is integral to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating the polymerization of F-actin in response to immune receptor engagement, thereby contributing to the formation of immunological synapses and effective immune responses (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). The protein's interactions within the WRC, including its association with proteins like ABI2 and WASF2, underscore its importance in actin dynamics and cellular signaling (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). Mutations in NCKAP1L have been linked to immunodeficiency syndromes, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune responses (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects).

## Structure
The NCKAP1L protein, also known as hematopoietic protein 1 (HEM-1), is a hematopoietic lineage-specific regulator of the actin cytoskeleton and a component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). The protein shares a sequence identity of 59.44% with NCKAP1, suggesting a similar structural fold, as proteins with more than 30% sequence identity are expected to share the same structural fold (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). Structural modeling of NCKAP1L was performed using the crystal structures of NCKAP1 from the Protein Data Bank, specifically PDB IDs 4n78 and 3p8c, as templates (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects).

The NCKAP1L protein is involved in actin polymerization, signaling downstream of activated Rac to stimulate F-actin polymerization in response to immune receptor engagement (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). It contains domains that facilitate its role in cytoskeletal organization and immune cell signaling, although specific domains are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure is crucial for its function within the WAVE complex, influencing interactions with other proteins such as ABI2 (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects).

A minor splice variant of NCKAP1L, known as nckap1l ß, plays a significant role in the morphogenesis of the intrahepatic biliary network, highlighting the importance of alternative splicing in generating protein isoforms with diverse functions (Ghaffari2021NCKassociated). This variant is implicated in actin organization and network branching, particularly in biliary epithelial cells (Ghaffari2021NCKassociated).

## Function
The NCKAP1L gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the WAVE regulatory complex, which plays a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in hematopoietic cells. This protein is involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, a process essential for various cellular functions such as migration, activation, and the formation of cellular contacts in lymphoid and myeloid cells (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). NCKAP1L is particularly important for the formation of immunological synapses in effector cells, which are critical for effective immune responses (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects).

In healthy human cells, NCKAP1L is active in the cytoplasm and is part of the WAVE complex, which signals downstream of activated Rac to stimulate F-actin polymerization. This process is crucial for the engagement of various immune receptors, including the B cell receptor, TCR, TLR, and cytokine receptors (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). The protein's role in actin polymerization is vital for proper lymphocyte development, phagocytosis, and neutrophil migration, contributing to immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune responses (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). Deficiencies in NCKAP1L can lead to impaired actin cytoskeleton dynamics, affecting T cell movement and immune function (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NCKAP1L gene are associated with a novel syndrome characterized by immunodeficiency, lymphoproliferation, and hyperinflammation. This condition presents with symptoms resembling hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), including an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio and T cell exhaustion. The syndrome is distinct from familial HLH, as it involves defects in the actin cytoskeleton machinery rather than cytotoxic granule transport or exocytosis (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). 

Patients with NCKAP1L mutations often experience recurrent infections, respiratory complications, and autoimmune manifestations such as systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease. These mutations lead to impaired T cell activation, immune synapse morphology, and neutrophil migration, contributing to the clinical symptoms (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects; Cook2022HEM1). 

The condition follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, with identified mutations including a missense variant and a splice site variant, both of which are novel and predicted to be damaging (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). The absence of NCKAP1L and WAVE2 proteins in patients' cells further supports the pathogenic role of these mutations, as these proteins are crucial for actin polymerization and immune cell function (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects).

## Interactions
NCKAP1L, also known as NCK-associated protein 1-like, is a component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration and immune cell function. NCKAP1L interacts with several proteins within the WRC, such as ABI2 and WASF2, to facilitate actin polymerization. These interactions are essential for the activation and stabilization of the WAVE complex, which in turn activates the Arp2/3 complex to promote F-actin polymerization (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects).

NCKAP1L also interacts with the Rac1 GTPase, acting downstream to regulate actin dynamics. This interaction is significant in the context of intrahepatic biliary network morphogenesis, where NCKAP1L functions as a signaling hub integrating pathways involving Rac1 and Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) (Ghaffari2021NCKassociated). The protein's role in these pathways highlights its importance in both cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling processes.

Mutations in NCKAP1L can disrupt these interactions, leading to impaired actin dynamics and associated cellular dysfunctions, as observed in certain immunodeficiency syndromes (Castro2020NCKAP1Ldefects). These findings underscore the critical role of NCKAP1L in maintaining the integrity of the WAVE complex and its interactions with other proteins.
