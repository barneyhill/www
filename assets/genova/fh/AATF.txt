# AATF

## Overview
AATF (apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis inhibition and ribosome biogenesis. The AATF protein, characterized by its role as a transcriptional coactivator, influences cell cycle progression and gene expression by interacting with multiple cellular components. It is predominantly localized in the nucleus and nucleolus, where it participates in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit and modulates the epigenetic state of rRNA genes. AATF's ability to interact with RNA and proteins, despite lacking canonical RNA-binding domains, underscores its versatility in cellular homeostasis. The protein's involvement in oncogenic pathways and its overexpression in several cancers highlight its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Kaiser2020AATFChe1—An; Srinivas2020Emerging).

## Structure
The AATF protein is a 62 kDa protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and apoptosis inhibition. It contains an unstructured N-terminal region followed by the AATF/Che1/Traube superfamily-specific domain (AATFD), which is divided into two well-conserved subdomains: AATFD-N and AATFD-C. The C-terminal subdomain (AATFD-C, residues 455-560) is crucial for the nucleolar localization of AATF and is sufficient for interaction with the NOL10 protein (Bammert2016Human). The full AATF superfamily domain is necessary for efficient binding to NGDN, another component of the ANN complex, which is essential for 40S ribosomal subunit synthesis (Bammert2016Human).

AATF is characterized by its ability to interact with RNA, despite lacking canonical RNA-binding domains. This interaction is facilitated by its intrinsically disordered, basic C-terminus, which is rich in lysine and arginine residues (Kaiser2019A). The protein also contains two putative nucleolar localization signals (NoLS) in its C-terminal portion, which are essential for its nucleolar localization (Kaiser2019A). AATF may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and has multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
AATF (apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor) is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It acts as a transcriptional coactivator, regulating gene expression and influencing cell cycle progression. AATF displaces histone deacetylases from transcription factor complexes, ensuring cell proliferation and growth arrest at different cell cycle checkpoints (Srinivas2020Emerging). It is involved in protecting cells from stress stimuli such as DNA damage, ER stress, hypoxia, or glucose deprivation by inducing cell cycle arrest, autophagy, or inhibiting apoptosis (Srinivas2020Emerging).

AATF is predominantly localized in the nucleus and nucleolus but also colocalizes with various proteins in the cytoplasm, indicating its diverse functional roles in cellular homeostasis (Srinivas2020Emerging). It is involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II by interacting with its subunits, such as hRPB11, and potentially forming part of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (Srinivas2020Emerging). AATF also plays a role in ribosome biogenesis, forming a complex with nucleolar factors to aid in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Srinivas2020Emerging). It modulates the epigenetic state of rRNA genes and relocates in response to DNA damage to facilitate p53-mediated growth arrest (Srinivas2020Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the AATF gene are implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of AATF is observed in several malignancies, including neuroblastoma, endometrial carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy (Kaiser2020AATFChe1—An; Höpker2012AATFChe1). In neuroblastoma, AATF amplification correlates with reduced survival rates, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Höpker2012AATFChe1). AATF also contributes to cancer cell survival by repressing p53-driven apoptosis, a critical pathway for cell death following DNA damage (Höpker2012AATFChe1).

Mutations in AATF, such as a frameshift mutation resulting in a 23 kDa protein, have been identified as oncogenic. This mutant form interacts with proteins like DNMT3B, leading to the down-regulation of tumor suppressor genes through promoter methylation, thereby promoting cancerous states (Sharma2014Oncogenic). In leukemia, AATF overexpression enhances cell survival via the PI3K/Akt pathway (Srinivas2020Emerging).

Beyond cancer, AATF is linked to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, where genetic variants affect thyroid volume and apoptosis regulation (Brčić2020AATF). These findings highlight AATF's significant role in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
AATF (apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in apoptosis regulation and ribosome biogenesis. AATF interacts with Dlk/ZIP kinase through their leucine zipper domains, which is crucial for its role in interfering with apoptosis (Page1999AATF). It also forms a phosphorylation-sensitive complex with MRLC3, a cytoskeletal protein, which is disrupted upon DNA damage, allowing AATF to translocate to the nucleus and modulate p53-driven apoptosis (Höpker2012AATFChe1).

In the context of ribosome biogenesis, AATF is a key component of the AATF-NGDN-NOL10 (ANN) complex, essential for the synthesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This complex is involved in pre-rRNA processing, particularly at the 5 ETS and ITS1 regions, and its disruption leads to defects in ribosomal subunit assembly (Kaiser2020AATFChe1—An; Bammert2016Human). AATF also interacts with ribosomal RNA, showing a preference for pre-ribosomal 45S RNA, and binds near rRNA maturation cleavage sites (Kaiser2020AATFChe1—An).

These interactions highlight AATF's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment due to its involvement in oncogenic pathways (Kaiser2020AATFChe1—An).
