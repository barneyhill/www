# ARHGAP35

## Overview
ARHGAP35 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho GTPase activating protein 35, commonly referred to as p190A RhoGAP. This protein is a member of the Rho GTPase-activating proteins (RhoGAPs) family, which are crucial regulators of the Rho family of small GTPases. These GTPases play significant roles in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. The p190A RhoGAP protein is characterized by its multidomain structure, which includes a GTPase-activating protein domain responsible for its catalytic activity, as well as other domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions. Functionally, p190A RhoGAP is involved in the inactivation of Rho GTPases, thereby influencing pathways such as the Hippo signaling pathway, which is important for contact inhibition and tumor suppression. Mutations in ARHGAP35 have been associated with several diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Frank2018p190; Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs; Reis2022ARHGAP35).

## Structure
The ARHGAP35 gene encodes the p190RhoGAP-A protein, which is a large multidomain protein involved in the regulation of Rho GTPases. The protein is approximately 1500 amino acids long and features a conserved domain structure. It includes a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain at the C-terminus, which is primarily responsible for its catalytic function targeting RhoA (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs).

The N-terminal region contains a pseudoGTPase domain, which adopts a GTPase-like fold but lacks catalytic activity due to divergence in conserved enzymatic residues. This domain is constitutively bound to GTP/Mg2+ and functions as a protein-protein interaction module rather than a catalytic enzyme (Stiegler2018The). The structure of this domain includes unique insert sequences that alter its surface shape and prevent binding to typical GAP, GEF, or effector molecules (Stiegler2018The).

The protein also contains four FF domains, two pseudoGTPase domains (pG1 and pG2), a protrusion localization sequence (PLS), and a polybasic region (PBR) (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a crucial role in regulating its interactions and activity (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs).

## Function
The ARHGAP35 gene encodes the p190A RhoGAP protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating the Rho family of small GTPases. These GTPases are essential for various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, migration, and division. p190A RhoGAP functions as a GTPase-activating protein, promoting the inactivation of Rho GTPases by enhancing their intrinsic GTPase activity, thus switching them from an active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound state (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs).

In healthy human cells, p190A RhoGAP is involved in promoting contact inhibition of cell proliferation (CIP), a process vital for maintaining normal tissue architecture and preventing uncontrolled cell growth. This is achieved through the modulation of the Hippo signaling pathway, where p190A represses the transcriptional activity of YAP, a key effector of the pathway. By activating LATS kinases and inhibiting the Rho-ROCK pathway, p190A prevents the nuclear translocation of YAP, thereby suppressing YAP-TEAD-regulated gene transcription (Frank2018p190).

p190A also plays a role in cytokinesis by localizing to the cleavage furrow and regulating RhoA activity, which is crucial for the completion of cell division (Su2003p190RhoGAP; Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs). Additionally, p190A is involved in neuronal development, influencing actin cytoskeletal rearrangements essential for brain functioning and neuronal morphogenesis (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARHGAP35 gene, which encodes the p190A RhoGAP protein, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and developmental disorders. In cancer, ARHGAP35 is considered a tumor suppressor, with mutations found in several tumor types, including endometrial tumors, lung adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer. These mutations often result in loss of function, affecting the protein's ability to regulate the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for contact inhibition of proliferation and tumor suppression (Ouyang2020p190A; Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs). Specific mutations, such as R997*, lead to a non-functional protein unable to bind active RhoA, contributing to cancer progression (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs).

In developmental disorders, damaging variants in ARHGAP35 have been linked to eye phenotypes such as anophthalmia and microphthalmia, as well as non-ocular anomalies like renal and cardiac defects. These variants are often located at the C-terminus of the protein, suggesting a common mechanism for these disorders (Reis2022ARHGAP35). Alterations in ARHGAP35 expression are also associated with mental health disorders, such as frontotemporal dementia, where its expression is linked to behavioral vulnerability (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs).

## Interactions
ARHGAP35, also known as p190RhoGAP, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the transcription factor TFII-I, sequestering it in the cytoplasm in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, which affects TFII-I's nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. This interaction is significant in regulating VEGFR2 expression and capillary network formation (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs). ARHGAP35 also forms complexes with translation preinitiation factors such as eIF3A, B, C, D, and H, potentially affecting mRNA translation rates (Héraud2019p190RhoGAPs).

ARHGAP35 interacts with p120 RasGAP, a relationship mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation, particularly at Tyr1105, which is targeted by c-Src kinase. This phosphorylation is crucial for the interaction, although some complex formation occurs independently of phosphorylation (Roof1998Phosphotyrosine). The protein also interacts with Blk kinase, which phosphorylates ARHGAP35, inhibiting RhoA activation. This interaction is modulated by the activation state of Gα13 (Bartolomé2014A).

In the context of centrosomal RhoA activation, ARHGAP35 interacts with Polycystin-1 (PC1), suggesting a role in regulating RhoA activity and ciliogenesis (Streets2020Polycystin1).
