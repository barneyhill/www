# CHRNB1

## Overview
The CHRNB1 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor nicotinic beta 1 subunit, which is a critical component of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel. This receptor is predominantly located at neuromuscular junctions, where it facilitates synaptic transmission by allowing ion flow across the cell membrane in response to acetylcholine binding, thereby playing a vital role in muscle contraction and neuromuscular function (Schaaf2014Nicotinic; Zuo2016Associations). The beta 1 subunit, encoded by CHRNB1, is integral to both fetal and adult forms of muscle-type nAChRs, contributing to the receptor's assembly and function (Schaaf2014Nicotinic). Mutations in CHRNB1 are linked to congenital myasthenic syndromes, which manifest as muscle weakness due to impaired neuromuscular transmission, and have been studied in both humans and other species, such as cattle (Agerholm2016A; Freed2020CHRNB1‐associated).

## Structure
The CHRNB1 gene encodes the beta 1 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel. This receptor is composed of homologous subunits with the stoichiometry (α1)2β1δε, where each subunit contains four transmembrane domains: M1, M2, M3, and M4. The M2 domain of each subunit forms the wall of the ion channel, while the intracellular M1-M2 and M3-M4 linkers connect the respective domains (Shen2020A).

The M1-M2 linker in the beta subunit plays a crucial role in channel gating and is structurally positioned to serve as a hinge for the M2 domain, which lines the channel pore. This region is conserved across β subunits from different species and contributes to the receptor's function by affecting ion selectivity and channel gating (Shen2020A).

Mutations in the CHRNB1 gene, such as the βP248L mutation, can lead to altered channel kinetics and reduced surface expression of the receptor. This mutation specifically affects the synaptic response by decreasing the miniature endplate potential decay time and the opening burst duration of the receptor, highlighting the importance of the M1-M2 linker in the beta subunit's function (Shen2020A).

## Function
The CHRNB1 gene encodes the beta 1 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel primarily found in neuromuscular junctions. This receptor plays a crucial role in neuromuscular transmission by facilitating the flow of ions across the cell membrane in response to acetylcholine binding, which is essential for muscle contraction and normal neuromuscular function (Schaaf2014Nicotinic; Zuo2016Associations). 

The nAChRs are composed of five subunits, and the CHRNB1 gene specifically encodes the beta 1 subunit, which is part of both the fetal and adult forms of the muscle-type nAChRs. The fetal form of the receptor is gradually replaced by the adult form during development, indicating a role in the maturation of neuromuscular function (Schaaf2014Nicotinic). 

In healthy human cells, the CHRNB1 subunit contributes to the proper assembly and function of the nAChR complex, ensuring effective synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. This process is vital for the coordination of muscle movements and overall motor function (Schaaf2014Nicotinic; Zuo2016Associations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHRNB1 gene, which encodes the beta 1 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, are associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). These syndromes are characterized by muscle weakness due to impaired neuromuscular transmission. Specific mutations in CHRNB1 can lead to different severities of CMS. For instance, biallelic variants, such as exon deletions and missense mutations, have been linked to significant muscle weakness and conditions like fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) (Freed2020CHRNB1‐associated). 

In some cases, CHRNB1 mutations result in a slow-channel type of CMS, which is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by gain-of-function missense mutations. These mutations lead to prolonged synaptic currents and muscle fatigue (Schaaf2014Nicotinic). Conversely, autosomal recessive mutations in CHRNB1 can cause acetylcholine receptor deficiency, leading to a loss of function and reduced receptor levels at the neuromuscular junction (Schaaf2014Nicotinic).

In cattle, a frameshift mutation in CHRNB1 has been associated with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), a condition characterized by joint contractures and skeletal abnormalities, highlighting the gene's role in neuromuscular development (Agerholm2016A).
