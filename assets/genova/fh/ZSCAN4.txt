# ZSCAN4

## Overview
ZSCAN4 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 4, which is primarily involved in maintaining genomic stability and telomere length. The protein is categorized as a nuclear protein due to its localization and function within the cell nucleus. ZSCAN4 is known for its role in telomere elongation through a telomerase-independent recombination mechanism, which is crucial during cellular reprogramming and early embryonic development (Akiyama2015Transient; Amano2015Correction). It binds to specific DNA motifs, contributing to genomic integrity by stabilizing microsatellite regions (Akiyama2023ZSCAN4binding). Additionally, ZSCAN4 interacts with various proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair, highlighting its multifaceted role in chromatin regulation and genome stability (Storm2014Zscan4; Tsai2023ZSCAN4). The gene's expression is context-dependent, acting as a tumor suppressor in some cancers while promoting oncogenic processes in others (He2023Low; Portney2020ZSCAN4).

## Function
ZSCAN4 is a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and telomere length in human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA motifs, particularly the TGCACAC motif enriched in CA/TG microsatellites, which are associated with genomic structures rather than specific gene functions (Akiyama2023ZSCAN4binding). This binding is thought to contribute to the maintenance of genomic integrity by stabilizing these microsatellite regions, which can form unstable Z-DNA structures that may lead to DNA breaks and mutations (Akiyama2023ZSCAN4binding).

ZSCAN4 is involved in telomere elongation through a telomerase-independent recombination mechanism, which is crucial for maintaining chromosomal stability (Amano2015Correction). This process is particularly important during cellular reprogramming and early embryonic development, where ZSCAN4 expression is transient and associated with chromatin changes that facilitate DNA repair and telomere maintenance (Cheng2020The; Akiyama2015Transient).

In addition to its role in telomere maintenance, ZSCAN4 interacts with chromatin repressors, suggesting its involvement in chromatin regulation and repression, which further supports its function in maintaining genome stability (Akiyama2023ZSCAN4binding).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZSCAN4 gene have been linked to various cancers. In urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the upper urinary tract and urinary bladder, low expression of ZSCAN4 is associated with advanced disease status and aggressive pathological parameters, such as high histological grade and vascular invasion. It is identified as a tumor suppressor in UC, with low expression serving as an independent negative prognostic factor for disease-specific survival and metastasis-free survival (He2023Low). 

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ZSCAN4 plays an oncogenic role by facilitating chromatin remodeling and promoting the cancer stem cell phenotype. Its expression is linked to increased cancer stem cell frequency and tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in HNSCC (Portney2020ZSCAN4).

ZSCAN4 is also implicated in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in stromal cells, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. Its expression is correlated with the activation of DNA damage response factors and may influence therapy resistance and tumor metastasis (Zhang2018The). These findings highlight the complex role of ZSCAN4 in cancer biology, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the context.

## Interactions
ZSCAN4 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair processes. In mouse embryonic stem cells, ZSCAN4 forms complexes with transcriptional repressors LSD1 and CtBP2, which are part of the CoREST-CtBP repressor complex. This interaction suggests ZSCAN4's involvement in transcriptional repression and possibly epigenetic regulation or chromatin remodeling (Storm2014Zscan4). ZSCAN4 also interacts with PARP1, a protein involved in DNA repair, to promote homologous recombination and reduce double-strand breaks (DSBs). This interaction is crucial for ZSCAN4's role in DNA repair, as inhibiting PARP1 negates the DSB-reduction benefits associated with ZSCAN4 (Tsai2023ZSCAN4).

ZSCAN4f, a member of the ZSCAN4 family, interacts with Tet2, a dioxygenase involved in DNA demethylation. This interaction is essential for reprogramming fibroblasts to pluripotency, as it enhances proteasome activity and promotes the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, a critical step in induced pluripotent stem cell generation (Cheng2020The). The ZSCAN4-Tet2 complex recruits Tet2 to specific promoter regions, leading to changes in DNA methylation and increased expression of proteasome subunits (Cheng2020The).
