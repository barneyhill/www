# IFNA4

## Overview
The IFNA4 gene encodes the protein interferon alpha 4, a member of the type I interferon family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system's response to viral infections. As a cytokine, interferon alpha 4 is involved in the activation of antiviral defense mechanisms by binding to specific receptors and initiating signaling pathways that lead to the expression of numerous antiviral genes (Savan2014PostTranscriptional). The gene is rapidly induced in response to viral infections, functioning as an immediate-early response gene that does not require ongoing protein synthesis for activation (Feng2013Bioinformatics). The regulation of IFNA4 involves complex interactions with transcriptional repressors and the 3D chromatin structure, influencing its expression in a cell-type specific manner (Feng2013Bioinformatics). Mutations in IFNA4 have been linked to diseases such as Crohn's disease and systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting its significance in both antiviral defense and autoimmune disease pathogenesis (Xiao2015Exome; Feng2013Bioinformatics).

## Function
The IFNA4 gene encodes a type I interferon protein, which plays a crucial role in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. In healthy human cells, IFNA4 is involved in the transcriptional activation of interferon genes, such as IFNA and IFNB, through the action of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). IRF-3 is a transcription factor that, upon activation by phosphorylation in virus-infected cells, enhances the transcription of IFNA4, leading to increased interferon synthesis and an antiviral state (Juang1998Primary).

The IFNA4 protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, where it binds to specific receptors to initiate signaling pathways. These pathways induce the expression of hundreds of antiviral genes, establishing an antiviral state and modulating immune system activity (Savan2014PostTranscriptional). The IFNA4 gene is rapidly induced in response to viral infections, acting as an immediate-early response gene, which does not require ongoing protein synthesis for its activation (Feng2013Bioinformatics).

Additionally, the regulation of IFNA4 involves complex interactions with transcriptional repressors like CTCF, which can influence the 3D structure of chromatin and suppress gene expression in a cell-type specific manner (Feng2013Bioinformatics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IFNA4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly Crohn's disease (CD). Novel compound heterozygous mutations in IFNA4, along with IFNA10, have been identified as contributing to impaired function in CD patients. These mutations are associated with increased susceptibility to CD, especially in the Chinese population, and may influence treatment outcomes (Xiao2015Exome). The study found that serum levels of IFNA4 were elevated in CD patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a link between IFNA4 expression and the disease. The increased levels were more pronounced in individuals carrying the variant allele, indicating that these mutations might affect the immune response and inflammation regulation in CD (Xiao2015Exome).

In addition to CD, IFNA4 is part of the type I interferon family, which plays a role in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The gene is involved in the type I IFN response, which is relevant to the pathogenesis of autoimmune conditions (Feng2013Bioinformatics). Alterations in IFNA4 expression or function can also influence susceptibility to viral infections and cancer progression, as the gene is involved in antiviral responses and immune system modulation (Padariya2021Functional).

## Interactions
The IFNA4 gene promoter interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in the immune response to viral infections. The virus-induced factor (VIF), a multiprotein complex that includes the transcription factor IRF-3, interacts with the IFNA4 promoter. VIF is detected in the nucleus shortly after viral infection and is distinct from other virus-activated complexes containing IRF-3, such as those with CREB binding protein (CBP) or p300 (Morin2002The). 

The IFNA4 promoter contains several virus-responsive modules (A, B, C, and D), with the C module being particularly critical for IRF-3-mediated transcription. IRF-3 binds to these modules, forming complexes of varying stoichiometry, and its binding affinity is higher for the ISRE-ISG15 probe compared to the B module (Morin2002The). 

Additionally, the induction of the IFNA4 gene involves the formation of a complex known as aF1/B, composed of at least two DNA-binding proteins of 68 and 96 kDa. This complex is associated with the induction of the IFNA4 promoter and requires cooperation between aF1 binding proteins and IRF-1 (Au1993Virusmediated).
