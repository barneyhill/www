# BICRAL

## Overview
BICRAL is a gene that encodes the BICRA like chromatin remodeling complex associated protein, which is a crucial component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its role in modifying chromatin structure, thereby influencing processes such as transcription, replication, and DNA repair. As a part of the GBAF subcomplex, BICRAL contributes to the dynamic regulation of chromatin accessibility, which is essential for cellular differentiation and development. The protein's function is particularly significant in embryonic development, as evidenced by knockout studies in mice that result in embryonic lethality, highlighting its essential role in maintaining chromatin integrity (Alpsoy2018Glioma). BICRAL's involvement in various cellular processes underscores its importance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Steensma2023Identification; Valencia2023Landscape).

## Function
BICRAL, also known as BICRA like chromatin remodeling complex associated protein, plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling, a process essential for regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. BICRAL is a component of the GBAF complex, a subcomplex of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which is distinct in its composition and function. This complex is involved in maintaining chromatin accessibility, thereby influencing transcription, replication, and repair processes within the cell (Alpsoy2018Glioma; Schick2019Systematic).

BICRAL can incorporate into the GBAF complex, replacing its paralog GLTSCR1, and altering the stoichiometry of the SWI/SNF complex. This incorporation affects the association of other subunits such as BRG1 and BRD9, highlighting its role in defining the composition and function of the GBAF complex (Alpsoy2018Glioma). BICRAL is active in the nucleus, where it influences cellular differentiation and development, as evidenced by its critical role in embryonic development, with knockout studies in mice resulting in an embryonic lethal phenotype (Alpsoy2018Glioma). This suggests that BICRAL is essential for maintaining the integrity of chromatin structure and function, impacting various cellular and organismal processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BICRAL gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders and congenital conditions. BICRAL is a component of the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a critical role in neural development and the regulation of embryonic development. Alterations in BICRAL have been linked to Coffin-Siris Syndrome 3, a condition characterized by congenital malformations, feeding difficulties, and poor growth (Steensma2023Identification). Additionally, BICRAL is implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, Kleefstra's syndrome spectrum, Hirschsprung's disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia (RosaFernandes2022Global).

BICRAL mutations are more frequently observed in cancer than in neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating its significant role in oncogenesis (Valencia2023Landscape). The gene's involvement in chromatin remodeling complexes suggests that its mutations can lead to disruptions in chromatin structure, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to the Zika virus has been shown to downregulate BICRAL expression, potentially affecting neurological development and ocular health in infants (RosaFernandes2022Global). These findings underscore the clinical significance of BICRAL in both developmental and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
BICRAL, also known as BICRA like chromatin remodeling complex associated protein, is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. This complex plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. BICRAL interacts with other proteins within this complex, facilitating its function in chromatin remodeling. The SWI/SNF complex is known for its ability to alter nucleosome positioning, thereby influencing the accessibility of transcription factors to DNA and regulating transcriptional activity. BICRAL's involvement in this complex suggests it may have a role in modulating these processes.

In addition to its interactions within the SWI/SNF complex, BICRAL may also engage with nucleic acids. This interaction could potentially influence transcriptional activity, although the specific mechanisms and effects of these interactions are not fully detailed in the available context. The ability of BICRAL to interact with both proteins and nucleic acids highlights its potential versatility in regulating gene expression and chromatin dynamics. These interactions underscore the importance of BICRAL in maintaining proper cellular function through its role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation.
