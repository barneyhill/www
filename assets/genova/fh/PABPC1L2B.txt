# PABPC1L2B

## Overview
PABPC1L2B is a gene that encodes the protein poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 like 2B, which is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation. This protein is part of the poly(A) binding protein family, which plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional control of gene expression by binding to the polyadenylate tail of mRNA molecules. The interaction of poly(A) binding proteins with mRNA is essential for various cellular processes, including mRNA stabilization, translation initiation, and the regulation of mRNA decay. The specific functions and interactions of PABPC1L2B in cellular pathways are still under investigation, but its role in mRNA metabolism suggests it may be significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
