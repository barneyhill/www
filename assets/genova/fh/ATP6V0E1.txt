# ATP6V0E1

## Overview
ATP6V0E1 is a gene that encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit e1, a component of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This protein is integral to the V0 domain of the V-ATPase, a transmembrane proton pump responsible for acidifying intracellular organelles in eukaryotic cells. The acidification process facilitated by the V-ATPase is essential for various cellular functions, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. ATP6V0E1 is particularly significant in pancreatic β-cells, where it influences lysosomal acidity and insulin secretion, and in ameloblasts during enamel formation, where it aids in the maturation of enamel by supporting hydroxyapatite crystal formation (Mo2023Identifying; Sarkar2016Vtype). Despite its critical role in cellular physiology, the specific interactions of ATP6V0E1 within the V-ATPase complex and with other proteins remain to be fully characterized (BlakePalmer2007Molecular).

## Function
ATP6V0E1 encodes a subunit of the V0 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is essential for the acidification of intracellular organelles in eukaryotic cells. This acidification is crucial for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. The V-ATPase complex, including ATP6V0E1, is primarily active in the membranes of organelles such as lysosomes and endosomes, where it helps maintain the acidic environment necessary for lysosomal function and autophagic flux (Mo2023Identifying; Sarkar2016Vtype).

In pancreatic β-cells, ATP6V0E1 plays a role in regulating lysosomal acidity, which is important for maintaining autophagic flux and insulin secretion. The gene is positively associated with the pancreatic secretion pathway and lysosome function, indicating its regulatory role in insulin secretion (Mo2023Identifying). Additionally, ATP6V0E1 is involved in the acidification process during enamel formation, particularly in ameloblasts, where it contributes to the maturation of enamel by facilitating the removal of the organic enamel matrix and supporting hydroxyapatite crystal formation (Sarkar2016Vtype).

## Interactions
ATP6V0E1 is a subunit of the V0 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which plays a crucial role in acidifying intracellular compartments. While specific interactions of ATP6V0E1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, it is known to be part of the larger V-ATPase complex, which includes multiple subunits such as ATP6V1A, ATP6V1B1, and ATP6V0A4, among others (Merkulova2015Mapping). The V-ATPase complex is involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and intracellular signaling (Merkulova2015Mapping).

In the context of insulinoma, ATP6V0E1 has been associated with increased activity in the pancreatic secretion pathway and lysosome function, which are important for insulin secretion and islet cell degradation (Mo2023Identifying). However, specific protein or nucleic acid interactions involving ATP6V0E1 in this context are not detailed.

The study by Blake-Palmer et al. highlights the essential role of the e-subunit, including ATP6V0E1, in the function of the V-ATPase complex, which is crucial for proton transport across membranes (BlakePalmer2007Molecular). Despite its importance, direct interactions of ATP6V0E1 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
