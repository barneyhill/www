# IMP3

## Overview
IMP3, or insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3, is a gene that encodes a multidomain RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA processing, localization, translation, and stability. The protein, also known as IMP U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein 3, is characterized by its six RNA-binding domains, which include two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and four hnRNP K-homology (KH) domains, allowing it to interact with specific RNA sequences (Jia2018Structural; Schneider2019Combinatorial). IMP3 is predominantly expressed during embryogenesis and plays a crucial role in regulating mRNA stability and translation, particularly by binding to the 5' untranslated region of IGF-II leader 3 mRNA, thereby modulating fetal growth factor biosynthesis (Degrauwe2016IMPs:; Nielsen1999A). In addition to its developmental functions, IMP3 is implicated in oncogenesis, as its overexpression is associated with various malignancies, serving as a prognostic marker for aggressive cancer phenotypes (Li2009IMP3; Yan2015IMP3).

## Structure
IMP3, also known as IMP U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein 3, is a multidomain RNA-binding protein characterized by its complex molecular structure. It contains six RNA-binding domains: two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and four hnRNP K-homology (KH) domains (Schneider2019Combinatorial). The RRM1-2 domains form a tandem structure, with RRM1 involved in RNA binding, while RRM2's RNA-binding site is occluded by RRM1 (Jia2018Structural). The KH domains are organized into two tandem pairs, KH1-2 and KH3-4, which act as prearranged RNA-binding modules (Schneider2019Combinatorial).

The primary structure of IMP3 includes specific sequence motifs that confer its RNA-binding specificity, with KH1 favoring the GGC motif and KH2 the CA motif (Schneider2019Combinatorial). The secondary structure of the RRM domains is characterized by a β1α1β2β3α2β4 topology, with two α-helices packed against an anti-parallel four-stranded β-sheet (Jia2018Structural). The tertiary structure of the RRM1-2 tandem domain is compact, stabilized by an interface of approximately 700 Å² of buried surface area (Jia2018Structural).

IMP3's quaternary structure involves the cooperative interaction of its domains, with the KH1-2 domains showing cooperative binding when both RNA motifs are present (Schneider2019Combinatorial). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in RNA processing and regulation.

## Function
IMP3, also known as insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3, is a member of the IMP family of RNA-binding proteins, which includes IMP1 and IMP2. These proteins are primarily expressed during embryogenesis and play significant roles in RNA processing, including localization, translation, and stability (Degrauwe2016IMPs:). IMP3 is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation by binding to specific RNA sequences, often recognizing sequences with the consensus element 5'-CAUH-3' (Degrauwe2016IMPs:). 

In healthy human cells, IMP3 is expressed during early stages of embryogenesis, particularly in developing epithelia, muscle, and placenta, but its expression is low or undetectable in most adult tissues (Jiang2006Analysis). IMP3 binds to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of IGF-II leader 3 mRNA, resulting in translational repression, which is crucial for controlling IGF-II biosynthesis, a major fetal growth factor (Nielsen1999A). 

IMP3 also plays a role in protecting mRNAs from miRNA-mediated silencing by sequestering them into cytoplasmic granules, acting as 'cytoplasmic safe houses' for oncogenes and stemness maintenance genes (Degrauwe2016IMPs:). This function is essential for maintaining stem cell populations and regulating mRNA stability and localization during development (Degrauwe2016IMPs:).

## Clinical Significance
IMP3, an RNA-binding protein, is significantly overexpressed in various malignancies, including colon cancer, renal-cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. In colon cancer, IMP3 is overexpressed in 65% of primary tumors and is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, correlating with disease progression and poor prognosis (Li2009IMP3). In renal-cell carcinoma, IMP3 expression is a strong independent predictor of metastasis and reduced survival, with higher expression in metastatic tumors (Jiang2006Analysis). 

In lung adenocarcinoma, IMP3 is expressed in 41.1% of cases and is linked to higher histological grades and advanced stages, serving as an independent predictor of poor prognosis (Yan2015IMP3). IMP3 expression in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms is associated with decreased survival and poor clinical outcomes, indicating its role in tumor invasion and metastasis (Er2017Expression). 

Overall, IMP3 serves as a prognostic marker in several cancers, with its overexpression indicating a higher risk of metastasis and recurrence, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
IMP3, also known as IMP U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein 3, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a ternary complex with the proteins hImp4 and hMpp10, which is essential for its association with the U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) in ribonucleoprotein complexes. This complex is involved in the early cleavage steps of pre-rRNA processing, crucial for ribosome biogenesis. The ternary complex sediments at 60-80S in glycerol gradients, indicating its association with larger U3 snoRNA-containing complexes rather than smaller ones (Granneman2003The).

IMP3 also interacts with circular RNAs (circRNAs) in mammalian cells, forming distinct circRNA-protein complexes. It specifically associates with circRNAs such as NFATC3 and ANKRD17, with the binding attributed to C/A-rich motifs. These interactions are facilitated by the RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) and KH domains of IMP3, which may involve different cofactors and result in various enriched motifs (Schneider2016CircRNAprotein).

The structural basis of IMP3's RNA interactions involves its RRM12 domain, which recognizes short RNA sequences, particularly those containing pyrimidine nucleotides. This domain's RNA-binding interface is primarily comprised of residues within RRM1, which is involved in recognizing central nucleotides (Jia2018Structural).
