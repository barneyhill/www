# ACOX1

## Overview
ACOX1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA oxidase 1, a crucial component of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway. This enzyme is classified as an oxidase and plays a pivotal role in the catabolism of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) within peroxisomes, distinguishing its function from mitochondrial beta-oxidation, which primarily processes medium and long-chain fatty acids. The ACOX1 protein functions as a homodimer and is essential for maintaining lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis. Mutations in the ACOX1 gene can lead to metabolic disorders, including peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency and Mitchell syndrome, which are characterized by neurological impairments and other systemic symptoms (Raas2024Generation; Ferdinandusse2007Clinical; Vluggens2010Functional).

## Structure
The ACOX1 protein is a peroxisomal enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids. It functions as a homodimer, with each subunit having a molecular weight of approximately 72 kDa, which is cleaved into 51-kDa and 21-kDa subunits upon import into the peroxisome (Ferdinandusse2007Clinical). The protein contains an FAD-binding domain, crucial for its enzymatic activity, and the FAD cofactor is bound at the dimer interface (Zhang2016Structural). The active site includes a catalytic glutamate residue, which is essential for its function (Zhang2016Structural).

ACOX1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as succinylation, which influences its dimerization and activity. SIRT5, a desuccinylase, negatively regulates ACOX1 by impairing its dimer formation (Chen2018SIRT5). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing of exon 3, which produce two isoforms with different substrate specificities: SCOX-exon 3I and SCOX-exon 3II (Ferdinandusse2007Clinical).

Mutations in ACOX1 can affect its structure and function, leading to peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency, characterized by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids and associated clinical symptoms (Ferdinandusse2007Clinical).

## Function
The ACOX1 gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA oxidase 1, which is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway. This enzyme is crucial for the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in peroxisomes, a process distinct from mitochondrial beta-oxidation that primarily handles medium and long-chain fatty acids (Fan1996Hepatocellular; Vluggens2010Functional). ACOX1 catalyzes the initial step in the degradation of VLCFAs by converting acyl-CoA to trans-2-enoyl-CoA, transferring electrons to molecular oxygen, and producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Chen2018SIRT5; Varanasi1994Isolation).

In healthy human cells, ACOX1 plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, which is essential for maintaining normal cellular function, including neuronal development and synaptic plasticity (Chung2020Loss). The enzyme's activity is vital for preventing the accumulation of VLCFAs, which can lead to metabolic disorders and severe neurological defects (Chung2020Loss; Vluggens2010Functional). ACOX1 is also involved in liver metabolism, interacting with nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), which regulate genes related to lipid metabolism (Vluggens2010Functional). Proper functioning of ACOX1 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism (Lu2024Liver).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACOX1 gene are linked to several neurological disorders. ACOX1 deficiency, also known as pseudo-neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe neurological symptoms such as infantile-onset hypotonia, seizures, and progressive degeneration of white and gray matter. This condition is marked by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) due to impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation, leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Affected individuals often experience developmental delays and have a reduced life expectancy, with many not surviving past early childhood (Raas2019A; Wang2014Effects).

A distinct gain-of-function mutation in ACOX1, specifically the N237S mutation, is associated with Mitchell syndrome. This condition is characterized by leukodystrophy, seizures, and hearing loss, and is linked to increased oxidative stress and glial damage rather than VLCFA accumulation. The mutation results in a stabilized active ACOX1 dimer, leading to dysregulated enzymatic activity and neuroinflammatory insults (Chung2020Loss; Raas2024Generation).

These mutations highlight the critical role of ACOX1 in maintaining neurological health and underscore the diverse mechanisms through which its dysfunction can lead to disease (Chung2020Loss; Raas2024Generation).

## Interactions
ACOX1 interacts with several proteins that influence its function and stability. It forms a homo-dimer in its native state, and this dimerization is inhibited by the peroxisomal import receptor PEX5, which binds to the monomeric form of ACOX1 to facilitate its import into peroxisomes (Freitas2015The). ACOX1 also interacts with DUSP14, which promotes its degradation through a ubiquitination-dependent mechanism. This interaction involves the N-terminal domain of ACOX1 and the C-terminal domain of DUSP14, leading to K48-linked ubiquitination at lysine 643, a process that affects ACOX1 stability and function in colorectal cancer (Zhang2023Reprogramming).

ACOX1 is regulated by SIRT5, which modulates its activity through succinylation. SIRT5-dependent desuccinylation impairs ACOX1 dimer formation, thereby negatively regulating its activity. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in various cell types (Chen2018SIRT5). Additionally, ACOX1 interacts with the Enterovirus 71 (EV71) 3D protein, which leads to the downregulation of ACOX1 protein levels via the proteasome pathway, impacting peroxisome biogenesis (You2020Enterovirus). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving ACOX1 and its role in cellular metabolism and disease progression.
