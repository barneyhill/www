# ANKRD28

## Overview
ANKRD28 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 28 protein, which is characterized by the presence of multiple ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are integral to the protein's role in facilitating protein-protein interactions, particularly within the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex. As a scaffolding protein, ankyrin repeat domain 28 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell migration, focal adhesion formation, and signal transduction pathways. It plays a crucial role in the dephosphorylation processes that regulate NF-κB signaling, thereby influencing inflammation and immune responses. Additionally, the protein interacts with the tumor suppressor BRCA1, suggesting its involvement in DNA damage repair pathways. ANKRD28's interactions with other proteins, such as Rab40c, further highlight its significance in cellular dynamics and cancer progression (Han2021Rab40c; Vincent2016BRCA1; Stefansson2008Protein).

## Structure
ANKRD28 is a protein characterized by the presence of multiple ankyrin repeat motifs, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These motifs contribute to the primary structure of ANKRD28, consisting of a sequence of amino acids that form these repeats (Vincent2016BRCA1). The secondary structure of ankyrin repeats typically includes alpha helices, which contribute to the protein's stability and interaction capabilities. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these repeats into a stable conformation, often forming a solenoid-like shape, which is common in proteins with ankyrin repeats.

ANKRD28 functions as a scaffolding protein within the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. It is involved in the regulation of cell migration and focal adhesion formation, as it localizes in the cytosol and at the lamellipodia, where it colocalizes with actin ruffles (Han2022Rab40c). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitylation, which targets it for lysosomal degradation, thereby regulating its activity and stability within the cell (Han2022Rab40c). The specific details of ANKRD28's quaternary structure, if applicable, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ANKRD28 (ankyrin repeat domain 28) is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes through its involvement in signal transduction pathways. It is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), a complex involved in dephosphorylation processes that regulate cellular signaling pathways. ANKRD28 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with PP6 to influence the dephosphorylation of IκBε, a protein that regulates NF-κB signaling. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing IκBε and negatively regulating NF-κB signaling, which is important for controlling inflammation and immune responses (Ohama2019The; Vincent2016BRCA1).

ANKRD28 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein BRCA1, suggesting a role in DNA damage repair pathways. This interaction may contribute to the regulation of NF-κB transcriptional activity and affect the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic gene expression (Vincent2016BRCA1). Additionally, ANKRD28 is involved in the regulation of focal adhesions and cell migration, impacting the dynamics of focal adhesion turnover and the Hippo signaling pathway, which are essential for cell mechanics and migration (Han2021Rab40c).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD28 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling and regulation. In hematological malignancies, a fusion of ANKRD28 with the NUP98 gene has been identified in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This fusion results from a cryptic 3-way translocation t(3;5;11) and is associated with leukemogenesis, as the ANKRD28-NUP98 fusion protein exhibits transforming activity in cells (Ishikawa2007A).

In germinal center B-cell type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL), ANKRD28 is associated with super enhancers, and its expression is crucial for cell proliferation. Knockdown of ANKRD28 inhibits cell growth, suggesting its role in cancer progression. The BET inhibitor JQ1 can suppress ANKRD28 expression, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2021Identification).

ANKRD28 also interacts with Rab40c in regulating focal adhesions and cell migration, particularly in cancer cells. Rab40c mediates the ubiquitylation and degradation of ANKRD28, affecting focal adhesion dynamics and the Hippo signaling pathway, which are critical in cancer cell migration (Han2021Rab40c).

## Interactions
ANKRD28 is known to interact with several proteins, forming part of multiprotein complexes that influence various cellular processes. It specifically interacts with protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) and its regulatory subunits, PP6R1 and PP6R3, through its ankyrin repeat domains. This interaction is crucial for the regulatory role of PP6 in cellular processes, particularly in limiting NF-κB signaling (Stefansson2008Protein). ANKRD28 does not interact with other phosphatases like PP2A or PP4, highlighting its specificity for PP6 (Stefansson2008Protein).

ANKRD28 also interacts with the BRCA1 protein, a tumor suppressor involved in various nuclear and cytoplasmic processes. This interaction occurs primarily in the cytoplasm and is important for modulating PP6 signaling, which contributes to BRCA1's tumor-suppressor function (Vincent2016BRCA1). The interaction between ANKRD28 and BRCA1 is primarily observed in the cytoplasm, and BRCA1 does not affect ANKRD28's interaction with PP6R1 (Vincent2016BRCA1).

Rab40c, a small monomeric GTPase, interacts with ANKRD28 as part of the CRL5 complex, mediating its ubiquitylation and degradation. This interaction is crucial for regulating the activity of the PP6 complex and involves the formation of a Cul5-based ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (Han2021Rab40c).
