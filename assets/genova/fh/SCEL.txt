# SCEL

## Overview
The SCEL gene encodes the protein sciellin, which is primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of the cornified envelope in keratinocytes, a critical component of the skin's barrier function. Sciellin is characterized by a proline-rich N-terminal domain, a central repeat region, and a carboxy-terminal LIM domain, which facilitate its role in protein interactions and structural organization within epithelial tissues (Baden2005Targeted). Unlike other major cornified envelope proteins, sciellin is not located in the epidermal differentiation complex, indicating a unique functional niche (Baden2005Targeted). Beyond its structural role, sciellin interacts with key signaling proteins, such as TNFR1 and EGFR, influencing cellular processes like apoptosis and tumor progression (Chan2023SCEL; Li2020Sciellin). Alterations in SCEL expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including triple-negative breast cancer and Kallmann syndrome, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Zhu2019Identification; Chan2023SCEL).

## Structure
Sciellin (SCEL) is a protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope in keratinocytes. It is characterized by a unique proline-rich N-terminal domain, a central repeat region, and a carboxy-terminal LIM domain, which is important for protein interaction (Baden2005Targeted). The central repeat region is speculated to have a beta helix structure, potentially acting as a rigid girder (Baden2005Targeted). The LIM domain may interact with the cytoskeleton and play roles in cell adhesiveness, signaling, and shape (Baden2005Targeted).

Sciellin is distinct from other major substrates of the cornified envelope, such as involucrin and loricrin, as it is not located in the epidermal differentiation complex (Baden2005Targeted). It is expressed in various tissues, including the epidermis, hair follicles, and nails, and is not associated with other genes encoding envelope components (Baden2005Targeted). Sciellin may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and can have splice variant isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of mRNA. The presence of sciellin in tissues without cornified envelopes, such as the brain's ependyma and the placenta's amnion, suggests it may have roles beyond structural support (Baden2005Targeted).

## Function
Sciellin (SCEL) is a protein that plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of the cornified envelope in epithelial cells, which is crucial for the skin's barrier function. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, contributing to keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal integrity. SCEL is involved in cross-linking with other proteins, enhancing the structural resilience of the cornified envelope, which is essential for the physical barrier of the epidermis and stratified squamous epithelia (Baden2005Targeted).

The protein contains a unique proline-rich N-terminal domain, a central repeat region, and a carboxy-terminal LIM domain, which is important for protein interaction. This suggests a role in protein organization within the epidermis (Baden2005Targeted). Despite its involvement in these processes, studies on sciellin null mice have shown that the absence of SCEL does not result in structural anomalies or decreased barrier function, indicating that its role might be more complex and not solely as a backup component (Baden2005Targeted). The precise role of SCEL in healthy human cells remains not fully established, but it is suggested to have functions beyond just structural support in epithelial tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SCEL gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high SCEL expression is associated with poor survival outcomes, including overall survival, progression-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival. SCEL is notably overexpressed in TNBC tissues compared to non-TNBC tissues and is linked to late-stage TNBC. It plays a crucial role in the metastatic colonization of TNBC cells in the lungs by enhancing pro-survival signaling pathways, such as the TNF-α/TNFR1/NF-κB/c-FLIP axis, and promoting cell proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis (Chan2023SCEL).

In Kallmann syndrome (KS), a congenital condition characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia, a chromosomal translocation involving the SCEL gene has been identified. This translocation results in reduced expression levels of SCEL and is associated with the genetic heterogeneity of KS. Although SCEL's precise role in KS is not fully established, its expression in the basement membrane of the third ventricle suggests a potential involvement in the migration and differentiation of GnRH neurons, which are crucial for normal olfactory and reproductive development (Zhu2019Identification).

## Interactions
Sciellin (SCEL) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of the key interactions of SCEL is with Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 (TNFR1). SCEL binds directly to TNFR1, promoting its stability and preventing its degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining TNFR1 stability, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Chan2023SCEL). The stabilization of TNFR1 by SCEL is important for regulating the balance between pro-survival and apoptotic pathways in cells, particularly in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Chan2023SCEL).

In gallbladder cancer, SCEL interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), stabilizing its protein expression. This interaction does not affect EGFR mRNA levels but prevents its proteasomal degradation, thereby promoting tumor cell growth through the activation of the PI3K/Akt1 signaling pathway (Li2020Sciellin). These interactions highlight SCEL's role in modulating key signaling pathways by stabilizing receptor proteins, which can influence cancer progression and metastasis.
