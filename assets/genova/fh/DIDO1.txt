# DIDO1

## Overview
The DIDO1 gene, located on chromosome 20q, encodes the death inducer-obliterator 1 protein, which plays a crucial role in apoptosis, genomic stability, and transcription regulation. The gene produces multiple isoforms, including DIDO1, DIDO2, and DIDO3, each with distinct structural and functional properties. DIDO1 is primarily involved in apoptosis, translocating to the nucleus to regulate caspase activity, while DIDO3 is essential for mRNA processing and transcription termination, interacting with splicing factors and RNA polymerase II. Additionally, the gene gives rise to a circular RNA, circDIDO1, which encodes a novel protein, DIDO1-529aa, that interacts with key proteins such as PARP1 and PRDX2, influencing cancer-related pathways. Alterations in DIDO1 expression are linked to various malignancies, including myeloid neoplasms and gastric cancer, underscoring its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Benedum2023The; Zhang2021CircDIDO1; Fütterer2005Dido).

## Structure
The DIDO1 gene encodes multiple protein isoforms, including DIDO1, DIDO2, and DIDO3, each with distinct structural features. The DIDO1 isoform is the smallest and contains only the Plant Homeodomain (PHD) domain, which specifically recognizes the H3K4me3 mark, a feature associated with active transcription (Benedum2023The). This isoform lacks the SPOC domain and TFIIS-like domain (TLD) present in the longer DIDO3 isoform (Benedum2023The).

DIDO3, the longest isoform, shares domain architecture with PHF3, including the PHD, TLD, and SPOC domains. The SPOC domain is crucial for interacting with phosphorylated serine-2 in the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, playing a significant role in transcription elongation (Benedum2023The). The C-terminal region of DIDO3 is intrinsically disordered and contributes to the formation of condensates that regulate transcriptional output by sequestering RNA polymerase II (Benedum2023The).

The DIDO1 gene also gives rise to a circular RNA, circDIDO1, which encodes a novel protein, DIDO1-529aa. This protein shares a similar sequence with the DIDO1 isoform but lacks the nuclear export sequence, resulting in its nuclear localization (Zhang2021CircDIDO1). The DIDO1-529aa protein interacts with PARP1, inhibiting its DNA repair activity, and promotes the degradation of PRDX2, impacting cancer-related pathways (Zhang2021CircDIDO1).

## Function
The DIDO1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in apoptosis and genomic stability. In healthy human cells, DIDO1 is involved in regulating apoptosis by translocating from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it induces caspase levels and activity upon apoptosis induction (Zhang2021CircDIDO1; SillarsHardebol2012CSE1L). This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation.

DIDO1 is also implicated in mRNA processing, particularly through its principal isoform, DIDO3. DIDO3 is a nuclear protein essential for accurate mRNA splicing and transcription termination, interacting with splicing factors such as SFPQ and RNA/DNA helicase DHX9 (Gutiérrez2022Hepatitis). These interactions are vital for the proper expression of vertebrate genes, and any malfunction can lead to gene misexpression and disease (Gutiérrez2022Hepatitis).

Additionally, DIDO1 is involved in chromatin remodeling, influencing gene expression and cellular differentiation. It interacts with chromatin, recognizing accessible regions marked by H3K4me3 histone marks, and is associated with enhancer sequences, suggesting a role in regulating gene networks, particularly in B cell differentiation (Gutiérrez2021The). These functions highlight the importance of DIDO1 in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DIDO1 gene are implicated in several hematological and solid tumor malignancies. In myeloid neoplasms, particularly myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPDs), a significant reduction in DIDO1 expression is observed. Studies have shown that 100% of MDS/MPD patients exhibit abnormalities in DIDO1 expression, suggesting its role as a potential tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 20q, a region often deleted in these malignancies (Fütterer2005Dido). 

In gastric cancer, circDIDO1, a circular RNA derived from the DIDO1 gene, acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is associated with larger tumor size, distal metastasis, and poor prognosis. CircDIDO1 inhibits gastric cancer progression by encoding a novel protein, DIDO1-529aa, which interacts with and inhibits PARP1 activity, and by promoting the degradation of PRDX2 protein (Zhang2021CircDIDO1).

DIDO1 gene alterations also affect mRNA processing, as seen in DIDO3-deficient mice, leading to conditions such as hepatitis, testicular degeneration, and ataxia. These deficiencies result from systemic alterations in mRNA splicing and transcriptional readthrough, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining normal cellular functions (Gutiérrez2022Hepatitis).

## Interactions
DIDO1, a gene involved in apoptosis and transcription regulation, encodes a protein that participates in several significant interactions within the cell. One of the key interactions involves the circular RNA circDIDO1, derived from the DIDO1 gene, which encodes a novel protein, DIDO1-529aa. This protein interacts with poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1), inhibiting its activity. PARP1 is crucial for DNA repair, and its inhibition by DIDO1-529aa can lead to increased apoptosis in gastric cancer cells (Zhang2021CircDIDO1).

DIDO1-529aa also interacts with peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), promoting its degradation through ubiquitin-mediated pathways. This interaction affects several cancer-related signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, MAPK, and PI3k/Akt, which are regulated by PRDX2. The degradation of PRDX2 by circDIDO1 suggests a tumor suppressor role for DIDO1 in gastric cancer (Zhang2021CircDIDO1).

These interactions highlight the role of DIDO1 in regulating protein stability and activity, contributing to its function as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. The interactions with PARP1 and PRDX2 are crucial for its role in inhibiting cancer progression (Zhang2021CircDIDO1).
