# ATL1

## Overview
The ATL1 gene encodes the protein atlastin GTPase 1, a member of the dynamin-like GTPase family, which plays a pivotal role in the homotypic fusion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. This protein is integral to maintaining the morphology of the ER, facilitating the formation of its tubular network, which is essential for various cellular processes such as protein synthesis, lipid metabolism, and calcium signaling (Zlamalova2024Atlastin1; Li2017Atlastin). Atlastin GTPase 1 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it is crucial for neuronal health and function, particularly in axonal maintenance. Mutations in the ATL1 gene are linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia, underscoring its significance in neurobiology (Byrnes2011Structural; Hu2015Human). The protein's activity is regulated through GTP-dependent dimerization, which is vital for its role in ER membrane fusion and maintaining ER structure (Byrnes2011Structural).

## Structure
The ATL1 protein, encoded by the ATL1 gene, is a membrane-bound dynamin-like GTPase involved in the homotypic fusion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Its molecular structure includes an N-terminal GTPase domain, a three-helix bundle (3HB), two transmembrane segments, and a C-terminal tail (Hu2015Human). The GTPase domain is composed of a central β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices, with GDP coordinated by conserved elements (Bian2011Structures). The three-helix bundle is connected to the GTPase domain by a flexible linker, facilitating conformational changes necessary for its function (Moss2011Membrane).

ATL1 forms dimers through interactions between adjacent G domains, with dimerization involving residues near the nucleotide-binding pocket, particularly within the P loop (G1), Walker B (G3) motif, and the guanosine-binding loop (G4) (Byrnes2011Structural). The protein can adopt different conformations depending on the nucleotide-bound state, which are crucial for dimerization and the conformational changes induced by GTP hydrolysis (Hu2015Human). Mutations in ATL1, particularly in the GTPase domain and dimer interface, can affect its function and are linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia (Bian2011Structures).

## Function
ATL1, or atlastin GTPase 1, is a crucial protein involved in maintaining the morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in healthy human cells. It is a member of the dynamin-like GTPase family and facilitates the fusion of ER tubules, which is essential for forming the polygonal network characteristic of the tubular ER. This network is vital for various cellular functions, including protein synthesis, lipid metabolism, and calcium signaling (Zlamalova2024Atlastin1; Li2017Atlastin).

ATL1 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in neurons, where it plays a significant role in maintaining axonal health and function. It is involved in homotypic membrane fusion events at the ER, which are crucial for sustaining the ER's interconnected topology. This connectivity supports the rapid flux of proteins and lipids, ensuring efficient protein targeting to the inner nuclear membrane and facilitating nuclear envelope expansion during interphase (Pawar2017Efficient; Byrnes2011Structural).

Mutations in ATL1 are linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia, highlighting its importance in neuronal function. The protein's activity is regulated by GTP-dependent dimerization, which is essential for its role in membrane fusion and maintaining ER morphology (Byrnes2011Structural; Hu2015Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATL1 gene are primarily associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), particularly spastic paraplegia type 3A (SPG3A), an autosomal dominant disorder. This condition is characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs, often with an early onset in childhood (Mészárosová2017Disease‐Causing; Álvarez2010Mutational). The ATL1 gene encodes atlastin-1, a protein involved in the formation of the tubular endoplasmic reticulum network and axon elongation. Disruptions in these processes due to ATL1 mutations can lead to neurodegeneration (Guelly2011Targeted).

In addition to SPG3A, ATL1 mutations have been linked to other neurological conditions, such as hereditary sensory neuropathy type I (HSN I), which is characterized by sensory loss and neuropathic symptoms (Guelly2011Targeted). Some studies suggest that ATL1 mutations may also follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, as seen in certain cases of early-onset HSP (Khan2014Evidence; HamamieChaar2024Patients).

The clinical presentation of ATL1-related disorders can vary, with some patients experiencing complex phenotypes, including intellectual disability and developmental delays (HamamieChaar2024Patients). Genetic testing is crucial for accurate diagnosis and understanding the genetic heterogeneity of these conditions (Mészárosová2017Disease‐Causing).

## Interactions
ATL1 (atlastin GTPase 1) is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its function in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology and facilitating membrane fusion. ATL1 interacts with REEP1 and spastin, both of which are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). The interaction with REEP1 occurs through ATL1's C-terminal fragment, which contains paired membrane-spanning segments, while the interaction with spastin, specifically the M1 isoform, involves an N-terminal domain unique to M1 spastin (Park2010Hereditary). These interactions are significant for coordinating microtubule interactions with the tubular ER network, which is crucial for axonal growth and branching (Park2010Hereditary).

ATL1 also interacts with proteins from the reticulon and DP1/Yop1p superfamilies, which are involved in ER tubule interconnections (Park2010Hereditary). These interactions are mediated through hydrophobic hairpin domains and are important for the localization and function of these proteins within the ER network (Park2010Hereditary). Additionally, ATL1's role in ER membrane fusion involves GTP-dependent dimerization, which is crucial for its function in maintaining ER structure (Byrnes2011Structural). These interactions highlight ATL1's role in the pathogenesis of HSP through its involvement in ER morphology and microtubule dynamics.
