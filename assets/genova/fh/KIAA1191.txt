# KIAA1191

## Overview
KIAA1191 is a human gene that encodes the Niban-like protein 1, which is implicated in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, transcription, and translation. The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, suggesting its involvement in cellular stress responses and apoptosis regulation. This localization indicates a potential role in neuroprotection and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Additionally, KIAA1191 is enriched in gene modules related to mitochondrial processes, highlighting its importance in cellular energy balance and metabolic functions. In pathological contexts, such as pancreatic cancer, KIAA1191 expression is modulated by microRNAs, indicating its potential role in cell growth and signal transduction pathways (Basu2011MicroRNA375; Mahfouz2015Shared).

## Structure


## Function
KIAA1191, also known as Niban-like protein 1, is involved in several molecular processes within healthy human cells. It plays a role in chromatin remodeling, transcription, and translation, as suggested by its identification as a highly connected hub gene in co-expression network analyses of the developing human brain transcriptome. This indicates its potential importance in maintaining the functional integrity of these processes (Mahfouz2015Shared).

The protein encoded by KIAA1191 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways. This localization suggests a role in cellular stress responses and apoptosis regulation, contributing to neuroprotection and cellular homeostasis. The involvement of KIAA1191 in mitochondrial processes, as indicated by its enrichment in specific gene modules, further supports its role in maintaining cellular energy balance and metabolic functions (Mahfouz2015Shared).

In the context of disease, KIAA1191 expression is downregulated by miR-375 in pancreatic cancer cells, which implies its involvement in cell growth and signal transduction pathways. However, its specific function in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated (Basu2011MicroRNA375).
