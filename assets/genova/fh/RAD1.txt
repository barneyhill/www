# RAD1

## Overview
The RAD1 gene encodes the RAD1 checkpoint DNA exonuclease, a crucial component of the 9-1-1 complex involved in the DNA damage response. This protein functions as a DNA exonuclease and is structurally similar to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), forming a sliding clamp that encircles DNA. The 9-1-1 complex, which includes RAD1, RAD9, and HUS1, plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in various DNA repair pathways, such as nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination, and base excision repair. RAD1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it acts as a damage sensor to activate checkpoint control, coordinating cell cycle arrest and repair mechanisms to prevent the propagation of damaged DNA (Venclovas2000Structurebased; Bai2010Interaction). The protein's interactions with other DNA repair proteins and its regulation through post-translational modifications underscore its importance in cellular responses to DNA damage and its potential implications in cancer development (Freire1998Human; Huang2007Jab1).

## Structure
The RAD1 protein is a component of the heterotrimeric 9-1-1 complex, which plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response. Structurally, RAD1 is similar to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), forming a sliding clamp that encircles DNA. The primary structure of RAD1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that contribute to its function as a DNA exonuclease. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in sliding clamp proteins (Sohn2009Crystal).

The tertiary structure of RAD1 involves a three-dimensional conformation that allows it to interact with other proteins and DNA. RAD1, along with Rad9 and Hus1, forms a closed-ring quaternary structure, which is essential for its function in DNA repair and checkpoint signaling (Sohn2009Crystal). The interfaces between RAD1 and the other subunits involve specific interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which are crucial for the stability and function of the 9-1-1 complex (Sohn2009Crystal).

RAD1 contains an exonuclease domain, which is important for its role in DNA repair. The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions (Venclovas2000Structurebased).

## Function
The human RAD1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the 9-1-1 complex, a DNA damage checkpoint protein complex involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. This complex, which includes Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1, functions as a sliding clamp structurally similar to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and is essential for DNA repair processes (Venclovas2000Structurebased; Bai2010Interaction). RAD1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in various DNA repair pathways, including nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination, and base excision repair (Venclovas2000Structurebased; Bai2010Interaction).

The 9-1-1 complex is loaded onto DNA by the Rad17-RFC2-5 complex and interacts with several enzymes involved in base excision repair, such as DNA glycosylases and DNA polymerase β, facilitating the repair of damaged DNA (Bai2010Interaction). RAD1's role in the DNA damage response includes acting as a damage sensor to activate checkpoint control, thereby coordinating cell cycle arrest and repair mechanisms to prevent the propagation of damaged DNA (Freire1998Human; Bai2010Interaction). This function is critical for the organismal outcome of maintaining genomic integrity and preventing the development of cancerous cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the RAD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly hereditary ovarian cancer. RAD1 is considered a BRCA-like tumor suppressor gene, and its knockdown has been shown to decrease cellular viability and increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and etoposide, similar to cells deficient in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Lopes2019FANCM). Despite this, RAD1 depletion does not reduce homologous recombination repair efficiency, suggesting its involvement in microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) for DNA repair (Lopes2019FANCM). A germline loss-of-function variant in RAD1 has been identified in a patient with ovarian cancer, indicating a potential risk factor for hereditary cancer predisposition (Lopes2019FANCM).

In mouse models, deletion of the RAD1 homolog, Mrad1, results in increased susceptibility to skin tumors, particularly when exposed to carcinogens like DMBA-TPA. This suggests that RAD1 plays a protective role against tumor development by maintaining genomic stability (Han2010Mouse). The embryonic lethality observed in RAD1 null mice further supports its critical role in genomic integrity and cancer prevention (Lopes2019FANCM).

## Interactions
The human RAD1 protein is a component of the 9-1-1 complex, which includes RAD9 and HUS1. This complex is involved in the DNA damage response and checkpoint signaling. RAD1 interacts with several proteins, forming a multiprotein complex that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. The 9-1-1 complex is structurally similar to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and forms a toroid structure that encircles DNA, acting as a damage sensor (Wang2004The).

RAD1 interacts with replication protein A (RPA), which facilitates the loading of the 9-1-1 complex onto chromatin in response to DNA damage. This interaction is essential for activating checkpoint signaling (Wu2005Interaction). RAD1 also interacts with mismatch repair proteins hMSH2, hMSH3, and hMSH6, enhancing the DNA binding activity of hMutSα, which is significant in the context of DNA repair (Bai2010Interaction).

Jab1/CSN5 mediates the degradation of the 9-1-1 complex by interacting with RAD1, leading to the translocation and degradation of the complex via the proteasome pathway. This regulation affects DNA synthesis recovery and cell viability under replication stress (Huang2007Jab1).
