# CLINT1

## Overview
CLINT1 is a gene that encodes the protein clathrin interactor 1, which plays a crucial role in intracellular trafficking processes. The protein is categorized as a peripheral membrane protein and is primarily involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Unlike other proteins involved in endocytosis, clathrin interactor 1 is not part of the endocytic machinery but is essential for recruiting coat components to the TGN membrane and facilitating clathrin binding. It interacts with clathrin and various adaptor proteins, such as AP-1 and GGA2, to mediate vesicle formation and transport between the TGN and the endosomal system (Kalthoff2002Clint:). The protein is highly expressed in epithelial cells, particularly in the kidney and small intestine, and is involved in Golgi-associated processes (Kalthoff2002Clint:). CLINT1's interactions and functions underscore its significance in cellular transport mechanisms and its potential implications in various diseases.

## Function
CLINT1, also known as clathrin interactor 1, is a protein involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). It interacts with clathrin and various adaptor proteins, including AP-1 and GGA2, to facilitate vesicle formation and transport between the TGN and the endosomal system (Kalthoff2002Clint:). Unlike other ENTH-domain proteins involved in endocytosis, CLINT1 is not part of the endocytic machinery but may function in recruiting coat components to the TGN membrane or orchestrating clathrin binding (Kalthoff2002Clint:).

CLINT1 is a peripheral membrane protein that can be solubilized from membranes, indicating its association with clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and its role in intracellular trafficking processes (Kalthoff2002Clint:). It is highly expressed in epithelial cells, particularly in the kidney and small intestine, where it colocalizes with clathrin and AP-1, suggesting a role in Golgi-associated processes (Kalthoff2002Clint:). The protein's structure includes a methionine-rich domain and a clathrin-binding motif, which are crucial for its interactions and function in clathrin-mediated trafficking (Kalthoff2002Clint:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CLINT1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of skin diseases, CLINT1 is associated with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have linked CLINT1 to these conditions, highlighting its role in epidermal homeostasis and development. Mutations in CLINT1 can lead to decreased cytoneme extension in keratinocytes, reduced Notch signaling, and abnormal keratinocyte differentiation, contributing to skin disorders (Wang2023Cytoneme-mediated).

In psychiatric disorders, CLINT1 has been identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia. It is specifically co-expressed in the anterior prefrontal cortex, a brain region associated with the disease, suggesting its involvement in the pathology of schizophrenia (Chavali2010Network). Additionally, CLINT1 is considered a strong candidate gene within the linkage region for severe bipolar disorder, indicating its potential role in psychiatric vulnerability (Jasinska2009A).

In colon cancer, CLINT1 has been highlighted as a core gene related to prognosis, with bioinformatics analyses identifying it as a hub gene in stage IIA colon cancer patients (Dong2019Predicting). These findings underscore the diverse clinical significance of CLINT1 across various conditions.

## Interactions
CLINT1, also known as clathrin interactor 1, is a protein that participates in various interactions crucial for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and vesicular transport. It directly interacts with the terminal domain of clathrin, primarily through the motif 423 LFDLM, facilitating its role in clathrin-coated vesicle formation (Kalthoff2002Clint:). CLINT1 also binds to the γ-appendage domain of the AP-1 adaptor complex and shows a weaker association with the AP-2 adaptor complex, primarily through the β-subunit (Kalthoff2002Clint:).

In addition to its interactions with clathrin and adaptor proteins, CLINT1 associates with the Golgi-localized protein GGA2, which is involved in intracellular trafficking. This interaction may involve multiple low-affinity sites that function cooperatively (Kalthoff2002Clint:). CLINT1 is also part of a protein complex involved in TNK2-mediated endocytosis, as demonstrated by its interaction with TNK2, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (Tahir2021ProximityDependent).

CLINT1's role extends to the regulation of EGFR degradation, where it interacts with the AP2 adaptor complex and is involved in sorting EGFR to lysosomes for degradation (Eguchi2023Spatiotemporal). These interactions highlight CLINT1's significant role in vesicular transport and endocytosis.
