# KIF21B

## Overview
KIF21B is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 21B, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-4 family. This protein plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics and intracellular transport, particularly within neuronal cells. Kinesin family member 21B is characterized by its ability to regulate microtubule growth and stability, acting as a microtubule pausing factor that influences neuronal development and function (van2017Kinesin4; Ghiretti2016ActivityDependent). The protein's structure includes a motor domain, a stalk with coiled coils, and a WD40 domain, which facilitate its interactions with microtubules and other proteins (van2017Kinesin4). KIF21B is implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders and has been identified as a genetic susceptibility locus for multiple sclerosis, underscoring its clinical significance (Asselin2020Mutations; McCauley2009Comprehensive).

## Structure
KIF21B is a kinesin motor protein with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of KIF21B consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, which includes an N-terminal motor domain, a stalk with several predicted coiled coils, and a C-terminal WD40 domain (van2017Kinesin4). The motor domain is responsible for movement along microtubules, while the WD40 domain contributes to interactions with microtubule plus ends (van2017Kinesin4).

The secondary structure of KIF21B includes an intramolecular antiparallel coiled coil, which is involved in autoinhibition, similar to the mechanism found in KIF21A (van2017Kinesin4; Bianchi2016Structural). This coiled coil is part of the regulatory domain that interacts with the motor domain to modulate activity (Bianchi2016Structural).

KIF21B's tertiary structure likely involves folding that allows interaction with microtubules through three non-overlapping regions: the motor domain, the coiled-coil part (CC2), and the WD40 domain (van2017Kinesin4). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but the protein functions as a dimer, as indicated by studies on truncated versions like KIF21B-MD-CC1 (van2017Kinesin4).

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
KIF21B is a kinesin motor protein that plays a significant role in microtubule dynamics and intracellular transport, particularly in neurons. It is involved in the regulation of microtubule growth and stability by acting as a potent microtubule pausing factor. KIF21B accumulates at microtubule plus ends, where it can induce pausing and reduce the growth rate of microtubules, thereby increasing catastrophe frequency (van2017Kinesin4). This activity is facilitated by multiple microtubule-binding regions within the protein, including the motor domain and tail regions, which prevent detachment from microtubule tips (van2017Kinesin4).

In neurons, KIF21B is crucial for the retrograde transport of BDNF-TrkB signaling complexes in dendrites, a process essential for neurotrophic signaling and gene transcription regulation in the nucleus (Ghiretti2016ActivityDependent). The protein's activity is modulated by neuronal activity, which favors its transport function over its role in microtubule dynamics (Asselin2020Mutations). KIF21B's function is critical for maintaining normal neuronal development and function, as evidenced by cognitive deficits and altered synaptic transmission in KIF21B knockout mice (Asselin2020Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIF21B gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders. The p.Ile678Leu variant, in particular, is associated with impaired axonal growth and connectivity, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by defects in inter-hemispheric connectivity and ipsilateral axon collateral formation. This variant causes a release of KIF21B autoinhibition, resulting in hyperactivation and axonogenesis defects, as demonstrated in zebrafish and primary neuron models (Asselin2020Mutations). Other missense variants, such as p.Gln313Lys and p.Ala1001Thr, also contribute to impaired neuronal migration and axon branching, potentially through a gain-of-function effect that enhances KIF21B motility (Asselin2020Mutations).

KIF21B has also been identified as a susceptibility locus for multiple sclerosis (MS). Variations in this gene, such as the SNP rs12122721, show a strong association with MS, suggesting that KIF21B may contribute to the genetic predisposition to this autoimmune disease (McCauley2009Comprehensive). The gene's involvement in MS highlights its potential role in the disease's pathogenesis, as it is associated with central nervous system inflammation and demyelination (McCauley2009Comprehensive).

## Interactions
KIF21B interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in neuronal function and transport processes. It interacts with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor TrkB, contributing to the retrograde transport of TrkB+ signaling endosomes in neurons. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the retrograde directionality of these endosomes, as demonstrated by the loss of retrograde bias upon KIF21B depletion (Ghiretti2016ActivityDependent). KIF21B also interacts with cytoplasmic dynein, suggesting a cooperative role in retrograde-directed motility necessary for neurotrophic signaling endosomes to reach the soma (Ghiretti2016ActivityDependent).

KIF21B is involved in synaptic plasticity through its interaction with ELMO1, a protein associated with cytoskeletal dynamics. This interaction is enhanced by NMDA receptor stimulation and is essential for processes like AMPAR internalization during long-term depression (Morikawa2018The). Additionally, KIF21B interacts with the unconventional myosin Va (MyoVa), which is crucial for its entry into dendritic spines, affecting actin dynamics and synaptic function (Gromova2022KIF21B).

KIF21B also interacts with the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIM3, which modulates its motility without contributing to its degradation (Labonté2013TRIM3). These interactions highlight KIF21B's multifaceted role in neuronal transport and signaling.
