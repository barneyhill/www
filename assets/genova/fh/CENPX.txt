# CENPX

## Overview
CENPX, or centromere protein X, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the function of the kinetochore, a critical structure for chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein centromere protein X, produced by the CENPX gene, is a component of the CENP-H/I/K complex and plays a vital role in the assembly and stability of the kinetochore. It is involved in the formation of a heterotetrameric nucleosome-like structure with other proteins such as CENPT, CENPW, and CENPS, which is essential for maintaining centromeric chromatin integrity (Thakur2016CENPT). Beyond its role in chromosome segregation, CENPX is also implicated in DNA repair processes through its interaction with the Fanconi anemia core complex, underscoring its importance in genomic stability (Kumar2013Identifying). Clinically, alterations in CENPX expression have been linked to diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zang2019Therapeutic; Yang2022Significance).

## Structure
CENPX, or centromere protein X, is a crucial component of the CENP-H/I/K complex, which plays a significant role in kinetochore function during cell division. The primary structure of CENPX consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its function and interaction with other proteins. The secondary structure of CENPX may include alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation.

The tertiary structure of CENPX refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its interaction with other components of the CENP-H/I/K complex. This interaction is critical for the proper assembly and function of the kinetochore, a key structure in chromosome segregation during mitosis.

In terms of quaternary structure, CENPX interacts with other proteins within the CENP-H/I/K complex, highlighting its role in the multi-protein assembly necessary for kinetochore activity. Post-translational modifications of CENPX can influence its function and localization within the cell, potentially affecting its role in cell division. Additionally, splice variants of CENPX may exist, which could lead to differences in its function or regulation, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
CENPX, or centromere protein X, is a crucial component of the inner kinetochore, a multi-protein complex essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. It is part of a heterotetrameric nucleosome-like structure with CENPT, CENPW, and CENPS, which can induce positive supercoils in DNA in vitro. This complex is involved in the assembly of the inner kinetochore, contributing to the structural integrity and function of centromeric chromatin (Thakur2016CENPT).

CENPX localizes to both centromeres and euchromatic arms, playing a significant role in the assembly of the outer kinetochore. It is involved in ensuring accurate attachment of spindle microtubules to the centromere, which is critical for proper kinetochore function and chromosome segregation (Thakur2016CENPT). The protein is active in the nucleus, particularly at the centromere, where it contributes to genomic stability by maintaining the correct spatial relationship between centromeric proteins such as CENPA, CENPC, and CENPT (Thakur2016CENPT).

In the context of molecular coding processes, CENPX acts as a protective factor, reducing the chance of a molecular species being part of a code, highlighting its role in the complex interactions within the kinetochore (Görlich2013Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CENPX gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and breast cancer. In the context of T2DM, studies have shown that silencing the CENPX gene can ameliorate hyperglycemia in both zebrafish and mouse models. This therapeutic approach led to increased insulin levels and activation of insulin-related pathways, suggesting that CENPX inhibition could be beneficial in managing hyperglycemia associated with T2DM (Zang2019Therapeutic).

In breast cancer, CENPX is one of several centromere protein genes found to be significantly overexpressed. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and lower chemotherapy sensitivity. High expression levels of CENPX and other CENP genes are linked to immune escape and reduced effectiveness of tumor cell killing, impacting patient outcomes negatively (Yang2022Significance). Although CENPX has not been previously reported for cancer-associated outcomes, recent studies suggest its potential involvement in cancer development through mutations and expression alterations (Kumar2013Identifying). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CENPX in both metabolic and oncological disorders.

## Interactions
CENPX, or centromere protein X, is a component of the CENP-H/I/K complex, which plays a crucial role in kinetochore function and chromosome segregation during cell division. It is involved in the assembly of the kinetochore complex and interacts with other centromere proteins such as CENP-H and CENP-I. CENPX is also part of a heterotetrameric complex with CENPT, CENPW, and CENPS, which forms a nucleosome-like structure that can induce positive supercoils in DNA in vitro. This complex is embedded within H3 nucleosome arrays and is distinct from CENPA nucleosomes, contributing to the structural integrity of centromeric chromatin (Thakur2016CENPT).

CENPX also participates in DNA repair processes by interacting with the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex. This interaction is significant for maintaining genomic stability and facilitating DNA repair mechanisms. The role of CENPX in these processes highlights its importance beyond kinetochore assembly, extending to critical cellular functions such as DNA repair (Kumar2013Identifying).
