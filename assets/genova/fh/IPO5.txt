# IPO5

## Overview
The IPO5 gene encodes the protein importin 5, a nuclear transport receptor that is integral to the nucleocytoplasmic transport system. Importin 5 is responsible for recognizing nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) on various cargo proteins and facilitating their translocation through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus, a process essential for cellular homeostasis and the regulation of critical signaling pathways (Patouret2021The). As a member of the importin-β family, importin 5 is involved in the nuclear import of several key proteins, including ribosomal proteins, p35, and Stella, which are crucial for protein synthesis, nervous system function, and early embryonic development, respectively (Nathaniel2022Importins:). The protein also plays a significant role in several signaling pathways, such as the RAS and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathways, by mediating the nuclear import of Smads and other signaling molecules (Nathaniel2022Importins:). Dysregulation of IPO5 expression has been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2019IPO5; Radhakrishnan2023Activin).

## Function
Importin 5 (IPO5) is a nuclear transport receptor that plays a critical role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins. It functions by recognizing nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) on cargo proteins and facilitating their translocation through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating critical signaling pathways (Patouret2021The).

In healthy human cells, IPO5 is involved in the nuclear import of various proteins, including ribosomal proteins, which are crucial for protein synthesis, and p35, a Cdk5 activator important for nervous system activities (Patouret2021The). IPO5 also plays a role in the nuclear import of Stella, a protein essential for early embryonic development, and prevents the degradation of FLIL33, a cytokine involved in inflammation (Nathaniel2022Importins:).

IPO5 is active in several signaling pathways, such as the RAS signaling pathway and the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway, by transporting Smads 1, 5, and 9 into the nucleus (Nathaniel2022Importins:). It also facilitates the nuclear import of CPEB3 in response to NMDA receptor signaling, which is important for controlling gene expression in neurons (Chao2012NMDAR). The correct subcellular distribution of proteins mediated by IPO5 is vital for normal cell function, and its mislocalization can lead to pathological consequences (Patouret2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IPO5 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), IPO5 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with increased tumor size, differentiation, TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for CRC diagnosis. Functional studies have shown that IPO5 overexpression enhances cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and migration, while its knockdown inhibits these processes. IPO5 also contributes to chemoresistance by reducing sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil, a common chemotherapy drug (Zhang2019IPO5).

In testicular cancer, IPO5 is involved in the crosstalk between activin and BMP signaling pathways, influencing the progression of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs). It selectively transports BMP signaling mediators, impacting gene expression related to cancer cell proliferation and differentiation. Knockdown of IPO5 in testicular cancer cell lines has been shown to reduce BMP4-induced gene expression changes, indicating its role in modulating signaling pathways crucial for tumor development (Radhakrishnan2023Activin).

In breast cancer, IPO5 gene amplification is a prevalent mutation type, highlighting its potential involvement in the disease's molecular pathology (Mehmood2021Molecular).

## Interactions
Importin 5 (IPO5) is a nuclear transport receptor that interacts with various proteins to facilitate their nuclear import. IPO5 binds to nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) in proteins, enabling their translocation into the nucleus. It is involved in the nuclear import of both cellular and viral proteins, playing a role in processes such as the RAS signaling pathway and viral replication (Patouret2021The).

IPO5 interacts with CPEB3, a nucleocytoplasm-shuttling RNA-binding protein, through its RNA-recognition motif (RRM1). This interaction is enhanced by NMDAR signaling, which increases the nuclear import of CPEB3 in a Ran-regulated manner (Chao2012NMDAR). The binding of IPO5 to CPEB3 is crucial for its nuclear translocation, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Chao2012NMDAR).

In colorectal cancer, IPO5 mediates the nuclear import of RASAL2, a RAS-GTPase-activated protein, by binding to its NLS. This interaction is significant for the activation of the RAS pathway, promoting cancer progression (Zhang2019IPO5).

IPO5 also interacts with proteins such as ribosomal proteins, p35, apoliprotein A-1, FLIL33, and IQGAP1, affecting various signaling pathways and potentially contributing to cancer progression (Patouret2021The).
