# ADAMTS20

## Overview
ADAMTS20 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 20, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs) family. This protein is a secreted metalloprotease involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, characterized by its complex multi-domain structure, including a metalloproteinase domain, disintegrin-like domain, and multiple thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs) (Takeda2016ADAM). ADAMTS20 plays a crucial role in various biological processes, such as melanoblast development and ciliogenesis, by facilitating the cleavage of proteoglycans like versican and modulating signaling pathways (Nandadasa2019Secreted; Silver2008The). The gene is expressed in multiple human tissues and has been linked to several clinical conditions, including pigmentation disorders and developmental defects (Llamazares2003Identification; Silver2008The).

## Structure
ADAMTS20 is a member of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a complex multi-domain structure. The protein includes a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a central thrombospondin type-1 repeat (TSR) motif, followed by a cysteine-rich domain and a spacer domain (Takeda2016ADAM). The metalloproteinase domain features a consensus HEXXHXXGXXH sequence, which is typical of the metzincin superfamily, and is crucial for its catalytic activity (Takeda2016ADAM).

ADAMTS20 contains 14 C-terminal TSRs and a GON domain, which is associated with gonadal development (PORTER2005The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, O-fucosylation, and C-mannosylation, which are important for its secretion, localization, and function (Holdener2019ADAMTS9; Dubail2015Insights). Specific TSRs in ADAMTS20 are modified with fucose and glucose, affecting its secretion and function (Holdener2019ADAMTS9).

ADAMTS20 also exists in splice variant isoforms, with a shorter isoform identified in humans and mice, containing fewer C-terminal TSRs (PORTER2005The). These structural features and modifications play a significant role in the protein's function in extracellular matrix remodeling.

## Function
ADAMTS20 is a secreted metalloprotease involved in several critical biological processes, primarily through its role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. It is characterized by multiple thrombospondin-1 repeats and a unique GON domain, which are structural features that contribute to its function in tissue-specific contexts (Llamazares2003Identification). ADAMTS20 is expressed in various human tissues, including the testis, prostate, ovary, heart, placenta, lung, and pancreas, and is overexpressed in several tumor types (Llamazares2003Identification).

In the context of melanoblast development, ADAMTS20 is essential for the survival of these cells, which are responsible for pigmentation. It facilitates the cleavage of versican, a proteoglycan involved in neural crest development, thereby supporting melanoblast survival and proper signaling pathways in the skin (Silver2008The). ADAMTS20 also plays a role in ciliogenesis, a process crucial for cilia formation, by participating in ciliary vesicle growth and modulating signaling pathways such as Hedgehog signaling. This function is vital for normal cellular signaling and development, including neural tube closure and other developmental processes (Nandadasa2019Secreted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADAMTS20 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In dogs, particularly the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers, a frameshift mutation in ADAMTS20 is associated with a complex phenotype that includes syndromic cleft lip, cleft palate, and syndactyly. This mutation results in a high penetrance of these conditions, with primary palate clefts being 100% penetrant and secondary palate clefts 92% penetrant (Wolf2015GenomeWide). In humans, genome-wide association studies have identified a suggestive association between ADAMTS20 and nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate (CL/P), although no single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) reached genome-wide significance (Wolf2015GenomeWide).

ADAMTS20 is also involved in melanoblast development, and mutations in this gene in mice lead to increased apoptosis of melanoblasts, resulting in pigmentation disorders such as the belted white-spotting phenotype (Silver2008The). The gene's role in cell survival and its potential involvement in melanoma progression have been suggested, with dysregulation of signaling between ADAMTS20, Kit, and versican possibly contributing to melanoma progression (Silver2008The). Additionally, ADAMTS20's secretion is affected by the loss of B3GLCT, which may contribute to developmental defects observed in Peters Plus Syndrome (Holdener2019ADAMTS9).

## Interactions
ADAMTS20 is known to interact with several proteins, primarily through its involvement in extracellular matrix remodeling and ciliogenesis. One of the key interactions of ADAMTS20 is with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). This interaction is part of a broader group that includes ADAMTS9 and other proteins, suggesting a role in endocytosis and recycling processes necessary for ciliogenesis (Dennler2023Phylogenetic; Nandadasa2019Secreted). 

ADAMTS20 is also implicated in the proteolytic modification of transmembrane molecules, which is essential for ciliogenesis. Although specific details on the physical interactions of ADAMTS20 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented, it is suggested that ADAMTS20 may interact with similar partners as ADAMTS9, such as LRP1/2 and furin, participating in proteolytic processes at the ciliary base (Nandadasa2019Secreted).

The interaction with LRP1 is shared among several hyalectanases, including ADAMTS-20, indicating a conserved mechanism within this protein family (Dennler2023Phylogenetic). These interactions highlight the role of ADAMTS20 in cellular processes related to extracellular matrix dynamics and developmental signaling pathways.
