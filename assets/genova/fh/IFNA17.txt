# IFNA17

## Overview
The IFNA17 gene encodes the protein interferon alpha 17, which is a member of the type I interferon family, known for its pivotal role in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense mechanisms. This protein functions primarily as a cytokine, facilitating communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the immune system against pathogens, especially viruses. Interferon alpha 17 is involved in the induction of interferon-stimulated genes that inhibit viral replication and modulate immune signaling pathways (Kim2003Interferon). The gene is located on chromosome 9 and is part of a complex family of interferon genes, each contributing uniquely to immune responses. The protein encoded by IFNA17 is active in both the cytoplasm and extracellular space, where it influences cell proliferation and apoptosis, and is associated with immune cell signatures such as the Th1 subset of CD4+ T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Galbraith2021Specialized). These characteristics underscore the gene's importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases.

## Function
The IFNA17 gene encodes interferon alpha 17, a type I interferon involved in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. In healthy human cells, IFNA17 plays a crucial role by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, which inhibit viral replication and modulate immune signaling. This protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, where it contributes to the modulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis (Kim2003Interferon).

IFNA17 is part of a complex gene family located on chromosome 9, and its proteins, while functionally equivalent, may differ in specific activity. The gene's role in healthy cells involves contributing to the immune response against viral infections, such as those caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a central etiologic agent in cervical cancer (Kim2003Interferon). The protein is also associated with immune cell signatures, such as the Thelper 1 (Th1) subset of CD4+ T cells, and is linked to the activity of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are strong producers of interferons during viral infections (Galbraith2021Specialized). These interactions highlight IFNA17's involvement in the broader immune response and its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
The IFNA17 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its polymorphisms and altered expression levels. A significant association has been found between the IFNA17 polymorphism (551T→G) and an increased risk of sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disorder characterized by a Th1-type inflammatory response. This polymorphism results in an amino acid change (I184R) and is linked to higher production of IFN-α and IL-12p70, which may contribute to the disease's pathogenesis (Akahoshi2004Association).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), a frameshift mutation in the IFNA17 gene, resulting in a premature stop codon, has been associated with an increased risk of developing the disease. This mutation leads to a non-functional allele, which is more prevalent in MS patients compared to controls (Miterski1999The).

Additionally, IFNA17 is overexpressed in primary testicular lymphoma (PTL) compared to nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis or progression of PTL (Mansoor2023Primary). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IFNA17 in various immune-related conditions and cancers.
