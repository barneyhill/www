# CACNB3

## Overview
The CACNB3 gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit beta 3, a protein that plays a critical role in the function of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). These channels are essential for the regulation of calcium ion entry into excitable cells, influencing various physiological processes such as neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability. The protein encoded by CACNB3, categorized as an auxiliary subunit, is primarily expressed in the brain and is involved in modulating the activity and trafficking of VGCCs, thereby affecting calcium influx and cellular responses (Andrade2019Genetic; Kjær2023Differential). The beta-3 subunit interacts with other proteins, including the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and RGK proteins, highlighting its role in complex cellular signaling pathways (Belkacemi2018IP3; Buraei2010The). Alterations in CACNB3 expression have been linked to neurological conditions such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and bipolar disorder, underscoring its clinical significance (McCarthy2016Calcium; Kjær2023Differential).

## Structure
The CACNB3 gene encodes the beta-3 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which are essential for the transport of calcium ions across cell membranes. The primary structure of the CACNB3 protein consists of specific amino acid sequences that form distinct domains, including the SH3 and guanylate kinase-like domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's function and interaction with other channel components.

In terms of secondary structure, the CACNB3 protein includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these domains, allowing the protein to achieve its functional configuration necessary for interaction with other subunits of the calcium channel complex.

The quaternary structure of CACNB3 refers to its interaction with other subunits of the voltage-gated calcium channels, forming a functional channel complex. This interaction is vital for the regulation of calcium ion flow through the channel.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating the function of the CACNB3 protein. These modifications can alter the protein's activity and interactions, impacting calcium channel function. Additionally, splice variants of CACNB3 may result in isoforms with different functional properties, potentially affecting the channel's physiological roles.

## Function
The CACNB3 gene encodes the beta-3 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), which are integral to the regulation of calcium ion entry into excitable cells. This subunit is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of these channels, influencing processes such as neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability (Andrade2019Genetic; Kjær2023Differential). The beta-3 subunit is involved in promoting channel trafficking and regulating the gating properties of VGCCs, thereby affecting calcium influx and subsequent cellular responses (Kjær2023Differential).

In healthy human cells, CACNB3 is expressed in both pre- and postsynaptic hippocampal neurons, where it enhances high voltage-activated calcium channel currents. This activity is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis, which is critical for normal neuronal function and excitability (Kjær2023Differential). The subunit's role in the presynaptic depolarization and Ca2+ channel opening pathway suggests its involvement in synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling (Kjær2023Differential). Although the specific functional roles of the beta-3 subunit are not fully elucidated, its association with inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity in the hippocampus indicates its participation in complex signaling networks (Kjær2023Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CACNB3 gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. In mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), CACNB3 is significantly upregulated in the temporal lobe neocortex of patients, suggesting its involvement in seizure generation due to its role in neuronal excitability (Kjær2023Differential). This upregulation is considered a potential target for developing new treatment strategies for drug-resistant mTLE, where current antiseizure medications are ineffective for a significant portion of patients (Kjær2023Differential).

CACNB3 is also a target of the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and its dysregulation may be linked to Fragile X syndrome and schizophrenia. The loss of FMRP can lead to the upregulation of CACNB3, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of these conditions (Heyes2015Genetic).

In bipolar disorder, CACNB3 expression is associated with circadian rhythm modulation. Knockdown experiments have shown that CACNB3 affects rhythm amplitude, and its expression varies in fibroblasts from bipolar disorder patients, indicating a possible link to the disorder's pathophysiology (McCarthy2016Calcium).

## Interactions
The CACNB3 gene encodes the Cavβ3 protein, which is involved in several key interactions with other proteins. Cavβ3 physically interacts with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), specifically the type 3 IP3R, modulating its function by reducing the receptor's sensitivity to low levels of IP3. This interaction is facilitated by the SH3 domain of Cavβ3, which is crucial for binding to IP3R, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Belkacemi2018IP3).

Cavβ3 also interacts with RGK proteins, such as Gem, which are involved in the inhibition of high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. This interaction occurs at the GK domain of Cavβ3 and is essential for the inhibition of these channels (Buraei2010The). Additionally, Cavβ3 forms a stable complex with the Ca v 1.4 subunit in CD8+ T lymphocytes, which is crucial for the stability and function of the Ca v 1.4 channel, affecting T cell signaling and survival (Jha2009Defective).

Cavβ3's interactions extend beyond calcium channels, as it can also bind to transcription factors like Pax6, influencing transcriptional activity (Buraei2010The). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of Cavβ3 in cellular signaling pathways.
