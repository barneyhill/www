# PLAGL1

## Overview
PLAGL1, or pleomorphic adenoma gene-like 1, is a gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. The protein encoded by PLAGL1, characterized by its zinc finger motifs, functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator, influencing the expression of genes involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. It is recognized for its role as a tumor suppressor, with its expression being epigenetically regulated through imprinting, leading to paternal monoallelic expression. PLAGL1 is implicated in several cancers, where its expression is often altered, and it is also associated with certain genetic conditions such as transient neonatal diabetes mellitus. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the tumor suppressor p53, underscore its significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential involvement in oncogenesis (Varrault2017Identification; Ahn2021Genomic; Abdollahi2006LOT1).

## Structure
The PLAGL1 gene encodes a protein consisting of 463 amino acids, characterized by the presence of seven C2H2-type zinc-finger motifs located at the amino-terminal region. These zinc fingers are crucial for the protein's DNA-binding capability, which is a common feature among the PLAG family of zinc finger proteins (Abdollahi2006LOT1; Kas1998Transcriptional). The carboxyl-terminal region of PLAGL1 is rich in proline and glutamine, contributing to its structural and functional properties (Abdollahi2006LOT1).

Alternative splicing of the PLAGL1 gene can result in polypeptides with either five or seven zinc fingers, which may influence their roles in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (Abdollahi2006LOT1). The protein's transcriptional activation capacity is notably strong, with its activation domain spread over a larger region compared to other family members like PLAG1 and PLAGL2 (Kas1998Transcriptional). PLAGL1 binds to a specific consensus DNA sequence, GGGGGGCCCC, which differs from the binding sites of PLAG1 and PLAGL2, despite their structural homology (Abdollahi2006LOT1). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation and acetylation, which modulate its activity (Abdollahi2006LOT1).

## Function
PLAGL1, also known as ZAC1, is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly facilitating physiological cell cycle exit during contact inhibition, growth factor withdrawal, or cell differentiation (Varrault2017Identification). PLAGL1 is known for its anti-proliferative activity and is considered a candidate tumor suppressor gene (Varrault2017Identification).

The gene is expressed ubiquitously in human cells, with higher levels in the placenta and lower levels in the brain, liver, and skeletal muscle. Its expression is epigenetically regulated by maternal methylation imprints, leading to paternal monoallelic expression (Ahn2021Genomic). PLAGL1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator of p53, a well-known tumor suppressor, and is involved in inducing apoptosis and promoting cell cycle arrest (Ahn2021Genomic).

PLAGL1 regulates a subset of imprinted gene network (IGN) genes and controls the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM), including collagens, by binding to GC-rich motifs in the promoter regions of target genes (Varrault2017Identification). This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLAGL1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast and ovarian tumors, the gene is often silenced not by mutations but by changes in expression levels, leading to reduced mRNA expression in these cancers (Abdollahi2006LOT1). Similarly, in gastric adenocarcinomas, PLAGL1 downregulation is attributed to gene deletion and promoter hyper-methylation, with a significant portion of tumors showing decreased expression compared to normal tissues (Li2014Both). In colorectal cancer, PLAGL1 expression is reduced at the mRNA level, correlating with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis (KOWALCZYK2015Altered).

PLAGL1 also plays a role in pediatric central nervous system tumors, where its amplification is a key feature of a novel tumor type. In these cases, PLAGL1 acts as an oncogene, with its overexpression linked to tumor development (Keck2022Amplification). In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, lower PLAGL1 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation and worse overall survival, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Liang2023PLAGL1).

Beyond cancer, PLAGL1 is involved in transient neonatal diabetes mellitus due to its imprinting on chromosome 6, where it is expressed only from the paternal allele (Abdollahi2006LOT1).

## Interactions
PLAGL1, also known as pleomorphic adenoma gene-like 1, is a zinc finger protein that participates in various interactions influencing cellular processes. It is capable of inducing transcription of the PACAP type 1 receptor and interacts functionally with the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing the activity of p53-responsive promoters. This suggests that PLAGL1 acts as a transcriptional coactivator for p53 by directly binding to it (Abdollahi2006LOT1).

PLAGL1 also interacts with the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO-1 through non-covalent interactions, which are significant for its coactivation activity. This interaction is crucial for regulating PLAGL1's functions, including the induction of the p21 gene, which is important for modulating apoptosis (Liu2012A).

In the context of pediatric-type supratentorial neuroepithelial tumors, PLAGL1 is involved in recurrent gene fusions, such as EWSR1:PLAGL1 and PLAGL1:FOXO1. These fusions suggest an oncogenic function, with the EWSR1:PLAGL1 fusion involving the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of EWSR1 fused to the zinc finger domain of PLAGL1 (Sievers2021Recurrent). These interactions highlight PLAGL1's role in both normal cellular regulation and tumorigenesis.
