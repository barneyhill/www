# BUB1B

## Overview
BUB1B is a gene that encodes the BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase B, commonly referred to as BubR1, a crucial component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis. This serine/threonine kinase plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation by delaying the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle, thereby preventing aneuploidy (Elowe2010Uncoupling). BubR1 is characterized by several conserved motifs, including KEN boxes and a GLEBS motif, which are essential for its function and interaction with other proteins such as BUB3 (Elowe2010Uncoupling). The protein's activity is regulated through various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which are critical for its role in chromosome stability and segregation (Bloom2021Physiological). Mutations in BUB1B are linked to several clinical conditions, including mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome and increased cancer risk, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Pavone2022Pathogenic; Silva2024BUB1B).

## Structure
BUB1B, also known as BubR1, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis. The protein is characterized by several key domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region contains APC/C degron domains, KEN boxes, destruction boxes, ABBA motifs, a GLEBS domain, and TPR motifs, which are crucial for interactions with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and kinetochore binding (Bloom2021Physiological). The C-terminal region is responsible for kinetochore-microtubule functions and includes the KARD, which is essential for monitoring kinetochore-microtubule attachments (Bloom2021Physiological).

BUB1B undergoes various post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate its activity. Phosphorylation by mitotic kinases such as Plk1 and Cdk1 modulates its role in kinetochore-microtubule interactions (Bloom2021Physiological). Acetylation at K250 and K668, as well as SUMOylation at K250, are critical for its function in chromosome segregation and stability (Bloom2021Physiological). The protein also interacts with B56 subunits, which is crucial for chromosome congression (Xu2013BUBR1).

The structural features of BUB1B include a conserved N-terminal domain essential for SAC function, mediating interactions with blinkin for kinetochore localization (BolanosGarcia2011BUB1). The N-terminal domain has a triple-tandem arrangement of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif, which is crucial for binding blinkin and other proteins (BolanosGarcia2011BUB1). The interaction with BUB3 involves the GLEBS motif, which is essential for kinetochore localization (BolanosGarcia2011BUB1).

## Function
The BUB1B gene encodes the BubR1 protein, which plays a critical role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. BubR1 is essential for delaying the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle, thus preventing aneuploidy (Elowe2010Uncoupling). It achieves this by interacting with Cdc20, a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), to inhibit its activity and prevent premature progression to anaphase (Elowe2010Uncoupling).

BubR1 contains several conserved motifs, including KEN boxes and a GLEBS motif, which are crucial for its function. The KEN boxes are involved in SAC function, while the GLEBS motif is necessary for Bub3 interaction and proper localization to the kinetochore (Elowe2010Uncoupling). Phosphorylation of BubR1 is important for maintaining kinetochore-microtubule attachments and timely mitotic progression, although it is not essential for SAC functions (Elowe2010Uncoupling).

BubR1's interaction with Bub3 and its localization to kinetochores are vital for its role in chromosome congression and SAC activity. Mutations affecting these interactions can lead to defects in mitotic timing and chromosome alignment (Elowe2010Uncoupling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BUB1B gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in maintaining chromosomal stability. Mosaic variegated aneuploidy 1 (MVA1) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder linked to BUB1B mutations. This syndrome is characterized by widespread mosaic aneuploidies, intrauterine growth restriction, post-natal growth retardation, severe neurological impairments, and a high risk of developing malignancies such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, and various leukemias (Pavone2022Pathogenic; Suijkerbuijk2010Molecular).

BUB1B variants also contribute to cancer predisposition, particularly in prostate cancer. In-frame deletions and other mutations in BUB1B can lead to chromosomal instability, which is associated with resistance to taxane-based chemotherapies and increased cancer risk (Silva2024BUB1B). Overexpression of BUB1B is observed in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is linked to worse clinical outcomes and tumor progression (Qiu2020BUB1B; Chen2015Requirement).

Additionally, rare BUB1B variants have been implicated in premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause, affecting reproductive lifespan and fertility (Chen2020Rare). These findings underscore the gene's critical role in genomic stability and its impact on various diseases.

## Interactions
BUB1B, also known as BUBR1, is a crucial component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and participates in several key protein interactions. It forms part of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) with BUB3, MAD2, and CDC20, which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to prevent premature chromosome segregation (BolanosGarcia2011BUB1; Wan2012Identification). BUB1B interacts with BUB3 through a conserved GLEBS motif, which is essential for its kinetochore localization and function in the SAC (BolanosGarcia2011BUB1).

In the context of DNA damage response, BUB1B interacts with phosphorylated ATM following ionizing radiation treatment, a critical interaction for resistance to DNA double-strand breaks in bladder cancer cells (Komura2021Increased). This interaction is particularly important for the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, contributing to the resistance against DNA-damaging agents (Komura2021Increased).

BUB1B is also a direct transcriptional target of the transcription factor FOXM1, which binds to the BUB1B promoter to regulate its expression. This interaction is significant for the growth and survival of certain cancer cells, such as rhabdomyosarcoma (Komura2021Increased; Wan2012Identification).
