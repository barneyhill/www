# LRATD1

## Overview
LRATD1, or Lecithin Retinol Acyltransferase Domain Containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by LRATD1 is characterized by the presence of a domain similar to that found in lecithin retinol acyltransferase, suggesting potential roles in lipid metabolism or retinoid processing. Research has highlighted its altered expression in certain pathological conditions, such as colorectal cancer, where it is associated with changes in cell motility and tumor aggressiveness (Pennel2024JAKSTAT3). Additionally, LRATD1 expression is noted in the context of bovine pregnancy, indicating a possible role in reproductive biology (Isabel2024Effects). Despite these associations, the full spectrum of LRATD1's functions and its implications in health and disease require further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the LRATD1 gene is primarily associated with its expression alterations in various conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly in stromal-rich tumors, high expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3 tyr705) is linked to the upregulation of LRATD1. This upregulation is associated with changes in cell motility, contributing to the aggressive phenotype observed in these tumors (Pennel2024JAKSTAT3). The study suggests that LRATD1 expression is altered in the context of high pSTAT3 tyr705 expression, which is linked to reduced cancer-specific survival in CRC patients (Pennel2024JAKSTAT3).

In the context of bovine pregnancy, LRATD1 is noted for its increased mRNA expression in endothelial and epithelial cells of the human endometrium. Although specific clinical implications are not detailed, the gene's upregulation in colorectal cancer and potential role in cell motility suggest its involvement in processes like cell invasion and stromal remodeling during implantation and placentation (Isabel2024Effects). However, the clinical significance of LRATD1 gene mutations or specific interaction changes remains largely unexplored, indicating a need for further research to elucidate its role in disease contexts.
