# CASKIN1

## Overview
CASKIN1 is a gene that encodes the CASK interacting protein 1, a multidomain scaffold protein primarily involved in synaptic organization and function within the nervous system. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, and tandem sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains, contributing to its role in synaptic scaffolding and signaling (Tabuchi2002CASK; Stafford2011Tandem). CASK interacting protein 1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it localizes to presynaptic active zones and interacts with various proteins, including CASK, to form complexes essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Tabuchi2002CASK; Stafford2011Tandem). Beyond its presynaptic functions, the protein also plays a role in postsynaptic processes, influencing dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity, which are critical for learning and memory (Bencsik2019Dendritic). Mutations in the CASKIN1 gene have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal neural function (Wahbeh2023A; Tőke2021Solution).

## Structure
CASKIN1 is a multidomain protein with a complex molecular structure that plays a significant role in synaptic function. It contains an N-terminal ankyrin repeat region, an SH3 domain, two central tandem sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains, and a disordered C-terminal proline-rich domain (Stafford2011Tandem). The SAM domains are particularly noteworthy as they form a novel type of helical polymer, crucial for organizing the cytomatrix in active zones of neural synapses. These SAM domains form a polymer with eight SAM domains per helical turn, sensitive to ionic strength (Stafford2011Tandem).

The SH3 domain of CASKIN1 is atypical, lacking the typical peptide binding groove found in other SH3 domains. Instead, it appears to bind lipid surfaces, particularly those with elevated levels of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Tőke2021Solution). The tertiary structure of the SH3 domain is characterized by a beta-sandwich fold with a hydrophobic core, stabilized by van der Waals interactions (Tőke2021Solution).

CASKIN1 interacts with the CASK protein through its CASK-interaction domain (CID), which is essential for forming large protein scaffolds that organize synaptic vesicles (Stafford2011Tandem). The interaction between CASKIN1 and CASK is mediated by specific residues forming a hydrophobic core, crucial for binding specificity (Wang2022Crystal).

## Function
CASKIN1 is a multidomain scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and function in the nervous system. It is primarily expressed in the brain, where it localizes to presynaptic active zones and interacts with various proteins to form complexes essential for synaptic transmission (Tabuchi2002CASK; Stafford2011Tandem). CASKIN1 interacts with CASK, a protein involved in synaptic scaffolding, forming stable complexes that are important for synaptic signaling and organization (Tabuchi2002CASK). 

CASKIN1 contains several domains, including ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, and sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains, which contribute to its scaffolding function by facilitating interactions with other synaptic proteins (Tabuchi2002CASK). The SAM domains of CASKIN1 form a novel polymer structure that is sensitive to ionic strength, influencing synapse organization during calcium ion influx (Stafford2011Tandem). 

In addition to its presynaptic roles, CASKIN1 is involved in postsynaptic functions, regulating dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity, which are critical for memory formation and learning (Bencsik2019Dendritic). It co-localizes with Shank2 in dendritic spines, suggesting its involvement in the postsynaptic scaffold protein network (Bencsik2019Dendritic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CASKIN1 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions. A missense variant in the proline-rich region of CASKIN1, specifically the D1204N variant, has been associated with psychosis in a three-generation family. This variant segregates with the condition in an autosomal dominant fashion and is linked to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The variant is absent from public databases, suggesting its rarity and potential significance in these conditions (Wahbeh2023A).

CASKIN1 is also associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In mouse models, it has been identified as a novel gene linked to ASD-like phenotypes, indicating its involvement in these disorders (Tőke2021Solution). Alterations in CASKIN1 expression have been observed in various pathological conditions. For instance, prenatal exposure to ethanol significantly decreases CASKIN1 expression in rats, suggesting that maternal alcohol consumption may impact CASKIN1-related synaptic functions (Tőke2021Solution).

Furthermore, CASKIN1 is implicated in chronic pain, with increased concentrations in the spinal dorsal horn affecting behavioral phenotypes such as nociception and stress response (Tőke2021Solution). These findings highlight the gene's potential role in diverse neurological and psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
CASKIN1 is a scaffold protein that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in synaptic signaling and neuronal development. It forms a complex with CASK, a member of the MAGUK family, through its CASK-interaction domain (CID), which binds to the CASK_CAMK domain. This interaction is characterized by specific amino acids in CASKIN1, such as L378 and R379, which are crucial for binding (Wang2022Crystal).

CASKIN1 also interacts with Nck, an adaptor protein with SH2 and SH3 domains. This interaction is SH3 domain-dependent and facilitates the recruitment of CASKIN1 to the EphB1 receptor tyrosine kinase, leading to the phosphorylation of CASKIN1 (Pesti2012Complex). The interaction with EphB1 is mediated by Nck binding to the phosphorylated Tyr-594 residue of EphB1, forming a complex that may contribute to cytoskeletal organization in dendritic spines (Pesti2012Complex).

CASKIN1 competes with Mint1 for binding to CASK, indicating a regulatory mechanism in synaptic protein complexes. This competition suggests that CASKIN1 and Mint1 cannot bind to CASK simultaneously, highlighting the specificity of these interactions (Tabuchi2002CASK).
