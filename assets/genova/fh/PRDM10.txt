# PRDM10

## Overview
PRDM10 is a gene that encodes the PR/SET domain 10 protein, a member of the PR/SET domain-containing family of zinc finger transcriptional regulators. The protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal PR domain, which is related to the lysine methyltransferase SET domain, and is followed by ten C2H2-type zinc finger repeats and a unique C-terminal glutamine-rich transactivation domain. These structural features enable PR/SET domain 10 to function as a sequence-specific transcription factor, playing a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression. It is involved in early embryonic development and the maintenance of mouse embryonic stem cell homeostasis, with its expression observed across multiple tissues, indicating a broad functional scope. PRDM10 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly through gene fusions and mutations, highlighting its potential as a marker for specific cancer subsets and its role in tumorigenesis (Han2020Global; Di2021The; Casamassimi2020Multifaceted).

## Structure
PRDM10 is a member of the PR/SET domain-containing family of zinc finger transcriptional regulators. It is characterized by a conserved N-terminal PR domain, which is related to the lysine methyltransferase SET domain, followed by ten C2H2-type zinc finger repeats, and a unique C-terminal glutamine (Q)-rich transactivation domain (Han2020Global; Di2021The). The zinc finger domains are crucial for DNA binding, allowing PRDM10 to function as a sequence-specific transcription factor (Han2020Global; Di2021The).

The PR domain in PRDM10 is structurally similar to those found in other PRDM family members, although PRDM10 may lack efficient S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding, potentially affecting its catalytic activity as a methyltransferase (Di2021The). The C-terminal Q-rich domain is involved in transcriptional activation, and its deletion leads to the downregulation of PRDM10-regulated genes (Di2021The).

PRDM10 can undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may influence its function and interactions. However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures, as well as common post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
PRDM10 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in early embryonic development and the maintenance of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) homeostasis. It functions as a sequence-specific transcription factor, regulating the expression of target genes, including Eif3b, a core component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex. This regulation is essential for maintaining global translation, which is critical for cell growth and survival (Han2020Global).

PRDM10 is characterized by its PR domain and multiple zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression. It binds to specific DNA motifs, activating transcription through its zinc finger array and recruiting co-activators via its PR and Q-rich domains (Han2020Global; Di2021The). PRDM10 is expressed across multiple tissues, suggesting it may have pleiotropic effects beyond early development (Han2020Global).

In PRDM10-deficient mESCs, significant transcriptional changes occur, particularly affecting genes associated with ribosomal function and translation, indicating its role as a transcriptional activator (Han2020Global). PRDM10's involvement in transcriptional regulation and development suggests it plays a crucial role in normal cellular processes (Hofvander2015Recurrent).

## Clinical Significance
PRDM10 has been implicated in various cancers through gene fusions and mutations. In soft tissue sarcomas, particularly low-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), PRDM10 is often found fused with MED12 or CITED2. These fusions are specific to a less aggressive subset of UPS, characterized by pleomorphism and low mitotic activity, and are associated with a better prognosis due to their low metastatic potential (Hofvander2015Recurrent; Hofvander2019Undifferentiated). PRDM10 rearrangements have also been identified in other soft tissue tumors, such as PRDM10-rearranged soft tissue tumors (PRDM10-STT), which exhibit overlapping features with superficial CD34-positive fibroblastic tumors (SCD34FT) (Perret2021Superficial).

Beyond sarcomas, PRDM10 plays a role in the onset, progression, and drug resistance of several malignancies, including hepatocellular, prostate, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric, and rectum cancers. Its influence on these processes may involve the regulation of BCL2 gene expression, affecting apoptosis (Casamassimi2020Multifaceted). PRDM10 mutations or overexpression have been observed in certain cancer types, suggesting its involvement in oncogenesis (Casamassimi2020Multifaceted). These findings highlight the potential of PRDM10 as a marker for specific cancer subsets and its role in tumorigenesis.

## Interactions
PRDM10 is a transcription factor that interacts with nucleic acids and proteins to regulate gene expression. It binds specifically to DNA motifs located near transcriptional start sites, particularly in promoter regions, to activate transcription. This interaction is facilitated by its zinc finger DNA-binding domain, which is crucial for its recruitment to target DNA sequences (Han2020Global). The binding of PRDM10 to its DNA motif is highly specific, as demonstrated by gel-shift assays, which show that its binding is diminished by competition with an excess of unlabeled probe (Han2020Global).

PRDM10 also interacts with the promoter of the Eif3b gene, a key downstream target, to regulate its expression. This interaction is essential for maintaining normal levels of Eif3b expression, which is crucial for translation initiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (Han2020Global). In the context of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, PRDM10 fusions, such as CITED2-PRDM10, affect chromatin accessibility and gene expression, suggesting that PRDM10's interaction with DNA is influenced by its fusion partners (Hofvander2019Undifferentiated). These interactions highlight PRDM10's role in transcriptional regulation and its impact on cellular processes.
