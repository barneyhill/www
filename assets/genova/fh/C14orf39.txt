# C14orf39

## Overview
C14orf39 is a gene that encodes the protein known as chromosome 14 open reading frame 39, or SIX6OS1, which plays a critical role in the synaptonemal complex (SC) during meiosis. The SIX6OS1 protein is a structural component of the SC, essential for the synapsis of homologous chromosomes, a process crucial for gamete formation and fertility. It is characterized by a helical N-terminal region that facilitates interactions with other SC proteins, particularly SYCE1, and a C-terminal region that may undergo post-translational modifications. Mutations in C14orf39 can lead to reproductive disorders such as non-obstructive azoospermia and premature ovarian insufficiency due to impaired synaptic processes and meiotic arrest (Fan2021Homozygous; GómezH2016C14ORF39SIX6OS1).

## Structure
The C14orf39 gene encodes the SIX6OS1 protein, a component of the synaptonemal complex (SC) crucial for meiotic progression and fertility. The protein has a predicted molecular weight of approximately 70 kDa, consistent with western blot analysis (GómezH2016C14ORF39SIX6OS1). The N-terminal region of SIX6OS1 is highly helical, containing a coiled-coil structure that likely facilitates interactions with other SC proteins, such as SYCE1 (GómezH2016C14ORF39SIX6OS1). This region may mediate self-association and binding to other structural proteins of the SC (GómezH2016C14ORF39SIX6OS1).

The C-terminal region of SIX6OS1 is predicted to be largely unstructured but contains conserved patches that may interact with globular proteins, potentially through specific peptide motifs. This region also includes several predicted phosphorylation sites, which could regulate the assembly of macromolecular complexes during meiosis (GómezH2016C14ORF39SIX6OS1). The presence of these phosphorylation sites suggests post-translational modifications that may influence protein function and stability.

Mutations in C14orf39, such as frameshift and nonsense mutations, can lead to truncated proteins, affecting the protein's interaction with SYCE1 and impairing synaptic processes, which are crucial for fertility (Fan2021Homozygous).

## Function
The C14orf39 gene, also known as SIX6OS1, encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the synaptonemal complex (SC) in human cells. This complex is essential for the synapsis of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, a critical process for successful gamete formation and fertility. C14orf39 is located in the spermatocyte nuclei and displays linear signals in spermatocytes with a typical sex body, indicating its role as a central element (CE) component of the SC (Fan2021Homozygous).

The protein encoded by C14orf39 interacts specifically with SYCE1, another central element protein, through its a-helical domain. This interaction is vital for the proper formation of synaptic complexes and the assembly of the SC, facilitating crossover formation and gamete production (Fan2021Homozygous). Mutations in C14orf39 can lead to synaptic defects and meiotic arrest, resulting in conditions such as non-obstructive azoospermia and premature ovarian insufficiency, highlighting its importance in maintaining the integrity of meiotic processes (Fan2021Homozygous).

In healthy human cells, C14orf39 is essential for the proper progression through meiotic prophase I, ensuring complete synapsis and the formation of a typical sex body, which are crucial for fertility (Fan2021Homozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C14orf39 gene, also known as SIX6OS1, have been linked to significant reproductive disorders, including non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) in males and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in females. These conditions are associated with disruptions in the synaptonemal complex (SC), a structure essential for meiotic progression. Homozygous mutations in C14orf39 can lead to synaptic defects and meiotic arrest, particularly at the pachytene-like stage, due to incomplete synapsis of homologous chromosomes (Fan2021Homozygous; Zhang2022Alterations).

In a study involving a consanguineous Pakistani family and two Chinese men, researchers identified a frameshift mutation (c.204_205del) and a nonsense mutation (c.958G>T) in C14orf39, which were absent in major genetic databases, indicating their rarity. These mutations result in truncated proteins that impair the formation of polycomplexes with SYCE1, a critical interaction for SC function (Fan2021Homozygous).

The clinical significance of C14orf39 mutations is underscored by their impact on fertility, as evidenced by studies using Six6os1 mutant mice, which exhibit similar reproductive phenotypes to those observed in humans, such as reduced testis size and absence of ovarian follicles (Fan2021Homozygous; GómezH2016C14ORF39SIX6OS1).

## Interactions
The C14orf39 gene, also known as SIX6OS1, encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the synaptonemal complex (SC) during meiosis. This protein specifically interacts with SYCE1, a central element protein of the SC, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fan2021Homozygous; GómezH2016C14ORF39SIX6OS1). The interaction between C14orf39/SIX6OS1 and SYCE1 is mediated by the N-terminal half of the protein, which is highly helical and likely facilitates self-association and binding (GómezH2016C14ORF39SIX6OS1). 

C14orf39/SIX6OS1 does not interact with other SC proteins such as SYCP1, SYCE2, SYCE3, or TEX12 (GómezH2016C14ORF39SIX6OS1). Despite mutations in C14orf39 not disrupting its interaction with SYCE1, these mutations impair the formation of polycomplexes, which are essential for proper synaptonemal complex assembly and function (Fan2021Homozygous). The protein can also form homo-oligomers, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation of differently tagged SIX6OS1 proteins (GómezH2016C14ORF39SIX6OS1). These interactions are critical for the structural integrity of the SC and are essential for meiotic progression and fertility in both mice and humans (Fan2021Homozygous; Zhang2022Alterations).
