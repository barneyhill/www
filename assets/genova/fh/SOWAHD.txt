# SOWAHD

## Overview
The SOWAHD gene encodes the protein sosondowah ankyrin repeat domain family member D, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ankyrin repeat motifs, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions and are involved in various cellular processes. The specific functions of the sosondowah ankyrin repeat domain family member D protein remain to be fully elucidated, but proteins in this family are often implicated in signal transduction pathways and cellular structural integrity. The SOWAHD gene and its encoded protein may play roles in cellular signaling and structural organization, although further research is needed to clarify its precise biological functions and potential implications in human health and disease.
