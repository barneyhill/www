# RETN

## Overview
The RETN gene encodes the protein resistin, a cysteine-rich proinflammatory cytokine primarily involved in metabolic and inflammatory processes. Resistin is categorized as a cytokine due to its role in modulating immune responses and its involvement in various signaling pathways. Unlike in rodents, where resistin is predominantly expressed in adipocytes, in humans, it is mainly produced by immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages (Nagaev2006Human; Kumar2019Resistin). The protein's structure is characterized by a high content of cysteine residues, which are crucial for forming disulfide bonds that stabilize its trimeric quaternary structure (Elkhattabi2019In). Resistin's interaction with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) highlights its role in modulating inflammatory responses, making it a significant factor in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (Li2021Resistin; Jang2017Human). The gene's expression is influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors, and its dysregulation is associated with various clinical conditions, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Kumar2019Resistin).

## Structure
The RETN gene encodes the resistin protein, a cysteine-rich molecule involved in inflammation and insulin resistance. The primary structure of resistin consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, with a notable abundance of cysteine residues, particularly in the C-terminal region, which are crucial for maintaining its structural integrity (Elkhattabi2019In). The secondary structure of resistin includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function (Elkhattabi2019In).

In terms of tertiary structure, resistin is characterized by the folding of its secondary structural elements into a three-dimensional shape, stabilized by disulfide bonds. These disulfide linkages are essential for maintaining the protein's conformation, and mutations affecting these bonds, such as C51Y and C104Y, can lead to significant structural changes and destabilization (Elkhattabi2019In).

Resistin forms a trimer, consisting of three monomers labeled A, B, and C, representing its quaternary structure. The interaction interfaces between these monomers have been studied using computational tools like COCOMAPS, highlighting the importance of these interactions for the protein's stability and function (Elkhattabi2019In). The protein is also involved in various metabolic and inflammatory pathways, as indicated by its protein-protein interaction network (Elkhattabi2019In).

## Function
The human gene RETN encodes the protein resistin, which functions as a systemic immune-derived proinflammatory cytokine. In healthy human cells, resistin is primarily expressed in monocytes, macrophages, and bone marrow cells, rather than adipocytes (Nagaev2006Human; Kumar2019Resistin). Resistin plays a significant role in inflammation by inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-12 through the NF-κB pathway (Filková2009The). It is involved in the modulation of molecular pathways related to metabolic, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases (Filková2009The).

Resistin affects calcium signaling and activates phospholipase C, leading to calcium release from intracellular stores (Filková2009The). It also influences glucose homeostasis by affecting insulin signaling and glucose uptake in adipocytes and skeletal muscles, and by stimulating hepatic glucose output (Filková2009The). The protein's expression is regulated by genetic and epigenetic factors, including specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect its expression levels in monocytes (Kumar2019Resistin). Resistin's role in inflammation and metabolism makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic and inflammatory disorders (Filková2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Altered expression of the RETN gene, which encodes the hormone resistin, is implicated in several metabolic and inflammatory conditions. Elevated levels of resistin are associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that raise the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. This association is due to resistin's role in promoting insulin resistance, a key feature of metabolic syndrome (RETN).

In obesity, resistin levels are often elevated, contributing to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The hormone's pro-inflammatory properties may exacerbate these conditions by promoting chronic low-grade inflammation, a common feature in obesity and diabetes (RETN).

Resistin is also linked to cardiovascular diseases. Its elevated levels are associated with atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Resistin may contribute to the inflammatory processes that underlie atherosclerosis, further increasing cardiovascular risk (RETN).

In rheumatoid arthritis, resistin may play a role in the inflammatory processes that damage joints. Elevated resistin levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis suggest that it could be a contributing factor to the disease's progression and severity (RETN).

## Interactions
Resistin (RETN) interacts with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to modulate inflammatory responses. Human resistin binds directly to TLR4, inhibiting the binding of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the MD2 adaptor protein, which are crucial for triggering proinflammatory signaling pathways. This interaction is primarily mediated through the N-terminal domain of resistin, which fits into the binding pocket of TLR4, effectively blocking LPS-induced inflammation (Jang2017Human).

Resistin's interaction with TLR4 also influences downstream signaling pathways, such as STAT3 and TBK1, promoting anti-inflammatory effects. This is evidenced by reduced TNFα production and increased IL-10 expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with resistin (Jang2017Human).

While resistin has been proposed to interact with adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), studies have not confirmed a direct binding between resistin and CAP1, suggesting that TLR4 is the primary receptor mediating resistin's effects (Li2021Resistin; Jang2017Human). Resistin's interaction with TLR4 is significant in its role as a bidirectional immunomodulatory molecule, affecting both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways (Li2021Resistin).
