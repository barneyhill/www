"The protein encoded by this intronless gene is a G-protein coupled receptor for serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). Ligand binding activates second messengers that inhibit the activity of adenylate cyclase and manage the release of serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine in the brain. The encoded protein may be involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders and therefore is often a target of antidepressant and other psychotherapeutic drugs.
