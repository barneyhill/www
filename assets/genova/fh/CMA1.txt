# CMA1

## Overview
The CMA1 gene encodes chymase 1, a serine protease predominantly expressed in mast cells, where it plays a critical role in various physiological and pathological processes. As a serine protease, chymase 1 is involved in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a key reaction in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance, distinguishing it from the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) pathway (Urata1990Identification). Beyond its cardiovascular functions, chymase 1 contributes to tissue remodeling by activating pro-matrix metalloproteases and cleaving type I procollagen, thus influencing fibrosis and connective tissue dynamics (Kofford1997Cleavage; Tchougounova2005A). The enzyme is stored in an active form within mast cell granules and is released upon cellular activation, where it modulates inflammatory responses and immune functions (Saarinen1994Activation). The clinical significance of CMA1 is underscored by its association with conditions such as asthma, sarcoidosis, and hypertension, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2012Association; Hersberger2010Association; Kruit2006Chymase).

## Structure
The human chymase, encoded by the CMA1 gene, is a serine protease with a well-defined molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, which includes a catalytic triad typical of serine proteases: Ser195, Asp102, and His57 (Arooj2015Finding). The secondary structure of human chymase is characterized by two six-stranded beta-barrels connected by three trans-domain segments, with the catalytic residues located at the junction of these beta-barrels (Arooj2015Finding). 

The tertiary structure of chymase is a three-dimensional conformation that is mostly polar due to the arrangement of main chain carbonyls along the surface (Arooj2015Finding). This structure is stabilized by interactions with glycosaminoglycans during intragranular folding, which is crucial for its biological activity (Atiakshin2019Mast). 

Human chymase may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its apparent molecular weight in SDS-PAGE analysis (Andersson2008The). The protein is stored in an active form within mast cell granules, allowing for rapid enzymatic activity upon release (Atiakshin2019Mast).

## Function
The CMA1 gene encodes chymase 1, a serine protease primarily found in mast cells, where it plays a significant role in various physiological processes. In the cardiovascular system, chymase 1 is a major enzyme responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a peptide hormone crucial for regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance. This conversion occurs in the human heart, where chymase 1 operates as a highly specific angiotensin II-forming enzyme, distinct from the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) pathway (Urata1990Identification).

Chymase 1 is also involved in tissue remodeling and repair. It cleaves type I procollagen to initiate collagen fibril formation, contributing to connective tissue biology and potentially influencing fibrosis pathogenesis (Kofford1997Cleavage). Additionally, chymase 1 activates pro-matrix metalloproteases, such as pro-MMP-9 and pro-MMP-2, which are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis (Tchougounova2005A). This enzyme is stored in mast cell granules and released upon activation, where it can exert its effects in the extracellular environment, influencing processes like inflammation and immune response (Saarinen1994Activation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CMA1 gene, which encodes the enzyme chymase, have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In asthma, particularly atopic asthma, short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphisms in the CMA1 gene have been linked to increased risk. The 39-allele of the CMA1 STR is notably associated with a higher risk of atopic asthma, suggesting a role for mast cell chymase in atopic responses, independent of IgE level modulation (Hersberger2010Association). 

In sarcoidosis, a systemic disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation, CMA1 polymorphisms have been studied in Dutch and Japanese populations. While no direct association with disease susceptibility was found, the -526 C/T genotype was linked to reduced inspiratory vital capacity (iVC), indicating a potential influence on lung function (Kruit2006Chymase).

In the context of essential hypertension, the Hap16 TTTA haplotype of the CMA1 gene was found to be more common in hypertensive patients within the Chinese Han population, suggesting a possible genetic susceptibility to hypertension (Wu2012Association). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CMA1 in various inflammatory and cardiovascular conditions.

## Interactions
Chymase 1 (CMA1) is a serine protease that participates in various interactions with proteins, influencing inflammatory and cardiovascular processes. CMA1 is known to degrade several alarmins, including heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), biglycan, HMGB1, and interleukin-33 (IL-33), which are involved in inflammation regulation. This degradation is specific to chymase and is inhibited by chymostatin, highlighting its role in modulating inflammatory responses (Roy2014Mast).

CMA1 also interacts with human serum albumin (HSA), hydrolyzing it at specific sites, particularly at Tyr-84. This interaction suggests that HSA could be a natural substrate for chymase, especially in conditions of vascular leakage (Raymond2003Albumin).

In addition, CMA1 is involved in the activation of pro-matrix metalloprotease-9 (pro-MMP-9) and pro-matrix metalloprotease-2 (pro-MMP-2), which are crucial for connective tissue remodeling. This activation occurs through specific cleavage sites, indicating CMA1's role in connective tissue homeostasis (Tchougounova2005A).

CMA1 also processes cytokines, such as converting the inactive precursor interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) into its active form, which is significant for initiating inflammatory responses (Mizutani1991Rapid).
