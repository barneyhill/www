# ING3

## Overview
The ING3 gene encodes the protein inhibitor of growth family member 3, which is a critical component of chromatin regulation and transcriptional control. This protein is characterized by a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger motif, which facilitates its binding to methylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a mark associated with active transcription (McClurg2018Human; AguissaTouré2010The). ING3 is a part of the NuA4-Tip60 MYST-HAT complex, playing a significant role in histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, and DNA repair (Smolle2019The; Taheri2022Molecular). Functionally, ING3 acts as a tumor suppressor in various cancers by modulating p53 transcription and promoting apoptosis through p53-dependent pathways (Taheri2022Molecular). However, its role can vary depending on the cancer type, as it may also exhibit oncogenic properties in certain contexts, such as prostate cancer (Nabbi2017ING3). The dual role of ING3 in cancer highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
The ING3 protein is characterized by a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger motif located at its C-terminus, which is crucial for its function in chromatin recognition and transcription regulation. This PHD motif forms an aromatic cage that specifically binds to methylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a mark associated with active transcription (McClurg2018Human; AguissaTouré2010The). The PHD domain's interaction with H3K4me3 involves key residues such as Y362 and W385, with mutations in these residues affecting binding affinity (McClurg2018Human).

The protein is a component of the NuA4-Tip60 MYST-HAT complex, which plays a role in chromatin regulation and is involved in processes like cell growth and apoptosis (Taheri2022Molecular). ING3 also interacts with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes, influencing histone modifications that affect chromatin structure and gene expression (AguissaTouré2010The).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of ING3 are not provided, the protein's functional domains and interactions suggest a complex role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The ING3 gene encodes a protein of 418 amino acids, with splice variants potentially affecting its function and localization (Taheri2022Molecular).

## Function
ING3 is a crucial component of the NuA4-Tip60 MYST-HAT protein complex, which plays a significant role in chromatin regulation. This protein is involved in the acetylation of histones, specifically the N-terminal tails of histones H4 and H2A, which is essential for modulating chromatin structure and gene expression in healthy human cells (Taheri2022Molecular). ING3 is expressed in various mammalian tissues, including the heart, spleen, and muscles, and is notably abundant in oocytes (Taheri2022Molecular).

Functionally, ING3 is involved in regulating cell growth, controlling the cell cycle, and inducing apoptosis. It acts as a tumor suppressor gene, inhibiting growth in various cancers by modulating p53 transcription and promoting apoptosis through p53-dependent pathways (Smolle2019The; Taheri2022Molecular). ING3 also interacts with histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDAC), influencing chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (He2004Phylogenetic; Taheri2022Molecular). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in DNA repair and cellular responses to DNA damage (Taheri2022Molecular). ING3's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the ING3 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In prostate cancer, ING3 acts as an oncogene by enhancing androgen receptor (AR) activity, which promotes cancer growth. High levels of ING3 are associated with aggressive prostate cancers and shorter patient survival, particularly in cases with low AR expression (Nabbi2017ING3). ING3's interaction with the TIP60 lysine acetyltransferase complex enhances AR acetylation and nuclear translocation, contributing to its oncogenic role (Nabbi2017ING3).

In contrast, ING3 is often downregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where its reduced expression is linked to poor overall survival, especially when combined with p53 mutations (Gunduz2008Downregulation). This suggests a tumor suppressor role in these cancers.

In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), ING3 is upregulated and associated with advanced stages and poor prognosis, indicating a potential oncogenic role in this context (BARLAK2023Expression). These findings highlight the complex and context-dependent role of ING3 in cancer progression and prognosis.

## Interactions
ING3 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression and cellular processes. It physically interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells, enhancing AR acetylation and nuclear translocation, which are crucial for AR activation. This interaction is facilitated by ING3's association with the TIP60 complex, a histone acetyltransferase, which promotes AR acetylation and subsequent gene regulation (Nabbi2017ING3).

ING3 also interacts with the DNA-binding domain of AR, suggesting a direct interaction or structural alteration that facilitates binding (Nabbi2017ING3). In addition to its role in AR signaling, ING3 is part of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, which acetylates histones H4 and H2A, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation through histone modifications (Unoki2009ING).

The protein's plant homeodomain (PHD) allows it to bind to methylated H3K4, a modification marking transcription start sites, which is crucial for its role in gene expression regulation (McClurg2018Human). ING3 also interacts with subunits of the TIP60 complex, such as TIP49A, and associates with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), suggesting a role in transcriptional repression (McClurg2018Human).
