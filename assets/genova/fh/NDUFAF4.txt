# NDUFAF4

## Overview
NDUFAF4 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 4, which is a crucial component in the assembly of mitochondrial Complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein functions as an assembly factor, playing a pivotal role in the early stages of Complex I assembly by facilitating the integration of specific subunits and stabilizing assembly intermediates. NDUFAF4 is part of the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex and interacts with other proteins to ensure the proper formation and function of Complex I, which is essential for efficient electron transfer and ATP production in the electron transport chain (Ugarteburu2020Complex; Mckenzie2010Assembly). Deficiencies or mutations in the NDUFAF4 gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and overall mitochondrial function (Baertling2017NDUFAF4; Fassone2012Complex).

## Function
NDUFAF4 is a mitochondrial assembly factor essential for the proper assembly and function of Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) in the electron transport chain. In healthy human cells, NDUFAF4 plays a critical role in the early stages of Complex I assembly by facilitating the integration of specific subunits into the complex. It is involved in anchoring early assembly intermediates to the mitochondrial membrane, particularly those containing the ND1 subunit, which is crucial for the formation of intermediate complexes (Mckenzie2010Assembly; fassone2012biochemical).

NDUFAF4 collaborates with other assembly factors, such as NDUFAF3, to stabilize and promote the maturation of these intermediates into the mature Complex I holo-complex. This process ensures efficient electron transfer and ATP production, which are vital for cellular energy metabolism (Zurita2012Early; fassone2012biochemical). NDUFAF4 is active in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it impacts the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes, contributing to overall organismal energy homeostasis (Ugarteburu2020Complex).

Deficiency in NDUFAF4 leads to specific defects in Complex I assembly, resulting in altered supercomplex stoichiometry and accumulation of assembly intermediates, highlighting its essential role in maintaining mitochondrial function (Baertling2017NDUFAF4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFAF4 gene are associated with severe mitochondrial disorders, primarily due to its role in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I. One of the most significant conditions linked to NDUFAF4 mutations is complex I deficiency, which can manifest as Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and specific MRI findings (Baertling2017NDUFAF4; Fassone2012Complex). Patients with NDUFAF4 mutations often present with early-onset symptoms such as metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, neurological deterioration, and facial dysmorphia. These symptoms can lead to early death, as observed in cases involving consanguineous families (Diaz2011Mitochondrial; Ugarteburu2020Complex).

The mutations in NDUFAF4 result in specific defects in complex I assembly, leading to a marked reduction in complex I structural components and altered supercomplex stoichiometry. This deficiency causes severe mitochondrial dysfunction, affecting energy metabolism and leading to clinical symptoms such as developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and cardiomyopathy (Baertling2017NDUFAF4; Ugarteburu2020Complex). The pathogenicity of these mutations is often confirmed through genetic sequencing and complementation studies, which restore complex I activity in patient fibroblasts (Baertling2017NDUFAF4).

## Interactions
NDUFAF4 is a critical assembly factor involved in the biogenesis of mitochondrial complex I. It interacts with several other proteins to facilitate the assembly and stabilization of this complex. NDUFAF4 is a component of the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex, which includes ACAD9, NDUFAF1, ECSIT, and TMEM126B. This complex plays a crucial role in the assembly of complex I, and all its components are associated with subcomplexes in samples with knockdowns of NDUFAF3 and NDUFAF4 (Murari2021Dissecting).

NDUFAF4 also interacts with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) M protein. The carboxy-terminal globular domain of the M protein is crucial for this interaction, with specific amino acids being critical for binding. Overexpression of NDUFAF4 in HeLa cells decreases VSV G protein expression and VSV titer, indicating that NDUFAF4 inhibits VSV growth. Conversely, knockdown of NDUFAF4 promotes VSV replication, suggesting that NDUFAF4 acts as a cellular antiviral protein against VSV replication through a mechanism independent of the type I interferon response (Pan2021The).

NDUFAF4 is closely associated with NDUFAF3, another complex I assembly factor. Both proteins are involved in the early stages of complex I assembly, particularly in the formation of intermediate complexes, and they remain associated with various intermediates during the assembly process (Mckenzie2010Assembly).
