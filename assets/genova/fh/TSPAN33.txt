# TSPAN33

## Overview
TSPAN33 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 33, a member of the tetraspanin family characterized by four transmembrane domains. Tetraspanin 33 is part of the TspanC8 subgroup, which is distinguished by the presence of eight cysteine residues in its large extracellular loop, playing a crucial role in the regulation of the metalloprotease ADAM10 (Seipold2016The; Matthews2018Regulation). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the maturation and trafficking of ADAM10, which is essential for the cleavage of substrates such as the platelet collagen receptor GPVI and the activation of Notch signaling pathways (Haining2012The; Koo2022The). Tetraspanin 33's interactions and functions are influenced by post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, which may lead to different isoforms with distinct roles (Hochheimer2019Classes; Beckwith2015Tetraspanins). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia, autoimmune conditions, and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Zhu2023A; Beckwith2015Tetraspanins).

## Structure
TSPAN33, a member of the tetraspanin family, is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which are a hallmark of this protein family. It features two extracellular loops, with the larger loop, known as EC2, containing conserved cysteine residues that are crucial for protein folding and interaction (Murru2018Tetraspanins). The EC2 domain is significant for its role in facilitating specific protein interactions, which are essential for the function of tetraspanins (Beckwith2015Tetraspanins).

Post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation and N-linked glycosylation are important for TSPAN33's function. These modifications influence the protein's interactions and assembly, affecting its role in cellular processes (Murru2018Tetraspanins; Beckwith2015Tetraspanins). TSPAN33 is part of the TspanC8 subgroup, which is characterized by eight cysteine residues in the large extracellular loop, playing a critical role in the regulation of the metalloprotease ADAM10 (Seipold2016The; Matthews2018Regulation).

Alternative splicing can lead to different isoforms of tetraspanins, potentially affecting their structure and function, although specific details about TSPAN33 isoforms are not provided (Hochheimer2019Classes). TSPAN33's interactions with ADAM10 are significant for its role in cellular processes, including trafficking and maturation (SaintPol2017Regulation; Matthews2018Regulation).

## Function
TSPAN33, a member of the TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, plays a significant role in regulating the activity and surface expression of ADAM10, a metalloprotease involved in various cellular processes. TSPAN33, along with other TspanC8 tetraspanins, facilitates the maturation and trafficking of ADAM10 to the cell surface, which is crucial for its function in cleaving substrates such as the platelet collagen receptor GPVI (Haining2012The; Koo2022The). In human platelets, TSPAN33, in conjunction with Tspan15, forms a complex with ADAM10 that acts as a "molecular scissor" to cleave GPVI, a process important for platelet activation and arterial thrombosis (Koo2022The).

TSPAN33 also influences Notch signaling, a pathway critical for cell differentiation and development. It has been shown to regulate ADAM10's role in Notch receptor activation, although its effect can vary depending on the cellular context. In some studies, TSPAN33 acts as a negative regulator of Notch signaling, while in others, it may have a positive regulatory role (Jouannet2015TspanC8; SaintPol2017Regulation). This variability suggests that TSPAN33's function is context-dependent, potentially influenced by the presence of other tetraspanins and cellular conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TSPAN33 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In humans, genetic variants of TSPAN33 have been associated with diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, where it is located at a deletion hotspot, although the significance of this is not fully understood (Beckwith2015Tetraspanins). In a genome-wide study, TSPAN33 expression in pancreatic islets was found to be associated with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, indicating a potential role in glucose metabolism and diabetes (SaintPol2017Regulation).

TSPAN33 has also been implicated in the immune system, with high expression levels observed in activated B-cells and certain lymphomas, such as Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Elevated transcripts have been noted in autoimmune conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting its involvement in immune cell activation (Beckwith2015Tetraspanins). In lung adenocarcinoma, TSPAN33 was identified as a hub gene, with genetic mutations and copy number variations potentially influencing tumorigenesis (Zhu2023A).

Furthermore, TSPAN33 plays a role in the cleavage of the platelet collagen receptor GPVI by ADAM10, which is relevant to conditions like coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke (Koo2022The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TSPAN33 in various pathological contexts.

## Interactions
TSPAN33, a member of the TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, is known to interact directly with ADAM10, a disintegrin and metalloprotease. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ADAM10's trafficking, maturation, and cell surface expression. TSPAN33, along with other TspanC8 tetraspanins, facilitates the exit of ADAM10 from the endoplasmic reticulum and increases its presence on the cell surface, which is essential for Notch receptor activation (Dornier2012TspanC8; Haining2012The).

The interaction between TSPAN33 and ADAM10 is direct and does not require palmitoylation, a post-translational modification, as demonstrated by experiments using palmitoylation mutants (Haining2012The). TSPAN33 also plays a role in the cleavage of the platelet collagen receptor GPVI by forming a complex with ADAM10, acting as a molecular scissor. This interaction is significant in the context of platelet activation and has implications for diseases such as cardiovascular disorders (Koo2022The).

TSPAN33's interaction with ADAM10 is conserved across species, including flies and mammals, highlighting its evolutionary importance in cellular signaling pathways (Dornier2012TspanC8).
