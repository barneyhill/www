# DYNLRB1

## Overview
DYNLRB1 is a gene that encodes the dynein light chain roadblock-type 1 protein, a critical component of the dynein motor complex. This protein is categorized as a light chain within the dynein complex and plays a pivotal role in intracellular transport processes, particularly in the retrograde movement of vesicles along microtubules. DYNLRB1 is involved in maintaining spindle pole integrity during mitosis and is essential for proper cell division and chromosome segregation. The protein interacts with various partners, including Rab6 family proteins and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine kinase, facilitating vesicular transport and protein aggregate clearance. Its ubiquitous expression across tissues and specific recruitment to the Golgi apparatus underscore its importance in cellular organization and function (He2023Distinct; Wanschers2007Rab6; Islam2015N-acetyl-D-glucosamine).

## Structure
The DYNLRB1 protein, also known as Roadblock-1, is a component of the dynein motor complex. It is a small protein, approximately 11 kDa in size, and is known to dimerize independently, as demonstrated by X-ray and NMR studies (Rao2024Structure). The primary structure of DYNLRB1 consists of amino acid sequences characteristic of the roadblock-type dynein light chain family. While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the protein's ability to dimerize suggests a quaternary structure involving dimer formation.

DYNLRB1 interacts with the intermediate chain (IC) of the dynein complex, binding downstream of IC's splicing sites and upstream of the WD repeats. This interaction is crucial as it converts the intrinsically disordered peptide of IC into a more ordered conformation, acting as a clamp to maintain the proximity of the heavy chain tails (Rao2024Structure). The protein shares 75% sequence identity with its homolog DYNLRB2, indicating potential structural similarities (He2023Distinct). While specific domains, prominent folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms are not detailed, the protein's role in maintaining spindle pole integrity during mitosis highlights its functional importance (He2023Distinct).

## Function
DYNLRB1 encodes a protein that is a component of the dynein motor complex, which is essential for intracellular transport processes. This protein interacts with Rab6 family proteins, playing a significant role in vesicular transport, particularly in neuronal cells. DYNLRB1 is involved in the retrograde movement of vesicles along microtubules, a process crucial for maintaining cellular organization and function (Wanschers2007Rab6).

In mitotic cells, DYNLRB1 is critical for maintaining spindle pole integrity and ensuring proper spindle bipolarity during cell division. It targets the nuclear mitotic apparatus (NuMA) and suppresses centriole overduplication, which is vital for accurate chromosome segregation (He2023Distinct). DYNLRB1's interaction with dynein intermediate chains and its role in structural changes of the dynein complex are crucial for the activation and function of the dynein motor during cell migration (Islam2020NAcetyldGlucosamine).

DYNLRB1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it is recruited by Rab6 isoforms. This recruitment is nucleotide-dependent, with DYNLRB1 showing a preference for GTP-bound Rab6A and GDP-bound Rab6B (Wanschers2007Rab6).

## Interactions
DYNLRB1, a component of the dynein motor complex, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in intracellular transport and protein aggregate clearance. It binds with N-acetyl-d-glucosamine kinase (NAGK), facilitating the clearance of protein aggregates by promoting their transport to the microtubule-organizing center for degradation via autophagy. This interaction involves the small domain of NAGK and the C-terminal of DYNLRB1, with specific residues identified as the binding site (Ripon2020NacetylDglucosamine; Islam2015N-acetyl-D-glucosamine).

DYNLRB1 also interacts with Rab6 family proteins, including Rab6A, Rab6A', and Rab6B. These interactions are specific and direct, with a preference for GTP-bound Rab6A and GDP-bound Rab6A' and Rab6B. This binding recruits DYNLRB1 to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting a role in stabilizing the dynein complex and facilitating retrograde transport (Wanschers2007Rab6).

In neuronal cells, DYNLRB1 is involved in dendritogenesis, where its interaction with NAGK at Golgi outposts is essential for maintaining dendritic structure. Disruption of this interaction leads to dendritic degeneration, highlighting its importance in neuronal development (Islam2015N-acetyl-D-glucosamine).
