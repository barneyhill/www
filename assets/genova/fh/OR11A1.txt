# OR11A1

## Overview
The OR11A1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 11 subfamily A member 1, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane helical structure, which is essential for their role in signal transduction across cell membranes. OR11A1 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a critical role in the detection of specific odorants, such as 2-ethyl fenchol, contributing to the perception of smell (de2015Structure–odour; PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR11A1 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential roles in other physiological processes, including cell proliferation and migration (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing). The gene's conservation across human populations and its involvement in various clinical conditions, such as preeclampsia and autism spectrum disorders, underscore its biological and medical significance (Wang2010Populationbased; Hirata2023Exploring).

## Structure
The OR11A1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors typically exhibit a seven-transmembrane helical structure, characteristic of GPCRs, which facilitates their role in signal transduction across cell membranes. The primary structure of OR11A1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure is predominantly composed of alpha helices, which are integral to the receptor's ability to span the cell membrane.

The tertiary structure of OR11A1 involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, allowing the receptor to interact with specific odorant molecules. This folding is crucial for the receptor's specificity and sensitivity to different odorants. While the quaternary structure is generally not applicable to olfactory receptors, as they typically function as monomers, the protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. These modifications can influence the receptor's stability, localization, and activity.

The OR11A1 receptor is associated with the detection of specific odorants, such as 2-ethyl fenchol, which has an earthy scent (de2015Structure–odour). The genetic variation in OR11A1 can affect the perceived intensity of these odorants (Trimmer2019Genetic).

## Function
OR11A1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating olfactory signal transduction pathways. OR11A1 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, leading to neuronal responses that contribute to the perception of smell (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing).

The receptor is associated with the detection of 2-ethylfenchol, an odorant related to soil, earth, and peat odors, indicating its role in environmental odor detection (de2021Genetic). The gene is conserved across different human populations and extinct relatives, suggesting its functional importance in olfaction (de2021Genetic).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR11A1 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, where it may participate in various biological processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and chemotaxis. This broader expression pattern suggests that OR11A1 might have functions beyond smell, potentially contributing to other physiological processes (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing).

## Clinical Significance
The OR11A1 gene, encoding an olfactory receptor, has been implicated in several conditions through its altered expression levels. In the context of preeclampsia, a study found that OR11A1 shows a loss of expression with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.75, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.785, suggesting its potential role in predicting this condition (Hirata2023Exploring). This indicates that OR11A1 may be involved in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and gestational hypothyroidism, potentially serving as a biomarker for these conditions.

In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), OR11A1 is located within a region of homozygosity on chromosome 6, which includes a cluster of olfactory receptors. This region has been associated with ASD in a population-based study from Croatia, suggesting that genetic variations in OR11A1 may contribute to the disorder (Wang2010Populationbased).

In cancer research, OR11A1 was identified among the genes more commonly mutated in patients who completely responded to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer, indicating a potential role in cancer treatment response (Bagaria2022Discriminating). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of OR11A1 across different medical conditions.
