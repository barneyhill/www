# PPFIBP1

## Overview
PPFIBP1, or PPFIA binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes the protein liprin-beta-1, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to cell migration and invasion. Liprin-beta-1 is a cytoplasmic protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of focal adhesion dynamics and intracellular signaling pathways. It is notably implicated in cancer biology, where it influences the behavior of glioma and ovarian cancer cells through interactions with key signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src. These interactions facilitate the pro-invasive and migratory capabilities of cancer cells, making PPFIBP1 a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Dong2021PPFIBP1; Bai2020The). Additionally, PPFIBP1 is associated with other pathological conditions, including early-onset breast cancer and congenital microcephaly, highlighting its broader clinical significance (Gilbert2020Retrospective; Shaheen2019Genomic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
PPFIBP1 has been implicated in several diseases, primarily through its role in cancer progression and metastasis. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor, high expression of PPFIBP1 is associated with increased tumor invasion and poor prognosis. The gene promotes glioma cell migration and invasion via the FAK/Src/JNK signaling pathway, enhancing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), which facilitates tumor invasion (Dong2021PPFIBP1). 

In ovarian cancer, PPFIBP1 is part of the miR-194-5p/IGF1R/PPFIBP1 axis, where it contributes to tumorigenesis by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. miR-194-5p downregulates PPFIBP1, and its reduced expression leads to increased PPFIBP1 levels, promoting cancer progression (Bai2020The).

PPFIBP1 is also associated with early-onset breast cancer. Its expression is linked to the age at diagnosis, with higher levels potentially contributing to earlier onset. This association is part of a network involving TP53 and the estrogen receptor, suggesting a role in breast cancer pathogenesis (Gilbert2020Retrospective).

Additionally, PPFIBP1 has been proposed as a novel candidate gene for congenital microcephaly, although its specific role in this condition requires further investigation (Shaheen2019Genomic).

## Interactions
PPFIBP1, also known as liprin-beta-1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as migration and invasion, particularly in glioma and ovarian cancer cells. In glioma cells, PPFIBP1 interacts with SRCIN1, a protein that enhances the phosphorylation of FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and Src, which are crucial for cell migration and invasion. This interaction is significant for the pro-invasive behavior of glioma cells, as inhibitors of phosphorylated Src and FAK can reverse the effects of PPFIBP1 overexpression (Dong2021PPFIBP1).

PPFIBP1 also activates the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway, promoting cell migration and invasion by increasing MMP-2 expression, which degrades the extracellular matrix (Dong2021PPFIBP1). In ovarian cancer, PPFIBP1 is regulated by miR-194-5p, which binds to its 3' untranslated region, leading to its downregulation. This interaction is part of a regulatory axis involving NF-κB, miR-194-5p, IGF1R, and PPFIBP1, which is crucial for ovarian cancer development (Bai2020The). These interactions highlight PPFIBP1's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
