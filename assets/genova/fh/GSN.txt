# GSN

## Overview
The GSN gene encodes the protein gelsolin, a multifunctional actin-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics. Gelsolin is categorized as an actin-modulating protein and is involved in severing, capping, and nucleating actin filaments, processes essential for cellular motility, shape changes, and various other cellular functions (Silacci2004Gelsolin; Sun1999Gelsolin). The protein's activity is modulated by calcium ions, pH, and phosphoinositides, which influence its interaction with actin (Kwiatkowski1999Functions; Feldt2018Structure). Gelsolin exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing of the GSN gene, and it undergoes post-translational modifications that affect its function and localization (Ghoshdastider2013The; Feldt2018Structure). Clinically, mutations in the GSN gene are associated with familial amyloidosis of the Finnish type and other amyloidosis-related conditions, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Schmidt2020Finnish; Efebera2014Novel).

## Structure
Gelsolin (GSN) is a protein composed of six homologous domains, labeled G1 to G6, which are organized into two homologous halves: the N-terminal half (G1-G3) and the C-terminal half (G4-G6) (Ghoshdastider2013The; Feldt2018Structure). The N-terminal half is calcium-free, while the C-terminal half requires calcium for activation (Feldt2018Structure). These domains form a calcium-controlled latch, where the third domain obscures the actin-binding site on the first domain (Ghoshdastider2013The). The protein's structure is derived from gene triplication followed by gene duplication (Ghoshdastider2013The).

Gelsolin has three actin-binding domains: G1, G2, and G4. G1 and G4 bind actin monomers, while G2 binds F-actin filaments (Feldt2018Structure). The protein can sever, cap, and nucleate actin filaments, playing a role in actin polymerization and depolymerization (Feldt2018Structure). Calcium binding induces a conformational change from a compact, inactive form to an active form that can bind actin (Feldt2018Structure).

Gelsolin exists in multiple isoforms, including cytoplasmic GSN (cGSN), plasma GSN (pGSN), and gelsolin-3, which result from alternative splicing of the GSN gene (Feldt2018Structure). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and proteolytic cleavage, which affect its function and localization (Ghoshdastider2013The).

## Function
Gelsolin (GSN) is a multifunctional actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in actin filament dynamics within healthy human cells. It is involved in severing and capping actin filaments, which regulates their assembly and disassembly, essential for cell motility and shape changes (Silacci2004Gelsolin; Sun1999Gelsolin). Gelsolin's activity is regulated by calcium ions, pH, and phosphoinositides, which influence its ability to bind and sever actin filaments (Kwiatkowski1999Functions; Feldt2018Structure).

In cellular processes, gelsolin is active in both the cytoplasm and extracellular space, contributing to wound healing and inflammation (Silacci2004Gelsolin). It modulates actin dynamics, which is vital for various cellular functions, including cell motility, phagocytosis, and platelet formation (Silacci2004Gelsolin). Gelsolin also interacts with signaling pathways, affecting phosphoinositide signaling and apoptosis regulation (Kwiatkowski1999Functions; Sun1999Gelsolin).

In the immune system, gelsolin plays roles in macrophage recruitment and motility, as well as in phagocytosis, particularly in collagen-induced and IgG-opsonised phagocytosis (Feldt2018Structure). Its involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GSN gene are primarily associated with familial amyloidosis of the Finnish type (FAF), also known as Meretoja syndrome. This condition is characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils derived from misfolded gelsolin fragments, leading to symptoms such as corneal lattice dystrophy, cranial and peripheral neuropathy, and cutis laxa (Schmidt2020Finnish; Chastan2005Cardiac). The most common mutations linked to FAF are c.640G>A and c.640G>T, with the former having a 100% penetrance (Schmidt2020Finnish). 

A novel mutation, c.633C>A, encoding the p.N211K protein variant, has been identified and is associated with renal amyloidosis and nephrotic syndrome, expanding the clinical spectrum of gelsolin-related amyloidosis (Efebera2014Novel). Other mutations, such as p.Asp214Asn, disrupt calcium binding, leading to increased enzymatic cleavage and amyloid deposits (Mullany2021A).

Altered expression of gelsolin is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Gelsolin can bind to amyloid-beta protein, inhibiting its fibrillation and promoting clearance, suggesting a neuroprotective role. Mutations in the GSN gene may reduce this protective effect, potentially contributing to AD pathogenesis (Jiang2020Analyses; Feldt2018Structure).

## Interactions
Gelsolin (GSN) is a multifunctional protein that interacts with various proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It binds to actin filaments through its six domains, facilitating actin filament severing, capping, and nucleation. This interaction is regulated by calcium ions, pH, and phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which can uncapping actin filaments for polymerization (Li2010Multifunctional; Feldt2018Structure).

GSN interacts with the androgen receptor, enhancing its transcriptional activity by binding to its C-terminal ligand-binding domain and central DNA-binding domain (Li2010Multifunctional). It also interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), colocalizing in the nuclei during hypoxia, which may influence apoptosis (Li2010Multifunctional).

In the context of apoptosis, GSN is cleaved by caspase-3, producing fragments that modulate apoptotic pathways. The N-terminal fragment can sever actin and disrupt the actin-DNase I interaction, enhancing apoptosis, while the C-terminal fragment, in combination with PIP2, exhibits anti-apoptotic behavior (Li2010Multifunctional; Feldt2018Structure).

GSN also interacts with amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins in Alzheimer's disease, inhibiting their fibrillation and aiding in their removal from the brain (Feldt2018Structure). These interactions highlight GSN's diverse roles in cellular dynamics and disease processes.
