# ZNF853

## Overview
ZNF853 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 853, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are integral to the protein's ability to bind DNA, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and epigenetic modifications. The zinc finger protein 853 is involved in metal ion binding, which is essential for its structural stability and function (Biase2017Oocyte). It has been identified in studies related to age-related epigenetic changes, particularly in human sperm, suggesting a role in the regulation of gene expression as individuals age (Bernhardt2023Agerelated). Additionally, ZNF853 has been studied in the context of CRISPR technology, where it was noted for its minimal off-target effects in Huntington's disease models, indicating its potential utility in genetic research without significant unintended consequences (Morelli2022An; Seo2023DNA). Despite these findings, the specific functions of ZNF853 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure
ZNF853 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capabilities. These domains are typically rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which are essential for coordinating zinc ions and stabilizing the protein structure. The primary structure of ZNF853 includes these residues, contributing to its functional conformation.

The secondary structure of ZNF853 likely comprises alpha helices and beta sheets, common features in zinc finger proteins that facilitate the formation of the finger-like projections necessary for DNA interaction. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these zinc finger domains, allowing the protein to achieve its functional conformation for DNA binding. While quaternary structures are less common in zinc finger proteins, the specific arrangement of ZNF853 in a quaternary structure, if present, is not detailed in the available information.

Post-translational modifications of ZNF853 may include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can influence the protein's stability, localization, and interaction with other molecules. These modifications are typical in regulating the activity and function of zinc finger proteins, although specific sites and effects in ZNF853 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
ZNF853 is a zinc finger protein that is part of a cluster functionally related to 'cation binding,' 'nucleic acid binding,' or 'metal ion binding' in human oocytes. This suggests that ZNF853 may play a role in binding metal ions, which is a common function of zinc finger proteins due to their structural configuration that allows interaction with DNA and other molecules (Biase2017Oocyte). 

In the context of age-related changes, ZNF853 has been identified among genes with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in human sperm, indicating potential involvement in epigenetic regulation as individuals age. However, specific details on its function in healthy cells were not provided (Bernhardt2023Agerelated).

ZNF853 was also mentioned in studies exploring off-target effects of CRISPR technologies in Huntington's disease models. Although it was identified as a differentially expressed gene in these contexts, the studies did not associate it with adult-onset neurological disorders, suggesting minimal off-target effects and implying that its primary functions may not be directly related to these conditions (Morelli2022An; Seo2023DNA). 

Overall, while ZNF853 is implicated in several molecular processes, specific details about its role in healthy human cells remain limited.
