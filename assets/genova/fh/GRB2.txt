# GRB2

## Overview
The GRB2 gene encodes the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2, a pivotal adaptor protein involved in signal transduction pathways. This protein is characterized by its non-catalytic nature and modular structure, comprising one Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain and two Src Homology 3 (SH3) domains. These domains facilitate GRB2's role as a molecular bridge, linking activated receptor tyrosine kinases to downstream signaling molecules, thereby playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and survival (Ackermann2011Grb2; Li1994A). GRB2 is ubiquitously expressed and is essential in various signaling pathways, including the Ras-MAPK pathway, which is vital for numerous cellular functions. Its interactions are critical in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in cellular signaling and potential as a therapeutic target (Majumder2017Cellular; Giubellino2008Grb2).

## Structure
The GRB2 protein is a non-catalytic adaptor protein with a molecular weight of 25 kDa, consisting of 217 amino acids. It features a modular structure with a central Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain flanked by two Src Homology 3 (SH3) domains, forming a distinctive 'sandwich structure' (Wang2024The). The SH2 domain, located between residues 60-152, binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues, facilitating interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases and other signaling molecules (Wang2024The; Sandouk2023GRB2). The SH3 domains, positioned at residues 1-58 and 156-215, interact with proline-rich motifs, such as PxxP motifs, and are crucial for binding to proteins like SOS, which is involved in Ras activation (Wang2024The; Kohda1994Solution).

The tertiary structure of the GRB2 SH2 domain includes a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by two α-helices, with additional β-strands extending the central β-sheet (Ogura2008Solution). The C-SH3 domain consists of six β-strands forming two β-sheets, with a hydrophobic core and a surface hydrophobic patch (Kohda1994Solution). GRB2 can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with dimerization mediated by SH2 domain-swapping, which is critical for its role in T cell signaling (Sandouk2023GRB2). Phosphorylation at Tyr160 can disrupt dimerization, influencing GRB2's quaternary structure and function (Ahmed2015Grb2).

## Function
GRB2 is a ubiquitously expressed adaptor protein that plays a critical role in cellular signaling pathways. It is composed of one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, which enable it to function as a bridge between activated receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling molecules. The SH2 domain of GRB2 binds to specific phosphotyrosine residues on activated receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), while the SH3 domains interact with proline-rich sequences on intracellular proteins like the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos. This interaction facilitates the activation of the Ras signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth, differentiation, and survival (Suen1993Molecular; Li1994A).

In T cells, GRB2 is essential for the formation of linker for activation of T cells (LAT) signaling clusters, which are necessary for the activation of MAP kinases, calcium flux, and the recruitment of PLC-γ1. These processes are vital for cytokine production and T cell receptor-mediated functions (Bilal2015GRB2). GRB2 also plays a role in B-cell receptor signaling, where it regulates calcium signaling and is involved in the maturation and survival of B cells (Ackermann2011Grb2; Jang2009Grb2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GRB2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein interacts with the GRB2 SH2 domain, linking it to the Ras pathway, which is a potential therapeutic target for patients resistant to treatments like Imatinib (Giubellino2008Grb2). GRB2 is overexpressed in breast cancer, enhancing MAPK pathway signaling and contributing to tumor development and metastasis (Giubellino2008Grb2). In prostate cancer, GRB2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and shorter recurrence-free survival, impacting pathways such as Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT (Iwata2021A).

GRB2 also plays a role in neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD), where its overexpression can stabilize cytoskeletal proteins and prevent degradation under AD-like conditions (Majumder2017Cellular). In diabetic retinopathy, genetic variations near the GRB2 gene have been linked to the disease, suggesting its involvement in retinal stress response (Burdon2015Genomewide). Despite its involvement in various conditions, no pathogenic mutations of GRB2 were identified in Silver-Russell syndrome, indicating its high conservation and lack of association with this phenotype (Hitchins2002Investigation).

## Interactions
The GRB2 protein is a key adaptor in signal transduction, primarily interacting with other proteins through its SH2 and SH3 domains. It binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) via its SH2 domain, facilitating the recruitment of the Son of Sevenless (SOS) protein, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, to the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway (Wang2024The; Belov2012Grb2).

GRB2 also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β-receptor, binding to specific phosphorylated tyrosine sites (Wang2024The). It forms complexes with proteins like Cbl and dynamin II through its SH3 domains, which recognize proline-rich motifs (Wang2024The).

In T cell signaling, GRB2 participates in the assembly of the LAT signalosome, a complex critical for cytokine production. This process involves GRB2 dimerization through SH2 domain-swapping, which enhances LAT phosphorylation and clustering (Sandouk2023GRB2). GRB2's interactions are dynamic, with its monomeric form being active in signaling, while dimerization can inhibit certain pathways (Ahmed2015Grb2).
