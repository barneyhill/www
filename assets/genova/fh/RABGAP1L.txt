# RABGAP1L

## Overview
RABGAP1L is a gene that encodes the RAB GTPase activating protein 1-like, a crucial regulator of intracellular membrane trafficking. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases, specifically inactivating Rab22A, which is vital for the maturation and identity of early endosomes (Qu2016AnkyrinB). RABGAP1L is involved in the polarized recycling of integrins, a process essential for directional cell migration and various cellular functions, including wound healing and tissue repair (Qu2016AnkyrinB). The protein interacts with several other proteins, such as Ankyrin-B and TUFT1, influencing endosomal dynamics and mTORC1 signaling, respectively (Kawasaki2018TUFT1; Qu2016AnkyrinB). Clinically, RABGAP1L has been linked to platelet dysfunction and certain cancers, where its expression and interactions play significant roles in disease pathology and progression (Golden2021The; Sun2007Decreased).

## Function
RABGAP1L is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular membrane trafficking by acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases. It specifically inactivates Rab22A by promoting its GDP-bound configuration, which is essential for the maturation and identity of early endosomes (Qu2016AnkyrinB). RABGAP1L is recruited to PI3P-positive organelles by Ankyrin-B (AnkB), where it facilitates the polarized recycling of α5β1-integrin, a process vital for directional cell migration, particularly in fibroblasts (Qu2016AnkyrinB). This interaction is significant for maintaining the dynamics of integrin trafficking, which is crucial for processes such as wound healing and tissue repair (Qu2016AnkyrinB).

In healthy human cells, RABGAP1L's function extends to regulating endosomal dynamics and membrane trafficking, impacting cellular organization and signaling. It is active in various cellular compartments, including early endosomes, where it influences the transport and recycling of specific cargos, such as integrins and potentially other endocytic cargos (Qu2016AnkyrinB). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining the directional migration of cells, which is important in processes like cancer cell metastasis and neuronal migration (Qu2016AnkyrinB).

## Clinical Significance
RABGAP1L has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular processes. In the context of platelet dysfunction, RABGAP1L expression is significantly downregulated in patients with a CBFA2 mutation, which is associated with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction. This downregulation may contribute to the observed platelet abnormalities, highlighting its potential role in the pathology of conditions involving platelet dysfunction (Sun2007Decreased).

In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-positive subtypes, RABGAP1L interacts with the oncogene AAMDC. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which is important for tumor growth. The knockdown of RABGAP1L in breast cancer cells reduces AKT signaling, suggesting its involvement in cancer cell metabolism and proliferation. The interaction between AAMDC and RABGAP1L could be a potential therapeutic target, as it influences cancer signaling networks and may affect treatment outcomes (Golden2021The).

These findings indicate that alterations in RABGAP1L expression or its interactions can have significant clinical implications, particularly in disorders related to platelet function and certain types of cancer.

## Interactions
RABGAP1L interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes through these interactions. It is known to interact with Ankyrin-B (AnkB), a multi-domain protein that recruits RABGAP1L to PI3P-positive organelles involved in endosomal trafficking. This interaction is mediated by the death domain of AnkB and is crucial for the recycling of α5β1-integrins, which is essential for directional cell migration (Qu2016AnkyrinB). RABGAP1L also interacts with the oncogene AAMDC, where it binds through its phosphotyrosine binding domain. This interaction is significant in luminal cancer cells and involves various Rab proteins, including Rab7a, which is implicated in endosomal trafficking (Golden2021The).

Additionally, RABGAP1L interacts with TUFT1, a protein involved in mTORC1 signaling. This interaction affects lysosomal positioning and vesicular trafficking, which are crucial for mTORC1 activation. TUFT1 enhances the GAP activity of RABGAP1L on Rab36, suggesting a regulatory mechanism in mTORC1 signaling and cancer progression (Kawasaki2018TUFT1). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of RABGAP1L in cellular signaling and trafficking pathways.
