# ABHD17B

## Overview
ABHD17B is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 17B, a member of the serine hydrolase family known for its depalmitoylase activity. This protein plays a critical role in the dynamic regulation of protein palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that affects protein localization and function within cells. ABHD17B is particularly involved in the depalmitoylation of N-Ras, a small GTPase that is integral to cell signaling pathways. The protein's activity is essential for maintaining proper cellular signaling and membrane dynamics, especially at the plasma membrane. Beyond its enzymatic role, ABHD17B has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including fibrotic diseases and cancer, where it influences cellular processes such as cytoskeleton regulation and cell adhesion (Remsberg2021ABHD17; Li2023Screening; Lin2015ABHD17).

## Structure
The ABHD17B protein is part of the ABHD17 family, which includes serine hydrolase proteins known for their depalmitoylase activity. The primary structure of ABHD17B involves a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its enzymatic function (Li2023Screening). The secondary structure of ABHD17B includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are typical of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family. This structure is characterized by a core of alternating alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Li2023Screening).

The tertiary structure of ABHD17B involves the overall 3D folding of the protein, which includes the formation of a catalytic triad typical of alpha-beta hydrolases. This triad is formed by Ser170, Asp235, and His264, with Ser170 identified as the active residue for depalmitoylation (Li2023Screening). Mutation of Ser170 to alanine disrupts the depalmitoylase activity, highlighting its importance in the protein's function (Li2023Screening).

While the quaternary structure is not detailed in the provided context, the protein's depalmitoylase activity and interaction with other proteins suggest a role in complex cellular processes, such as regulating cytoskeleton and adhesion pathways (Li2023Screening).

## Function
ABHD17B is a member of the ABHD17 family of serine hydrolases, which function as protein depalmitoylases. These enzymes are involved in the removal of palmitate groups from proteins, a process known as depalmitoylation, which is crucial for regulating protein localization and function within cells (Lin2015ABHD17). ABHD17B, along with its isoforms ABHD17A and ABHD17C, plays a significant role in the depalmitoylation of N-Ras, a small GTPase involved in cell signaling. This activity influences the subcellular localization of N-Ras, affecting its trafficking and signaling pathways (Remsberg2021ABHD17; Lin2015ABHD17).

In healthy human cells, ABHD17B is active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in the regulation of dynamic palmitoylation processes, which are essential for maintaining proper protein localization and function (Lin2015ABHD17). The enzyme's activity is particularly important at the plasma membrane, where it helps regulate the palmitoylation state of proteins, thereby influencing cellular signaling and membrane dynamics (Remsberg2021ABHD17). The precise role of ABHD17B in healthy cells, beyond its involvement in N-Ras depalmitoylation, remains an area of ongoing research (Remsberg2020ABHD17).

## Clinical Significance
ABHD17B has been identified as a significant target in the context of fibrotic diseases. Alterations in its expression are linked to liver fibrosis, where it plays a role in maintaining the fibrotic phenotype of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Depletion of ABHD17B in these cells leads to reduced activation and decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as COL1A1 and ACTA2, suggesting its involvement in promoting fibrosis (Li2023Screening). In mouse models, loss of Abhd17b has been shown to protect against liver fibrosis, indicating its necessity for a robust fibrotic response (Li2023Screening).

Beyond liver fibrosis, ABHD17B also influences fibrotic processes in lung fibroblasts, where its depletion reduces collagen expression, highlighting its broader role in fibrotic conditions (Li2023Screening). Despite its known depalmitoylase activity, this function is not required for its pro-fibrotic role, suggesting that ABHD17B may influence fibrosis through other pathways, such as those involving the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion (Li2023Screening).

In cancer, ABHD17B is involved in the regulation of N-Ras palmitoylation, a process crucial for N-Ras-dependent cancer growth. Inhibitors targeting ABHD17B have shown potential in reducing cancer cell growth, particularly in NRAS-mutant cancers (Remsberg2021ABHD17; Remsberg2020ABHD17).
