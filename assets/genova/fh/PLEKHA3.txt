# PLEKHA3

## Overview
PLEKHA3 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology domain containing A3, which is involved in intracellular membrane trafficking and cellular signaling processes. The protein is characterized by its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which allows it to interact with phosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), and participate in the regulation of membrane dynamics. PLEKHA3 plays a role in the recruitment of trans-Golgi network (TGN)-derived vesicles to autophagic vacuoles during bacterial infections, thereby contributing to autophagy-mediated defense mechanisms (Nakajima2018RAB30). Additionally, it is involved in the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate by acting as a bridge between ER-localized Sac1 and Golgi-localized PI4P, although its role in inflammasome signaling appears to be limited (Hollingsworth2024Spatiotemporal).

## Function


## Interactions
PLEKHA3, also known as pleckstrin homology domain containing A3, is involved in various protein interactions within cellular compartments. It is proposed to function as a bridge between ER-localized Sac1 and Golgi-localized PI4P, facilitating the dephosphorylation of PI4P by Sac1. However, knockout studies in iBMDMs and THP-1 macrophages showed that the absence of PLEKHA3 did not significantly affect the NLRP3 inflammasome response, suggesting that its role in inflammasome signaling might be limited or redundant (Hollingsworth2024Spatiotemporal).

PLEKHA3 is also implicated in the recruitment of trans-Golgi network (TGN)-derived vesicles to GAS-containing autophagic vacuoles (GcAVs) during Group A Streptococcus infection. It colocalizes with TGN markers and surrounds GAS, indicating its involvement in autophagy-mediated restriction of bacterial growth. This process is crucial for the incorporation of TGN-derived elements into GcAVs, with PLEKHA3 interacting with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) on the TGN membrane (Nakajima2018RAB30).

These interactions highlight PLEKHA3's role in intracellular membrane trafficking and its potential involvement in cellular responses to infections and signaling pathways.
