# PARP12

## Overview
PARP12 is a gene that encodes the protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 12, which is part of the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in mono-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification critical for various cellular processes, including intracellular membrane trafficking and stress responses. Structurally, PARP12 contains a PARP catalytic domain, WWE domains, and zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, contributing to its roles in translation inhibition and antiviral defense (Atasheva2014InterferonStimulated; Almeleebia2022Identification; Suskiewicz2023Updated). The protein's ability to translocate to stress granules under stress conditions and its interactions with viral proteins underscore its significance in cellular stress responses and immune functions (Catara2017PARP1produced; Li2018PARP12).

## Structure
PARP12 is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family and is characterized by several distinct structural domains. It contains a PARP catalytic domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, specifically mono-ADP-ribosylation (Atasheva2014InterferonStimulated; Almeleebia2022Identification). The protein also features a WWE domain, which is involved in recognizing poly(ADP-ribose) chains and is a common interaction module in ubiquitination and ADP-ribosylation processes (Suskiewicz2023Updated; Li2021ADPribosyltransferase). 

PARP12 includes a unique arrangement called MZAP, composed of a CCCH-type zinc finger (ZnF) and two WWE domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Amé2004The; Suskiewicz2023Updated). The presence of zinc finger motifs suggests a role in RNA binding and regulation of cellular processes (Amé2004The). 

The protein's structure allows it to form complexes with ribosomes, indicating a role in translation inhibition and antiviral activity (Atasheva2014InterferonStimulated). PARP12 also interacts with other proteins, such as PARP11, to enhance its antiviral functions (Li2021ADPribosyltransferase). The structural flexibility of PARP12, compared to other PARPs, may relate to its diverse functional interactions (Suskiewicz2023Updated).

## Function
PARP12 is a member of the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) family, primarily involved in mono-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification that plays a crucial role in intracellular membrane traffic. In healthy human cells, PARP12 localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is essential for the transport of E-cadherin from the TGN to the plasma membrane. This process is mediated through the mono-ADP-ribosylation of Golgin-97, a substrate of PARP12, which is necessary for the proper exocytosis of E-cadherin. The absence of this modification results in the accumulation of E-cadherin in a trans-Golgi proximal compartment, disrupting its transport to the plasma membrane (Grimaldi2020PARP12catalyzed).

PARP12 also plays a role in cellular stress responses. Under stress conditions, it translocates from the Golgi complex to stress granules, a process driven by the activation of PARP1 and the release of poly-ADP-ribose. This translocation is associated with the fragmentation of the Golgi complex and impaired membrane transport, which can be reversed by alleviating the stress condition (Catara2017PARP1produced).

## Clinical Significance
PARP12 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular stress responses and immune functions. Alterations in PARP12 expression or mutations can contribute to cancer progression, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PARP12 acts as a tumor suppressor by interacting with FHL2 and regulating its stability. Deficiency in PARP12 leads to increased TGF-β1 transcription, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhancing HCC metastasis (Shao2018PARP12). 

In the context of viral infections, PARP12 plays a crucial role in suppressing Zika virus (ZIKV) replication. It mediates the degradation of viral proteins NS1 and NS3 through its PARP domain, highlighting its antiviral defense capabilities. Alterations in PARP12 expression or mutations affecting its PARP domain could impact its ability to control ZIKV infection (Li2018PARP12).

PARP12 is also involved in cellular stress responses, where it translocates to stress granules under oxidative stress, impacting intracellular trafficking and potentially contributing to degenerative disorders. This translocation is linked to the impairment of Golgi complex functions and inhibition of anterograde membrane traffic (Catara2017PARP1produced).

## Interactions
PARP12 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular stress responses and antiviral defense. It translocates to stress granules in response to oxidative stress, a process facilitated by its interaction with poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) through its WWE domain. This interaction is essential for its recruitment to stress granules and is independent of eIF2α modification (Catara2017PARP1produced). 

PARP12 also interacts with Golgin-97, a substrate for PARP12-catalyzed mono-ADP-ribosylation, which is crucial for the exocytosis of E-cadherin. This interaction highlights PARP12's role in regulating basolateral cargo transport from the trans-Golgi network (Grimaldi2020PARP12catalyzed). 

In the context of antiviral defense, PARP12 interacts with Zika virus nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS3, mediating their ADP-ribosylation and subsequent degradation, thereby inhibiting viral replication (Li2018PARP12). 

PARP12's interactions extend to the translation machinery, where it associates with mRNA and induces translational repression by tethering to the 3'UTR of mRNA, blocking its expression (Welsby2014PARP12). These interactions underscore PARP12's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
