# DMGDH

## Overview
The DMGDH gene encodes the enzyme dimethylglycine dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial flavoprotein involved in the metabolism of dimethylglycine, a derivative of glycine. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the choline and one-carbon metabolism pathways by catalyzing the oxidative demethylation of N,N-dimethylglycine to sarcosine, which is essential for the formation of 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (THF) and the prevention of toxic formaldehyde accumulation (Leys2003Channelling). As a flavoprotein, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase contains a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, which is integral to its catalytic function (Cook1985The; Cook1984Identification). The enzyme's interaction with electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) facilitates electron transfer to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, underscoring its role in energy metabolism (Henriques2021Electron). Mutations in the DMGDH gene can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining metabolic balance and human health (Yu2016Whole; Guo2017Genetic).

## Structure
Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a role in the metabolism of dimethylglycine. The enzyme is a flavoprotein containing a covalently bound FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) cofactor, which is linked to a histidine residue at the 8a position of the isoalloxazine ring (Cook1985The; Cook1984Identification). The primary structure of DMGDH includes a sequence of amino acids, with the flavin-peptide sequence identified as His(flavin)-Ala-Ala-Gly-Leu (Cook1985The).

The secondary structure of DMGDH is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, but it likely includes common elements such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of many proteins. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its enzymatic function, although specific details are not provided in the context.

DMGDH shares structural similarities with other enzymes like sarcosine dehydrogenase, as indicated by significant homology in their amino acid sequences (Cook1985The). The enzyme may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

## Function
Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in the metabolism of dimethylglycine, a derivative of the amino acid glycine. In healthy human cells, DMGDH is involved in the choline and 1-carbon metabolism pathways. It catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of N,N-dimethylglycine to sarcosine, a process that is crucial for the formation of 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (THF) from THF and a labile iminium intermediate. This reaction is important for preventing the formation of toxic formaldehyde, thereby maintaining cellular health and metabolic balance (Leys2003Channelling).

The enzyme binds flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) covalently and operates in a reductive half-reaction, which is essential for its catalytic activity. The structure of related enzymes, such as dimethylglycine oxidase (DMGO), reveals a channelling mechanism that links substrate oxidation to the formation of 5,10-methylene-THF, avoiding the production of harmful byproducts (Leys2003Channelling). Proper function of DMGDH is crucial for maintaining metabolic balance, and mutations in related enzymes can lead to metabolic disorders, underscoring the importance of DMGDH in human health (Leys2003Channelling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DMGDH gene can lead to dimethylglycine dehydrogenase deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of dimethylglycine in the blood and urine. This condition is associated with neurological and developmental issues due to the disruption in the metabolism of dimethylglycine (Yu2016Whole; Guo2017Genetic). The DMGDH gene has also been implicated in the risk of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP), particularly in Hispanic populations. Variants in the DMGDH gene, as part of the BHMT/BHMT2/DMGDH gene cluster, have been associated with altered metabolite levels in maternal sera, which may influence CLP risk (Marini2016Sequence). Additionally, the DMGDH gene is involved in selenium metabolism, and its polymorphisms can affect baseline selenium status, although no direct link to psoriasis was found (Dębniak2024Selenium). The gene's role in trimethylamine metabolism has also been explored, with potential contributions to trimethylaminuria, a condition characterized by a fishy body odor, although this connection remains speculative (Guo2017Genetic).

## Interactions
DMGDH (dimethylglycine dehydrogenase) is involved in the metabolism of dimethylglycine and plays a role in mitochondrial energy metabolism. It interacts with electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF), which acts as an electron acceptor for DMGDH and other dehydrogenases involved in choline metabolism. This interaction facilitates electron transfer to the electron transport chain via ETF:QO and Coenzyme Q10, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Henriques2021Electron).

The oxidation of the FAD cofactor in human ETF to its 8-formyl-derivative enhances its affinity to DMGDH, suggesting a potential modulatory role in ETF's interaction with redox partners (Henriques2021Electron). This interaction is part of a broader network where ETF serves as a hub for electron transfer from various flavoenzymes to the respiratory chain, playing a significant role in fatty acid oxidation and amino acid degradation (Henriques2021Electron).

DMGDH is also involved in the conversion of dimethylglycine to glycine, a process linked to one-carbon metabolism and the synthesis of glutathione, a major antioxidant. This pathway is crucial for cellular oxidative stress management and is connected to the metabolism of choline (Lemire2015Glutathione).
