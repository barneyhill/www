# VEGFD

## Overview
Vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGFD) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the platelet-derived growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (PDGF/VEGF) family, which plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. The protein product, VEGF-D, is a secreted glycoprotein that primarily functions by binding to and activating the tyrosine kinase receptors VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, which are integral to vascular development and function (Achen1998Vascular). VEGF-D is characterized by a central VEGF homology domain (VHD) and is initially synthesized as a precursor that undergoes proteolytic processing to become a mature form, predominantly existing as a non-covalent dimer (Stacker1999Biosynthesis). This protein is crucial for endothelial cell proliferation and migration, influencing the growth and maintenance of blood and lymphatic vessels, and is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression (PaquetFifield2013Vascular).

## Structure
The vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) protein is characterized by a central VEGF homology domain (VHD) flanked by long N- and C-terminal extensions. The VHD is crucial for its biological function, as it binds and activates the endothelial cell tyrosine kinase receptors VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 (Stacker1999Biosynthesis). The VHD contains a cystine knot motif, essential for maintaining the protein's tertiary structure (Stacker1999Biosynthesis). 

VEGF-D is initially synthesized as a precursor protein and undergoes proteolytic processing to release the mature form, which consists solely of the VHD. This mature form exists predominantly as a non-covalent dimer, unlike other VEGF family members that typically form disulfide-bonded homodimers (Stacker1999Biosynthesis). The mature VEGF-D structure includes an antiparallel 4-stranded β-sheet, three connecting loops, and an N-terminal α-helix, forming an antiparallel homodimer stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bridges (Leppänen2011Structural).

Post-translational modifications of VEGF-D include glycosylation, which affects its solubility and crystallization. Glycosylation mutants have been studied to understand their impact on the protein's structure and function (Davydova2012Preparation). The N-terminal α-helix is particularly important for receptor binding, with specific residues playing a critical role in interaction with VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 (Davydova2016Differential).

## Function
VEGFD, or vascular endothelial growth factor D, is a protein that plays a significant role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, processes crucial for the formation and maintenance of blood and lymphatic vessels. In healthy human cells, VEGFD primarily functions by binding to and activating VEGF receptors 2 (VEGFR-2) and 3 (VEGFR-3), which are tyrosine kinase receptors involved in vascular development and function (Achen1998Vascular). 

VEGFD is a mitogen for endothelial cells, promoting their proliferation and migration, which is essential for the growth and maintenance of the vascular system (Achen1998Vascular). It is particularly involved in the modulation of lymphatic vessels, influencing their size and function, which is crucial for efficient lymphatic transport and fluid homeostasis (PaquetFifield2013Vascular). 

In osteoblasts, VEGFD activates VEGFR-3, leading to osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, highlighting its role in bone health (Orlandini2006Vascular). VEGFD's signaling pathways also involve interactions with neuropilin receptors and integrins, suggesting roles in cell adhesion and migration (Achen2012Vascular). These molecular activities underscore VEGFD's importance in maintaining vascular and lymphatic system integrity in healthy tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VEGFD gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and breast cancer. In colorectal carcinoma, VEGF-D expression is associated with tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis, suggesting its role in tumor progression and metastasis (Onogawa2004Expression). In NSCLC, moderate to high expression of VEGF-D is linked to improved survival outcomes in patients with advanced-stage disease, although its expression is generally down-regulated in lung cancers (Carrillo2009Prognostic). In breast cancer, VEGF-D expression is associated with hypoxia-inducible factors but does not correlate with lymph node metastasis or survival outcomes, indicating a complex role in cancer progression (Currie2004Expression).

VEGF-D is involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, processes critical for tumor growth and metastasis. Its expression is regulated by factors such as hypoxia and estrogen, which can influence its role in cancer (Currie2004Expression). Despite its involvement in these processes, the prognostic significance of VEGF-D varies across different cancer types and stages, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand its clinical implications.

## Interactions
VEGFD interacts with the tyrosine kinase receptors VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, which are crucial for its role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. In humans, VEGFD binds to and activates both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, leading to endothelial cell proliferation and migration (Baldwin2001The; Leppänen2011Structural). The binding of VEGFD to VEGFR-2 involves specific residues such as Asn147 and Glu149, which are positioned to interact with VEGFR-2 domains (Leppänen2011Structural). VEGFD forms an antiparallel homodimer stabilized by disulfide bridges, which is important for its interaction with these receptors (Leppänen2011Structural).

VEGFD also interacts with neuropilin-2 (NP2), a co-receptor that modulates its activity. This interaction is heparin-dependent and functionally significant, as NP2 cointernalizes with VEGFR-3 in lymphatic endothelial cells upon stimulation with VEGFD (Karpanen2006Functional). The interaction with NP2 suggests that VEGFD is part of an active signaling complex that influences lymphatic vasculature development (Karpanen2006Functional). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of VEGFD in vascular biology, contributing to both blood and lymphatic vessel formation.
