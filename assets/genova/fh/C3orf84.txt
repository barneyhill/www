# C3orf84

## Overview
C3orf84 is a gene located on chromosome 3 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 3 open reading frame 84. This protein is categorized as a microtubule inner protein (MIP), which plays a crucial role in the structural and functional dynamics of cilia. C3orf84 is involved in the stabilization and organization of ciliary components, contributing to cellular motility and signaling pathways mediated by cilia (Andersen2024Uncovering). The gene has been implicated in various genetic studies, suggesting associations with chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and endometriosis, highlighting its potential significance in these conditions (Adewuyi2020Genetic; Corfield2024Characterising). Despite these associations, further research is needed to elucidate the precise biological functions and clinical implications of C3orf84.

## Function
C3orf84 is implicated in the structural and functional dynamics of cilia, as it is part of a family of microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) that interact with the microtubule lattice within cilia. These proteins, including C3orf84, are thought to play a role in maintaining cilia structure and function, potentially acting as MIPs that contribute to the stability and organization of ciliary components (Andersen2024Uncovering). The gene has been identified in genetic studies as being associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), suggesting a potential link between its function and fatigue-related phenotypes (Corfield2024Characterising). 

C3orf84 is also involved in the broader context of microtubule-binding modules, which are crucial for the stabilization of microtubule structures, particularly in cilia and centrioles. These modules, including Mn repeats found in C3orf84, are essential for the proper assembly and function of ciliary structures, indicating that C3orf84 may have a specialized role in ciliary biology (Andersen2024Uncovering). The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its potential importance in cellular motility and signaling pathways mediated by cilia.

## Clinical Significance
C3orf84 has been implicated in several disorders through genetic studies, although its specific clinical significance remains under investigation. In the context of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), a study identified C3orf84 as one of five genome-wide significant genes, suggesting a potential genetic association with fatigue phenotypes (Corfield2024Characterising). Additionally, C3orf84 has been associated with depression and endometriosis. A genetic analysis found it to be a genome-wide significant gene in the replication analysis using data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Major Depressive Disorder (PGC MDD), indicating a genetic overlap between endometriosis and depression (Adewuyi2020Genetic).

In the realm of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), C3orf84 is located near a lead SNP associated with the condition, although the specific clinical implications of this proximity are not detailed (Strom2024Genomewide). Furthermore, C3orf84 has been identified as a protein with Mn repeat units, suggesting a potential role in cilia function, which may have implications for disorders related to ciliary dysfunction (Andersen2024Uncovering). Despite these associations, the precise role of C3orf84 in these conditions and its potential as a therapeutic target require further research.
