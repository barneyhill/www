# WDR19

## Overview
WDR19 is a gene that encodes the protein WD repeat domain 19, also known as IFT144, which is a critical component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-A complex. This protein is integral to the retrograde transport processes in cilia, which are essential for maintaining ciliary function and structure. Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that play pivotal roles in cellular signaling, motility, and sensory perception. The WDR19 protein is characterized by the presence of multiple WD40 and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate its involvement in protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes. These structural features enable WDR19 to participate in the transport of molecular cargo necessary for ciliary maintenance and function. Mutations in the WDR19 gene have been implicated in a variety of ciliopathies, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Bredrup2011Ciliopathies; Coussa2013WDR19).

## Structure
The WDR19 gene encodes a protein that is part of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically the IFT-A complex, which is crucial for retrograde transport within cilia. The protein, also known as IFT144, is composed of 1342 amino acids and includes 37 exons (Bredrup2011Ciliopathies; Coussa2013WDR19). The molecular structure of WDR19 features several key domains: six WD40 domains, which are involved in the coordination of multi-protein complex assembly, and six tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which mediate protein-protein interactions (Coussa2013WDR19). The WD40 domains form a beta-propeller structure, providing a scaffold for protein interactions (Lin2003Isolation).

WDR19 also contains transmembrane domains, with predictions indicating three strong transmembrane helices, suggesting it is a type III membrane protein (Lin2003Isolation). The protein includes a clathrin heavy-chain repeat (CHCR) motif, which is involved in vesicle transport and protein sorting (Lin2003Isolation). Post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation, phosphorylation, and N-myristoylation are predicted for WDR19 (Lin2003Isolation). The gene exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms that may have tissue-specific functions, particularly in the prostate (Lin2003Isolation).

## Function
The WDR19 gene encodes the IFT144 protein, a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically the IFT-A complex, which is essential for retrograde transport within cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play significant roles in cell motility, sensory reception, and developmental processes. In healthy human cells, WDR19 is expressed in the retina, particularly in photoreceptors, where it is involved in maintaining ciliary function and signaling pathways, such as the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway (Bredrup2011Ciliopathies; Coussa2013WDR19).

The IFT system, including IFT144, is responsible for the assembly and maintenance of cilia by transporting materials from the ciliary tip back to the base, a process executed by a dynein motor. This retrograde transport is vital for recycling proteins and ensuring proper ciliary function, which is critical for photoreceptor survival and overall cellular signaling and maintenance (Bredrup2011Ciliopathies; Coussa2013WDR19).

WDR19 is also expressed in the prostate, where it is regulated by androgenic hormones, suggesting a role in androgen-regulated signaling mechanisms or vesicular trafficking of secretory processes (Lin2003Isolation). The gene's function in healthy cells involves maintaining proper ciliary function and signaling, essential for various developmental and physiological processes (Bredrup2011Ciliopathies).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR19 gene, which encodes the intraflagellar transport component IFT144, are associated with a range of ciliopathies. These include Jeune syndrome, Sensenbrenner syndrome, and isolated nephronophthisis, all of which are characterized by skeletal anomalies and renal insufficiency (Bredrup2011Ciliopathies). WDR19 mutations can also lead to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and Senior-Løken syndrome, which involve retinal dystrophy and nephronophthisis (Coussa2013WDR19). The phenotypic spectrum of WDR19 mutations is broad, with variability in clinical manifestations attributed to different mutation types and potential modifying mutations in other ciliary-related genes (Bredrup2011Ciliopathies).

A specific mutation, p.Leu7Pro, has been identified in a patient with Jeune syndrome, resulting in less severe clinical and ciliary phenotypes compared to Sensenbrenner syndrome (Bredrup2011Ciliopathies). In a Moroccan family, compound heterozygous mutations in WDR19 were linked to isolated nephronophthisis, with affected siblings presenting with small kidneys and end-stage renal disease (Bredrup2011Ciliopathies). The gene's role in ciliary function is crucial, as mutations can disrupt protein interactions and alter ciliary structure, leading to the diverse clinical features observed in these conditions (Fehrenbach2014Mutations).

## Interactions
WDR19, also known as WD repeat domain 19, is a protein that plays a crucial role in intraflagellar transport (IFT) and ciliary function. It is a component of the IFT-A complex and interacts with other IFT proteins, including IFT140 and IFT88, which are part of the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes, respectively. These interactions are essential for the proper localization and function of these proteins within cilia (Ni2020A).

WDR19 contains several structural domains, such as WD40 repeats and tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions. These domains allow WDR19 to form multiprotein complexes necessary for the assembly and maintenance of cilia (Efimenko2006Caenorhabditis; Coussa2013WDR19).

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the orthologue of WDR19, known as DYF-2, is involved in both anterograde and retrograde transport within cilia, suggesting that WDR19 may interact with components of both IFT complexes A and B. This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of the IFT machinery and the maintenance of ciliary structure (Efimenko2006Caenorhabditis).
