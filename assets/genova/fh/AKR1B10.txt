# AKR1B10

## Overview
AKR1B10 is a gene that encodes the protein aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10, which belongs to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. This protein is characterized by its (α/β)8 barrel structure, a common motif among AKR enzymes, and plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism by reducing aldehydes, ketones, and quinones to their corresponding alcohols using NADPH as a cofactor (Endo2021The; Ruiz2021Perspective). AKR1B10 is highly expressed in the epithelial cells of the stomach and intestine, where it contributes to gastrointestinal homeostasis and protects cells from oxidative stress by detoxifying reactive carbonyl species (Endo2021The). The gene's expression is altered in various cancers, where it can influence processes such as protein prenylation and chemoresistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Endo2021The; Chung2012Overexpression).

## Structure
The AKR1B10 protein is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, characterized by its (α/β)8 barrel structure, also known as the TIM barrel fold, which is a common motif among these enzymes (CousidoSiah2014Identification; Ruiz2021Perspective). The active site of AKR1B10 is located at the C-terminal end of the barrel, where it binds the NADP+ cofactor in an extended conformation (CousidoSiah2014Identification). The enzyme's active site includes a conserved catalytic tetrad consisting of Asp43, Tyr48, Lys77, and His110, which is crucial for its catalytic function (Ruiz2021Perspective).

AKR1B10's structure is highly similar to that of other AKR family members, sharing 71% amino acid sequence identity with AKR1B1 (aldose reductase) (Ruiz2021Perspective). The protein's plasticity and substrate specificity are influenced by three external loops (A, B, and C), which are highly variable and contribute to the enzyme's inhibitor selectivity (Ruiz2021Perspective). The enzyme may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and may exist in different splice variant isoforms, which can alter its structure and function (Liu2009Structure). The AKR1B10 gene is located on chromosome 7q33 and consists of 10 exons and 9 introns (Liu2009Structure).

## Function
AKR1B10 is a human enzyme that plays a significant role in the metabolism of various compounds within cells. It is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family and is primarily involved in the reduction of aldehydes, ketones, and quinones to their corresponding alcohols, utilizing NADPH as a cofactor (Endo2021The). This enzyme is highly expressed in the epithelial cells of the stomach and intestine, suggesting its importance in gastrointestinal homeostasis (Endo2021The).

In healthy human cells, AKR1B10 is crucial for maintaining retinoid homeostasis by catalyzing the reduction of retinal to retinol, a key step in the production of retinoic acid, which is vital for cell proliferation and differentiation (Endo2021The). The enzyme also detoxifies reactive carbonyl species (RCS) generated from lipid peroxidation, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, converting them into less toxic alcohols, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress (Endo2021The).

AKR1B10 interacts with acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α, promoting fatty acid and lipid synthesis, and inhibits autophagy by interacting with GAPDH (Endo2021The). These functions highlight its role in cellular metabolism and protection against oxidative damage, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AKR1B10 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), AKR1B10 expression is notably reduced, particularly in advanced stages, and this downregulation is associated with poor prognosis. The gene is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53, and its decreased expression is linked to increased vulnerability to DNA damage and disrupted retinoid homeostasis (Taskoparan2017Opposing; Kropotova2010Downregulation). 

In pancreatic cancer, AKR1B10 is overexpressed in approximately 70% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. This overexpression is associated with the modulation of protein prenylation, crucial for the activation of oncogenic KRAS, which is mutated in the majority of pancreatic cancers. Silencing AKR1B10 in pancreatic cancer cells has been shown to increase apoptosis and reduce KRAS activity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chung2012Overexpression).

AKR1B10 is also implicated in chemoresistance. Its expression is upregulated in response to chemotherapy, contributing to resistance by detoxifying reactive carbonyl species and modulating drug metabolism. This upregulation is linked to the activation of the transcription factor Nrf2, which may be due to somatic mutations or other factors (Endo2021The).

## Interactions
AKR1B10, a member of the aldo-keto reductase family, participates in several interactions with other proteins and potentially nucleic acids. In pancreatic carcinoma, AKR1B10 is involved in protein prenylation, a process crucial for the activation of KRAS, a protein that plays a significant role in cancer progression. Silencing AKR1B10 in pancreatic cancer cell lines results in decreased levels of membrane-bound KRAS protein and its downstream effectors, phosphor-ERK and phosphor-MEK1/2, indicating an interaction with the KRAS signaling pathway (Chung2012Overexpression).

In adrenocortical carcinoma cells, AKR1B10 has been shown to physically interact with PDIA6, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction suggests a role in regulating cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis (Chen2023FNDC5). AKR1B10 also interacts with FNDC5, influencing the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, which affects cell proliferation and apoptosis in adrenocortical carcinoma (Chen2023FNDC5).

While specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context, AKR1B10's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its impact on cellular processes suggest potential interactions with nucleic acids, although further research is needed to clarify these interactions.
