# SLC12A8

## Overview
SLC12A8 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 12 member 8, which is part of the cation-chloride cotransporter family. This protein is characterized by its unique membrane topology and is involved in the transport of polyamines and amino acids, playing a crucial role in cellular homeostasis and metabolism (Hebert2004Molecular; Daigle2009Molecular). SLC12A8 is expressed in various tissues and has been identified as a sodium-dependent nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) symporter, essential for maintaining the NAD+ cell reservoir, which is vital for energy metabolism (Lavoro2023In). The gene's expression and function have been linked to several clinical conditions, including psoriasis and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Daigle2009Molecular; Lavoro2023In). Despite its recognized roles, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of SLC12A8 remain subjects of ongoing research.

## Structure
The SLC12A8 protein is a member of the cation-chloride cotransporter family and is characterized by a unique predicted membrane topology. It is a shorter protein, consisting of 714 amino acids, and is widely expressed across various tissues (Hebert2004Molecular). The protein's structure is notable for its lack of predicted extracellular loops within the central core of hydrophobic domains, which is atypical for proteins in this family. It is suggested that the protein may end with a glycosylated extracellular COOH-terminal tail, indicating potential post-translational modification (Hebert2004Molecular).

Despite these structural predictions, the specific transport function of SLC12A8 remains unknown. However, the presence of clear orthologs in the Drosophila and C. elegans genomes suggests a conserved evolutionary role, hinting at a fundamental biological function (Hebert2004Molecular). The protein has been identified as a sodium-dependent nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) symporter, playing a crucial role in maintaining the NAD+ cell reservoir, which is essential for energy metabolism (Lavoro2023In). The molecular structure and function of SLC12A8 are still under investigation, with ongoing research aimed at elucidating its precise role in cellular processes.

## Function
The SLC12A8 gene encodes a protein that functions as a cation-chloride cotransporter, specifically involved in the transport of polyamines and amino acids in human cells. This protein, also known as CCC9a, is part of a larger family of cation-Cl− cotransporters and amino acid-polyamine-organocation carriers (APCs) (Daigle2009Molecular). SLC12A8 is expressed in HEK-293 cells, where it facilitates the influx of polyamines such as spermidine and spermine, as well as certain amino acids like glutamate and aspartate (Daigle2009Molecular).

The transport activity of SLC12A8 is modulated by specific amino acids and is inhibited by drugs like pentamidine and furosemide, but it is independent of sodium, potassium, or chloride ions (Daigle2009Molecular). This suggests that SLC12A8 may function as a polyamine-amino acid efflux system, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function (Daigle2009Molecular). The protein is localized both in intracellular compartments and at the cell surface, indicating its role in cellular transport processes (Daigle2009Molecular). The precise role of SLC12A8 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in polyamine transport suggests a significant role in cell proliferation and metabolism (Pochini2024Involvement).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC12A8 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in polyamine and amino acid transport. Alterations in the expression of SLC12A8 have been associated with psoriasis vulgaris, a common skin disorder characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation. This association is supported by findings of increased ornithine decarboxylase activity and altered polyamine ratios in affected skin, suggesting that SLC12A8 may contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis through its involvement in polyamine metabolism (Daigle2009Molecular).

In cancer, SLC12A8 is noted for its significant upregulation in various tumor types. This upregulation is linked to its role as a sodium-dependent nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) symporter, which is crucial for maintaining the NAD+ cell reservoir, essential for energy metabolism. The gene's expression is correlated with DNA methylation patterns, which may influence its role in tumorigenesis, survival, and drug resistance (Lavoro2023In).

The gene's involvement in cancer and psoriasis highlights its potential as a therapeutic target. However, the specific clinical significance of SLC12A8 mutations or expression alterations in these conditions requires further investigation (Daigle2009Molecular; Lavoro2023In).
