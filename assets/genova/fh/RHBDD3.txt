# RHBDD3

## Overview
RHBDD3 is a gene that encodes the protein rhomboid domain containing 3, which is a member of the rhomboid family of serine proteases. Unlike typical serine proteases, RHBDD3 functions as a pseudoprotease, meaning it lacks proteolytic activity but plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and immune regulation. The protein is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains, allowing it to integrate into cellular membranes, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. RHBDD3 is involved in modulating immune responses by acting as a scaffold in the NFκB signaling pathway, influencing processes such as dendritic cell activation and inflammatory responses. Its regulatory functions are significant in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune diseases. Additionally, RHBDD3 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in its role in apoptosis and as part of prognostic gene signatures in certain cancers (Zhu2020Roles; Canzoneri2013Rhomboid; Lemberg2016Inactive).

## Structure
RHBDD3 encodes a protein that is part of the rhomboid family, characterized by its serine protease activity. The protein structure includes multiple transmembrane domains, which are integral to its secondary structure. These transmembrane domains contribute to the protein's ability to embed within cellular membranes, a common feature among proteins in the rhomboid family. The presence of these domains suggests a complex tertiary structure that facilitates its enzymatic function and interaction with other cellular components.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in RHBDD3, potentially influencing its activity, stability, and interactions within the cell. These modifications can play a crucial role in regulating the protein's function and its response to cellular signals.

The RHBDD3 gene can undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms of the protein. These isoforms may vary in their functional properties and localization within the cell, which can have significant implications for the protein's role in cellular processes. The diversity in isoforms highlights the gene's potential adaptability and functional versatility in different cellular contexts.

## Function
RHBDD3, a member of the rhomboid family of serine proteases, functions as a pseudoprotease involved in various cellular processes. It plays a significant role in immune homeostasis by acting as a scaffold in endosomes, facilitating the recruitment of the NFκB pathway kinase IKKγ to the deubiquitinating enzyme A20. This interaction helps modulate NFκB responses, thereby maintaining immune balance and preventing excessive immune activation (Zhu2020Roles; Lemberg2016Inactive).

In dendritic cells, RHBDD3 negatively regulates activation by promoting the deubiquitination of NEMO, an essential component of the NFκB signaling pathway. This regulation is crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune responses (Zhu2020Roles). RHBDD3 is also involved in the proteasomal degradation of DAP12, an adaptor protein associated with activating receptors on NK cells, forming part of a negative feedback loop to inhibit signaling (Freeman2014The).

RHBDD3 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it influences protein trafficking and cellular signaling pathways. Its activity impacts immune responses and cellular stress pathways, contributing to organismal health and disease states (Lemberg2016Inactive).

## Clinical Significance
RHBDD3, also known as the pituitary tumor apoptosis gene (PTAG), has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in apoptosis regulation. In breast cancer, RHBDD3 expression is notably low, with only one tumor sample showing mRNA expression, suggesting its limited role in this cancer type (Canzoneri2013Rhomboid). In uveal melanoma, RHBDD3 is part of a six-gene signature associated with glycolysis and immune response, serving as an independent prognostic predictor of overall survival. This gene signature correlates with immune cell infiltration, indicating potential targets for immunotherapy (Liu2021A).

The bidirectional nature of the EWSR1 promoter, which regulates RHBDD3, suggests shared regulatory elements between these genes, although the clinical significance of RHBDD3 in this context is not fully detailed (Möller2009Bidirectionality). Overall, RHBDD3's involvement in apoptosis and its expression patterns in various tumors highlight its potential role in cancer pathogenesis and as a target for therapeutic interventions. However, specific mutations or alterations in RHBDD3 directly linked to diseases are not extensively documented in the provided context.

## Interactions
RHBDD3, a rhomboid pseudoprotease, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It acts as a scaffold in the NFκB signaling pathway by recruiting the kinase IKKγ to the deubiquitinating enzyme A20, which regulates NFκB responses. This interaction is crucial for modulating immune responses, as RHBDD3 localizes to endosomes and facilitates the recruitment of A20, thereby influencing the deubiquitination of NEMO, a component of the NFκB pathway (Zhu2020Roles; Lemberg2016Inactive).

RHBDD3 also interacts with A20 to regulate dendritic cell (DC) activation. It recruits A20 to promote the deubiquitination of NEMO, negatively regulating DC activation and maintaining immune homeostasis. This interaction is essential for preventing autoimmunity, as evidenced by RHBDD3 knockout mice developing systemic autoimmune phenotypes (Zhu2020Roles).

In the context of inflammatory responses, RHBDD3 inhibits IL-6 production in DCs by interacting with A20, thereby suppressing the generation of Th17 cells. This interaction is significant in controlling inflammatory diseases, as RHBDD3-deficient mice show increased susceptibility to Th17 cell-mediated colitis (Zhu2020Roles).
