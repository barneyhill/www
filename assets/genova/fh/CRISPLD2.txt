# CRISPLD2

## Overview
CRISPLD2 is a gene that encodes the protein cysteine-rich secretory protein LCCL domain containing 2, which is involved in various biological processes, including immune response modulation and developmental pathways. The protein is characterized by its LCCL domains, which facilitate interactions with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), playing a crucial role in the innate immune system by potentially blocking endotoxin interactions with host receptors (Vásárhelyi2014Both). CRISPLD2 is expressed in multiple tissues and is implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses, as well as in developmental processes such as lung and kidney development. Clinically, alterations in the CRISPLD2 gene have been associated with craniofacial abnormalities, including nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate, highlighting its significance in craniofacial development (Yuan2012Craniofacial; Rong2023Decreased). Additionally, CRISPLD2 is involved in cancer progression pathways, such as the HIPPO/YAP signaling pathway, further underscoring its diverse functional roles (HU2020SerglycinMediated).

## Structure
The CRISPLD2 protein contains two LCCL domains, which are conserved protein modules involved in protein-protein interactions. These domains are located at residues 288-379 and 389-483, respectively (Vásárhelyi2014Both). The protein also includes a CAP-domain spanning residues 62-200 (Vásárhelyi2014Both). The LCCL domains of CRISPLD2 have a high affinity for lipid A, a component of lipopolysaccharides, suggesting a role in blocking endotoxin interactions with host receptors (Vásárhelyi2014Both). 

The primary structure of CRISPLD2 includes specific amino acid sequences for its domains, such as the N-terminal sequence MGSSHHHHHHSQDRSEFMTQVVR for the recombinant protein containing the first LCCL-domain (Vásárhelyi2014Both). The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage, resulting in fragments like CRISPLD2_LCCL2, which includes residues Met360-Gln497 (Vásárhelyi2014Both). 

While the context does not provide detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, it is noted that the protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which could affect its stability and function. The presence of cysteine-rich regions likely contributes to the structural stability of CRISPLD2 (Vásárhelyi2014Both).

## Function
The CRISPLD2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis in healthy human cells. CRISPLD2 is a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein that interferes with the binding of LPS to target cells, thereby reducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. This function suggests that CRISPLD2 is involved in regulating endotoxin function and protecting against excessive inflammatory responses (Wang2009The).

CRISPLD2 is expressed in various tissues, including the placenta, heart, lung, and blood leukocytes, and is present in human serum and plasma at higher concentrations than other known LPS-binding proteins. It is found intracellularly in immune cells like monocytes, NK cells, and T cells, but not on their surface (Wang2009The). The protein's secretion is upregulated in response to LPS stimulation, indicating its active role in the body's response to bacterial endotoxins (Wang2009The).

In addition to its role in immune regulation, CRISPLD2 is involved in developmental processes, such as lung and kidney development, and is associated with conditions like nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate (Rong2023Decreased).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CRISPLD2 gene have been associated with several craniofacial abnormalities, particularly nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCLP). Studies have shown that CRISPLD2 is crucial for normal craniofacial development, and its disruption can lead to significant jaw and palatal abnormalities. In zebrafish models, knockdown of crispld2 results in altered neural crest cell migration and increased apoptosis, leading to craniofacial defects (Yuan2012Craniofacial; Chiquet2018Knockdown).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CRISPLD2, such as rs1546124, have been linked to an increased risk of NSCLP in various populations, including Caucasian, Hispanic, and the Xinjiang Uyghur population. These genetic variations may affect transcription and splicing regulation, influencing craniofacial development (Mijiti2015Preliminary; Letra2011CRISPLD2).

CRISPLD2 is also involved in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, which are essential for the transition of neuroepithelial cells to neural crest cells, further implicating its role in craniofacial development (Yuan2012Craniofacial). The gene's interaction with the folic acid pathway suggests that it may be influenced by nutritional and environmental factors, contributing to the complexity of NSCLP etiology (Chiquet2010Nonsyndromic).

## Interactions
CRISPLD2, also known as LGL1, is involved in several interactions that influence cellular functions. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CRISPLD2 is a downstream effector in the SRGN-mediated HIPPO/YAP signaling pathway. It is upregulated by SRGN overexpression, which enhances HCC cell motility. CRISPLD2 is involved in the YAP-TEAD1 protein-protein interaction, which mediates the oncogenic function of YAP. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of CRISPLD2, as confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays that demonstrate direct binding of the YAP-TEAD1 complex to the CRISPLD2 promoter (HU2020SerglycinMediated).

CRISPLD2 also interacts with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) through its LCCL domains, which have a high affinity for lipid A, a component of LPS. This interaction suggests a role in the innate immune system by potentially blocking interactions between endotoxins and host receptors, thereby modulating immune responses (Vásárhelyi2014Both). These interactions highlight CRISPLD2's involvement in both cancer progression and immune response modulation.
