# PARP8

## Overview
PARP8 is a gene that encodes the protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 8, which is part of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family. This family of proteins is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, genomic stability, and cell death. PARP8 is characterized by its unique structural features, such as a helical appendage to the ART domain and a putative C4-type zinc finger, which suggest specialized regulatory functions (Suskiewicz2023Updated). Unlike some other PARP family members, PARP8 lacks a transmembrane domain, indicating a distinct cellular localization and function. The protein primarily localizes to the nuclear envelope and centrosomes, playing a critical role in maintaining nuclear integrity and cell morphology (Richard2022Beyond; Vyas2013A). Additionally, PARP8 is implicated in the cellular response to oxidative stress, although its precise mechanisms in DNA repair and other cellular processes are not yet fully understood (Richard2022Beyond).

## Structure
PARP8 is a member of the PARP family, characterized by its unique molecular structure. It features a helical appendage to the ART domain, similar to PARP6 and PARP16, which does not obstruct the NAD+ binding site, indicating a distinct regulatory or interaction function (Suskiewicz2023Updated). Unlike PARP16, PARP8 lacks a C-terminal transmembrane helix but includes an extended N-terminal region with a putative C4-type zinc finger (ZnF) and a 'split' RWD domain. The C4-type ZnF is structurally distinct from that in PARP1 and is rigidly connected to the split RWD domain, suggesting a functional relationship (Suskiewicz2023Updated).

The RWD domain in PARP8 is related to the ubiquitin-conjugating core domain of E2 enzymes, hinting at a potential link to ubiquitylation pathways (Suskiewicz2023Updated). PARP8 also contains multiple ADP-ribosylated cysteine residues, which are genuine sites of automodification, as demonstrated by a decrease in NAD+ incorporation upon mutation (Vyas2014Familywide). The protein localizes primarily to the nuclear envelope and centrosomes, with its depletion leading to mitotic and nuclear morphology defects (Richard2022Beyond). These structural features and modifications suggest a complex role in cellular processes, potentially involving protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications.

## Function
PARP8, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family, is involved in several cellular processes, primarily related to its localization and function within the cell. It is primarily localized to the nuclear envelope during most of the cell cycle and relocates to centrosomes and spindle poles during mitosis (Richard2022Beyond; Vyas2013A). This localization suggests a role in nuclear structure and mitotic spindle function, although the specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed (Vyas2013A).

PARP8 is implicated in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity, as its knockdown results in structural defects such as multilobed nuclei and decreased nuclear size, indicating its involvement in nuclear envelope biogenesis or maintenance (Vyas2013A). Additionally, the knockdown of PARP8 leads to significant cell morphology defects and reduced cell viability, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal cell morphology and survival (Vyas2013A).

PARP8 is also involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in response to oxidative stress, where it undergoes auto-PARylation upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide, suggesting a role similar to PARP1 in oxidative stress response (Richard2022Beyond). However, the precise mechanisms by which PARP8 contributes to DNA repair and genomic stability remain to be fully elucidated (Richard2022Beyond).
