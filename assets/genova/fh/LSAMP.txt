# LSAMP

## Overview
The LSAMP gene encodes the limbic system-associated membrane protein, a neural adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in the nervous system. This protein is part of the IgLON family, which is involved in cell adhesion and signaling processes. LSAMP is predominantly expressed in limbic-associated regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum, where it contributes to the regulation of synaptic plasticity, neuritogenesis, and synaptogenesis (Innos2013Limbic; Singh2018The). The protein's involvement in these processes is essential for establishing proper neuronal connections and influencing emotional and stress-related behaviors (Bregin2020Expression). Additionally, LSAMP is implicated in various clinical conditions, including certain cancers and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts (Mehrjoo2020Limbic; Gong2022Long).

## Structure


## Function
The LSAMP gene encodes the limbic system-associated membrane protein, which is a neural adhesion molecule involved in several critical processes within the nervous system. LSAMP plays a significant role in the maintenance of cell proliferation, neuritogenesis, and synaptogenesis, which are essential for establishing proper neuronal connections and behavior (Bregin2020Expression). It is part of the IgLON family of proteins, which are involved in cell adhesion and signaling, and is expressed on the surface of neurons, particularly in limbic-associated regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum (Innos2013Limbic; Singh2018The).

In healthy cells, LSAMP is involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and transmission, particularly in the hippocampus, where it influences long-term potentiation and is linked to the regulation of BDNF pathways, crucial for neuronal survival and differentiation (Heinla2015Gene). LSAMP also modulates neurite outgrowth through a process of ectodomain shedding facilitated by ADAM metallopeptidases, which is crucial for axon extension and neuronal development (Sanz2017Ectodomain). Additionally, LSAMP is involved in the serotonergic neurotransmission system, influencing serotonin turnover and synaptic connections (Bregin2020Expression). These molecular activities contribute to LSAMP's role in modulating emotional and stress-related behaviors (Innos2013Limbic).

## Clinical Significance
The LSAMP gene, known for its role in cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth, has been implicated in various cancers and other diseases due to alterations in its expression or mutations. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LSAMP expression is downregulated, correlating with poor prognosis. The long non-coding RNA Lnc-LSAMP-1, which stabilizes LSAMP mRNA, is also downregulated in NSCLC, leading to increased tumor growth and metastasis (Gong2022Long). Similarly, in lung adenocarcinoma, reduced LSAMP expression is linked to poor survival, with its knockdown promoting cell proliferation and migration (Chang2021The).

In osteosarcoma, LSAMP is frequently deleted or methylated, resulting in low expression levels associated with poor patient survival. These genetic alterations suggest LSAMP's role as a tumor suppressor in this cancer type (Kresse2009LSAMP). In neuroblastoma, LSAMP rearrangements are found in relapsed tumors, and its low expression is linked to poor survival outcomes, indicating its involvement in tumor progression (Martinez‑Monleon2023Identification).

Additionally, a missense variant in LSAMP has been associated with Ménière’s disease in a family study, suggesting a potential role in this condition (Mehrjoo2020Limbic).

## Interactions
LSAMP (limbic system-associated membrane protein) is involved in various protein interactions that influence neuronal development and function. It is a member of the IgLON family of cell adhesion molecules, which includes neurotrimin (NTM) and NEGR1, among others. LSAMP forms heterophilic complexes with other IgLON family members, such as NTM and OBCAM, which can stabilize these proteins on the neuronal surface and inhibit neurite outgrowth (Sanz2017Ectodomain). The interaction between LSAMP and NTM is particularly significant, as it regulates neurite sprouting and cellular proliferation independently of cell-cell adhesion (Singh2018The). 

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, LSAMP interacts with NEGR1, with a positive correlation between their expressions. Higher NEGR1 expression is associated with longer survival in patients, suggesting that the interaction between LSAMP and NEGR1 may influence clinical outcomes (Chang2021The). LSAMP is also involved in the serotonergic neurotransmission system, where it colocalizes with serotonin transporter (SERT) and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), indicating its presence in both pre-and postsynaptic terminals (Bregin2020Expression). These interactions highlight LSAMP's role in modulating synaptic connectivity and plasticity.
