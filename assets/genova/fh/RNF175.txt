# RNF175

## Overview
RNF175 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 175, which is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by the presence of a RING-finger domain, a structural motif that facilitates its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by mediating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins. RNF175 is notable for its involvement in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), a critical pathway for maintaining protein quality control within the cell. The protein is composed of 328 amino acids and features five transmembrane domains, suggesting its association with cellular membranes and potential involvement in membrane-associated functions. RNF175 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, particularly in neural tissues, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. Despite its recognized roles in cellular homeostasis and stress responses, the full spectrum of RNF175's physiological and pathological functions remains to be elucidated (Regalbuto2020Human; Kaneko2016Genomewide; Wu2021Development).

## Structure
RNF175 is a human protein characterized by the presence of a RING-finger domain, which is a type of zinc finger domain involved in ubiquitin ligase activity. This domain is crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions and facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzymes to substrate proteins (Nakamura2011The). RNF175 is noted to have five transmembrane domains, suggesting a complex structure likely involved in membrane-associated functions (Kaneko2016Genomewide). The protein is 328 amino acids in length, indicating its primary structure (Kaneko2016Genomewide).

The molecular structure of RNF175 is not detailed in terms of secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures in the available context. However, its transmembrane domains imply a role in anchoring the protein within cellular membranes, which is typical for proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways (Kaneko2016Genomewide). RNF175 is also involved in cellular degradation processes, which may relate to its function in ubiquitination and potential roles in various cellular stress responses (Moschny2020Novel). Specific post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation are common for proteins with RING domains, although these are not explicitly detailed for RNF175 in the context provided.

## Function
RNF175 is a gene encoding a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays a critical role in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including the cell cycle, DNA repair, and response to stress (Regalbuto2020Human). RNF175 is involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), a mechanism crucial for protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is noted for its tissue-specific expression, particularly in neural tissues, suggesting it may have specific roles depending on the tissue or developmental stage (Kaneko2016Genomewide).

The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. RNF175's activity as a ubiquitin ligase is significant in the context of cellular stress responses and protein turnover, which are vital for cellular homeostasis and function (Wu2021Development). Despite its recognized roles, the specific physiological and pathological functions of RNF175 in healthy human cells remain largely unknown, indicating a need for further research to fully elucidate its molecular mechanisms and impacts (Kaneko2016Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
RNF175 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in ubiquitination and protein regulation. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), RNF175 is part of a prognostic signature that helps predict patient outcomes. Alterations in its expression are associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, indicating its potential role in cancer pathogenesis (Wu2021Development).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), RNF175 is one of the hub ubiquitin ligase genes found to be downregulated in various brain regions affected by the disease. This downregulation suggests a potential involvement in AD pathogenesis, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Liu2021Identification).

RNF175 has also been studied in the context of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) response in depression. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within RNF175 has been associated with ECT responsiveness, suggesting a role in the treatment outcomes of depression, although the precise mechanisms are not well understood (Moschny2020Novel).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of RNF175 in various conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to fully understand its role in disease mechanisms.
