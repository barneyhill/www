# CCDC158

## Overview
The CCDC158 gene encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 158, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC158 protein may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the precise biological functions of the CCDC158 protein are not fully elucidated, it has been implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. The gene's potential involvement in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and coronary artery disease, as well as its association with kidney function markers, highlights its significance in human health (Wang2023Understanding; Jia2019Multivariate; Jiao2021Pathway). Further research is needed to clarify the molecular mechanisms and pathways in which CCDC158 is involved.

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC158 gene has been implicated in several health conditions, although its specific clinical significance remains under investigation. It has been identified as a novel pleiotropic gene potentially associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and coronary artery disease (CAD) through multivariate analysis of genome-wide data. However, the detailed pathomechanisms of CCDC158 in these diseases are not fully understood, and further experimental studies are needed to confirm its role (Jia2019Multivariate).

In the context of kidney function, CCDC158 has been associated with plasma cystatin C levels, a biomarker for kidney function. The gene is located upstream of SHROOM3, and specific SNPs within CCDC158 have shown significant associations with cystatin C levels, suggesting a potential role in kidney-related pathways (Jiao2021Pathway).

Additionally, CCDC158 has been linked to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function, in studies exploring the genetic basis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Wang2023Understanding). Despite these associations, the exact mechanisms by which CCDC158 influences these conditions remain unclear, necessitating further research to elucidate its clinical significance.
