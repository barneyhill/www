# ACADM

## Overview
The ACADM gene encodes the enzyme medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. As a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases family, MCAD is responsible for catalyzing the initial step in the breakdown of medium-chain fatty acids, facilitating their conversion into acyl-CoA derivatives. This process is vital for energy production, especially during periods of fasting or increased energy demand. The MCAD enzyme is predominantly active in the mitochondria of liver and muscle cells, where it plays a significant role in maintaining energy homeostasis by converting fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which subsequently enters the citric acid cycle to produce ATP. Mutations in the ACADM gene can lead to medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), a metabolic disorder that impairs energy metabolism and can result in severe metabolic crises (Sturm2012Functional; Zschocke2001Molecular).

## Structure
The ACADM gene encodes the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) enzyme, which is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) family involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids. The MCAD protein is a homotetramer, arranged as dimers of dimers, and shares a common 'MCAD-fold' with other soluble ACADs (Kim201211). Each monomer consists of an N-terminal α-helical domain, a β-sheet domain, and a C-terminal α-helical domain (Kim201211). The flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor is located between the β-sheet domain and the C-terminal helical domain of one monomer and the C-terminal helical domain of the other monomer in the dimeric unit of the tetramer (Kim201211).

The active site of MCAD includes a key catalytic residue, Glu376, which functions as a general base in the dehydrogenation reaction (Kim201211). The substrate binding cavity can accommodate fatty acyl chains up to 12 carbons in length, with the base of the cavity formed by Gln95 and Glu99 on helix E (Kim201211). In the absence of substrate, water molecules fill the binding cavity, and no major structural changes occur upon substrate binding, although some side chains adopt alternate conformations to accommodate the substrate (Kim201211). The structure of MCAD is similar to that of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD), with a 1.7 Å r.m.s. deviation between the main chain Cα atoms (Kim201211).

## Function
The ACADM gene encodes the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) enzyme, which plays a critical role in the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the initial step in the breakdown of medium-chain fatty acids, specifically those with chain lengths between four and twelve carbon atoms, converting them into acyl-CoA derivatives (Sturm2012Functional; Koster2014Functional). This process is essential for energy production, particularly during periods of fasting or increased energy demand, such as physical exertion or illness (Sturm2012Functional; Zschocke2001Molecular).

MCAD is primarily active in the mitochondria of liver and muscle cells, where it facilitates the conversion of medium-chain fatty acids into acetyl-CoA. This acetyl-CoA can then enter the citric acid cycle to produce ATP, thereby maintaining energy homeostasis in the body (Sturm2012Functional; Tanaka1992Mutations). The enzyme's activity is highest toward substrates like hexanoyl-CoA and octanoyl-CoA, and it is synthesized as a precursor protein that is imported into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is processed into a mature subunit (Tanaka1992Mutations). Deficiencies in MCAD due to mutations in the ACADM gene can lead to metabolic disorders, such as MCAD deficiency, which affects energy metabolism and can result in life-threatening metabolic crises during catabolic states (Zschocke2001Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACADM gene lead to medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), an autosomal recessive disorder affecting mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. This condition impairs the body's ability to convert medium-chain fatty acids into energy, particularly during fasting or illness, resulting in symptoms such as hypoglycemia, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and, in severe cases, coma or sudden death (Iafolla1994Medium–chain; Gong2021Clinical). The most common mutation associated with MCADD is c.985A>G (p.K329E), which accounts for a significant proportion of pathogenic alleles in affected individuals, particularly among those of European descent (Smith2010Allelic; Maier2005Population).

Newborn screening programs have been instrumental in early detection and management of MCADD, significantly reducing morbidity and mortality associated with the disorder (Hara2016Significance; Maier2005Population). The genetic diversity of ACADM mutations varies across populations, with certain mutations being more prevalent in specific ethnic groups, such as p.P128X in Japanese patients (Hara2016Significance). Early diagnosis through newborn screening allows for dietary management and avoidance of fasting, which can prevent severe metabolic crises and lead to normal neurodevelopmental outcomes (Gong2021Clinical).

## Interactions
The ACADM protein, encoded by the ACADM gene, is involved in several interactions with other proteins. In the context of viral infections, ACADM interacts with the structural glycoprotein E2 of the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV). This interaction was initially identified using a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed in CSFV-infected cells through proximity ligation assay (PLA) and coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) methods. The interaction is specific to CSFV-infected cells, as demonstrated by distinct punctate spots in the cytoplasm of infected SK6 cells and the coimmunoprecipitation of E2 with ACADM (Vuono2023Classical).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ACADM is regulated by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), which acts as a negative transcriptional regulator. SREBP-1 binds to the ACADM promoter, suppressing its expression. This regulatory interaction is part of a broader pathway involving caveolin-1 (Cav1), which enhances SREBP-1 nuclear accumulation, further suppressing ACADM expression and affecting fatty acid oxidation (Ma2021Suppression). These interactions highlight the role of ACADM in both viral pathogenesis and cancer metabolism.
