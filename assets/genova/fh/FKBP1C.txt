# FKBP1C

## Overview
FKBP1C is a gene that encodes the protein FKBP prolyl isomerase family member 1C, which is part of the immunophilin protein family. This protein functions as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, facilitating protein folding and conformational changes by catalyzing the isomerization of proline residues in polypeptides. FKBP1C is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein trafficking, and has been implicated in the regulation of immune responses. The protein's role in these processes is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
