# SULT1B1

## Overview
SULT1B1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme sulfotransferase family 1B member 1, a cytosolic enzyme involved in the sulfation of various substrates, including thyroid hormones and xenobiotics. This enzyme belongs to the sulfotransferase family, characterized by its ability to transfer a sulfonate group from a donor molecule, such as 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), to an acceptor molecule, thereby enhancing the solubility and facilitating the excretion of these compounds (Kurogi2021SULT; Dooley2000Expression). SULT1B1 is expressed in multiple human tissues, with significant activity in the liver and small intestine, where it plays a crucial role in detoxification processes and hormonal regulation (Riches2009Quantitative; Coughtrie2016Function). The enzyme's structure features a Rossmann fold, which is essential for its enzymatic function and interaction with substrates and cofactors (AllaliHassani2007Structural). Understanding the function and regulation of SULT1B1 is important for elucidating its role in metabolic processes and its potential implications in various diseases.

## Structure
The SULT1B1 protein is a member of the human cytosolic sulfotransferase family, characterized by a common structural fold. This fold includes a central four-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices and loops, which can become ordered upon ligand binding, such as with PAP or PAPS (AllaliHassani2007Structural). The binding site for these cofactors is highly conserved across the SULT family, suggesting a structural mechanism that primes certain loops for substrate binding (AllaliHassani2007Structural).

The tertiary structure of SULT1B1 forms a globular shape, often featuring a Rossmann fold, which is typical in sulfotransferases. This structure is crucial for its enzymatic activity, allowing the protein to interact with various substrates and cofactors (AllaliHassani2007Structural). The presence of specific domains and motifs, such as those for 5'-phosphosulfate and 3'-phosphate binding, is essential for its function (Yamauchi2019A).

SULT1B1 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and stability. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and tissue-specific expression (Coughtrie2016Function).

## Function
SULT1B1 is a member of the sulfotransferase enzyme family, primarily involved in the sulfation of thyroid hormones, which is crucial for regulating their metabolism and activity. This process enhances the solubility and excretion of these hormones, facilitating their inactivation and removal from the body (Kurogi2021SULT; Dooley2000Expression). SULT1B1 is expressed widely in human tissues, with significant activity in the liver and small intestine, where it plays a key role in detoxifying xenobiotics and maintaining hormonal balance (Riches2009Quantitative; Coughtrie2016Function).

The enzyme's activity is essential for the irreversible inactivation of thyroid hormones through deiodination, a process that helps maintain thyroid hormone levels within narrow limits, thus influencing various metabolic processes across different tissues (Dooley2000Expression). SULT1B1 is also involved in the metabolism of other substrates, such as dopa and tyrosine, although its primary function is related to thyroid hormone regulation (Kurogi2021SULT). The enzyme's expression and activity patterns suggest its significant role in hepatic metabolism and the detoxification of drugs and other xenobiotics, contributing to the overall metabolic regulation in healthy human cells (Dubaisi2019Developmental; Riches2009Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SULT1B1 gene primarily involves its role in drug metabolism and hormone regulation. Genetic polymorphisms in SULT1B1, such as the nonsynonymous cSNPs Leu145Val, Glu186Gly, and Glu204Asp, have been identified in human populations. The Leu145Val variant, particularly prevalent in African Americans, shows a higher affinity for 1-hydroxypyrenes compared to the wild-type enzyme, although no significant correlation with colorectal or prostate cancers has been observed (Kurogi2021SULT).

Alterations in SULT1B1 expression have been studied in the context of liver diseases, but findings are inconsistent. There are no consistent changes in SULT1B1 expression in conditions like hepatocellular carcinoma or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, making it challenging to determine its pathophysiological significance (Xie2020The). The enzyme's role in detoxifying phenolic compounds suggests its importance in protecting against harmful substances, but specific clinical implications of expression changes remain unclear (Alnouti2006Tissue).

Interactions with environmental toxins, such as di-isononyl phthalate metabolites, have been studied, but these metabolites do not significantly inhibit SULT1B1 due to their physicochemical properties (Ceauranu2023Evaluation). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of SULT1B1 gene mutations and expression alterations.

## Interactions
SULT1B1 is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly within the sulfotransferase family. It has been identified as interacting with SULT1E1, as part of a complex network of enzymes involved in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate biosynthesis. This interaction was observed in a study using affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis from rat liver tissue lysate, which identified SULT1B1 as one of the proteins interacting with SULT1E1 (Tumilovich2024The).

The enzyme is also known to be inhibited by certain phthalate monoesters, which can affect its activity. For instance, mono-hexyl phthalate (MHP), mono-octyl phthalate (MOP), and mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) have been shown to significantly inhibit SULT1B1. This inhibition was characterized using enzyme activity assays and molecular docking studies, which provided insights into the binding interactions between these inhibitors and SULT1B1 (Huang2022Inhibition).

However, SULT1B1 does not interact with certain larger and more hydrophobic metabolites, such as those derived from di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP), due to their inability to fit into the enzyme's active site (Ceauranu2023Evaluation).
