# POLE4

## Overview
The POLE4 gene encodes the DNA polymerase epsilon 4, accessory subunit, a critical component of the DNA polymerase epsilon (Polε) complex, which plays a pivotal role in DNA replication and repair. As the smallest accessory subunit, POLE4 is integral to the stability and function of the Polε complex, interacting with other subunits such as POLE1, POLE2, and POLE3. The POLE3-POLE4 complex, in particular, acts as a histone chaperone, facilitating the assembly and maintenance of chromatin structure during DNA replication by binding to histones H3-H4. This interaction is essential for the accurate duplication of genomic DNA and the preservation of epigenetic information, thereby ensuring genomic stability and proper cellular function (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

## Structure
The POLE4 protein is a component of the DNA polymerase epsilon (Polε) complex, specifically forming a part of the POLE3-POLE4 complex. It is characterized by a C-terminal H2A-like histone fold domain, which is preceded by a flexible and unstructured tail. This structural configuration facilitates its interaction with POLE3, forming a stable complex essential for the integrity of the Polε complex (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

The interaction between POLE3 and POLE4 is mediated by conserved residues, notably Phe44 in POLE3 and Phe74 in POLE4, which engage in pi stacking of their side chains. Mutations in these residues disrupt the interaction, highlighting their importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the complex (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

The POLE3-POLE4 complex also interacts with histones H3-H4, suggesting a role in linking the replisome and histone assembly pathways during DNA replication. This interaction is salt-dependent and specific, as neither POLE3 nor POLE4 binds to H2A-H2B under the same conditions (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4). The structural model of POLE4, based on superposition onto H2A, aligns with the crystal structure of yeast homologs, supporting the proposed structural features (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

## Function
The POLE4 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the POLE3-POLE4 complex, which functions as a histone chaperone involved in maintaining chromatin integrity during DNA replication. This complex specifically binds to histones H3-H4, promoting tetrasome formation and facilitating DNA supercoiling, which are essential for replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. This process ensures the accurate duplication of genomic DNA and the epigenetic information encoded in histones, thereby maintaining chromatin structure and function in healthy cells (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

POLE4 is the smallest accessory subunit of the DNA polymerase epsilon (Polε) complex and is vital for the stability of the entire Polε complex. It interacts with the catalytic core components, POLE1 and POLE2, and is necessary for their stability. The absence of POLE4 leads to a significant reduction in POLE3 levels, indicating that POLE3 and POLE4 form a stable subcomplex in vivo (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

The POLE3-POLE4 complex is involved in the deposition of newly synthesized histones and the recycling of parental histones, coordinating histone deposition pathways to maintain chromatin integrity. This coordination is crucial for proper DNA replication and cellular function, impacting processes such as stemness and cellular differentiation (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
POLE4 is a subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon, a complex crucial for DNA replication and repair. It physically interacts with other subunits of the polymerase, including POLE, POLE2, and POLE3. These interactions are essential for forming a multiprotein complex that facilitates the polymerase's role in leading-strand DNA synthesis. The assembly of these subunits into a functional complex is critical for the polymerase's activity, ensuring accurate and efficient DNA replication. The interaction between POLE4 and the other subunits helps stabilize the complex and may influence its enzymatic activity, although the specific mechanisms of these interactions are not fully detailed in the provided context. The formation of this complex underscores the importance of POLE4 in maintaining genomic stability through its role in DNA synthesis and repair processes.
