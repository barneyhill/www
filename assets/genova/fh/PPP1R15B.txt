# PPP1R15B

## Overview
The PPP1R15B gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15B, commonly referred to as CReP. This protein is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and plays a pivotal role in the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), a critical process in the integrated stress response. CReP is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein synthesis, particularly under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress. It forms a complex with PP1, directing it to phosphorylated eIF2α to facilitate its dephosphorylation, which is essential for modulating protein translation and cellular stress responses (Hicks2023The; Abdulkarim2015A). The protein is constitutively expressed and has additional roles in insulin secretion, apoptosis protection, and membrane trafficking, underscoring its importance in various cellular processes (Kloft2012A; Vaneynde2022The). Mutations in PPP1R15B have been linked to several rare syndromes, including those affecting growth and neurodevelopment, as well as conditions like multiple myeloma, highlighting its clinical significance (Xiong2024Super; Kernohan2015Homozygous).

## Structure
The PPP1R15B protein, also known as CReP, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) involved in the dephosphorylation of eIF2α, a key process in the integrated stress response. The protein contains a conserved C-terminal region of approximately 70 residues, which is crucial for its function. This region includes a PP1-anchoring domain characterized by the RVxF motif, essential for binding to the PP1 catalytic subunit (crespillo2018eif2; Yan2021Higherorder). The RVxF motif engages hydrophobic clefts on the PP1 catalytic subunit, a common feature among PP1 regulatory subunits (crespillo2018eif2).

The C-terminal region of PPP1R15B is predicted to have two regions with a helical secondary structure, which may serve as potential protein binding sites, although these regions are not visible in the crystal structure (crespillo2018eif2). The N-terminal half of this core binds PP1c, while the C-terminal half binds G-actin, forming a ternary complex that enhances dephosphorylation activity (Yan2021Higherorder).

The PPP1R15B protein is constitutively expressed and functions by continuously dephosphorylating eIF2α under basal conditions (Vaneynde2022The). A specific mutation, Arg658Cys, affects the conserved C-terminal functional core, impacting the interaction between CReP and PP1 (Vaneynde2022The). The structure of PPP1R15B remains largely unchanged upon binding with PP1G, and the presence of metal ions in the catalytic groove is noted, with variations in occupancy observed across different crystal structures (Chen2015Gactin).

## Function
The PPP1R15B gene encodes a regulatory subunit known as CReP, which is crucial for the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) in healthy human cells. This process is essential for regulating protein synthesis and maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Hicks2023The; Abdulkarim2015A). CReP forms a complex with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), targeting it to phosphorylated eIF2α, thereby facilitating its dephosphorylation. This action helps manage the phosphorylation state of eIF2α, which is critical for protein translation and cellular stress responses (Hicks2023The; Kernohan2015Homozygous).

In pancreatic beta-cells, PPP1R15B plays a significant role in regulating insulin secretion and protecting against apoptosis, especially under ER stress and exposure to free fatty acids (Abdulkarim2015A). The protein is also involved in membrane trafficking, independent of its role in translation initiation, by regulating the uptake of pore-forming toxins and facilitating vesicle formation (Kloft2012A). These functions highlight the importance of PPP1R15B in maintaining normal cellular processes and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP1R15B gene have been linked to several rare syndromes and conditions. A homozygous mutation in PPP1R15B was identified in two siblings with a syndrome characterized by diabetes, short stature, and microcephaly. This mutation, R658C, is located in a highly conserved region critical for protein function, affecting its ability to bind PP1, which is essential for its role in the ER stress response (Abdulkarim2015A). Another study identified a homozygous missense mutation in PPP1R15B in siblings with severe microcephaly, short stature, delayed myelination, and intellectual disability, suggesting its role in translation initiation and human development (Kernohan2015Homozygous).

Alterations in PPP1R15B expression have also been implicated in multiple myeloma (MM). The gene is frequently overexpressed in MM cells, driven by super enhancers, and is associated with the regulation of protein homeostasis. This overexpression is linked to increased protein synthesis and immunoglobulin production, contributing to MM pathogenesis. Targeting the PP1-PPP1R15B complex could be a potential therapeutic strategy for MM (Xiong2024Super).

Additionally, compound heterozygous mutations in PPP1R15B have been associated with infantile cirrhosis, growth impairment, and neurodevelopmental anomalies, highlighting its importance in liver function and development (Mohammad2016Infantile).

## Interactions
PPP1R15B, also known as CReP, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and plays a crucial role in the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). This interaction is essential for modulating protein synthesis and stress responses. PPP1R15B forms a holophosphatase complex with PP1, which specifically targets eIF2α for dephosphorylation, maintaining its dephosphorylated state under unstressed conditions (Abdulkarim2015A; Kernohan2015Homozygous).

The R658C mutation in PPP1R15B disrupts its interaction with PP1, leading to impaired dephosphorylation of eIF2α. This mutation affects the protein's ability to bind PP1, destabilizing the PPP1R15B-PP1 complex and reducing its phosphatase activity (Abdulkarim2015A; Kernohan2015Homozygous). The mutation is located within the PPP1C binding site, which is crucial for the interaction between PPP1R15B and PP1 (Kernohan2015Homozygous).

In multiple myeloma, PPP1R15B is overexpressed due to super enhancer acquisition, which involves transcription factors such as CEBPB and YY1. These factors regulate PPP1R15B expression by binding to its promoter and super-enhancer regions, influencing its role in protein homeostasis and cell survival (Xiong2024Super).
