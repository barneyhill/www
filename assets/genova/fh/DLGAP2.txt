# DLGAP2

## Overview
DLGAP2, or Discs Large Homolog Associated Protein 2, is a gene that encodes the DLG associated protein 2, a crucial scaffold protein predominantly expressed in the brain. This protein is a member of the DLGAP family, which plays a significant role in synaptic organization and signaling. DLG associated protein 2 is primarily located in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons, where it interacts with other key proteins such as DLG4 (PSD-95), SHANK, and Homer, contributing to synaptic stability and plasticity. These interactions are vital for cognitive functions, including learning and memory. The protein is involved in the regulation of ion channels and modulation of glutamate receptors, such as NMDA and AMPA receptors, at the synapse. Alterations in the expression of DLGAP2 have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal synaptic function and neuronal signaling (Li2014Role; Rasmussen2017The; JiangXie2014Autismassociated).

## Structure
The DLGAP2 protein is a member of the DLGAP family, which includes DLGAP1-4, and is characterized by three main domains: a 14 amino acid repeat domain, a dynein light chain (DLC) domain, and a GKAP homology domain 1 (GH1) (Rasmussen2017The). The 14-a.a. repeat domain facilitates binding to the GK domain of DLG proteins, with its location varying depending on the isoform (Rasmussen2017The). The DLC domain interacts with motor protein subunits in dendrites and the postsynaptic density (PSD), while the GH1 domain, composed of four alpha helices, shows high sequence homology among DLGAP proteins (Rasmussen2017The).

DLGAP2 is involved in forming multiprotein complexes at synaptic junctions, contributing to its quaternary structure. It interacts with other scaffold proteins like DLG and SHANK, playing a role in synaptic scaling and stabilization of glutamate receptors (Rasmussen2017The). The protein is expressed mainly in the brain, with alternative splicing resulting in different transcripts in testis and brain (Ranta2000Positional). Despite its importance, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, are not fully detailed in the available literature.

## Function
DLGAP2, also known as SAPAP2, is a protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and signaling within the brain. It is primarily located in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons, where it acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions with other key proteins such as DLG4 (PSD-95), SHANK, and Homer. These interactions are essential for maintaining synaptic stability and plasticity, which are critical for cognitive functions like learning and memory (Rasmussen2017The; Chien2013Deep).

DLGAP2 is involved in the regulation of ion channels and the modulation of glutamate receptors, including NMDA and AMPA receptors, at the synapse. It plays a significant role in synaptic scaling, a process that adjusts the strength of synaptic transmission in response to changes in neuronal activity (Rasmussen2017The). The protein is also implicated in endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic depression, influencing synaptic plasticity by regulating endocannabinoid production (Rasmussen2017The).

Alterations in DLGAP2 expression have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal synaptic function and neuronal signaling (Li2014Role; Rasmussen2017The). The protein's activity in the postsynaptic density underscores its role in the structural and functional integrity of synapses (Li2014Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DLGAP2 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), DLGAP2 is considered a candidate gene due to its role in synaptic function and social behavior. Studies have identified various missense variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DLGAP2 that may increase the risk of ASD, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (JiangXie2014Autismassociated; Chien2013Deep). DLGAP2 knockout mice exhibit aggressive behaviors and synaptic deficits, suggesting a link between DLGAP2 dysfunction and ASD-related symptoms (JiangXie2014Autismassociated).

DLGAP2 is also associated with schizophrenia. Genetic studies have identified several rare mutations and haplotypes in DLGAP2 that may contribute to the disorder, potentially through increased gene expression and altered synaptic signaling (Li2014Role). The gene's involvement in synaptic organization and neuronal signaling underscores its potential role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Li2014Role).

Alterations in DLGAP2 expression have been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol dependence. In PTSD, changes in DLGAP2 methylation and expression have been observed in the hippocampus, a region associated with the disorder (Rasmussen2017The). In alcohol dependence, differential methylation of DLGAP2 is associated with altered reward processing, highlighting its role in addiction (Meng2019Genotypedependent).

## Interactions
DLGAP2, a protein encoded by the DLGAP2 gene, is involved in several critical interactions within the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons. It interacts with the DLG family of proteins, specifically DLG4 (also known as PSD-95), through its guanylate kinase domain. This interaction is essential for the stabilization of synaptic structures and the regulation of neurotransmission (Li2014Role; JiangXie2014Autismassociated). DLGAP2 also forms part of a complex with SHANK proteins, which are crucial for synaptic morphogenesis and function. This complex, known as the DLG4-DLGAP-SHANK complex, plays a significant role in synaptic signaling and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (JiangXie2014Autismassociated).

DLGAP2 indirectly interacts with AMPA receptors through its association with Stargazin via DLG4, linking it to the synaptic targeting of these receptors (Rasmussen2017The). Additionally, DLGAP2 is involved in a complex with Homer proteins, which connect it to group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), although DLGAP2 does not directly bind to Homer proteins (Rasmussen2017The). These interactions highlight DLGAP2's role in synaptic stability and plasticity, influencing cognitive processes and potentially contributing to psychiatric disorders.
