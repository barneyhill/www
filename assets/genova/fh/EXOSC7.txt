# EXOSC7

## Overview
EXOSC7 is a gene that encodes the protein exosome component 7, a non-catalytic subunit of the RNA exosome complex, which is integral to RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotic cells. The protein is categorized as a structural component, contributing to the formation of the hexameric ring structure that stabilizes the exosome complex (Zhang2019Exosome; de2023Analysis). EXOSC7 is involved in maintaining RNA homeostasis by participating in the 3' to 5' mRNA degradation pathway, and it plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation, particularly in erythropoiesis and epidermal progenitor cell maintenance (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional; McIver2016Exosome). The protein's interactions within the exosome complex are essential for its function, and its expression levels have been linked to clinical outcomes in diseases such as mantle cell lymphoma, highlighting its potential impact on RNA metabolism and disease progression (Zhang2019Exosome).

## Structure
The EXOSC7 protein is a structural component of the RNA exosome complex, which is involved in RNA processing and degradation. It is one of the nine non-catalytic subunits that form the core of the exosome, specifically contributing to the hexameric ring structure that stabilizes the complex (Zhang2019Exosome; de2023Analysis). This hexameric core is composed of subunits EXOSC4 through EXOSC9, with EXOSC7 playing a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the exosome (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

The protein features domains typical of exosome components, including an S1 RNA-binding domain and a KH domain, which are involved in RNA binding and stabilization (Gerlach2018Distinct). These domains contribute to the protein's ability to interact with RNA substrates as they are processed through the exosome complex. The structural organization of EXOSC7, along with other subunits, forms a barrel-like structure that facilitates the exosome's function in RNA degradation (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

While specific post-translational modifications and splice variants of EXOSC7 are not detailed in the provided context, such modifications could potentially influence its function and interactions within the exosome complex.

## Function
EXOSC7 is a critical component of the RNA exosome complex, a highly conserved multi-protein machine involved in RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotic cells. This complex plays a significant role in maintaining RNA homeostasis by degrading various RNA molecules, primarily through the 3' to 5' mRNA degradation pathway (Zhang2019Exosome). EXOSC7, along with other subunits like EXOSC8 and EXOSC9, is essential for the structural integrity of the exosome complex, which is crucial for its function in RNA degradation and processing (McIver2016Exosome).

In healthy human cells, EXOSC7 is involved in regulating the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. It is particularly important in processes such as erythropoiesis, where it modulates RNA processing to ensure the expression of key signaling molecules like the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase, while preventing premature differentiation signals (McIver2016Exosome). In epidermal progenitor cells, EXOSC7 helps maintain the undifferentiated state by regulating the expression of genes associated with proliferation and differentiation (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

EXOSC7 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to RNA quality control and the regulation of gene expression, which are vital for cellular differentiation and organismal development (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

## Clinical Significance
EXOSC7, a component of the RNA exosome complex, plays a significant role in RNA processing and degradation. Alterations in the expression of EXOSC7 have been linked to various clinical implications. In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), EXOSC7 is classified as a 'harmful gene' with a hazard ratio greater than 1, indicating a negative effect on patient survival. High expression levels of EXOSC7, along with other EXOSC genes, correlate with poorer survival outcomes in MCL patients, as indicated by a high EXO.index (Zhang2019Exosome).

While specific diseases directly caused by mutations in EXOSC7 have not been reported, the gene's role in RNA metabolism suggests potential implications in neurological disorders. The RNA exosome, including EXOSC7, is crucial for maintaining cellular processes, and its dysfunction could contribute to neurodegenerative conditions. High transcript levels of EXOSC7 in tissues such as the heart, kidney, and skin suggest its importance in these areas, although direct associations with specific pathologies remain to be established (de2023Analysis).

Overall, the clinical significance of EXOSC7 is primarily associated with its expression levels and potential involvement in RNA-related pathologies, particularly in the context of cancer and possibly neurological diseases.

## Interactions
EXOSC7 is a component of the exosome complex, a multi-protein assembly involved in RNA processing and degradation. It interacts with other exosome components, including EXOSC1, EXOSC6, and EXOSC8, to form a stable complex that is essential for its function in RNA degradation (Sterrett2021A). EXOSC7 has been shown to modulate the activity of EXOSC1 by decreasing its ability to cleave single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), indicating an inhibitory interaction that affects EXOSC1's function in DNA processing (Xiao2021Exosome). 

In the context of cancer, EXOSC7 is classified as a 'harmful gene' in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) due to its negative impact on patient survival. It shows a positive correlation with EXOSC4 and EXOSC5, and a negative correlation with EXOSC9 and EXOSC8, suggesting complex interactions within the exosome that influence its role in disease progression (Zhang2019Exosome). These interactions highlight the importance of EXOSC7 in maintaining the integrity and function of the exosome complex, as well as its potential impact on cellular processes related to RNA metabolism and cancer prognosis.
