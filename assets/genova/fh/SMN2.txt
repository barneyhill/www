# SMN2

## Overview
The SMN2 gene, located on chromosome 5q13, is a paralog of the SMN1 gene and encodes the survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric (SMN2) protein. This protein is a key component of the spliceosomal machinery, playing a crucial role in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing (Jodelka2010A; Chaytow2018The). The SMN2 protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a Tudor domain that facilitates interactions with methylated proteins, and a C-terminal YG box necessary for oligomerization and interaction with other proteins (Riboldi2023SMN). Unlike SMN1, the SMN2 gene predominantly produces a truncated protein due to alternative splicing that often excludes exon 7, resulting in reduced functional protein levels (Seo2016A). The number of SMN2 gene copies can modulate the severity of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disorder caused by SMN1 mutations, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Butchbach2021Genomic).

## Structure
The SMN2 gene encodes the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is crucial for the assembly of the spliceosomal complex. The SMN protein is composed of several conserved functional domains. The N-terminal region contains an interaction motif for binding to Gemin2, a central Tudor domain that interacts with di-methylated proteins, and a C-terminal YG box essential for self-oligomerization and interaction with other Gemins (Riboldi2023SMN). The Tudor domain is particularly important for interactions with methylated arginine or lysine residues, playing a significant role in snRNP biogenesis (Riboldi2023SMN).

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and sumoylation regulate the function and stability of the SMN protein. Phosphorylation affects SMN's function, stability, and subcellular distribution, while methylation, especially symmetrical dimethylation, is crucial for snRNP assembly (Riboldi2023SMN). Ubiquitination and acetylation also influence SMN's stability and interactions, with specific sites identified for these modifications (Riboldi2023SMN).

The SMN2 gene predominantly produces a truncated SMN protein due to exon 7 exclusion, but splice variants like SMN6B have been identified. SMN6B includes an additional exon, 6B, which alters the C-terminus of the protein, affecting its stability and interaction with other proteins (Seo2016A).

## Function
The SMN2 gene encodes the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is crucial for the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), essential components of the splicing machinery in cells (Jodelka2010A). The SMN protein is involved in several cellular processes, including spliceosome assembly, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and mitochondrial function (Chaytow2018The). It acts as an assembly factor for snRNPs, which are vital for pre-mRNA splicing, influencing motor neuron health and function (Nölle2011The).

In healthy human cells, the SMN protein is found in nuclear bodies, such as Cajal bodies, where it plays a role in the biogenesis of snRNPs (Chaytow2018The). The protein contains several functional motifs, including a Tudor domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for spliceosome assembly (Chaytow2018The). The SMN protein is also involved in the transport of mRNA along axons, promoting axonal outgrowth and neuromuscular maturation (Nölle2011The). The presence of SMN in these cellular processes is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper neuromuscular function (Chaytow2018The).

## Clinical Significance
The SMN2 gene plays a critical role in modifying the severity of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disorder primarily caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene. SMA is characterized by the loss of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. The number of SMN2 copies can influence the disease's severity, with higher copy numbers generally associated with milder forms of SMA (Butchbach2021Genomic). 

Certain variants in the SMN2 gene can also affect the clinical phenotype of SMA. For instance, the c.859G>C variant in exon 7 is associated with a milder SMA phenotype due to increased exon 7 inclusion, which enhances the production of functional SMN protein (BlascoPérez2022Deep; Vezain2010A). This variant disrupts a binding site for hnRNP A1, a protein that typically promotes exon 7 exclusion, thereby improving splicing and increasing full-length SMN2 mRNA levels (Vezain2010A).

The SMN2 gene's expression and splicing are also influenced by splicing modifiers like SMN-C3, which promote exon 7 inclusion and increase SMN protein levels, offering potential therapeutic benefits for SMA (Naryshkin2014SMN2). These findings underscore the importance of SMN2 in SMA pathogenesis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
The SMN2 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing. The SMN protein, produced by SMN2, is a part of a multiprotein complex that includes Gemins 2-6. This complex is crucial for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, interacting with several proteins that often contain arginine and glycine-rich (RG) domains. These interactions are mediated by symmetrical dimethylarginine modifications, enhancing the binding affinity to the SMN complex (Paushkin2002The).

The SMN complex also interacts with Sm proteins, which are associated with uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (UsnRNAs) to form UsnRNP particles, key components of the spliceosomal machinery (Paushkin2002The). Additionally, the SMN protein interacts with RNA helicase A (RHA) and proteins like GAR1 and fibrillarin, which are involved in ribosomal RNA processing (Paushkin2002The).

Small molecule splicing modifiers, such as SMN-C5 and NVS-SM1, interact with the SMN2 pre-mRNA and U1 snRNA, promoting the inclusion of exon 7 in SMN2 by stabilizing an RNP complex unique to SMN2 transcripts. These compounds enhance the interaction of U1 snRNP with the 5′ splice site of SMN2 exon 7, which is crucial for efficient exon inclusion (Sivaramakrishnan2017Binding).
