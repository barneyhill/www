# RGPD5

## Overview
RGPD5 (RANBP2 like and GRIP domain containing 5) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, including nuclear transport and cytoskeletal organization. The RGPD5 protein is associated with the nuclear pore complex, which is essential for regulating the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, thereby maintaining cellular function and homeostasis. This protein plays a significant role in cytoskeletal organization, contributing to the structural integrity and functionality of the cell. By facilitating molecular movement across the nuclear envelope and supporting the cytoskeleton, RGPD5 is crucial for cellular responses to internal and external signals, underscoring its importance in sustaining cellular homeostasis and overall organismal health (Chen2019Systematic; Zhang2017miR3635p; Anuntakarun2021Identification; Hladilkova2015A).

## Structure


## Function
RGPD5 (RANBP2 like and GRIP domain containing 5) encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in nuclear transport and cytoskeletal organization. The RGPD5 protein is associated with the nuclear pore complex, a critical structure that regulates the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This transport is essential for maintaining cellular function and homeostasis, as it ensures that necessary proteins and RNA molecules are correctly distributed within the cell.

In addition to its role in nuclear transport, RGPD5 is implicated in maintaining cellular structure. By contributing to cytoskeletal organization, the protein helps preserve the integrity and functionality of the cell. This structural support is vital for the proper operation of cellular processes and for the overall stability of the cell's architecture.

The activities of RGPD5 within the cell underscore its importance in sustaining cellular homeostasis. By facilitating the movement of molecules across the nuclear envelope and supporting the cytoskeleton, RGPD5 ensures that cells can efficiently respond to internal and external signals, thereby contributing to the organism's overall health and functionality.

## Clinical Significance
RGPD5 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or genetic mutations. In Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (KFD), RGPD5 is the most up-regulated gene in affected lymph node tissue, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathology. The study indicates that cancer-related genes, including RGPD5, may contribute to the cell necrosis observed in KFD, highlighting a possible link between up-regulated genes in KFD and human cancers (Anuntakarun2021Identification).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (KIRC), RGPD5 is associated with survival outcomes through its alternative splicing events. The expression of RGPD5 and its splicing events are influenced by specific splicing factors, such as KHDRBS3 and SRSF6, which correlate with patient survival times (Chen2019Systematic).

RGPD5 is also part of the minimal deletion in 2q13 deletion syndrome, which is associated with developmental delay and mild facial dysmorphisms. This syndrome exhibits incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, suggesting that RGPD5 may contribute to the risk of developmental disorders (Hladilkova2015A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RGPD5 is targeted by hsa-miR-363-5p, with its expression potentially influencing angiogenic properties and tumor invasion, although specific details on its role in cancer are limited (Zhang2017miR3635p).
