# SMC1B

## Overview
SMC1B is a gene that encodes the protein structural maintenance of chromosomes 1B, which is a crucial component of the cohesin complex. This protein plays a significant role in chromosome dynamics, particularly during meiosis, where it is essential for proper chromosome segregation. Unlike its paralog SMC1A, SMC1B is also expressed in somatic cells, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, and genome stability (Mannini2015SMC1B). The SMC1B protein interacts with other cohesin subunits, such as SMC3 and RAD21, but not with SMC1A, indicating a distinct functional role within the cohesin complex (Mannini2015SMC1B). Its involvement in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation underscores its importance beyond meiosis, with implications in both reproductive health and cancer (Nie2021Clinical; Murdoch2013Altered).

## Function
SMC1B is a component of the cohesin complex, traditionally associated with meiosis, but it is also expressed in somatic cells, including human primary fibroblasts. In these cells, SMC1B interacts with mitotic cohesin proteins such as SMC3 and RAD21, contributing to the cohesin complex's role in chromosome segregation, gene expression regulation, and genome stability (Mannini2015SMC1B). Although SMC1B is not essential for maintaining centromere cohesion, its depletion leads to significant dysregulation of gene expression, with a majority of affected genes being downregulated (Mannini2015SMC1B). SMC1B is involved in DNA repair processes, particularly in repairing double-strand breaks, which is crucial for maintaining genome stability (Mannini2015SMC1B).

SMC1B localizes primarily at intergenic and gene body regions, suggesting a role in regulating transcription of gene clusters, such as HOX and PCDHB (Mannini2015SMC1B). Despite its involvement in these processes, the absence of SMC1B does not affect chromosome segregation, indicating that other cohesin components, like SMC1A, may compensate for its loss in somatic cells (Mannini2015SMC1B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SMC1B gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in reproductive health and cancer. In the context of meiosis, SMC1B is crucial for proper chromosome segregation. Altered expression or mutations in SMC1B can lead to meiotic errors, resulting in chromosomally abnormal gametes. This increases the risk of aneuploid pregnancies and structural chromosome abnormalities, which are major causes of birth defects and miscarriages (Murdoch2013Altered). In females, mutations in SMC1B can lead to subfertility and an increased likelihood of producing chromosomally abnormal eggs, while in males, such mutations can result in sterility (Murdoch2013Altered).

In cancer, SMC1B is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is overexpressed in HCC tissues, and high levels of SMC1B are associated with poor overall survival and progression-free survival in patients. This suggests that SMC1B could serve as a prognostic marker for HCC (Nie2021Clinical). The gene's expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, indicating a potential role in modulating immune responses in cancer (Nie2021Clinical).

## Interactions
SMC1B, a cohesin complex protein, is traditionally associated with meiosis but is also expressed in somatic tissues such as the brain, heart, and spleen. In these tissues, SMC1B physically interacts with other cohesin proteins, including SMC3 and RAD21, forming part of the cohesin complex in somatic cells. This interaction was demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which showed that SMC1B associates with SMC3 and RAD21 but not with SMC1A, indicating a specific role in the cohesin complex distinct from SMC1A (Mannini2015SMC1B).

SMC1B is also involved in the DNA damage response in human fibroblasts, where it interacts with the SMC3 cohesin subunit. Despite its involvement in DNA repair processes, SMC1B does not physically associate with ATM, a protein known for its role in the DNA damage response (Mannini2015SMC1B). The depletion of SMC1B affects gene transcription, particularly in gene clusters like HOX and PCDHB, suggesting a role in gene expression regulation. Genes with altered expression due to SMC1B depletion are enriched for cohesin-SMC1B binding, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Mannini2015SMC1B).
