# PALS1

## Overview
PALS1, or Protein Associated with Lin Seven 1, is a gene that encodes a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, specifically the MAGUK p55 subfamily member 5 (MPP5). The PALS1 protein is characterized by its PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains, which facilitate its role as a scaffolding protein involved in cellular signaling and structural organization. It is a critical component of the Crumbs (Crb) polarity complex, playing a significant role in establishing and maintaining epithelial cell polarity by forming and maintaining tight and adherens junctions. PALS1 is essential for the proper functioning of various tissues, including the kidney and retina, where it ensures the structural integrity and polarity of epithelial cells. Its interactions with proteins such as CRB1, PATJ, and VE-cadherin are crucial for its function in cell polarity and junction formation. Alterations in PALS1 expression or function are associated with several diseases, including colorectal cancer and retinal dystrophies, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Straight2004Loss; Groh2023PALS1; Cho2012Genetic).

## Structure
PALS1, a member of the MAGUK family, is characterized by its PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for cellular signaling and structural organization. The PDZ domain of PALS1, spanning residues 251-335, adopts a canonical PDZ fold with two β-sheets flanked by two α-helices (Ivanova2015Structures). This domain is involved in binding interactions with various peptides, including the Crb1 peptide and viral proteins, through a peptide-binding groove formed by the β2 strand and helix α2 (Javorsky2021Structural).

The PDZ domain's interaction with the Crb1 peptide is characterized by a high affinity, with a dissociation constant (K_d) of 9.2 mM, and involves the ERLI motif binding as an antiparallel β-strand (Ivanova2015Structures). The structure of the PALS1 PDZ domain in complex with the Crb1 peptide was determined at 1.23 Å resolution, revealing specific hydrogen bonds with residues Leu267, Gly268, and Ala269 (Ivanova2015Structures).

PALS1 also interacts with viral proteins, such as the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein, which binds to a hydrophobic pocket formed by the PDZ and SH3 domains. This interaction is significant for viral virulence and involves the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of the viral protein (Chai2021Structural). The PALS1 protein can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and functions.

## Function
PALS1, also known as MAGUK p55 subfamily member 5 (MPP5), is a critical component of the Crumbs (Crb) polarity complex, which plays a significant role in establishing and maintaining epithelial cell polarity. In epithelial cells, PALS1 is essential for the formation and maintenance of tight junctions and adherens junctions, which are crucial for cell-cell contact and the establishment of apicobasal polarity (Straight2004Loss; Groh2023PALS1). PALS1 acts as an adaptor protein, linking Crumbs and PATJ, and is involved in recruiting other proteins to tight junctions, thereby maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial tissues (Roh2002The).

In the human kidney, PALS1 is highly expressed in nephrons, where it is vital for maintaining the polarization of renal epithelial cells, necessary for proper nephron function (Berghaus2022Impact). PALS1 also regulates the distribution of tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and Occludin, ensuring a continuous tight junction belt, which is important for paracellular transport and epithelial barrier function (Groh2023PALS1).

In the retina, PALS1 is indispensable for the proper localization of Crb proteins, maintaining retinal polarity, and ensuring the survival of retinal neurons, which is crucial for normal visual function (Cho2012Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PALS1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer, downregulation of PALS1 leads to increased cell migration and invasion due to enhanced activation of Arf6 and Rac1, which are involved in cell motility. This effect is particularly pronounced in the absence of SMAP1, a gene that functions redundantly with PALS1 to inhibit Arf6. The simultaneous downregulation of both PALS1 and SMAP1 is linked to poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients, highlighting their combined role in cancer progression (Harms2022Pals1; Lüttgenau2021Pals1).

In the context of retinal diseases, PALS1 is crucial for maintaining the Crb polarity complex, which is essential for retinal development. Genetic ablation of PALS1 in mice models the retinal pathology of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a severe early-onset retinal dystrophy. PALS1 deficiency leads to retinal degeneration, disorganization, and early visual impairment, mimicking symptoms of LCA. This suggests that PALS1 is indispensable for retinal cell organization and survival, and its deficiency can lead to LCA-like pathology (Cho2012Genetic).

PALS1 haploinsufficiency is also linked to kidney-related conditions, such as proteinuria and cyst formation, indicating its role in kidney function and disease (Weide2017Pals1).

## Interactions
PALS1, a member of the MAGUK family, is involved in several critical protein interactions that contribute to cell polarity and tight junction formation. It acts as an adaptor protein in the Crumbs complex, interacting with CRB1 and PATJ. This interaction is crucial for targeting CRB1 to tight junctions, forming a ternary complex with PATJ and PALS1, which is evolutionarily conserved across species (Roh2002The).

In vascular endothelial cells, PALS1 interacts directly with VE-cadherin, a key component of adherens junctions. This interaction is specific to the canonical 82 kDa isoform of PALS1 and occurs at the juxtamembrane domain of VE-cadherin, facilitating PALS1's localization to intercellular junctions (Brinkmann2016VEcadherin).

PALS1 also binds to the SARS coronavirus E protein through its PDZ domain. This interaction involves a PDZ domain-binding motif at the carboxy-terminus of the E protein, which can compete with CRB3 for binding to PALS1, potentially affecting tight junction integrity and epithelial morphogenesis (Teoh2010The).

The interaction between PALS1 and its partners, such as PATJ and CRB3, is essential for maintaining tight junction stability and cell polarity, as demonstrated by the effects of PALS1 suppression in MDCKII cells (Straight2004Loss).
