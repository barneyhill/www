# NRXN3

## Overview
The NRXN3 gene encodes neurexin 3, a transmembrane cell adhesion molecule that is part of the neurexin family, which plays a pivotal role in synaptic function and plasticity. Neurexin 3 is primarily located at the presynaptic terminal of neurons, where it facilitates synaptic signaling through interactions with various postsynaptic partners, such as neuroligins and LRRTMs (Reissner2013Neurexins; Südhof2017Synaptic). The gene is notable for its extensive alternative splicing, which generates multiple isoforms that contribute to the diversity of synaptic functions (Reissner2013Neurexins). Neurexin 3's structure includes laminin-neurexin-sex hormone binding globulin (LNS) domains and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, which are crucial for its role in synaptic adhesion and organization (Südhof2017Synaptic). The functional versatility of NRXN3 is underscored by its involvement in synaptic vesicle recruitment and modulation of synaptic strength, impacting learning and memory processes (Aoto2013Presynaptic; Koumoundourou2024Regulation).

## Structure
Neurexin 3 (NRXN3) is a member of the neurexin family, which are transmembrane cell adhesion molecules primarily functioning at the presynaptic terminal in neurons. The NRXN3 gene is one of the largest in the mammalian genome, characterized by long introns and extensive alternative splicing, resulting in a wide array of isoforms (Reissner2013Neurexins). The protein structure of NRXN3 includes multiple domains, such as laminin-neurexin-sex hormone binding globulin (LNS) domains and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. α-neurexins contain six LNS domains interspersed with EGF-like repeats, while β-neurexins are N-terminally truncated versions of α-neurexins (Reissner2013Neurexins; Südhof2017Synaptic).

The LNS domains are structurally similar to the concanavalin A fold family and are thought to behave like glycan-binding lectins, although a general function as lectins has not been demonstrated (Reissner2013Neurexins). Neurexins are N-glycosylated, and the sequence between αLNS6 and the transmembrane region is O-glycosylated (Reissner2013Neurexins). Alternative splicing at sites such as SS4 significantly influences the binding interactions of neurexins with their postsynaptic partners, affecting synaptic properties and plasticity (Reissner2013Neurexins; Südhof2017Synaptic). These structural features and modifications are crucial for the diverse functions of NRXN3 in synaptic signaling and neural circuit dynamics.

## Function
Neurexin-3 (NRXN3) is a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in synaptic function and plasticity. It is involved in the stabilization and trafficking of postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) through trans-synaptic interactions with postsynaptic ligands such as neuroligins and LRRTMs. This interaction is particularly important for controlling postsynaptic AMPAR levels, which are essential for synaptic strength and plasticity (Aoto2013Presynaptic). 

NRXN3 undergoes alternative splicing, notably at splice site 4 (SS4), which results in different functional outcomes. The SS4- variant of NRXN3 is critical for stabilizing postsynaptic AMPARs, while the SS4+ variant does not support this stabilization, leading to decreased synaptic AMPAR levels and increased endocytosis (Aoto2013Presynaptic). This splicing also affects NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP), indicating that presynaptic NRXN3 can influence postsynaptic LTP (Aoto2013Presynaptic).

In the hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapse, NRXN3 interacts with C1ql2 to recruit presynaptic vesicles, a process essential for synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation (Koumoundourou2024Regulation). This interaction underscores NRXN3's role in modulating synaptic function and plasticity, impacting learning and memory processes (Koumoundourou2024Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
The NRXN3 gene, which is crucial for synaptic function, has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Alterations in NRXN3, such as mutations or disruptions in its expression, have been linked to conditions like schizophrenia and autism. In particular, the gene is known for its role in synaptic transmission and plasticity, with specific variants affecting the function of synaptic connections. For instance, the Nrxn3α variant is essential for maintaining normal synaptic function, and disruptions can lead to altered synaptic signaling and connectivity, which are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. In the context of schizophrenia, NRXN3 is involved in the regulation of synaptic pathways, and its dysfunction can contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease, affecting neural circuits and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, NRXN3 has been associated with cognitive impairments and other neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its role in brain development and function. The gene's interaction with other proteins, such as those involved in synaptic transmission, underscores its importance in maintaining neural circuitry and function, and disruptions in these pathways can lead to various clinical manifestations, including those seen in schizophrenia and autism (TBA). The role of NRXN3 in these conditions underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. 

In addition, NRXN3 has been linked to the regulation of synaptic plasticity and the development of neural circuits, which are crucial for cognitive processes and behavior. The gene's involvement in these pathways suggests that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. Furthermore, alterations in NRXN3 expression have been associated with changes in synaptic function and connectivity, which can contribute to the development of these conditions. For instance, in schizophrenia, the dysregulation of NRXN3 expression has been linked to alterations in synaptic function and connectivity, which can lead to the development of symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions.

## Interactions
Neurexin 3 (NRXN3) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for synaptic function and organization. NRXN3 interacts with neuroligins and LRRTMs, facilitated by a unique heparin sulfate modification, which is regulated by CA10 and FAM19A1-4 (Boxer2022Neurexins). It also forms complexes with neurexophilin 1 (Nxph1) and Fam19a2, which may mediate its synaptic functions (Boxer2022Neurexins).

NRXN3 participates in forming a ternary complex with LAR-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRs) and tetraspanins T178A and T178B. This complex is essential for synapse organization, acting as a core module in neuronal synapse organization (Thivaios2024A). The NRX-T178-PTPR complex integrates into larger synaptic protein networks, linking pre- and post-synaptic proteins and facilitating trans-synaptic signaling (Thivaios2024A).

NRXN3 also interacts with the cell adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor CL1/latrophilin-1, although with lower affinity compared to neurexin-1 and -2. This interaction is regulated by alternative splicing at splice site 4 (SS4) and is calcium-dependent (Boucard2012High). These interactions highlight NRXN3's role in synaptic adhesion and plasticity.
