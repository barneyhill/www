# TBC1D3H

## Overview
TBC1D3H is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 3H, which is part of the TBC1 domain family known for its role in intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. The protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RAB5, a key player in vesicle transport and signal transduction, processes that are crucial in cancer pathways (Zhang2022Comprehensive). TBC1D3H is also involved in immune response regulation, particularly in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, where it is associated with immune cell infiltration, including CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (Wang2021TBC1D3). The protein's interactions, such as with SDCBP, highlight its potential role in complex cellular networks and its significance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

## Interactions
TBC1D3H, a member of the TBC1 domain family, is known to interact with various proteins, playing a role in cellular processes such as intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. One specific interaction identified for TBC1D3H is with the protein SDCBP, discovered through phage display techniques. This interaction is part of efforts to map protein-protein interactions using high-throughput methods like yeast two-hybrid assays, which are particularly useful for studying membrane proteins (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

In the context of immune response and cancer, TBC1D3H is associated with immune infiltration in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). It is positively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. This suggests that TBC1D3H may influence immune cell activity and immune checkpoint pathways, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Wang2021TBC1D3).

TBC1D3H also functions as a GTPase-activating protein for RAB5, implicating it in processes like vesicle transport and signal transduction, which are critical in cancer pathways (Zhang2022Comprehensive).
