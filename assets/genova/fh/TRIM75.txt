# TRIM75

## Overview
TRIM75 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 75, which is part of the TRIM protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of a tripartite motif, which typically includes a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. Proteins in the TRIM family are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TRIM75, like other TRIM proteins, is thought to play a role in the regulation of these processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action are still under investigation. The protein's involvement in cellular pathways suggests potential implications in disease states, making it a subject of interest in clinical research (Qiu2020aarFDC).
