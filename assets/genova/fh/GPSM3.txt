# GPSM3

## Overview
GPSM3, or G protein signaling modulator 3, is a gene that encodes a small regulatory protein involved in the modulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. The protein, also known as G protein signaling modulator 3, functions primarily as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), playing a critical role in cellular signal transduction by binding to inactive Gαi subunits and preventing GDP release. This action modulates the association of Gβγ subunits, thereby influencing various signaling pathways. GPSM3 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, where it acts as a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key player in innate immune responses and inflammation. The protein's interactions with Gβ subunits and its role in stabilizing these subunits until the formation of the Gβγ dimer further underscore its importance in cellular signaling dynamics (Giguère2012Gprotein; Giguère2014G).

## Structure
GPSM3, or G protein signaling modulator 3, is a small protein approximately 160 amino acids in length. It is characterized by the presence of GoLoco motifs, which are involved in binding Gαi·GDP subunits. GPSM3 contains three GoLoco motifs, with the first and third motifs being active in binding, while the second is inactive due to degeneracy (Giguère2012Gprotein). The protein also features a leucine-rich region between amino acids 58 and 68, which is likely to form an α-helix secondary structure. This region is crucial for its interaction with Gβ subunits, as mutations in this leucine-rich area disrupt binding (Giguère2012Gprotein).

The interaction site for Gβ subunits is located between amino acids 50 and 70, which is N-terminal to the first GoLoco motif (Giguère2012Gprotein). GPSM3 interacts with Gβ subunits independently of Gγ subunits, suggesting a unique role in stabilizing Gβ until the formation of the Gβγ dimer (Giguère2012Gprotein). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its function in modulating G-protein signaling and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activity (Giguère2014G). However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of GPSM3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
GPSM3, also known as G protein signaling modulator 3, plays a crucial role in regulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), binding to inactive Gαi subunits and preventing the release of GDP. This action inhibits the association of Gβγ subunits, thereby modulating signal transduction processes (Giguère2012Gprotein; Gall2024From).

GPSM3 is predominantly expressed in cells of the hematopoietic lineage, such as monocytes and macrophages, where it influences immune responses and inflammation. It acts as a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component in the regulation of innate inflammation. By interacting with the leucine-rich repeat domain of NLRP3, GPSM3 inhibits its function, reducing the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β (Giguère2014G).

In addition to its role in inflammasome regulation, GPSM3 interacts with Gβ subunits, stabilizing them and influencing G-protein signaling pathways. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of cellular signal transduction via the Gβγ effector PLCβ, affecting processes such as cellular migration, survival, and angiogenesis in inflammatory conditions (Giguère2012Gprotein; Gall2024From).

## Clinical Significance
The GPSM3 gene is implicated in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Genome-wide association studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the GPSM3 gene locus, such as rs204989 and rs204991, which are associated with a decreased incidence of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (Gall2024From). These SNPs are less prevalent in individuals with these conditions, suggesting a protective effect. The protective alleles are linked to decreased GPSM3 transcript levels, which may reduce leukocyte migration and inflammation, contributing to the protective phenotype observed in Gpsm3-deficient mouse models of inflammatory arthritis (Gall2024From).

Conversely, GPSM3 SNPs are associated with an increased risk of type I diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease (Gall2024From). In the context of cancer, GPSM3 expression is elevated in low-grade gliomas (LGG), where it correlates with poorer prognosis and immune-related processes in the tumor microenvironment (Wang2021Molecular). These findings suggest that GPSM3 plays a complex role in disease pathogenesis, influencing both protective and risk factors depending on the condition.

## Interactions
GPSM3, or G protein signaling modulator 3, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate G-protein signaling dynamics. It interacts with Gα subunits of the Gi/o family, acting as a GDP dissociation inhibitor, which prevents the association of Gβγ subunits (Giguère2012Gprotein). GPSM3 also interacts with Gβ subunits (Gβ1 to Gβ4) independently of Gγ or Gαi·GDP subunit interactions, stabilizing Gβ until the formation of the Gβγ dimer (Giguère2012Gprotein). This interaction is significant as it adds complexity to GPSM3's role in G-protein regulation, with the Gβ-GPSM3 complex forming at the Golgi apparatus and existing as a soluble complex in the cytoplasm (Giguère2012Gprotein).

In addition to its role in G-protein signaling, GPSM3 interacts with the NLRP3 protein, a component of the inflammasome complex involved in immune responses. This interaction inhibits NLRP3-dependent IL-1β secretion, suggesting a role in modulating inflammasome activity (Giguère2014G). GPSM3 also associates with heat shock protein HSPA8 and scaffolding protein RACK1, indicating its involvement in chaperonin-mediated regulation of NLRP3 function (Giguère2014G). These interactions highlight GPSM3's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and immune regulation.
