# HHATL

## Overview
HHATL (hedgehog acyltransferase like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the post-translational modification of hedgehog proteins, which are critical components of various cell signaling pathways. The protein encoded by HHATL is categorized as an acyltransferase, specifically facilitating the palmitoylation of hedgehog proteins, a modification that enhances their signaling efficacy by increasing hydrophobicity and promoting membrane association (Buglino2012Palmitoylation). This process is essential for the proper functioning of hedgehog proteins, such as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), within the endoplasmic reticulum (Buglino2012Palmitoylation). HHATL has been implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including its decreased expression in pancreatic islets in type 2 diabetes, suggesting a role in glucose homeostasis and insulin regulation (Asplund2022Islet; Bacos2023Type). Additionally, HHATL interacts with other proteins in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, potentially acting as a negative regulator of N-palmitoylation, thereby modulating signal transduction (Lucas2016Yeast).

## Function
HHATL (hedgehog acyltransferase like) is involved in the post-translational modification of hedgehog proteins, which are essential for various cell signaling pathways. This protein facilitates the palmitoylation of hedgehog proteins, a process that enhances their signaling activity by increasing their hydrophobicity and promoting membrane binding, which is crucial for effective signal transduction (Buglino2012Palmitoylation). Palmitoylation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, where HHATL is active, and is vital for the proper functioning and signaling of hedgehog proteins, such as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) (Buglino2012Palmitoylation).

In the context of type 2 diabetes, HHATL expression is significantly decreased in pancreatic islets, suggesting its role in glucose homeostasis and body composition (Bacos2023Type). Although its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, HHATL is implicated in the regulation of insulin secretion and islet hormone expression, with higher expression observed in β-cells, which are crucial for insulin production (Asplund2022Islet). The downregulation of HHATL is associated with the de-differentiation of human islets, indicating its potential role in maintaining islet cell function (Solimena2017Systems).

## Clinical Significance
The HHATL gene has been studied in the context of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), where its expression is significantly decreased in pancreatic islets from individuals with the condition. This reduction in expression aligns with findings from Hhatl-KO mice, which exhibit impaired glucose tolerance and altered body composition. However, silencing HHATL in human islets from non-diabetic individuals did not significantly affect insulin secretion at stimulatory glucose levels, suggesting that while HHATL expression is altered in T2D, its direct impact on insulin secretion may be limited (Bacos2023Type).

In Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHDS)-derived renal tumors, HHATL is more highly expressed compared to other renal cell carcinoma subtypes, indicating a distinct gene expression pattern. However, the clinical significance of HHATL mutations in these tumors or their association with diseases beyond T2D is not detailed (Klomp2010BirtHoggDubé).

In studies related to cardiac conditions, HHATL was initially considered a candidate gene due to its role in inhibiting the N-palmitoylation of sonic hedgehog (SHH). However, functional analysis showed no significant impact of HHATL variants on the conditions studied, such as atrial fibrillation, suggesting it is not the causative variant in these cases (Tucker2017Gainoffunction).

## Interactions
HHATL (hedgehog acyltransferase like) is known to interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. It co-localizes with Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT) and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it directly interacts with Shh. This interaction reduces the efficiency of Shh palmitoylation, suggesting that HHATL may act as a negative regulator of HHAT-driven N-palmitoylation of Shh, thereby modulating the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Lucas2016Yeast).

In yeast, the homologous protein Gup1, which shares functional similarities with HHATL, has been shown to physically interact with the mitochondrial porin Por1 (also known as VDAC1). This interaction is significant for maintaining cell wall integrity and regulating programmed cell death in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The interaction between Gup1 and Por1 is hypothesized to occur at the ER-mitochondria junction region known as ERMES, which is involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and apoptosis (Tulha2018Saccharomyces). These interactions highlight the potential regulatory roles of HHATL and its homologs in cellular processes and signaling pathways.
