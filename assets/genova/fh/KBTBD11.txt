# KBTBD11

## Overview
KBTBD11 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch repeat and BTB domain containing 11, which is a member of the BTB-Kelch protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and a C-terminal Kelch-repeat domain, both of which are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions. The BTB domain serves as an adaptor for Cullin3, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, thereby implicating KBTBD11 in ubiquitin-dependent proteasome-mediated degradation pathways (Watanabe2022KBTBD11; Narahara2019KBTBD11). Functionally, KBTBD11 is involved in the regulation of NFATc1 protein ubiquitination, which is significant for osteoclastogenesis and adipocyte differentiation (Watanabe2022KBTBD11; Narahara2019KBTBD11). The gene is also expressed in brain tissues, suggesting a potential role in neural functions (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). Clinically, KBTBD11 has been associated with various cancers, including colorectal cancer and gastric adenocarcinoma, where it may function as a tumor suppressor (Gong2018A; Zhao2019Analysis).

## Structure
The KBTBD11 protein is a member of the BTB-Kelch protein family, characterized by the presence of an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and a C-terminal Kelch-repeat domain. The BTB domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, including dimer formation and self-association, and serves as a specific adapter for Cullin3, a RING-finger type E3 ubiquitin ligase (Watanabe2022KBTBD11; Narahara2019KBTBD11). The Kelch-repeat domain forms a β-propeller structure, which is also involved in protein-protein interactions (Watanabe2022KBTBD11; Narahara2019KBTBD11). 

KBTBD11 is implicated in E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated events, particularly in the regulation of NFATc1 protein ubiquitination, which is crucial for processes like osteoclastogenesis and adipocyte differentiation (Watanabe2022KBTBD11; Narahara2019KBTBD11). The protein interacts with heat shock proteins HSC70 and HSP60, which are involved in its stabilization and regulation (Watanabe2022KBTBD11). Despite these functional insights, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of KBTBD11 are not provided in the available literature (Watanabe2022KBTBD11; Narahara2019KBTBD11).

## Function
The KBTBD11 gene encodes a protein that is involved in several molecular processes, primarily through its interactions with other proteins. It is part of the BTB protein superfamily, which is known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and participating in ubiquitin-dependent proteasome-mediated degradation (Watanabe2022KBTBD11). KBTBD11 interacts with heat shock proteins HSC70 and HSP60, which are involved in protein folding and stability, suggesting a role in maintaining protein homeostasis (Watanabe2022KBTBD11). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of NFATc1 ubiquitination, which affects Cyclin D1 protein levels, a key factor in cell proliferation (Watanabe2022KBTBD11).

KBTBD11 is also implicated in adipocyte differentiation, where it is regulated by the transcription factor PPARγ. Its expression is upregulated during adipocyte differentiation, indicating a role in cell differentiation processes (Watanabe2022KBTBD11). In the brain, KBTBD11 is primarily expressed in brain tissues and is associated with brain-specific enhancer chromatin, suggesting a potential role in neural function (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). The gene's expression and function in healthy human cells may involve these molecular activities, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
KBTBD11 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). A polymorphism in the KBTBD11 gene, specifically the SNP rs11777210, is associated with increased CRC risk. This SNP affects the binding affinity of the MYC oncogene, with the C allele showing stronger binding, leading to decreased expression of KBTBD11, which functions as a tumor suppressor. The interaction between MYC and KBTBD11, mediated by this SNP, contributes to CRC susceptibility (Gong2018A; Abd2018Single).

In gastric adenocarcinoma, KBTBD11 is targeted by specific miRNAs, and its knockdown has been linked to enhanced cell proliferation, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor in this context as well (Zhao2019Analysis). In lung squamous cell carcinoma, KBTBD11 is mentioned as having oncogenic relations, indicating its complex role in cancer development (Zengin2021Comprehensive).

Epigenetic changes in KBTBD11, such as hypomethylation, have been observed in leukemia, correlating with increased expression and suggesting a potential link to leukemia prognosis (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). These findings highlight the significance of KBTBD11 in cancer pathogenesis and its potential as a biomarker for cancer risk and prognosis.

## Interactions
The KBTBD11 protein is involved in several significant protein-protein interactions. It interacts with heat shock proteins HSC70 and HSP60, which are involved in protein folding and degradation. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of NFATc1 proteolysis, as inhibition of HSC70 and HSP60 leads to increased KBTBD11 levels, promoting NFATc1 ubiquitination and degradation (Watanabe2022KBTBD11).

KBTBD11 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin3. This interaction facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of NFATc1, a critical factor for osteoclast differentiation. The BTB domain of KBTBD11 acts as an adaptor for Cullin3, while the Kelch-repeat domain is involved in further protein-protein interactions (Narahara2019KBTBD11). This interaction is essential for the negative regulation of osteoclastogenesis, as KBTBD11 knockdown enhances osteoclast differentiation, while overexpression inhibits it (Narahara2019KBTBD11).

These interactions highlight KBTBD11's role in cellular processes such as protein stability, degradation, and cell differentiation, particularly in the context of osteoclastogenesis and potentially other cell types (Watanabe2022KBTBD11; Narahara2019KBTBD11).
