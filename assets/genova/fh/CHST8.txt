# CHST8

## Overview
The CHST8 gene encodes the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfotransferase 1 (GalNAc4-ST1), a type II transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the sulfation of carbohydrates. This enzyme is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the transfer of sulfate groups to specific oligosaccharides on glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), particularly those with terminal β-1,4-linked N-acetylgalactosamine (Cabral2012Wholeexome). The sulfation process is essential for the biosynthesis of glycoprotein hormones such as lutropin and thyrotropin, which are vital for various physiological functions (Cabral2012Wholeexome). GalNAc4-ST1 is expressed throughout the epidermis, especially in the granular and cornified layers, indicating its importance in epidermal differentiation and homeostasis (Cabral2012Wholeexome). Mutations in CHST8, such as the R77W missense mutation, have been linked to type A non-inflammatory Peeling Skin Syndrome, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in maintaining skin integrity (Cabral2012Wholeexome).

## Structure
The CHST8 gene encodes the GalNAc4-ST1 protein, a type II transmembrane protein consisting of 424 amino acids (Cabral2012Wholeexome). This protein is involved in the sulfation of carbohydrates, specifically transferring sulfate groups to oligosaccharides on glycoproteins with terminal β-1,4-linked GalNAc (Cabral2012Wholeexome). The protein contains four potential N-glycosylation sites and two putative 3′-phosphoadenosine, 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) binding domains, which are characteristic of its function as a sulfotransferase (Cabral2012Wholeexome). 

The GalNAc4-ST1 protein is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in the biosynthesis of glycoprotein hormones such as lutropin and thyrotropin (Cabral2012Wholeexome). The protein's structure includes a Golgi luminal domain, which is affected by the R77W mutation, leading to changes in hydrophilicity and stability (Cabral2012Wholeexome). This mutation results in impaired glycosylation and increased degradation of the protein, indicating its importance in maintaining protein stability and function (Cabral2012Wholeexome). 

The CHST8 protein's activity is crucial for normal epidermal homeostasis, as it is expressed throughout the epidermis, particularly in the granular and cornified layers (Cabral2012Wholeexome). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as prominent folds or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CHST8 gene encodes the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfotransferase 1 (GalNAc4-ST1), a type II transmembrane protein primarily active in the Golgi apparatus. This enzyme is responsible for transferring sulfate groups to the C4 hydroxyl group of terminal β1,4-linked N-acetylgalactosamine moieties on glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (Cabral2012Wholeexome). The sulfation process mediated by GalNAc4-ST1 is crucial for the biosynthesis of glycoprotein hormones such as lutropin and thyrotropin, which are essential for various physiological functions (Cabral2012Wholeexome).

GalNAc4-ST1 is expressed throughout the epidermis, particularly in the granular and cornified layers, indicating its role in epidermal differentiation and homeostasis (Cabral2012Wholeexome). The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the skin by ensuring proper sulfation of GAGs, which are important for cell-cell interactions, signal transduction, and embryonic development (Cabral2012Wholeexome). In healthy cells, the sulfation of GAGs by CHST8 contributes to epidermal homeostasis and prevents excessive desquamation of the stratum corneum (Cabral2012Wholeexome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHST8 gene, which encodes the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfotransferase 1 (GalNAc4-ST1), have been linked to type A non-inflammatory Peeling Skin Syndrome (PSS). This condition is characterized by lifelong, continuous shedding of the upper epidermis. A specific homozygous missense mutation (c.229C>T; R77W) in CHST8 has been identified as the underlying cause of this syndrome. The mutation leads to reduced expression and altered glycosylation of GalNAc4-ST1, which may increase its degradation and affect the protein's conformation and stability. This results in increased desquamation of the stratum corneum, contributing to the symptoms of type A PSS, such as asymptomatic skin peeling with occasional pruritus (Cabral2012Wholeexome).

The mutation in CHST8 is associated with a loss of function of the GalNAc4-ST1 enzyme, which is crucial for normal skin function. Functional studies have shown that the mutant protein is less stable, not glycosylated, and has reduced function, as evidenced by decreased levels of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in cells expressing the mutant protein (Cabral2012Wholeexome). This highlights the importance of sulfation in maintaining normal epidermal homeostasis and suggests that alterations in CHST8 can lead to significant dermatological conditions (Cabral2012Wholeexome).
