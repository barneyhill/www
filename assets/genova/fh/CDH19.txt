# CDH19

## Overview
CDH19 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 19, a type II classical cadherin involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion. Cadherin 19 is characterized by its role in mediating homodimeric adhesion through its extracellular cadherin domains, which are crucial for maintaining cell-cell contacts and tissue integrity, particularly in the nervous system (Zorniak2015Myelinforming; Lin2010Cadherin19). The protein is predominantly expressed in myelin-forming cells such as Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, where it contributes to the process of myelination during development (Lin2010Cadherin19). While CDH19 is expressed at lower levels in adult tissues, its expression is notably higher in certain cancerous tissues, suggesting a complex role in both developmental processes and disease states (Zorniak2015Myelinforming; Yu2023The).

## Structure
The CDH19 protein, a type II classical cadherin, is involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion. It is composed of 776 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 87.14 kDa with an isoelectric point of 4.72 (Lin2010Cadherin19). The primary structure of CDH19 includes a signal peptide of 19 amino acids at the N terminus, which is crucial for directing the protein to its proper cellular location (Lin2010Cadherin19).

Structurally, CDH19 contains five extracellular cadherin domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Lin2010Cadherin19). These extracellular domains are responsible for mediating homodimeric adhesion, a characteristic feature of type II cadherins, through the EC1 domain (Zorniak2015Myelinforming). Unlike type I cadherins, type II cadherins like CDH19 do not possess the conserved HAV sequence in the first extracellular cadherin repeat (Lin2010Cadherin19).

The quaternary structure of CDH19 involves the formation of homodimers, which are essential for its function in cell adhesion (Zorniak2015Myelinforming). While specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided, such modifications are common in cadherins and may include glycosylation and phosphorylation.

## Function
CDH19, or cadherin 19, is a type II classical cadherin involved in cell adhesion, playing a crucial role in maintaining cell-cell contacts and tissue integrity. It is primarily expressed in the nervous system, particularly in myelin-forming cells such as Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, where it contributes to myelination during development (Lin2010Cadherin19). In humans, CDH19 is expressed in specific tissues, including the olfactory bulb and dorsal root ganglion, although at lower levels compared to glioblastoma stem-like cells (Zorniak2015Myelinforming).

CDH19 mediates homodimeric adhesion through its EC1 domain, facilitating cell-cell interactions within tissues (Zorniak2015Myelinforming). It is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, particularly in the nervous system, where it plays a role in the development and maintenance of neural structures (Yu2023The). The protein is active in the plasma membrane, where it supports cellular communication and structural integrity (Lin2010Cadherin19). Despite its significant role in development, CDH19 maintains low expression in adult human tissues, suggesting a more prominent function during early developmental stages (Zorniak2015Myelinforming).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDH19 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A notable genetic variation in CDH19 is associated with a rare neurodevelopmental disorder known as CDH19-related X-linked intellectual disability syndrome. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, delayed speech and language development, and other neurological and developmental abnormalities (Yu2023The).

In the context of cancer, CDH19 expression levels have been implicated in the progression and prognosis of various cancers. In cervical carcinoma, CDH19 is significantly downregulated, and its overexpression has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and the activation of the AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways. This suggests a potential tumor-suppressive role for CDH19 in cervical carcinoma, where higher expression levels correlate with better overall survival rates, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Yu2023The).

In breast cancer, CDH19 expression has been associated with prognostic outcomes. Although high expressions of several CDH genes are linked to poor outcomes, CDH19 is noted to have a lower hazard ratio, indicating a better prognostic outcome in breast cancer (Ku2022Comprehensive). The relationship between CDH19 and cancer is complex and varies depending on the cancer type (Yu2023The).
