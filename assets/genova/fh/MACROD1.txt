# MACROD1

## Overview
The MACROD1 gene encodes the protein mono-ADP ribosylhydrolase 1, which is a member of the macrodomain-containing protein family. This protein functions primarily as an ADP-ribosyl hydrolase, catalyzing the removal of mono-ADP-ribose from proteins, a process known as mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation). This enzymatic activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, transcriptional regulation, and mitochondrial homeostasis (Agnew2018MacroD1; Yang2020Molecular). The protein is predominantly localized in mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function, but it also has important nuclear functions, interacting with transcription factors such as estrogen and androgen receptors (Žaja2020Comparative; Wang2024ADPribose). The MACROD1 gene and its encoded protein are implicated in several cancers, where they influence cell proliferation and survival through their interactions with hormone receptors and involvement in DNA repair pathways (Agnew2018MacroD1; Feijs2020The).

## Structure
The MACROD1 protein is characterized by a macrodomain structure, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity in hydrolyzing ADP-ribosylation. The crystal structure of human MacroD1, covering residues 91-325, reveals a three-layered α-β-α sandwich with a central six-stranded β-sheet, typical of macro domain-containing proteins (Agnew2018MacroD1; Yang2020Molecular). This structure includes a deep cleft where ADP-ribose binds, facilitating its hydrolysis (Yang2020Molecular).

Key residues such as Phe 272 play a critical role in orienting the distal ribose of ADP-ribose, essential for catalytic activity (Yang2020Molecular). The β5-α10-loop undergoes significant conformational changes upon substrate binding, acting as a switch loop to sequester the substrate and provide structural flexibility (Yang2020Molecular).

The N-terminal region of MacroD1 is rich in basic residues and is necessary for its mitochondrial localization, suggesting the presence of a mitochondrial targeting sequence (Agnew2018MacroD1; Žaja2020Comparative). This region is cleaved upon mitochondrial import, indicating post-translational modification (Agnew2018MacroD1). The protein's localization and function are influenced by its structural domains, which are conserved across species, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Yang2020Molecular).

## Function
The MACROD1 gene encodes the MacroD1 protein, which functions as an ADP-ribosyl hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) from proteins. This enzymatic activity is crucial for DNA damage repair, as MacroD1 is recruited to DNA lesions where it facilitates the removal of ADP-ribose units, thereby aiding in the recycling of DNA repair factors and maintaining genomic stability (Yang2020Molecular). MacroD1 is primarily localized in mitochondria but also has nuclear functions, where it is involved in the regulation of transcriptional activities by interacting with estrogen and androgen receptors (Agnew2018MacroD1; Wang2024ADPribose).

In healthy human cells, MacroD1 plays a role in mitochondrial homeostasis and RNA metabolism, with its expression being particularly high in tissues with high energy demands, such as skeletal muscle and heart (Žaja2020Comparative). The protein's mitochondrial localization is dependent on its N-terminal region, which is cleaved upon import into mitochondria (Agnew2018MacroD1; Žaja2020Comparative). Loss of MacroD1 leads to mitochondrial fragmentation, indicating its importance in maintaining mitochondrial structure (Žaja2020Comparative).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the MACROD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast, prostate, gastric, liver, lung, and colorectal cancers. In breast cancer, MACROD1 expression is increased by estrogen treatment, promoting cell proliferation through estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activation (Agnew2018MacroD1). The gene also acts as a co-activator of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells, enhancing transcriptional activity upon androgen treatment (Agnew2018MacroD1). A RUNX-MACROD1 fusion has been identified in leukemia, suggesting a role in hematological malignancies (Feijs2020The).

MACROD1's involvement in cancer is further supported by its role in nuclear functions, such as activating NF-κB signaling and counteracting PARP7-mediated MARylation, which are processes linked to tumorigenesis (Wang2024ADPribose). Despite its mitochondrial localization, MACROD1's nuclear activities are often highlighted in cancer studies (Feijs2020The). The gene's expression levels have been correlated with clinical outcomes, although the mutation rate in cancer patient samples is relatively low, at 0.9% (Feijs2020The). The potential for drug development targeting MARylation processes involving MACROD1 is noted, although the role of mono(ADP-ribosyl)hydrolases in cancer remains underexplored (Feijs2020The).

## Interactions
MACROD1 is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in several cellular processes. It physically interacts with transcription factors such as estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), androgen receptor (AR), and NF-κB, acting as a co-activator in transcriptional regulation. These interactions are significant in the context of hormone-responsive cancers, where MACROD1 is required for estrogen-responsive proliferation in breast cancer cells and acts as a co-activator of AR in prostate cancer cells (Agnew2018MacroD1).

In mitochondria, MACROD1 is involved in RNA metabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis. It interacts with mitochondrial DNA-directed RNA polymerase POLRMT, suggesting a role in mitochondrial RNA metabolic pathways (Žaja2020Comparative). The protein is also implicated in DNA damage repair, where it is recruited to DNA lesions through ADP-ribosylation recognition. This recruitment is crucial for the repair process, as MACROD1 helps remove ADP-ribose from DNA, facilitating proper repair (Yang2020Molecular).

MACROD1's enzymatic activity includes the removal of mono-ADP-ribose from phosphorylated double-stranded DNA, indicating its role in DNA damage repair and interaction with nucleic acids (Agnew2018MacroD1). These interactions highlight MACROD1's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and stress responses.
