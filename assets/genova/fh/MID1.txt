# MID1

## Overview
The MID1 gene encodes the midline 1 protein, a member of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family, specifically classified as TRIM18. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) levels, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper microtubule dynamics. The MID1 protein is characterized by several distinct domains, including a RING finger domain, B-box zinc finger domains, and a PRY-SPRY domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its ubiquitin ligase activity. MID1 is involved in various cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, and is associated with microtubules throughout the cell cycle. Mutations in the MID1 gene are linked to X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome, a disorder marked by midline developmental defects, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Trockenbacher2001MID1; Baldini2020The; De2003X‐linked).

## Structure
The MID1 protein is a member of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family, specifically known as TRIM18, and is characterized by several distinct domains. The primary structure of MID1 includes a RING finger domain, two B-box zinc finger domains, a coiled-coil region, a COS domain, a Fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain, and a PRY-SPRY domain (Mnayer2006A; Baldini2020The). The RING domain is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins (Baldini2020The). The B-box domains, particularly B-box 1, share structural similarities with RING domains and coordinate zinc atoms (Baldini2020The).

The COS domain, a 60-amino acid region, is essential for microtubule localization and forms a helix-loop-helix structure with a central hydrophobic core (Wright2016Solution). This domain interacts with the adjacent coiled-coil domain to form a spectrin-like fold necessary for microtubule binding (Wright2016Solution). The PRY-SPRY domain has a compact, globular structure with antiparallel beta-sheets forming a jellyroll beta-sandwich fold (Hu2012A).

MID1 can form homo- and hetero-dimers, a common feature among TRIM family members, and is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity (Baldini2020The). The gene also produces various transcript isoforms due to alternative splicing (Baldini2020The).

## Function
The MID1 gene encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the regulation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) levels in human cells. MID1 targets the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, which is essential for maintaining proper phosphorylation levels of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and ensuring normal cellular functions such as signal transduction and cell cycle regulation (Trockenbacher2001MID1). 

MID1 is associated with microtubules throughout the cell cycle, where it forms complexes with other proteins, including the α4 regulatory subunit of PP2A. This interaction facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of PP2Ac, preventing its accumulation and maintaining microtubule dynamics (Trockenbacher2001MID1; Baldini2020The). The protein's RING finger domain is involved in binding ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which is critical for its function as an E3 ligase (Baldini2020The).

In healthy cells, MID1's activity is vital for cellular homeostasis, influencing processes like apoptosis, cell migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, particularly during development (Cainarca1999Functional). Its role in regulating PP2A and microtubule dynamics is crucial for proper cell division and cytoskeletal organization (Trockenbacher2001MID1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MID1 gene are associated with X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome (OS), a disorder characterized by midline defects such as hypertelorism, cleft lip/palate, hypospadias, and laryngo-tracheo-esophageal abnormalities (De2003X‐linked; Hu2012A). These mutations include missense, nonsense, splice site mutations, and indels, which are distributed along the entire length of the gene, suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism (Baldini2020The). The clinical manifestations of MID1 mutations are highly variable, with symptoms ranging from facial dysmorphisms to neurological issues like cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (De2003X‐linked; Baldini2020The).

The severity of the phenotype can vary depending on the specific mutation and its location within the MID1 protein. For instance, mutations in the FNIII domain are generally associated with milder OS presentations, while mutations causing premature termination codons are linked to more severe phenotypes, including cleft lip/palate and cardiac anomalies (Mnayer2006A). The MID1 gene product's role in regulating protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and its involvement in microtubule dynamics are crucial for normal development, and disruptions in these processes due to MID1 mutations can lead to the diverse clinical features observed in OS (Baldini2020The).

## Interactions
The MID1 protein is involved in several key interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, forming a complex network that influences cellular processes. MID1 is part of a microtubule-associated ribonucleoprotein complex known as the MID1/4 complex, which includes elongation factor 1 (EF-1) and 40S ribosomal proteins S3 and S8. This complex is associated with translation regulation and interacts with proteins such as Nucleophosmin (NPM), RACK1, and Annexin A2 (ANXA2), which are linked to the 40S ribosomal subunit and play roles in translational control (ArandaOrgillés2008The).

The interaction between MID1 and EF-1 is specific and biologically relevant, occurring at the microtubules and involving the SRPY/PRY domain in the C-terminus of MID1 (ArandaOrgillés2008The). MID1 also interacts with the Alpha 4 regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a connection mediated by the B-box domains of MID1. This interaction is crucial for tethering Alpha 4 to microtubules, which is significant for understanding the clinical variability of X-linked Opitz GBBB syndrome (Trockenbacher2001MID1; Short2002MID1).

MID1's role extends to RNA interactions, as it associates with specific RNA sequences, particularly poly-rG and poly-rU sequences, suggesting a role in mRNA localization and translation regulation (ArandaOrgillés2008The).
