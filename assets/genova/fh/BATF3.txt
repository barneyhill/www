# BATF3

## Overview
BATF3, or basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors. The BATF3 protein is characterized by its bZIP domain, which facilitates the formation of heterodimers with JUN family proteins, allowing it to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression (Chang2018Quantitative). Unlike many transcription factors, BATF3 lacks a transcriptional activation domain and functions primarily as an inhibitor of AP-1 activity (Chang2018Quantitative). It plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the development and function of CD8α+ conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which are essential for antigen cross-presentation and the activation of CD8+ T cells (Murphy2013Specificity; Hildner2008Batf3). BATF3's involvement in immune responses and its dysregulation in various cancers underscore its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Lollies2017An; Cao2018MiR760).

## Structure
The BATF3 protein is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, characterized by an alpha-helical bZIP domain that includes a DNA binding region and a leucine zipper motif. This domain allows BATF3 to form heterodimers with JUN family proteins, recognizing specific DNA elements such as the TPA response elements (TRE) and the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) (Chang2018Quantitative). The bZIP domain is highly conserved among BATF family members, which include BATF and BATF2, in addition to BATF3 (Chang2018Quantitative).

BATF3 lacks a transcriptional activation domain and acts as an inhibitor of AP-1 activity. It is relatively small, consisting of 118 amino acids, and does not contain additional domains beyond the bZIP (Chang2018Quantitative). The protein does not have a signal peptide, indicating it is not secreted (Zhu2019Investigating).

BATF3 is involved in forming heterodimers and heterotrimers with other proteins, such as JUNB and IRF4/IRF8, which influence its quaternary structure and DNA binding specificity (Chang2018Quantitative). The protein's activity can be regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
BATF3 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and function of CD8α+ conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which are essential for effective immune responses. It is involved in the maturation of CD24+ cells into functionally competent CD8α+ cDCs, a process that also requires the transcription factor IRF8 (Murphy2013Specificity). BATF3 is crucial for the cross-presentation of antigens, a key function of CD8α+ cDCs, which leads to the activation of CD8+ T cells and is vital for initiating immune responses against viruses and tumors (Murphy2013Specificity; Hildner2008Batf3).

In the absence of BATF3, there is a significant reduction in CD8α+ cDCs, resulting in impaired antigen cross-presentation and reduced CD8+ T cell responses (Hildner2008Batf3). BATF3 also interacts with other BATF family members, such as BATF and BATF2, to regulate the expression of T helper 2 (TH2) cell-associated genes and can compensate for BATF in certain immune functions (Murphy2013Specificity). This transcription factor is active in the nucleus, where it forms heterodimers with JUN proteins, influencing gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences (Murphy2013Specificity).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BATF3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), BATF3 is associated with poor prognosis. The microRNA miR-760, which is downregulated in CRC, targets BATF3, leading to the suppression of CRC cell proliferation. This interaction suggests that BATF3 has oncogenic potential in CRC, and miR-760 could serve as a therapeutic target (Cao2018MiR760).

In classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), BATF3 is overexpressed and plays a role in promoting cell proliferation and survival. Its expression is regulated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which influences MYC expression, a critical factor for lymphoma cell survival. Knockdown of BATF3 in these lymphomas leads to reduced MYC levels and impaired cell proliferation, highlighting its role in oncogenic processes (Lollies2017An).

BATF3 is also crucial for the development of conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), which are important for tumor rejection. In Batf3-deficient mice, the absence of cDC1s impairs tumor rejection, indicating BATF3's role in antitumor immunity (Theisen2019Batf3Dependent).

## Interactions
BATF3 is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It forms heterodimers with JUN proteins, such as JUNB, and these complexes can bind to DNA at specific sites, including TPA response elements (TREs) and cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) (Murphy2013Specificity). BATF3 also interacts with interferon-regulatory factors IRF4 and IRF8, forming heterotrimeric complexes that bind to AP-1-IRF composite elements (AICEs) in DNA. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of immune responses and the development of CD8α+ classical dendritic cells (Murphy2013Specificity; Chang2018Quantitative).

The interaction between BATF3 and IRF4 is particularly important for the suppression of FOXP3 expression, as BATF3 requires IRF4 to effectively inhibit FOXP3. Mutations in BATF3 that reduce its interaction with IRF4 also diminish its ability to suppress FOXP3 expression (Arnold2022Suppression). BATF3's interaction with IRF4 and IRF8 enhances the DNA binding affinity of these complexes, particularly at sites with no spacer between the IRF and BATF binding sites, indicating cooperative binding through protein-protein interactions (Chang2018Quantitative). These interactions highlight BATF3's role in transcriptional regulation and immune cell development.
