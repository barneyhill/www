# CD53

## Overview
CD53 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tetraspanin family, which is characterized by four transmembrane domains. The CD53 protein plays a crucial role in the immune system by organizing membrane microdomains known as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. It is predominantly expressed in immune cells such as B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, where it functions as a co-stimulatory molecule and stabilizes key signaling proteins. The protein's structure includes conserved cysteine residues and potential N-glycosylation sites, which are important for its stability and interactions with other proteins. CD53 is involved in forming multicomponent complexes with other tetraspanins and proteins, influencing immune cell activation and response. Mutations in the CD53 gene have been linked to immune deficiencies and increased susceptibility to infections, underscoring its significance in immune regulation (Yeung2020Leukocyte; Angelisová1990The; Dunlock2020Tetraspanin).

## Structure
The CD53 protein is a member of the tetraspanin family, characterized by four transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop. The primary structure of CD53 consists of 219 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 28,456.6 Da (Angelisová1990The). The protein lacks a conventional leader sequence and features two potential N-glycosylation sites within its extracellular loop (Angelisová1990The). 

The secondary structure includes conserved cysteine residues within the second extracellular loop, which may form cystine bridges to stabilize the protein's structure (Hořejši1991Novel). The tertiary structure is not detailed, but the protein's configuration suggests it could resemble ion channels or transport molecules (Hořejši1991Novel). 

CD53 forms part of multicomponent complexes in the membrane, interacting with other tetraspanins like CD37, CD81, and CD82, as well as proteins such as CD19 and CD21, indicating a role in quaternary structure organization (Rasmussen1994Crosslinking). Glycosylation of CD53, occurring on two conserved asparagine residues, accounts for about half of its molecular weight and influences its interactions with partner proteins (van2023Glycosylation).

## Function
CD53 is a tetraspanin protein that plays a significant role in the immune system by organizing membrane microdomains, known as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), which are crucial for various cellular processes. It is primarily active in the plasma membrane of immune cells, including B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (Dunlock2020Tetraspanin).

In T cells, CD53 acts as a co-stimulatory molecule, enhancing T cell proliferation when combined with CD3 stimulation. This process involves a switch from a naïve to an effector T cell phenotype, although it does not increase IL-2 production, indicating a distinct pathway from other co-stimulatory molecules like CD28 (Dunlock2019Dynamic). CD53 also stabilizes the CD45RO isoform on T cells, which is essential for proper T cell activation and signaling (Dunlock2019Dynamic).

In B cells, CD53 is involved in activation and differentiation. Cross-linking of CD53 promotes B cell activation, leading to increased expression of activation markers and enhanced DNA synthesis in the presence of cytokines (Rasmussen1994Crosslinking). CD53 also interacts with integrins, influencing cell adhesion and migration, which are vital for immune cell function and response (Dunlock2020Tetraspanin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD53 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions, particularly those involving the immune system. Genetic polymorphisms in CD53 have been linked to an increased risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). Studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD53 gene that are significantly associated with TB susceptibility, suggesting that these genetic variations may influence cytokine regulation and immune responses, thereby affecting TB pathogenesis (Jin2018Association; Omae2017Pathogen).

CD53 also plays a critical role in leukocyte function, and its deficiency can lead to immune deficiencies similar to leukocyte adhesion deficiency. CD53-deficient neutrophils exhibit impaired recruitment to inflamed areas and defects in transmigration, which are crucial for effective immune responses. This deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, highlighting the importance of CD53 in immune cell adhesion and trafficking (Yeung2020Leukocyte).

Additionally, CD53 has been implicated in the regulation of innate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha levels. A specific SNP in CD53, rs6679497, has been associated with lower TNF-α levels, although no direct link to osteoarthritis was found, indicating a potential role in inflammatory diseases (Bos2010A).

## Interactions
CD53, a tetraspanin protein, is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of immune cell signaling. It interacts with membrane proteins such as CD2, which is expressed on NK and T cells and plays a role in cell adhesion and co-stimulation (Dunlock2020Tetraspanin). CD53 also interacts with the interleukin 7 receptor (IL-7R), affecting B cell development by modulating IL-7R surface expression and associated signaling pathways like PI3K and JAK/STAT (Dunlock2020Tetraspanin). 

CD53 forms complexes with protein kinase C (PKC), facilitating PKC-dependent phosphorylation of integrins, and interacts directly with PKCβ in B cells, which is crucial for PKC recruitment to the plasma membrane upon B cell receptor stimulation (Dunlock2020Tetraspanin). It is linked to the Akt pathway, where its ligation results in increased Akt phosphorylation, potentially serving as a survival mechanism in tumor cells (Dunlock2020Tetraspanin). 

Glycosylation of CD53 influences its interactions, inhibiting its binding with partner proteins CD45 and CD20 (van2023Glycosylation). CD53 also interacts with integrins, such as LFA-1, enhancing NK cell adhesion and modulating NK cell responses (TodrosDawda2014The). These interactions highlight CD53's role in regulating immune cell adhesion, signaling, and migration.
