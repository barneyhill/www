# ABHD14A

## Overview
ABHD14A is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 14A, which is a member of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family. This protein is characterized by its unique ABHD-fold and a catalytic triad composed of serine, aspartic acid, and histidine, indicative of its role as a serine hydrolase (Bononi2021α/β-Hydrolase; Vaidya2023Identification). Unlike its paralog ABHD14B, ABHD14A lacks the acyltransferase motif, suggesting distinct functional roles (Vaidya2023Identification). The protein is predicted to be a single-pass type II membrane protein, potentially localizing to cellular membranes, which may influence its involvement in cellular signaling or metabolism (Lord2013Mammalian). ABHD14A has been implicated in various biological processes, including embryonic cerebellar development, and is associated with several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Vaidya2023Identification; Staege2010Lipases; Cukier2014Exome).

## Structure
ABHD14A is a protein that belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family, characterized by a core structure consisting of an eight-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices (Bononi2021α/β-Hydrolase). The protein contains a catalytic triad composed of serine, aspartic acid, and histidine, which is typical of hydrolases and suggests esterase activity (Lord2013Mammalian; Vaidya2023Identification). ABHD14A features a non-canonical SxSxS motif within its ABHD-fold, differing from the canonical GxSxG motif found in other members of the family (Vaidya2023Identification).

The N-terminal region of ABHD14A includes an extended disordered stretch and an alpha-helical region, which is likely responsible for membrane anchoring. This region is highly conserved and consists of approximately 30-40 amino acids forming an anchoring alpha-helical sequence (Vaidya2023Identification). Unlike its paralog ABHD14B, ABHD14A lacks the acyltransferase motif (HxxxxD), indicating a distinct function (Vaidya2023Identification).

ABHD14A is predicted to be a single-pass type II membrane protein, although this has not been experimentally verified (Lord2013Mammalian). The protein's structure and function may be influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and splice variant isoforms may exist, affecting its function and localization.

## Function
ABHD14A, also known as Dorz1, is a protein that belongs to the metabolic serine hydrolases subgroup within the serine hydrolase enzyme superfamily. It is characterized by an ABHD-fold and a conserved catalytic triad (Ser-His-Asp), although it lacks the acyltransferase motif found in its close relative, ABHD14B, suggesting a distinct function (Vaidya2023Identification). The protein is predicted to have a unique N-terminal α-helical region that may anchor it to cellular membranes, indicating potential localization to the plasma membrane or microsomal components, unlike the cytosolic and nuclear localization of ABHD14B (Vaidya2023Identification).

ABHD14A has been identified as a downstream genetic interactor of the transcription factor Zic1 and is thought to play a role in the embryonic development of the cerebellum in mammals (Vaidya2023Identification). Despite its sequence similarity to ABHD14B, the specific biochemical function of ABHD14A in healthy human cells remains speculative and requires experimental validation. Its potential membrane localization suggests it might have unique functions related to cellular signaling or metabolism, but these roles are not yet fully understood (Vaidya2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ABHD14A gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities. In family studies, changes in ABHD14A have been associated with intellectual disability and bipolar disorder, highlighting its potential role in cerebellar development and its genetic overlap with various neurodevelopmental conditions (Agarwala2021Risk; Cukier2014Exome). 

ABHD14A has also been identified as a candidate gene in autism through homozygous haplotype mapping, suggesting its involvement in autism pathophysiology and its potential as a novel ASD candidate gene (Casey2011A; Agarwala2021Risk). 

In cancer research, ABHD14A expression is upregulated in certain cancers, such as bladder cancer, lung carcinoids, and acute myeloid leukemia, although its precise physiological functions remain unknown (Staege2010Lipases). Additionally, alternative splicing events in ABHD14A have been linked to adverse prognostic outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma, indicating its potential impact on cancer progression and patient survival (Chang2020GenomeWide). 

ABHD14A is also proposed as a novel prognostic biomarker for basal breast cancer, suggesting its role in the heterogeneity of breast cancer subtypes (Cava2022Identification).
