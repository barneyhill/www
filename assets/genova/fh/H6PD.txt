# H6PD

## Overview
The H6PD gene encodes the enzyme hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a crucial component of the pentose phosphate pathway located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This enzyme is distinct from its cytosolic counterpart, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and is involved in the generation of NADPH, which is essential for various cellular processes, including antioxidant defense and biosynthetic pathways (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate; Lavery2008Deletion). Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase plays a significant role in the prereceptorial activation of glucocorticoids by interacting with 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), facilitating the conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate; Bánhegyi2008Hexose6phosphate). This interaction is vital for maintaining glucocorticoid sensitivity and regulating glucose metabolism. The enzyme's activity is also implicated in metabolic conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, through its influence on intra-abdominal cortisol levels and interaction with genetic polymorphisms (Chedid2019Interaction).

## Structure
The human H6PD protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 1p36 and spans 37 kb, consisting of five exons and four introns (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate; Mason1999Human). The protein is composed of 763 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 89 kDa (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate). It is glycosylated at Asn-138 and Asn-263, which is consistent with its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate).

The N-terminal region of H6PD shows high homology to the cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), particularly in the coenzyme and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) binding sites (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate). The C-terminal 250 amino acids show homology to bacterial devB proteins and other related proteins (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate). The protein has binding sites for NADP and G6P, deduced from sequence similarity (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate).

H6PD functions as a dimer, and electrophoretic polymorphisms have been detected in various tissues (Mason1999Human). The protein lacks a conventional ER retention signal sequence and transmembrane domains, suggesting a unique mechanism for its ER localization (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate). The enzyme is involved in supplying NADPH to 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) in the ER lumen, indicating a functional interaction that may anchor H6PD to the ER membrane (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate).

## Function
The H6PD gene encodes the enzyme hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in the pentose phosphate pathway. This enzyme is responsible for generating NADPH, a reducing equivalent necessary for various cellular processes, including antioxidant defense, detoxification, and biosynthetic pathways (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate; Lavery2008Deletion). H6PD is distinct from its cytosolic homolog, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and is involved in the first two reactions of the pentose-phosphate pathway, converting glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and NADP+ to 6-phosphogluconate and NADPH (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate).

In healthy cells, H6PD provides NADPH for luminal reductases, including 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which is involved in the conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol. This interaction is crucial for maintaining glucocorticoid sensitivity and regulating glucose output from the liver and peripheral glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate; Lavery2008Deletion). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining the redox state of the ER and supporting various metabolic functions, including lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the H6PD gene have been implicated in various metabolic conditions. The H6PD gene is crucial for the activity of the enzyme 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1), which is involved in converting inactive cortisone to active cortisol. This conversion process can influence intra-abdominal cortisol levels, contributing to obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) (Chedid2019Interaction). 

In individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), specific polymorphisms in the H6PD gene, such as rs6688832:G>A, have been studied for their potential protective effects against obesity. While this polymorphism alone was not significantly associated with MetS-related characteristics, its interaction with polymorphisms in the HSD11B1 gene showed a significant effect in reducing obesity risk among T2DM patients (Chedid2019Interaction). 

The interaction between HSD11B1 and H6PD polymorphisms may lead to decreased HSD11B1 levels, potentially reducing obesity risk in T2DM individuals. This suggests that HSD11B1 is a significant factor in obesity and related features, and its modulation affects insulin resistance (Chedid2019Interaction). These findings highlight the complexity of gene interactions and their role in metabolic conditions.

## Interactions
Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) is known to interact with 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This interaction is crucial for the prereceptorial activation of glucocorticoids, as H6PD supplies NADPH to 11β-HSD1, facilitating the conversion of inactive glucocorticoids to their active forms (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate; Bánhegyi2008Hexose6phosphate). The interaction between H6PD and 11β-HSD1 has been demonstrated through various techniques, including coimmunoprecipitation and FRET, indicating a physical association in the ER lumen (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate).

H6PD and 11β-HSD1 are colocalized in the ER, and their interaction is suggested to be weak but significant, as membrane permeabilization can lead to their dissociation (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate). The N-terminal domain of H6PD is thought to directly interact with 11β-HSD1, potentially anchoring H6PD to the ER membrane despite lacking a conventional ER retention signal (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate). This interaction is essential for maintaining the reductase activity of 11β-HSD1 in the oxidative environment of the ER (Senesi2010Hexose6phosphate).
