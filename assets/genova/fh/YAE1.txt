# YAE1

## Overview
The YAE1 gene encodes the YAE1 maturation factor of ABCE1, a protein integral to the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein assembly machinery. This protein functions as an adaptor, facilitating the maturation of the ABC protein ABCE1 by recruiting it for Fe-S cluster insertion, a critical step in ribosome biogenesis and function (Paul2015The; Prusty2021The). YAE1 forms a heterodimeric complex with ORAOV1, which is essential for its solubility and function, and this complex is involved in the insertion of Fe-S clusters into target proteins (Prusty2021The). Despite lacking a metal-binding consensus motif, YAE1 plays a pivotal role in the structural environment of the complex, which is crucial for the maturation of proteins within the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly (CIA) machinery (Prusty2021The). The function of YAE1 is conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular iron-sulfur cluster assembly and function (Paul2015The).

## Structure
The YAE1 protein, involved in the maturation of the ABC protein Rli1, is characterized by its role as an adaptor in the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein assembly machinery. YAE1 does not contain conserved cysteine residues, which suggests it does not function as a recipient Fe-S protein (Paul2015The). Instead, it features a deca-GX3 sequence motif, crucial for its interaction with Lto1 and the CIA machinery, facilitating the recruitment of Rli1 for Fe-S cluster insertion (Paul2015The).

The YAE1 protein forms a complex with ORAOV1, which is necessary for its solubility and function. This heterodimeric complex has a molecular mass of 42 kDa, with YAE1 contributing a calculated mass of 25.299 kDa (Prusty2021The). The secondary structure of the YAE1-ORAOV1 complex is predominantly α-helical, as indicated by far-UV CD spectroscopy, showing 47% α-helical content (Prusty2021The). NMR data reveal that the complex has both structured and unstructured regions, with the structural environment of ORAOV1 changing upon heterodimer formation with YAE1 (Prusty2021The). The YAE1-ORAOV1 complex can bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster, although YAE1 itself lacks a metal-binding consensus motif (Prusty2021The).

## Function
The YAE1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein assembly machinery in human cells. YAE1, in conjunction with ORAOV1, forms a complex that is involved in the insertion of Fe-S clusters into the ABC protein ABCE1, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis and function (Prusty2021The). The YAE1-ORAOV1 complex binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster, which is critical for its function in the maturation of proteins involved in the CIA machinery, a process vital for cellular iron-sulfur cluster assembly and function (Prusty2021The).

YAE1 acts as an adaptor, recruiting the ABC protein Rli1 (the yeast homolog of ABCE1) for Fe-S cluster insertion, a process crucial for protein production and ribosomal subunit export (Paul2015The). The YAE1-Lto1 complex specifically targets Rli1 for Fe-S cluster formation, which is important for ribosomal subunit export and protein translation (Paul2015The). This function is conserved across species, as human homologs can substitute their yeast counterparts, indicating a fundamental role in Fe-S protein assembly (Paul2015The).

## Interactions
The YAE1 protein, known as the YAE1 maturation factor of ABCE1, is involved in the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein assembly machinery. It forms a complex with the ORAOV1 protein, which is crucial for the maturation of Fe-S proteins, particularly the human ABC protein ABCE1. This complex is part of the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly (CIA) machinery and is responsible for the insertion of Fe-S clusters into target proteins (Prusty2021The). 

YAE1 interacts with ORAOV1 to form a heterodimeric complex that can bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster. This interaction is facilitated by sequential GX3 motifs conserved at the N-termini of both proteins (Prusty2021The). Although YAE1 lacks a metal-binding consensus motif, it plays a role in the structural environment of the complex, transitioning ORAOV1 from a homodimeric to a heterodimeric state upon complex formation (Prusty2021The). 

The YAE1-ORAOV1 complex is thought to escort the apo form of ABCE1 to the CIA targeting complex, aiding in the transfer of Fe-S clusters. However, the specific role of YAE1 in this process, whether it actively participates in Fe-S cluster binding and insertion, remains unclear (Prusty2021The).
