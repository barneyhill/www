# CFB

## Overview
Complement factor B (CFB) is a gene that encodes a serine protease, which plays a pivotal role in the alternative pathway of the complement system, a crucial component of the innate immune response. The protein product, complement factor B, is involved in the formation of the C3 convertase enzyme complex, which is essential for the activation and amplification of the complement cascade. This process facilitates the opsonization and clearance of pathogens, as well as the maintenance of immune homeostasis (Walport2001Complementa; He2021Low). The CFB gene is subject to various mutations and polymorphisms that can significantly impact its function, leading to either protective or pathogenic outcomes in diseases such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and age-related macular degeneration (de2007Gainoffunction; Francis2008Polymorphisms). Understanding the structure, function, and interactions of complement factor B is critical for elucidating its role in immune regulation and its implications in complement-mediated diseases.

## Structure
Complement factor B (CFB) is a serine protease involved in the alternative pathway of the complement system. The primary structure of CFB consists of a polypeptide chain with specific amino acid sequences, including notable variants such as the R32W mutation, which affects the protein's stability and binding affinity (Shi2022Functional). The secondary structure of CFB includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function.

The tertiary structure of CFB involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, forming domains such as the von Willebrand factor type A domain. This domain is crucial for the protein's interaction with other components of the complement system, such as C3b (Aradottir2021Factor). The quaternary structure of CFB may involve interactions with other complement components, facilitating the formation of the C3 convertase complex.

Post-translational modifications of CFB include glycosylation, which can affect its function and stability. For instance, the G252S variant creates a new glycosylation site, impacting the protein's binding to C3b and its enzymatic activity (Akhlaghpour2023Genetic). These structural features and modifications are essential for CFB's role in the immune response.

## Function
Complement factor B (CFB) is a critical component of the alternative pathway of the complement system, which is part of the innate immune response. In healthy human cells, CFB is involved in the formation of the C3 convertase enzyme complex, C3bBb. This complex is essential for the activation of the complement system, leading to the cleavage of complement component C3 into C3b, which facilitates opsonization, inflammation, and cell lysis (Walport2001Complementa; He2021Low).

CFB is cleaved by complement factor D into two fragments, Ba and Bb. The Bb fragment, in combination with C3b and properdin, forms the C3 convertase, which is crucial for the amplification of the complement response. This process is vital for the clearance of pathogens and damaged cells, thereby maintaining immune surveillance and homeostasis (Sun2012CFBC2Gene; He2021Low).

CFB is primarily active in blood plasma and on cell surfaces where complement activation occurs. Its regulation is crucial to prevent excessive complement activation, which could lead to host tissue damage (Tawadrous2010A). Dysregulation of CFB can affect immune function and has been implicated in various diseases (He2021Low).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the complement factor B (CFB) gene are associated with several diseases, primarily due to dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is one such condition, characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute renal failure. Gain-of-function mutations in CFB, such as F286L and K323E, enhance the formation of the C3 convertase or increase its resistance to inactivation, leading to excessive complement activation and contributing to the pathogenesis of aHUS (Tawadrous2010A; de2007Gainoffunction).

CFB mutations also play a role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Certain polymorphisms in the CFB gene are protective against AMD progression by reducing the activity of the complement alternative pathway (Jakobsdottir2008C2; Francis2008Polymorphisms). The interaction of CFB with other genetic factors, such as CFH and LOC387715, further influences susceptibility to AMD (Jakobsdottir2008C2).

In some cases, CFB variants can contribute to renal diseases when combined with mutations in other genes, such as COL4A5, as seen in a case report involving siblings with severe renal symptoms (Wang2021Combination). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CFB in various complement-mediated diseases.

## Interactions
Complement factor B (CFB) is a crucial component of the alternative pathway of the complement system. It interacts with complement component 3b (C3b) to form the C3bB complex, which is then cleaved by complement factor D (CFD) to generate the active C3 convertase (C3bBb) (Akhlaghpour2023Genetic). This interaction is essential for the amplification of the complement response, as the C3 convertase plays a pivotal role in the cascade.

Mutations in the CFB gene can alter its interaction with C3b. For instance, the G252S mutation in CFB results in decreased binding to C3b and impairs the cleavage of CFB into its subunits by CFD, leading to reduced activation of the alternative complement pathway (Akhlaghpour2023Genetic). This mutation also introduces a glycosylation site at position 252, potentially affecting the protein's conformation and function (Akhlaghpour2023Genetic).

In the context of diseases like atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), certain CFB mutations, such as D371G, increase the affinity for C3b, resulting in a gain-of-function phenotype that enhances complement activation (Aradottir2021Factor). These interactions highlight the critical role of CFB in modulating the complement system and its implications in various diseases.
