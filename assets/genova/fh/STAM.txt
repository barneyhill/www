# STAM

## Overview
The STAM gene encodes the Signal Transducing Adaptor Molecule, a protein integral to intracellular signaling and endosomal sorting processes. As a component of the ESCRT-0 complex, the STAM protein is pivotal in the downregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the lysosomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. It interacts with Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated substrate) to form a complex that facilitates the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway, crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating receptor signaling. The STAM protein is characterized by several domains, including a VHS domain, a ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), and an SH3 domain, which enable its interactions with ubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains, particularly those linked via Lys63. These interactions underscore its role in modulating signaling pathways and cellular behavior (Bache2003STAM; Komada2005The; Nguyen2019Molecular).

## Structure
STAM (Signal Transducing Adaptor Molecule) is a protein that plays a role in intracellular signaling pathways and is involved in the downregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). It forms a complex with Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated substrate), which is crucial for its function. The STAM protein contains several domains, including a VHS domain, a UIM (ubiquitin-interacting motif), and an SH3 domain. These domains facilitate interactions with ubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains, with a preference for Lys63-linked chains, which are important for lysosomal degradation processes (Komada2005The; Nguyen2019Molecular).

The STAM protein is part of the ESCRT-0 complex, which is localized on the cytoplasmic face of the early endosome. The Hrs/STAM complex is anchored to the endosome via the FYVE domain of Hrs, while STAM lacks a lipid-binding domain and is localized through its interaction with Hrs (Komada2005The).

STAM proteins are subject to post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, which are involved in cell growth and differentiation signaling (Komada2005The). In mammals, there are two STAM genes, STAM1 and STAM2, which have a 53% overall amino acid sequence identity and are believed to have redundant functions (Komada2005The).

## Function
The STAM (Signal Transducing Adaptor Molecule) protein plays a critical role in the endocytic pathway, particularly in the regulation of receptor downregulation and lysosomal degradation. It is a component of the ESCRT-0 complex, which is responsible for the initial selection of ubiquitinated proteins targeted for lysosomal degradation. This process is essential for the downregulation of signaling pathways, such as the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling (ChanutDelalande2010The). In healthy human cells, STAM is involved in sorting internalized and monoubiquitinated membrane proteins on the early endosome to the multivesicular body (MVB) for lysosomal degradation, maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring precise regulation of receptor and channel localization (Hu2007STAM).

STAM interacts with ubiquitinated cargo proteins, facilitating their recruitment by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of protein trafficking within the cell (Bednash2017Targeting). The STAM-Hrs complex is known to down-regulate ligand-activated growth factor receptors from the cell surface, indicating a conserved mechanism across species (Hu2007STAM). This function is critical for modulating signaling pathways during development and maintaining cellular signaling and behavior (ChanutDelalande2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the STAMBP gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and pancreatic cancer. In neurodevelopmental disorders, mutations in STAMBP, such as compound heterozygous mutations, are associated with conditions like microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome (MICCAP). These mutations lead to developmental delays, microcephaly, epilepsy, and dysmorphic features, primarily due to disrupted cortical proliferation and impaired neural stem cell proliferation (Hu2022Novel). Specific missense variants, such as STAMBP G307E and T313I, have been identified as pathogenic, failing to rescue the impaired proliferation in cortical organoids (Hu2022Novel).

In pancreatic cancer, STAMBP is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance, particularly to gemcitabine. High STAMBP expression enhances aerobic glycolysis through the PDK1-mediated Warburg effect, contributing to chemoresistance. This process is regulated by the transcription factor E2F1, which STAMBP stabilizes by preventing its degradation (Zhang2024Identification). Targeting the STAMBP/E2F1/PDK1 axis has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer (Zhang2024Identification). The FDA-approved drug entrectinib has been identified as a potential STAMBP inhibitor, enhancing the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine (Zhang2024Identification).

## Interactions
STAM (signal transducing adaptor molecule) interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in intracellular signaling and endosomal sorting. STAM proteins, including STAM1 and STAM2, form a multivalent ubiquitin-binding complex on early endosomes with Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) and Eps15. These interactions are essential for the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway (Bache2003STAM). Hrs acts as a bridge between STAM proteins and Eps15, facilitating the formation of a ternary complex (Bache2003STAM).

STAM proteins bind ubiquitin through ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), which is critical for their role in endosomal sorting (Bache2003STAM). The interaction between STAM and Hrs is mediated by coiled-coil domains, with specific binding sites identified on both proteins (Asao1997Hrs). STAM also interacts with AMSH, a zinc-containing ubiquitin isopeptidase, which enhances AMSH's deubiquitination activity, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for protein sorting and degradation (Kim2006STAM–AMSH).

In the context of cytokine signaling, STAM is associated with Jak3 and Jak2, indicating its involvement in signaling pathways that regulate DNA synthesis and cell growth (Asao1997Hrs). These interactions highlight STAM's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
