# APBB1IP

## Overview
The APBB1IP gene encodes the protein amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 1 interacting protein, commonly referred to as RIAM. RIAM is a member of the MRL (Mig-10/RIAM/Lamellipodin) family of multi-adaptor proteins, which play a pivotal role in cellular adhesion and signaling processes. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including Ras-association (RA) and pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains, which are essential for its function in integrin activation and cell adhesion. RIAM is particularly significant in the immune system, where it facilitates the activation of integrins on leukocytes, thereby influencing leukocyte adhesion and migration, critical steps in immune response and inflammation. Additionally, RIAM is involved in actin polymerization and cell motility, interacting with proteins such as Ena/VASP to regulate actin dynamics. The gene's expression and function have clinical implications, with associations found in conditions such as schizophrenia and cancer, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological and pathological processes (Patsoukis2017The; Klapproth2015Loss; Lagarrigue2016The).

## Structure
The APBB1IP gene encodes the RIAM protein, which is a member of the MRL family of multi-adaptor molecules. RIAM is characterized by several key structural domains that facilitate its role in cell adhesion and signaling. It contains an N-terminal coiled-coil region, a central region with Ras-association (RA) and pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains, and a proline-rich C-terminus with multiple FPPPP motifs that interact with Ena/VASP proteins (Coló2012The). The RA and PH domains are crucial for its interaction with active Rap1 and for its recruitment to the plasma membrane, which is essential for integrin activation (Lagarrigue2016The).

RIAM also features SH3-binding motifs and profilin-binding sites, which contribute to its interactions with other proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization (Coló2012The). The protein's predicted molecular weight is approximately 73 kDa, but it appears as 100-110 kDa bands in Western blots, suggesting post-translational modifications or alternative splicing (Coló2012The). RIAM's interaction with talin, within the first 100 amino acids of its N-terminus, is critical for integrin-mediated cell adhesion (Coló2012The). The PH domain's ability to bind phosphatidylinositol monophosphates aids in its localization at cell membranes (Coló2012The).

## Function
The APBB1IP gene encodes a protein known as RIAM, which plays a significant role in integrin activation and cell adhesion processes. RIAM is a Rap1-GTP-interacting adapter molecule that is crucial for the activation of integrins, particularly β2 integrins, on leukocytes. This activation is essential for leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium, a critical step in immune response and inflammation (Klapproth2015Loss). RIAM facilitates the recruitment of talin to the plasma membrane, which is necessary for integrin activation and subsequent cell signaling (Lagarrigue2016The).

RIAM is involved in actin polymerization and cell spreading, promoting lamellipodial protrusion, which is important for cell motility and migration (Lagarrigue2016The). It interacts with Ena/VASP proteins, regulating actin dynamics and contributing to cell migration and growth (Coló2012The). In the immune system, RIAM's role in integrin activation is critical for leukocyte trafficking and immune cell function, impacting processes such as leukocyte adhesion and extravasation (Klapproth2015Loss). These functions highlight RIAM's importance in maintaining normal immune responses and cellular interactions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the APBB1IP gene, also known as RIAM, have been implicated in several clinical conditions. APBB1IP is associated with schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations and cognitive deficits. Studies have identified APBB1IP as a candidate gene for schizophrenia, with significant associations found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses in both humans and mice. Variants in APBB1IP have been linked to schizophrenia-related traits and the usage of antipsychotics (Ashbrook2019A).

APBB1IP is also involved in immune system processes, and its expression is linked to immune function. Alterations in its expression can impact immune cell function, potentially leading to immunodeficiency. The gene's role in integrin-mediated signaling is crucial for normal immune responses, and disruptions in this pathway can affect cell adhesion and migration, contributing to conditions like cancer metastasis (Patsoukis2017The).

In cancer, RIAM's involvement in integrin activation and cell migration has been shown to influence cancer progression, particularly in melanoma, where its depletion impairs cell migration and invasion (Patsoukis2017The).

## Interactions
APBB1IP, also known as RIAM, is involved in several key protein interactions that facilitate integrin activation and cell adhesion. It interacts with Rap1, a small GTPase, which is crucial for the activation of integrins in leukocytes. This interaction promotes the binding of talin to the integrin beta cytoplasmic domain, leading to integrin activation through allosteric rearrangements (Lagarrigue2016The). RIAM also forms a complex with talin and integrin, which is enriched at the tips of growing actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions. The N terminus of RIAM binds and recruits talin to the plasma membrane, inducing integrin activation, while the C terminus recruits ENA/VASP to increase actin polymerization (Lagarrigue2016The).

RIAM interacts with the SKAP-55/ADAP module to promote the membrane targeting of the RIAM-Rap1 module upon antigen stimulation of T cells, facilitating LFA-1 integrin activation (Lagarrigue2016The). Despite its significant role in integrin activation, the genetic deletion of RIAM in mice does not affect development or platelet integrin functions, suggesting that alternative Rap effectors may regulate talin in platelets (Lagarrigue2016The).
