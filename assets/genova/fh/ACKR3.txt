# ACKR3

## Overview
ACKR3, or atypical chemokine receptor 3, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) known for its atypical signaling properties. Unlike conventional GPCRs, the protein encoded by ACKR3 does not activate G-protein signaling pathways but instead engages in β-arrestin-mediated signaling. This receptor is involved in modulating chemokine gradients by scavenging and degrading chemokines such as CXCL12 and CXCL11, thereby influencing various physiological processes, including cardiac and neuronal development, as well as immune responses (Nibbs2013Immune; Quinn2018Emerging). Structurally, ACKR3 features the characteristic seven transmembrane helices of GPCRs and includes unique elements such as a conserved disulfide bond that may play a role in ligand recognition (Gustavsson2017Structural). The receptor's ability to form heterodimers with other receptors, such as CXCR4, further underscores its complex role in cellular signaling and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Quinn2018Emerging).

## Structure
ACKR3, also known as atypical chemokine receptor 3, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that exhibits a unique structural profile. It possesses the characteristic seven transmembrane helices of GPCRs, along with extracellular and intracellular loops (Gustavsson2017Structural). The receptor includes a DRY sequence and NPxxY motif, which are common in canonical GPCRs, indicating some structural similarities despite its atypical signaling pathways (Gustavsson2017Structural).

A notable feature of ACKR3 is the presence of a unique disulfide bond between cysteine residues C21 and C26 in its N terminus, which is not found in other chemokine receptors. This disulfide bridge is conserved across species and may play a role in ligand recognition (Gustavsson2017Structural). The receptor's extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) is crucial for interactions with the chemokine CXCL12, forming a crosslink with the chemokine's N terminus, which is important for the receptor's function (Gustavsson2017Structural).

ACKR3 does not activate G-protein signaling but instead signals through β-arrestin pathways, which may involve conformational changes similar to those seen in other GPCRs like rhodopsin (Gustavsson2017Structural). The receptor can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure, although specific details on dimerization are not extensively covered in the provided context.

## Function
ACKR3, also known as atypical chemokine receptor 3, is a G protein-coupled receptor that primarily binds to the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL11. Unlike conventional chemokine receptors, ACKR3 does not initiate classic G protein signaling but instead modulates chemokine availability through scavenging and degradation, thereby influencing chemokine gradients and signaling pathways (Nibbs2013Immune; Quinn2018Emerging). This receptor is involved in various physiological processes, including cardiac and neuronal development, where it regulates CXCL12 signaling crucial for heart valve formation and neuronal migration (Nibbs2013Immune; Quinn2018Emerging).

ACKR3 is expressed in several cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, neurons, and astrocytes, where it plays roles in neurotransmitter homeostasis and synaptic signaling (Quinn2018Emerging). It can form heterodimers with CXCR4, affecting downstream signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, which are important for T-cell integrin activation and other cellular responses (Quinn2018Emerging). In the immune system, ACKR3 modulates the trafficking and subcellular localization of CXCR4, thereby influencing immune responses and maintaining homeostasis (Nibbs2013Immune). Its expression in the placenta and other tissues suggests roles in regulating blood-borne chemokines and contributing to developmental processes (Nibbs2013Immune).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ACKR3 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and cardiovascular conditions. In cancer, ACKR3 is often upregulated and associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes, enhanced tumor cell proliferation, and resistance to therapies. It is linked to poor prognosis in several cancers, including prostate, breast, lung, and renal cell carcinoma (Sjöberg2020The; Lokeshwar2020Atypical; Groblewska2020The). In prostate cancer, ACKR3 expression increases upon androgen deprivation, enhancing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated signaling and contributing to castration-resistant and metastatic stages (Lokeshwar2020Atypical). In lung adenocarcinoma, high ACKR3 expression is a poor prognostic marker, promoting tumor growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Sjöberg2020The).

In cardiovascular diseases, ACKR3 plays a complex role. It is involved in cardiac development and is upregulated in ischemic conditions, contributing to both protective and detrimental effects. While it can reduce lesion formation and cholesterol levels in atherosclerosis, it is also associated with increased neointimal formation and macrophage accumulation, indicating a role in inflammation and atherosclerosis progression (Duval2022Emerging; Gencer2019Atypical). These findings highlight ACKR3's significant impact on disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ACKR3, also known as atypical chemokine receptor 3, engages in various protein interactions that influence its signaling pathways. It interacts with β-arrestins, which mediate its signaling and internalization, although it can also signal independently of G proteins and β-arrestins (Gustavsson2017Structural; Hicks2024ACKR3). The receptor forms heteromeric complexes with the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (AVPR1A) in vascular smooth muscle cells, affecting signaling pathways by inhibiting arginine vasopressin-induced inositol trisphosphate production and antagonizing vasopressin-mediated arterial constriction (Albee2018Identification).

ACKR3 interacts with proteins involved in endocytic machinery, such as VPS29, which is part of the retromer complex, suggesting a role in receptor trafficking (Hicks2024ACKR3). It also interacts with BMP2K, a bone morphology protein 2-inducible kinase, independently of G proteins and β-arrestins. This interaction is linked to specific phosphorylation sites on ACKR3, indicating a unique receptor binding interface (Hicks2024ACKR3). These interactions highlight the complexity of ACKR3's role in cellular signaling and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
