# TGS1

## Overview
The TGS1 gene encodes the enzyme trimethylguanosine synthase 1, a methyltransferase that plays a pivotal role in RNA processing. This enzyme is responsible for the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, specifically catalyzing the formation of a trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap on the 5' end of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). This modification is crucial for RNA stability, nuclear import, and proper processing, impacting the assembly and function of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonuclear proteins (snRNPs) (Monecke2009Structure; Chen2022TGS1). TGS1's activity is essential for maintaining telomerase RNA levels and telomere integrity, with implications in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (Chen2020Loss; Buemi2022TGS1). The enzyme's interactions with proteins such as the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein underscore its significance in RNA splicing and cellular viability (Chen2020TGS1).

## Structure
The human trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1) protein is characterized by a conserved methyltransferase domain, which is crucial for its function in RNA processing. The primary structure of TGS1 includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the TGS1 gene, with specific fragments such as amino acids 636-853 and 653-853 being studied for their structural properties (Monecke2009Structure). The secondary structure of TGS1 features a canonical fold typical of class I methyltransferases, consisting of a central seven-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices, along with additional N-terminal β-strands (Monecke2009Structure).

The tertiary structure of TGS1 forms a specific 3D conformation necessary for its enzymatic activity, with the substrate m7GpppA binding via its adenosine moiety in the AdoMet-binding cleft. However, the m7G cap remains disordered, indicating an incomplete cap-binding pocket in the crystallized fragment (Monecke2009Structure). The quaternary structure involves the formation of monomers with D2 symmetry, as observed in the crystallized asymmetric unit (Monecke2009Structure).

TGS1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function. The protein may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, potentially resulting in varied functional properties.

## Function
Trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA in human cells. It catalyzes the formation of a trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap on the 5' end of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), which is essential for their stability, nuclear import, and proper processing (Monecke2009Structure). TGS1 is involved in the hypermethylation of the 5' cap of human telomerase RNA (hTR), which is critical for maintaining hTR levels and ensuring its retention within the nucleus (Chen2020Loss). This modification suppresses hTR accumulation and affects its association with specific RNA binding proteins, thereby regulating telomerase activity and telomere maintenance (Chen2020Loss).

TGS1 is active in the nucleoplasm and is crucial for the proper assembly and function of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonuclear proteins (snRNPs), which are critical for RNA splicing (Chen2022TGS1). It interacts with the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein and the Sm core proteins to facilitate the nuclear import of snRNPs, accelerating their maturation in Cajal bodies (Chen2022TGS1). TGS1's role in snRNA processing is significant because defects in this pathway can lead to neurodegenerative diseases (Chen2022TGS1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the TGS1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. TGS1 is crucial for the proper processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and its deficiency can lead to neurological phenotypes similar to those caused by Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) deficiency. This suggests a potential role for TGS1 in conditions like Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia type 7 (PCH7) (Chen2022TGS1; Chen2020TGS1). TGS1 mutations result in the accumulation of untrimmed 3'-extended U2 snRNA molecules, which are linked to neurodegeneration and motor neuron loss (Chen2022TGS1; Chen2020TGS1).

In cancer, TGS1 is involved in telomere maintenance through the 2,2,7-trimethyl guanosine capping of human telomerase RNA. Loss of TGS1 function can lead to telomere dysfunction, promoting the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway, which is associated with genomic instability and cancer progression (Buemi2022TGS1). TGS1 mutations may disrupt normal telomere maintenance, contributing to cancer cell survival and potentially offering new therapeutic targets (Buemi2022TGS1).

## Interactions
Trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing. TGS1 interacts with the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein and the SmB subunit of the Sm complex, which are essential for the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (Chen2020TGS1). This interaction is crucial for the hypermethylation of snRNA caps, facilitating their nuclear import and proper function in splicing (Monecke2009Structure).

In Drosophila, the homolog of TGS1, known as dTgs1, has been shown to physically associate with the SMN complex, including several Gemin proteins, indicating a conserved functional interaction across species (Maccallini2020Intimate). This interaction is vital for the viability of retinal progenitor cells and can partially rescue defects caused by SMN depletion (Maccallini2020Intimate).

TGS1 also interacts with the Swm2p protein in yeast, which is necessary for efficient snRNA trimethylation and pre-rRNA processing. The self-association of TGS1 is crucial for its function, as it enhances the efficiency of sn(o)RNA methylation (Boon2015Selfassociation). These interactions highlight TGS1's role in maintaining RNA integrity and processing across different organisms.
