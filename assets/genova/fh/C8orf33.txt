# C8orf33

## Overview
C8orf33, or chromosome 8 open reading frame 33, is a gene located on the human chromosome 8 that encodes a protein of the same name. The protein encoded by C8orf33 is currently uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms of action remain largely unknown (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite this, emerging research suggests that C8orf33 may play a role in cancer biology, as alterations in this gene have been observed in various cancer types, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and thymoma (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene's expression is potentially regulated by the cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1), implicating it in cancer-related signaling pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Further studies are required to fully understand the protein's function and its implications in human health and disease.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the C8orf33 gene in human health, particularly in relation to cancer, is an area of ongoing research. Genetic alterations in C8orf33, such as gene amplifications, have been observed with a frequency of up to 6% in certain cancer types, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). However, the clinical impact of these alterations remains uncertain, as the ClinVar database classifies missense mutations in C8orf33 as having 'uncertain' or 'likely benign' clinical significance (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

C8orf33 is associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC) and thymoma (THYM), and its expression is linked to cancer-related pathways and microRNAs (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene's expression may be regulated by the cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1), which is involved in cancer signaling, indicating that C8orf33 might participate in upstream transcriptional regulation in these cancers (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

Despite these associations, the specific clinical outcomes or conditions directly resulting from C8orf33 mutations or expression changes are not well-documented, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate its role in cancer and other systemic diseases (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
