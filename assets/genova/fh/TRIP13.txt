# TRIP13

## Overview
TRIP13 is a gene that encodes the protein thyroid hormone receptor interactor 13, which is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family. This protein plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and spindle assembly checkpoint control. As an ATPase, TRIP13 facilitates the remodeling of HORMA domain proteins, such as MAD2, which is essential for the proper functioning of the mitotic checkpoint. The protein's ability to form hexameric structures is crucial for its function in these processes (Brulotte2017Mechanistic; Ye2017The). TRIP13's interactions with other proteins, such as USP7 and components of the nonhomologous end joining DNA repair pathway, underscore its importance in maintaining genomic stability and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Banerjee2014TRIP13; Li2021TRIP13). Overexpression of TRIP13 has been linked to various cancers, where it contributes to drug resistance and poor prognosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Hagihara2023Identification; Zhao2023Targeting).

## Structure
The TRIP13 protein is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family, characterized by a conserved ATPase domain. Its molecular structure includes a small N-terminal domain (NTD) responsible for substrate recognition and a larger AAA+ ATPase region that forms the ATP-binding site (Lu2019Insights; Ye2017The). The AAA+ ATPase region is divided into large and small subdomains, with the ATP-binding site located at their interface (Brulotte2017Mechanistic). 

TRIP13 can form hexameric rings, a common quaternary structure in the AAA+ ATPase family, although it can also assemble into a helical filament under certain conditions (Wang2020A; Ye2017The). The hexameric structure is crucial for its function in remodeling HORMA domain proteins, such as MAD2, by engaging and unfolding their N-terminal regions (Brulotte2017Mechanistic; Ye2017The). 

The protein's pore loops, located in the large AAA domain, extend into the hexamer pore and are involved in substrate interaction, particularly with MAD2 and p31 comet (Ye2017The). These structural features enable TRIP13 to facilitate the conversion of closed MAD2 to open MAD2, a process essential for spindle checkpoint silencing (Brulotte2017Mechanistic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The TRIP13 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromosomal stability and cell cycle regulation. Overexpression of TRIP13 is associated with drug resistance in multiple cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma, colorectal cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma. This overexpression leads to increased proliferation, invasion, and decreased sensitivity to anticancer drugs such as bortezomib, cisplatin, and paclitaxel (Hagihara2023Identification; Zhao2023Targeting).

In multiple myeloma, TRIP13 overexpression is linked to chromosomal instability by affecting the spindle assembly checkpoint and DNA damage repair mechanisms, contributing to drug resistance (Zhao2023Targeting). In lung adenocarcinoma, high TRIP13 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is regulated by noncoding RNAs such as miR-515-5p and miR-192-5p (Hagihara2023Identification).

TRIP13 is also overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it promotes tumor growth and metastasis, correlating with poor survival rates (Zhu2019Elevated). In gliomas, TRIP13 expression is linked to DNA damage checkpoint responses and is associated with aneuploidy, a characteristic of tumor development (Chen2021Clinical). These findings suggest that TRIP13 is a potential therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
TRIP13, a member of the AAA+ protein superfamily, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. It interacts with key components of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway, including KU70, KU80, and DNA-PKcs, facilitating error-prone DNA repair and contributing to chemoresistance in head and neck cancer (Banerjee2014TRIP13). TRIP13's ATPase activity is essential for these interactions, as it aids in the assembly of protein-DNA or protein-protein complexes (Banerjee2014TRIP13).

TRIP13 also interacts with the deubiquitinase USP7, enhancing its activity and affecting the stability of proteins such as PTEN and p53, which are critical for genomic stability. This interaction occurs in the ubiquitin-like (UBL) region, and mutations in this area can disrupt the interaction (Li2021TRIP13). TRIP13's interaction with USP7 also stabilizes NEK2, a protein associated with drug resistance in multiple myeloma (Li2021TRIP13).

In the context of the spindle assembly checkpoint, TRIP13 interacts with MAD2 and p31 comet, facilitating the conversion of closed MAD2 to open MAD2, which is crucial for the disassembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex (Lu2019Insights). These interactions highlight TRIP13's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
