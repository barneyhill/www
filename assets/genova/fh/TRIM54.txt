# TRIM54

## Overview
TRIM54, or tripartite motif containing 54, is a gene that encodes a protein known as muscle RING-finger protein-3 (MuRF3), which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme that facilitates the attachment of ubiquitin to specific substrate proteins, marking them for degradation by the proteasome. The TRIM54 protein is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a RING finger domain, B-box domains, a coiled-coil region, and a COS domain, which collectively contribute to its role in muscle protein turnover and cytoskeletal regulation (Sardiello2008Genomic). TRIM54 is crucial for maintaining muscle integrity and function, as it regulates the degradation of myosin heavy chains and other proteins involved in muscle structure. Additionally, TRIM54 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through its interactions with components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Zhu2021Targeting).

## Structure
TRIM54, also known as muscle RING-finger protein-3 (MuRF3), is a member of the TRIM family characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. These domains contribute to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of specific substrates such as beta/slow myosin heavy chain (beta/slow MHC) and MHCIIa (Sardiello2008Genomic; Liu2021Tumor).

The RING domain is a cysteine-rich zinc-binding motif that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process by interacting with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The B-box domains, also zinc-binding motifs, are involved in modulating E3 ligase activity and protein interactions. The coiled-coil domain facilitates oligomerization, allowing TRIM54 to form homodimers, heterodimers, and heterotrimers, which may enable it to perform various tasks and adapt to different stimuli (Sardiello2008Genomic; Liu2021Tumor).

TRIM54 also contains a COS domain, which is a microtubule-binding domain, and this domain structure is described as R-B2-CC-COS (Sardiello2008Genomic). The presence of these domains suggests a role in cytoskeletal regulation and muscle protein turnover.

## Function
TRIM54, also known as muscle RING-finger protein-3 (MuRF3), functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in healthy human cells. It plays a critical role in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of specific myosin heavy chains, including beta/slow myosin heavy chain (beta/slow MHC) and MHCIIa. This activity is essential for maintaining muscle integrity and performance, as it prevents the accumulation of these proteins, which can lead to muscle dysfunction (Liu2021Tumor).

In the absence of TRIM54, mice exhibit skeletal muscle myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, conditions characterized by subsarcolemmal MHC accumulation, myofiber fragmentation, and reduced muscle performance. These findings underscore the importance of TRIM54 in muscle maintenance and cardiac health (Liu2021Tumor).

TRIM54 also targets other proteins for degradation, such as four-and-a-half LIM domain (FHL2) and g-filamin, which are involved in muscle structure and function. The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to muscle cell differentiation and maintenance, impacting overall muscle integrity and function (Liu2021Tumor).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM54 is significantly overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared to normal tissues, and its overexpression is associated with the progression and poor prognosis of HCC. Higher TRIM54 expression correlates with shorter overall survival, progression-free survival, and relapse-free survival in HCC patients. The overexpression of TRIM54 promotes HCC proliferation and metastasis both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting its role as an oncogenic gene in HCC. Inhibition of TRIM54 results in smaller tumors and reduced metastasis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2021Targeting).

Mechanistically, TRIM54 interacts with Axin1, leading to the degradation of Axin1 and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis. This interaction results in increased nuclear β-catenin expression and decreased Axin1 expression in clinical HCC samples, contributing to the aggressiveness of HCC (Zhu2021Targeting).

In hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC, TRIM54 expression is linked to poor overall survival, and its upregulation is observed in patients with higher neoplasm histologic grades, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis and as a potential biomarker for disease severity (Hu2022Comprehensive).

## Interactions
TRIM54, a member of the tripartite motif family, is involved in significant protein-protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TRIM54 has been shown to interact directly with Axin1, a crucial component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction is pivotal as TRIM54 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Axin1. The degradation of Axin1 by TRIM54 leads to the sustained activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis in HCC (Zhu2021Targeting).

TRIM54's role in modulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is further highlighted by its effect on β-catenin itself. Overexpression of TRIM54 reduces the ubiquitination of β-catenin, thereby enhancing the signaling activity of the pathway. This interaction underscores TRIM54's oncogenic potential in HCC, as it promotes cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through these molecular interactions (Zhu2021Targeting).

These findings suggest that TRIM54's interactions with Axin1 and β-catenin are critical in the context of HCC, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention aimed at disrupting these interactions to inhibit cancer progression (Zhu2021Targeting).
