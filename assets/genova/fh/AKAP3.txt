# AKAP3

## Overview
AKAP3, or A-kinase anchoring protein 3, is a gene that encodes a scaffolding protein crucial for sperm motility and male fertility. The protein, also referred to as AKAP3, plays a pivotal role in the structural organization of the sperm fibrous sheath, a component essential for the proper function of the sperm flagellum. As a scaffolding protein, AKAP3 anchors protein kinase A (PKA) to specific sites within the sperm cell, facilitating the regulation of PKA-dependent phosphorylation events necessary for sperm motility and capacitation (Rafaee2022Structural; Luconi2004Increased). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as AKAP4 and PKA regulatory subunits, underscore its importance in organizing multiprotein signaling complexes that are vital for sperm function (Hillman2013Dissociation; Luconi2011Role). Additionally, genetic variations in AKAP3 have been linked to male infertility and cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Kjällquist2018Exome; Rafaee2022Structural).

## Structure
The AKAP3 protein is a scaffolding protein involved in the assembly of the sperm fibrous sheath, which is crucial for sperm motility and male fertility. The primary structure of AKAP3 consists of 853 amino acids (Rafaee2022Structural). Its secondary structure is predominantly composed of coils, with alpha helices and beta-sheets also present (Rafaee2022Structural). The tertiary structure of AKAP3 was modeled using the Robetta comparative modeling approach, and the model was validated with a PROCHECK-Ramachandran plot, indicating a reliable structure with most amino acids in favored regions (Rafaee2022Structural). The QMEAN Z-score of -1.49 suggests that the model's quality is comparable to experimental structures of similar size (Rafaee2022Structural).

AKAP3 plays a role in the cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway, essential for sperm motility, and interacts with other proteins like PKA and Gα13, highlighting the importance of conserved regions for these interactions (Rafaee2022Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. The study of AKAP3's structure provides insights into its role in male fertility and the potential impact of genetic variations (Rafaee2022Structural).

## Function
AKAP3 (A-kinase anchoring protein 3) is a critical component in the regulation of sperm motility and male fertility. It functions as a scaffolding protein that anchors protein kinase A (PKA) to specific locations within the sperm cell, particularly in the fibrous sheath of the sperm flagellum. This localization is essential for the regulation of PKA-dependent phosphorylation events, which are crucial for sperm motility (Rafaee2022Structural; Luconi2004Increased).

AKAP3 facilitates the recruitment of PKA to the sperm tail, enhancing sperm motility through the interaction with the RIIβ regulatory subunit of PKA. This interaction is mediated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of AKAP3, which is necessary for the binding of PKA and is crucial for the regulation of sperm function (Luconi2005Tyrosine; Luconi2004Increased). The protein is also involved in the structural organization of the fibrous sheath, coordinating the assembly of signaling platforms that include various enzymes necessary for sperm motility (Luconi2011Role).

AKAP3's role extends to sperm capacitation, a process essential for fertilization, where it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, further enhancing its interaction with PKA and other proteins in the fibrous sheath (Zhao2019Human). This phosphorylation is crucial for the biochemical pathways that regulate sperm motility and capacitation (Luconi2005Tyrosine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AKAP3 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, particularly affecting male fertility and cancer progression. In the context of male infertility, AKAP3 is crucial for sperm motility and the structural integrity of the sperm fibrous sheath. Mutations such as I500T and I661T have been studied for their impact on sperm motility, although they do not cause significant structural or functional deviations leading to immotile spermatozoa (Rafaee2022Structural). Despite being classified as benign, these mutations can decrease the stability of the AKAP3 protein, potentially contributing to conditions like oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (Rafaee2022Structural).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, AKAP3 mutations have been identified in metastatic lesions, suggesting a role in cancer progression and metastasis. The Ser807Leu mutation in AKAP3 was found with a higher variant allele frequency in metastatic lesions compared to primary tumors, indicating clonal selection and a potential role in metastasis (Kjällquist2018Exome). These findings highlight the importance of AKAP3 in both reproductive health and oncogenesis, with its deregulation potentially contributing to disease states (Kjällquist2018Exome).

## Interactions
AKAP3 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in sperm motility and capacitation. It anchors Protein Kinase A (PKA) by binding to its regulatory subunits, particularly PKA RII, which is essential for its stability and function during sperm capacitation (Hillman2013Dissociation). The interaction between AKAP3 and PKA is modulated by phosphorylation events, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, which enhances PKA binding and compartmentalization in the fibrous sheath, thereby promoting sperm motility (Zhao2019Human; Luconi2011Role).

AKAP3 also interacts with other proteins like AKAP4, forming a complex that is integral to the structural organization of the sperm fibrous sheath. This interaction is important for the assembly and function of the fibrous sheath, which supports sperm motility (Luconi2011Role). Additionally, AKAP3 binds to proteins with a conserved RII docking domain, including ROPN1, ASP, SP17, and CABYR, which further protect it from degradation during capacitation (Vizel2015AKAP3). These interactions highlight AKAP3's role in organizing multiprotein signaling complexes essential for sperm function.
