# ARK2C

## Overview
ARK2C is a gene that encodes the protein arkadia (RNF111) C-terminal like ring finger ubiquitin ligase 2C, also known as RNF165. This protein is categorized as a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitylation cascade, a process essential for protein degradation and cellular regulation. ARK2C is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, where it regulates Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) signaling by promoting the degradation of negative regulators such as SMAD7 and SnoN/Ski, thus acting as a positive regulator of this pathway (Paluda2022Ubiquitin). The protein's structure, characterized by a RING domain and multiple ubiquitin binding sites, facilitates its interaction with E2 enzymes and ubiquitin molecules, enabling the assembly of Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains (Paluda2022Ubiquitin). These interactions are crucial for its function in protein degradation and signaling pathways, with implications for nervous system development and function (Paluda2022Ubiquitin).

## Structure
The ARK2C protein, also known as RNF165, is characterized by a RING domain that is essential for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This domain facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 enzyme to substrate proteins by stabilizing the E2~ubiquitin conjugate in an activated conformation (Paluda2022Ubiquitin). The RING domain of ARK2C is part of a larger structure that includes a β3-RING loop, which contains acidic residues that interact with basic residues on ubiquitin, enhancing ubiquitin transfer (Paluda2022Ubiquitin). The β3-RING loop is flexible and plays a crucial role in recruiting ubiquitin molecules, particularly at the Ub R and Ub D binding sites, which are important for efficient ubiquitin chain assembly (Paluda2022Ubiquitin).

ARK2C also features a charged loop N-terminal to the RING domain, which interacts with both regulatory ubiquitin and the ubiquitin conjugated to the E2 enzyme, further enhancing its activity (Paluda2022Ubiquitin). The protein's structure is stabilized by multiple ubiquitin binding sites, which are critical for its function in ubiquitin transfer and chain assembly (Paluda2022Ubiquitin). The structural dynamics of ARK2C, including its interaction with the E2 enzyme UbcH5b, suggest its role in assembling Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains (Paluda2022Ubiquitin).

## Function
ARK2C, also known as RNF165, is a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in the regulation of the ubiquitylation cascade, a process crucial for protein degradation and cellular regulation. This protein is specifically expressed in the nervous system and is involved in the regulation of Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) signaling, a pathway important for cell growth and differentiation. ARK2C functions as a positive regulator of TGFβ signaling by mediating the attachment of degradative ubiquitin chains to negative regulators of the pathway, such as SMAD7 and SnoN/Ski, thereby promoting their degradation (Paluda2022Ubiquitin).

The molecular activity of ARK2C involves its interaction with E2 enzymes, such as UbcH5b, to facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins. This interaction is enhanced by specific ubiquitin binding sites on ARK2C, which stabilize the activated conformation of the E2~Ub conjugate, promoting efficient ubiquitin transfer (Paluda2022Ubiquitin). The protein's activity is fine-tuned by its structural components, including the β3-RING loop, which contains residues that interact with ubiquitin to enhance its transfer activity (Paluda2022Ubiquitin). The loss of ARK2C function leads to motor innervation defects, highlighting its critical role in nervous system development (Paluda2022Ubiquitin).

## Interactions
ARK2C, also known as RNF165, is a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with various proteins to facilitate ubiquitin transfer. It forms a complex with the E2 enzyme UbcH5b and ubiquitin molecules, which is crucial for the assembly of Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains. This interaction involves specific residues in the RING domain and a charged loop that enhance the stability and activity of the complex (Paluda2022Ubiquitin).

The RING domain of ARK2C binds both the E2-Ub conjugate and a free ubiquitin molecule, forming a catalytic complex that is essential for its enzymatic activity. This binding stabilizes the E2-E3 assembly, promoting the nucleophilic attack on the thioester bond in the E2-Ub conjugate (Mintis2020Assessing).

ARK2C also interacts with UBXN7, a member of the UBA-UBX family, through its UAS thioredoxin-like domain. This interaction inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of ARK2C by preventing the binding of E2 conjugating enzymes to the RING domain, thereby modulating the degradation of substrates in response to signaling pathways (Amhaz2023The).

These interactions highlight ARK2C's role in regulating protein degradation and signaling pathways through its ubiquitin ligase activity.
