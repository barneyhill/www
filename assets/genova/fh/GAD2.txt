# GAD2

## Overview
The GAD2 gene encodes the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD65), which is a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. GAD65 is categorized as a decarboxylase enzyme and is predominantly found in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it plays a vital role in converting glutamate to GABA, thus maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission (Pan2012Transcriptional). This balance is crucial for various neural processes, including the modulation of synaptic plasticity and the regulation of neuronal excitability. The expression of GAD2 is regulated by neuronal activity and is influenced by factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through specific signaling pathways (Pan2012Transcriptional). Alterations in the GAD2 gene have been associated with several metabolic and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Boutin2003GAD2; Hettema2006Association).

## Function
The GAD2 gene encodes the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD65), which is crucial for the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. GAD65 is primarily located in presynaptic terminals, where it facilitates the production of GABA for vesicle release, playing a key role in maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in neuronal circuits (Pan2012Transcriptional). This balance is essential for the proper functioning of neuronal circuits, including the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neuronal progenitors during development, as well as the integration and modulation of excitatory activities in mature neurons (Pan2012Transcriptional).

GAD2 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of GABA synthesis, particularly in cortical GABAergic interneurons, and is regulated by the transcription factor CREB, which is activated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through a TrkB-Ras/ERK-dependent pathway (Pan2012Transcriptional). The gene's expression is activity-dependent, with GAD65 being responsible for GABA synthesis during intense synaptic activities, highlighting its role in adaptive responses to cell activity and environmental stimuli (Pan2012Transcriptional). Disruptions in GABA synthesis and regulation involving GAD65 are linked to several neurological disorders, underscoring the importance of GAD2 in maintaining normal brain function (Pan2012Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GAD2 gene have been implicated in several health conditions, particularly obesity and related metabolic disorders. The GAD2 gene, located on chromosome 10p12, is associated with human obesity through its role in the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which influences food intake behavior. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the GAD2 gene, such as À243 A.G, have been linked to increased transcriptional activity and are associated with massive obesity, higher hunger, and disinhibition scores in morbidly obese individuals (Boutin2003GAD2). These genetic variations may affect insulin secretion and GABA levels, potentially modulating food intake and contributing to obesity (Boutin2003GAD2).

The GAD2 gene has also been studied in the context of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression. However, evidence for its involvement in these conditions is limited. While some studies have suggested associations between GAD2 and anxiety-related traits, results have been inconsistent, and significant associations have not been consistently replicated (Hettema2006Association). Overall, the GAD2 gene's role in clinical conditions highlights its potential impact on metabolic and neurological pathways.
