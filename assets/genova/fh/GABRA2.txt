# GABRA2

## Overview
The GABRA2 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit alpha2, a critical component of the GABA-A receptor, which is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel family. This receptor plays a pivotal role in mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system by facilitating the influx of chloride ions upon activation by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. The GABA-A receptor, typically a pentameric assembly, includes the alpha2 subunit encoded by GABRA2, which is particularly significant in regions of the brain associated with anxiety modulation and motor coordination (Agha2021Molecular; Arias2013A). Variations in the GABRA2 gene have been linked to neurological disorders such as epilepsy and alcohol dependence, underscoring its clinical importance (Soyka2008GABAA2; Hawkins2021Gabra2).

## Structure
The GABRA2 gene encodes the alpha2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, a member of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel family. This receptor is a pentameric structure, typically composed of two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunit, forming a central pore for ion conduction (Mullins2010Fine). The primary structure of the GABRA2 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes transmembrane domains, specifically four transmembrane helices (TMH) labeled M1 to M4, with TM2 lining the pore and TM4 interacting with the lipid bilayer (Mullins2010Fine). 

The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the polypeptide, contributing to the formation of the receptor's functional conformation. The quaternary structure is characterized by the assembly of the alpha2 subunit with other subunits to form the functional GABA-A receptor (Mullins2010Fine). The protein contains an extracellular domain that forms a beta-barrel and a conserved Cys-loop, which is crucial for its function as a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel (Mullins2010Fine). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which may affect the receptor's function and localization (Mullins2010Fine).

## Function
The GABRA2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is a crucial component of the inhibitory neurotransmission system in the human brain. This receptor is a ligand-gated chloride ion channel that mediates the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. When GABA binds to the GABA-A receptor, it triggers the influx of chloride ions into neurons, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability (Agha2021Molecular; Goetjen2020Induced).

The GABA-A receptors, including those containing the alpha-2 subunit encoded by GABRA2, are widely expressed throughout the brain and play a significant role in maintaining the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. This balance is essential for regulating various physiological processes, such as anxiety modulation, sedation, and motor coordination (Soyka2008GABAA2; Arias2013A). The alpha-2 subunit is particularly significant in limbic regions of the brain, where it contributes to the anxiolytic and myorelaxant effects of benzodiazepines (Arias2013A). The GABRA2 gene is also involved in the regulation of neural connectivity and patterning, influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors (Goetjen2020Induced).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GABRA2 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders, most notably epilepsy. The gene is associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), a severe condition affecting newborns, and focal epilepsy. Specific non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in GABRA2, such as the F285S variant, have been identified as particularly deleterious, affecting the structure and stability of the GABRA2 protein and leading to increased seizure susceptibility (Agha2021Molecular). Another mutation, Pro280Leu, is associated with enhanced desensitization and reduced channel open probability, contributing to EIEE and other neurological symptoms (Sanchis‐Juan2020Structural).

Alterations in GABRA2 expression levels have also been linked to epilepsy. In mouse models, variations in the Gabra2 gene have been shown to modify the severity of Dravet syndrome and SCN8A encephalopathy, both severe forms of epilepsy. These studies suggest that increasing GABRA2 expression or function could improve outcomes in these conditions (Hawkins2021Gabra2; Yu2020Gabra2).

GABRA2 has also been associated with alcohol dependence. Specific haplotypes of the gene have been linked to an increased risk of alcohol dependence and related withdrawal symptoms, highlighting its role in the genetic predisposition to this condition (Soyka2008GABAA2).

## Interactions
The GABRA2 gene encodes the alpha2 subunit of the GABA_A receptor, which is a component of a heteropentameric ion channel complex. This receptor is typically composed of two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunit, forming a structure that is crucial for inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain (Sanchis‐Juan2020Structural). The GABRA2 protein interacts with other GABA_A receptor subunits, such as GABRA3, GABRA4, GABRA5, and GABARAP, as well as NSF and UBQLN1, suggesting its involvement in common pathways related to neurotransmitter activity and synaptic transmission (Agha2021Molecular).

The transcription factor Specificity protein 4 (Sp4) has been shown to bind specifically to the promoters of the GABRA2 gene, forming DNA/Sp4 complexes that regulate its transcription. This interaction is crucial for the expression of GABRA2 in neurons, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (Nair2016Specificity). These interactions highlight the role of GABRA2 in the regulation of inhibitory signaling in the central nervous system.
