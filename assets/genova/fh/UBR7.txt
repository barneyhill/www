# UBR7

## Overview
UBR7 is a human gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 7, which functions as an atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by its unique structural domains, including a UBR-box and a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which are essential for its role in chromatin modification and transcription regulation (Adhikary2019Atypical; Li2021UBR7). UBR7 is primarily involved in the monoubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120, a modification crucial for maintaining chromatin dynamics and gene expression (Adhikary2019Atypical). The protein plays a significant role in cellular processes such as the suppression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (Adhikary2019Atypical). Clinically, UBR7 is implicated in various diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers, where it functions as a tumor suppressor by maintaining epithelial characteristics and inhibiting tumor progression (Zhao2022UBR7; Li2021UBR7).

## Structure
The UBR7 protein is characterized by the presence of a UBR-box domain and a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger. The UBR-box is a domain commonly found in E3 ligases that act as N-recognins, which are involved in recognizing substrates with destabilizing residues for degradation (Li2021UBR7). The PHD finger of UBR7 is an atypical chromatin-binding module with a unique motif organization (Cys4-His2-Cys2) that differs from canonical PHD or RING fingers. This domain is stabilized by zinc ion coordination in a cross-braced topology, similar to RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligases, and is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting histone H2B at lysine 120 (Adhikary2019Atypical).

The PHD finger is involved in monoubiquitination of histone H2B, a process important for transcription regulation and chromatin state transitions (Adhikary2019Atypical). Mutations in the zinc-coordinating residues, such as His163 and His166, disrupt its catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of these residues for its structural integrity and function (Adhikary2019Atypical). The UBR7 protein does not have a typical E3 ligase domain but instead relies on its PHD finger for its enzymatic activity (Srivastava2021NOTCH1driven). The molecular structure details, such as primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, are not explicitly detailed in the available context.

## Function
UBR7 is a human gene encoding a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, primarily involved in the monoubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120 (H2BK120Ub). This activity is crucial for chromatin modification and regulation of gene transcription, influencing the chromatin state by affecting marks like H3K79Me2, which are associated with active transcription (Adhikary2019Atypical). UBR7 plays a significant role in maintaining the epithelial state and inhibiting cellular plasticity, which is important for normal cell function and preventing malignancy (Adhikary2019Atypical).

In healthy cells, UBR7 is involved in suppressing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with cancer metastasis. It maintains epithelial characteristics and prevents the transition to a mesenchymal state by regulating the expression of CDH4/R-cadherin, a protein important for cell boundary maintenance, tissue morphogenesis, and cell polarity (Adhikary2019Atypical). UBR7 also modulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (Adhikary2019Atypical).

UBR7 is active in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin dynamics and gene regulation, playing a critical role in maintaining normal cellular processes and preventing tumorigenesis (Adhikary2019Atypical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the UBR7 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In neurodevelopmental disorders, variants in UBR7 are associated with a syndrome characterized by epilepsy, ptosis, and hypothyroidism. This syndrome shares similarities with Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome, which involves UBR1, another E3 ubiquitin ligase. UBR7 mutations may disrupt the Notch signaling pathway, contributing to neurodevelopmental anomalies (Li2021UBR7).

In cancer, UBR7 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative and basal-like subtypes. Its loss leads to reduced levels of H2BK120Ub, a histone modification crucial for transcriptional regulation, and activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. UBR7's role in maintaining epithelial characteristics and suppressing mesenchymal traits is critical in preventing breast cancer progression (Adhikary2019Atypical).

UBR7 also functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by inhibiting glycolysis through the Keap1/Nrf2/Bach1/HK2 axis. Its deficiency is linked to increased tumor growth, and low UBR7 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes in HCC patients (Zhao2022UBR7).

## Interactions
UBR7 is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), UBR7 interacts with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetases (PRPS1, PRPS2, and PRPS3), which are crucial for nucleotide biosynthesis. This interaction is facilitated by the C-terminal region of UBR7, and it stabilizes the catalytic subunits of PRPS by mediating the degradation of PRPS-associated proteins, which are negative regulators of PRPS (Srivastava2021NOTCH1driven).

UBR7 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 (TP53) in the context of breast cancer. This interaction is enhanced by asukamycin, a polyketide that acts as a molecular glue, promoting the formation of a complex between UBR7 and TP53. This complex is suggested to impair breast cancer pathogenicity by enhancing the anti-proliferative effects of asukamycin (Isobe2019Manumycin).

In addition to these interactions, UBR7 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It recognizes proteins for degradation based on their N-terminal sequences, a process known as the 'N-end rule' (Li2021UBR7).
