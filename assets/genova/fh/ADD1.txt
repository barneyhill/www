# ADD1

## Overview
The ADD1 gene encodes the protein adducin 1, a cytoskeletal protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including the maintenance of cytoskeletal integrity and mitotic spindle assembly. Adducin 1 is categorized as an actin-binding protein and is involved in the regulation of the actin-spectrin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape and stability. The protein is composed of three main domains: a globular N-terminal head, a neck domain, and a C-terminal tail, each contributing to its structural and functional roles (Franco2010Erythrocyte; Chan2013Adducin1). Adducin 1 is essential for erythrocyte membrane skeleton assembly, cell-cell junction stabilization, and neuronal synapse assembly, among other functions (Hsu2018Adducin‐1). Clinically, mutations in the ADD1 gene, such as the Gly460Trp polymorphism, have been linked to conditions like essential hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its significance in human health (Li2007AngiotensinConverting; Cusi1997Polymorphisms).

## Structure
Adducin 1 (ADD1) is a cytoskeletal protein composed of three main domains: a globular N-terminal head domain, a neck domain, and a C-terminal tail domain. The head domain is highly conserved among the adducin family, although its exact function is not fully understood. It is suggested to play a role in dimerization and association with mitotic spindles (Franco2010Erythrocyte; Chan2013Adducin1). The neck domain is involved in oligomerization, forming dimers and tetramers, and is crucial for the protein's function in spectrin recruitment and actin capping (Li1998Adducin).

The C-terminal tail domain contains a 22-residue myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS)-related domain, which is essential for interactions with actin, spectrin, and calmodulin. This domain is a major site for phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C, which modulates ADD1's activity and interactions with the cytoskeleton (Matsuoka1998Adducin; Chan2013Adducin1). Phosphorylation by protein kinase C inhibits ADD1's ability to promote spectrin-actin interactions (Matsuoka1998Adducin).

In terms of quaternary structure, ADD1 forms heterodimers and heterotetramers with other adducin subunits, such as β and γ, which are necessary for its functional activity in cells (Li1998Adducin; Franco2010Erythrocyte).

## Function
ADD1 (adducin 1) is an actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the spindle pole during mitosis. It is phosphorylated at the S726 residue, which is essential for its localization to centrosomes and interaction with TPX2, a microtubule-associated protein necessary for spindle assembly and function. This phosphorylation allows ADD1 to organize into a rosette-like structure at the pericentriolar material, preventing centriole splitting and the formation of multipolar spindles, which is vital for proper chromosomal segregation during cell division (Hsu2018Adducin‐1).

In addition to its role in mitosis, ADD1 is involved in various cellular processes, including erythrocyte membrane skeleton assembly, cell-cell junction stabilization, neuronal synapse assembly, axon diameter maintenance, and cell migration facilitation (Hsu2018Adducin‐1). ADD1 also localizes to the nucleus, where it interacts with RNA polymerase II and ZNF331, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Liu2017Adducin). In healthy cells, ADD1 contributes to the stabilization of the membrane cytoskeleton and cell-cell junctions, playing a role in maintaining cell structure and function (Liu2017Adducin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADD1 gene, particularly the Gly460Trp polymorphism, have been associated with essential hypertension. This polymorphism is linked to increased salt sensitivity and altered blood pressure response to sodium balance, suggesting that individuals with the 460Trp allele may benefit from diuretic treatment or sodium reduction strategies (Cusi1997Polymorphisms). The Gly460Trp mutation is also associated with increased Na+, K+-ATPase activity, leading to higher sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, which contributes to hypertension (Li2007AngiotensinConverting).

The ADD1 Gly460Trp polymorphism has been implicated in cardiovascular outcomes, particularly when combined with the ACE DD genotype. This combination is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, including higher mortality and incidence of cardiovascular events (Li2007AngiotensinConverting). In Black individuals, the ADD1 variant is linked to a significantly increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes (Gerhard2008αAdducin).

Additionally, the Gly460Trp mutation in the ADD1 gene has been studied in relation to Ménière's disease, where it may contribute to endolymphatic hydrops, a condition associated with the disorder (Teggi2008Gly460Trp).

## Interactions
Adducin-1 (ADD1) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and mitotic processes. ADD1 interacts with TPX2, a microtubule-associated protein, which is essential for spindle pole integrity during mitosis. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of ADD1 at serine 726 (S726), which facilitates its localization to centrosomes and its role in organizing the pericentriolar material (Hsu2018Adducin‐1). The interaction between ADD1 and TPX2 is critical for bipolar spindle formation and is mediated through the region aa 120-370 of TPX2 (Hsu2018Adducin‐1).

ADD1 also interacts with Myo10, a motor protein involved in mitotic spindle assembly. This interaction is facilitated by the phosphorylation of ADD1 at serine residues S12 and S355 by CDK1, which is necessary for ADD1's association with mitotic spindles (Chan2013Adducin1). The head domain of ADD1 is responsible for its interaction with Myo10, and this interaction is crucial for proper spindle assembly and function (Chan2013Adducin1).

In erythrocytes, ADD1 forms a ternary complex with spectrin and actin, promoting the binding of spectrin to actin. This interaction is regulated by calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner (Mische1987Erythrocyte).
