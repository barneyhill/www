# CELF1

## Overview
CELF1, or CUGBP Elav-like family member 1, is a gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of mRNA processing, including alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. The protein, also referred to as CUG-BP1, is characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that facilitate its binding to specific RNA sequences, such as UG dinucleotide repeats and UGU trinucleotides (Dasgupta2011The). CELF1 plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene regulation, influencing cellular processes such as muscle function, insulin sensitivity, and cell proliferation. It is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and myotonic dystrophy, due to its regulatory functions in RNA metabolism (Barreau2006Mammalian; Qin2024Curriculum). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affect its interactions and functional outcomes within the cell (Barreau2006Mammalian).

## Structure
CELF1, a member of the RNA-binding protein family, is characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for its RNA binding capabilities. The primary structure of CELF1 includes these RRMs, with RRM1 and RRM2 located near the N-terminus and RRM3 near the C-terminus (Dasgupta2011The; Qin2024Curriculum). The secondary structure of these motifs typically involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's ability to bind RNA. The tertiary structure of CELF1 involves the folding of these motifs into a stable three-dimensional conformation, allowing for specific interactions with RNA sequences such as UG dinucleotide repeats and UGU trinucleotides (Dasgupta2011The).

CELF1 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, which may influence its functional interactions within the cell (Ladd2001The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in modulating CELF1's stability and interactions, with specific phosphorylation sites like Ser302 affecting its association with translation initiation factors (Dasgupta2011The). CELF1 also exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which result from alternative splicing and can alter its RNA binding properties and cellular roles (Barreau2006Mammalian; Kajdasz2022Distribution).

## Function
CELF1, also known as CUG-BP1, is an RNA-binding protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of mRNA processing in healthy human cells. It is involved in alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and translation, impacting various cellular processes. CELF1 binds to specific intronic elements and influences the splicing of exons in different genes, such as promoting exon skipping in the insulin receptor gene and exon inclusion in the cardiac troponin T gene, which affects muscle function and insulin sensitivity (Barreau2006Mammalian).

In the cytoplasm, CELF1 regulates mRNA decay by binding to GU-rich elements in the 3' UTRs of mRNAs, promoting their deadenylation and degradation. This activity is crucial for the turnover of eukaryotic mRNAs and is specific to CELF1, as it does not occur with other CELF family members (Dasgupta2011The; VlasovaSt.2011Coordinate). CELF1 also modulates translation by interacting with translation initiation factors and competing with other RNA-binding proteins, such as calreticulin, which can influence cellular decisions between proliferation and senescence (Barreau2006Mammalian).

CELF1's activity is regulated by its phosphorylation status, which affects its ability to bind mRNA and stimulate translation or promote mRNA decay (Barreau2006Mammalian). This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
CELF1 (CUGBP Elav-like family member 1) is implicated in a range of diseases due to its role in RNA splicing and post-transcriptional regulation. In cancer, CELF1 is associated with several types, including melanoma, glioma, colorectal cancer, oral cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and stomach cancer. Its dysregulation often leads to increased cell proliferation, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy (Qin2024Curriculum). In breast cancer, CELF1 expression correlates with tumor progression and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Chaudhury2016CELF1).

CELF1 is also involved in non-neoplastic disorders. In myotonic dystrophy type 1, CELF1 is upregulated, causing splicing abnormalities (Ladd2013CUGBP). In myocardial hypertrophy, CELF1 affects the MAPK signaling pathway, contributing to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Qin2024Curriculum). It plays a role in kidney and hepatic fibrosis by facilitating fibroblast activation and hepatic stellate cell activation, respectively (Qin2024Curriculum). In type 2 diabetes, CELF1 influences insulin receptor splicing, contributing to insulin resistance (Qin2024Curriculum). These associations highlight CELF1 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions across various conditions.

## Interactions
CELF1 is an RNA-binding protein that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression at multiple levels. It binds to GU-rich elements (GREs) within the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, playing a significant role in promoting the translation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) effector mRNAs (Chaudhury2019CELF1). CELF1 interacts directly with the eIF4E cap-binding protein and the Poly(A) binding protein (PABP), facilitating translation initiation in a noncanonical manner (Chaudhury2019CELF1). This interaction is crucial for CELF1's role in EMT and cancer progression (Chaudhury2019CELF1).

CELF1 also competes with the RNA-binding protein HuR for binding to the Myc mRNA 3'-UTR. While CELF1 represses MYC translation, HuR promotes it, highlighting a competitive interaction that modulates MYC expression and intestinal epithelium renewal (Liu2015Competition). CELF1's binding to Myc mRNA is increased when HuR is silenced, leading to decreased MYC translation, and vice versa (Liu2015Competition).

In mouse myoblasts, CELF1 binds to mRNAs encoding components of the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), potentially influencing their polyadenylation, translation, decay, or localization (Russo2017The). These interactions underscore CELF1's multifaceted role in post-transcriptional regulation.
