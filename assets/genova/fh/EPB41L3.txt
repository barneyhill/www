# EPB41L3

## Overview
EPB41L3 is a gene that encodes the protein erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 3, also known as protein 4.1B. This protein is a member of the protein 4.1 family, which is characterized by the presence of FERM domains that are essential for linking the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane. The 4.1B protein plays a critical role in maintaining cell shape, stability, and polarity by interacting with the actin cytoskeleton and various membrane proteins. It is predominantly expressed in the brain and has been implicated in processes such as cell adhesion, motility, and signal transduction. EPB41L3 is recognized for its function as a tumor suppressor, with its expression often downregulated in several cancers, including prostate, breast, and lung cancers, due to genetic and epigenetic alterations (Schulz2010Changes; AddouKlouche2010Loss). The gene's involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker for early detection highlight its clinical significance (Giuliano2019Methylation).

## Structure
EPB41L3, also known as protein 4.1B, is a member of the protein 4.1 family, characterized by the presence of FERM domains. These domains are crucial for connecting the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane, playing a significant role in maintaining cell shape and mechanical stability (Schulz2010Changes; Kaafarani2023Proximity). The protein contains several well-described domains, including the FERM domain, the N domain found in ubiquitin-like structural domains, and the C domain found in tyrosine phosphatases (Zhou2009High). 

Alternative splicing of the EPB41L3 gene can lead to different isoforms, which may affect the function of these domains and the protein's role in pathological states (Zhou2009High). For instance, an exon skip event of exon 17 results in an in-frame deletion, potentially leading to the loss of 41 amino acids in the C-terminal portion of the protein, affecting the region between the spectrin-actin domain and the 4.1 C-terminal domain (Zhou2009High). 

EPB41L3 is predominantly expressed in the brain and is involved in cell polarity, adhesion, and motility. It acts as a metastasis suppressor in certain cancers, such as prostate cancer, where its expression is often downregulated (Schulz2010Changes).

## Function
The EPB41L3 gene encodes the 4.1B protein, a component of the cortical cytoskeleton that underlies the cell membrane. This protein plays a crucial role in linking the actin cytoskeleton to various membrane proteins, thereby influencing cell adhesion, polarity, migration, and response to extracellular signals (Schulz2010Changes). In healthy human cells, 4.1B is most strongly expressed in neurons and is enriched in the basal cells of certain epithelia. It interacts with spectrins, actin, and transmembrane adhesion proteins, contributing to the organization of cell polarity, adhesion, and motility (Schulz2010Changes).

The 4.1B protein also binds to the adhesion molecule CD44, which interacts with hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix, and the candidate tumor suppressor disc large 1/DLG1 (Schulz2010Changes). These interactions suggest a role in maintaining cellular architecture and communication. EPB41L3 is involved in cytoskeletal protein-membrane anchor activity, cytoskeletal rearrangements, intracellular transport, and signal transduction (Kim2023The). Its activity in the cytoskeleton and cell membrane influences cellular architecture and communication, playing a role in maintaining cell shape and stability (Kim2023The).

## Clinical Significance
EPB41L3, also known as DAL-1 or protein 4.1B, is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. It is frequently downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and other tumors, often due to allelic deletions or epigenetic modifications such as hypermethylation (Singh2004DAL14.1B; AddouKlouche2010Loss). In breast cancer, the loss of EPB41L3 expression is associated with early stages of progression and an increased risk of relapse in high-risk patients (AddouKlouche2010Loss). The gene's downregulation is also linked to colorectal cancer, where it is involved in epithelial cell differentiation and acts as a tumor suppressor (NAVVABI2021Altered).

EPB41L3 interacts with protein arginine N-methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3), inhibiting its ability to methylate substrates, which may play a role in tumorigenesis (Singh2004DAL14.1B). In oropharyngeal cancer, EPB41L3 methylation, along with HPV 16 methylation, serves as a potential biomarker for early detection (Giuliano2019Methylation). Additionally, mutations in EPB41L3 have been associated with etoposide resistance in small-cell lung cancer, potentially by enhancing DNA repair mechanisms (Qiu2019&lt; A; p&gt). These findings underscore the clinical significance of EPB41L3 in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

## Interactions
EPB41L3, also known as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 3, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. In cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), EPB41L3 expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MAGI2-AS3, which acts as a molecular sponge for microRNA miR-233. This interaction modulates EPB41L3 expression, with MAGI2-AS3 upregulating and miR-233 downregulating EPB41L3, thereby influencing cancer cell invasion and migration (LncRNA; Hou2020&lt; p&gt).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EPB41L3 is part of a regulatory network involving the lncRNA LINC00052 and miR-452-5P. LINC00052 upregulates EPB41L3 by binding to miR-452-5P, which otherwise inhibits EPB41L3 expression. This interaction suppresses HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting the tumor suppressive role of EPB41L3 in this context (Zhu2017LINC00052).

In cervical cancer cells, overexpression of EPB41L3 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis through interactions with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This involves the downregulation of phosphorylated PI3K and AKT, as well as the modulation of apoptosis-related proteins such as Bcl2, BAX, and caspase-3 (Tuerxun2022Overexpression).
