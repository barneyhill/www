# SNX20

## Overview
SNX20, or sorting nexin 20, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly within the endosomal system. The protein, characterized by its Phox (PX) domain, plays a crucial role in binding phosphoinositides, which facilitates its localization to endosomes and interaction with other proteins, such as P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (Teasdale2011Insights; Schaff2008SLIC‐1sorting). SNX20 is categorized as a sorting nexin, a group of proteins known for their involvement in endocytosis and protein sorting. The protein's structure includes additional domains, such as the PXB domain with tetratricopeptide repeats, suggesting a scaffolding role during endocytosis (Teasdale2011Insights; Qi2024The). While SNX20 is expressed in various tissues, its specific functions in healthy human cells remain not fully understood, though it has been implicated in immune cell function and cancer prognosis (Qi2024The; Yuan2021SNX20ARMiRNA301a3pSNX20).

## Structure
SNX20, also known as sorting nexin 20, is a protein characterized by the presence of a Phox (PX) domain, which is a phosphoinositide-binding module. This domain is crucial for the protein's localization to cellular membranes and intracellular vesicles, particularly endosomes, by binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) and other phosphoinositides (Schaff2008SLIC‐1sorting; Qi2024The). The PX domain of SNX20 also facilitates its interaction with the cytoplasmic tail of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (Teasdale2011Insights).

In addition to the PX domain, SNX20 contains a PXB domain at its C-terminus, which includes three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). These TPR motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role for SNX20 in scaffolding during endocytosis (Teasdale2011Insights; Qi2024The). The protein's structure is not limited to the PX domain, as it also includes regions predicted to form folded domains of unknown function, indicating that SNX20 is not a 'PX-only' protein (Teasdale2011Insights). The specific molecular structure of SNX20, including its tertiary and quaternary structures, remains to be fully elucidated.

## Function
SNX20, also known as sorting nexin 20, is a protein involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the endosomal system. It contains a Phox homology (PX) domain that binds phosphoinositides, which is crucial for its localization to endosomes (Schaff2008SLIC‐1sorting). SNX20 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of P-Selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), directing its subcellular distribution to endosomes. This interaction is mediated by the PX domain, which facilitates the binding to phospholipids such as PtdIns(3)P, essential for endosomal targeting (Schaff2008SLIC‐1sorting).

Despite its role in trafficking PSGL-1 to endosomes, SNX20 does not appear to influence the degradation or recycling of PSGL-1, as its deletion does not affect PSGL-1 surface levels in leukocytes (Schaff2008SLIC‐1sorting). The absence of SNX20 in knockout mice does not impact PSGL-1-dependent signaling, suggesting that SNX20's primary function may be limited to the trafficking and localization of proteins without affecting their signaling or degradation (Schaff2008SLIC‐1sorting).

SNX20 is expressed in various lymphatic tissues and immune cells, indicating a potential role in immune cell function, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains not fully understood (Qi2024The).

## Clinical Significance
SNX20 (sorting nexin 20) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SNX20 is typically down-regulated, and its low expression is associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and lymph node metastasis. Higher SNX20 expression in LUAD correlates with better overall survival and progression-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Yuan2021SNX20ARMiRNA301a3pSNX20). 

In low-grade glioma (LGG), SNX20 is up-regulated, and its higher expression is linked to poor clinical outcomes, including WHO grade and IDH mutation status. DNA hypomethylation leads to SNX20 overexpression, making it an independent prognostic factor for LGG (Chen2022DNA). 

SNX20 also plays a role in immune regulation in cancer. In LUAD, its expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint-related gene expression, indicating its involvement in cancer immune regulation (Yuan2021SNX20ARMiRNA301a3pSNX20). SNX20's interaction with PD-L1 in LUAD suggests it could predict the clinical response to PD-1 inhibitors, with high SNX20 and PD-L1 levels associated with better therapeutic outcomes (p&gt; Increased; Fan2020&lt).

## Interactions
SNX20, also known as sorting nexin 20, is involved in various protein interactions that play a role in cellular processes. It has been identified to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of P-Selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). This interaction is facilitated by the Phox homology (PX) domain of SNX20, which binds phosphoinositides, targeting the PSGL-1/SNX20 complex to endosomes (Schaff2008SLIC‐1sorting). Despite this interaction, the deletion of SNX20 in murine models does not affect PSGL-1-dependent signaling, suggesting that SNX20's role may be limited to the intracellular trafficking of PSGL-1 rather than its signaling functions (Schaff2008SLIC‐1sorting).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SNX20 is correlated with several proteins involved in immune response regulation, such as NCF1, KLHL12, ENOSF1, and HS1BP3. These interactions suggest SNX20's involvement in the regulation of the immune microenvironment, impacting immune cell infiltration and cancer prognosis (Yuan2021SNX20ARMiRNA301a3pSNX20). SNX20 is also part of a regulatory network involving miR-301a-3p, where SNX20AR, a long non-coding RNA, acts as a sponge for miR-301a-3p, influencing SNX20 expression (Yuan2021SNX20ARMiRNA301a3pSNX20).
