# RFX1

## Overview
RFX1 is a gene that encodes the protein Regulatory Factor X1, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of both viral and cellular genes. The RFX1 protein is characterized by a unique DNA-binding domain, which distinguishes it from other known DNA-binding motifs, and plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes and the hepatitis B virus enhancer I (Reith1994RFX1; Katan‐Khaykovich2001Nuclear). As a transcription factor, RFX1 can function as a monomer or dimer, forming part of nuclear complexes that bind to specific DNA sequences, such as the X-box motif (Reith1994RFX1). The protein's activity is modulated by its structure and interactions, which are essential for its role in gene regulation (Katan1997The). Dysregulation of RFX1 has been implicated in various diseases, including coronary artery disease and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its significance in immune system function and disease pathogenesis (Zhao2010RFX1; Du2019RFX1).

## Structure
RFX1 is a transcription factor characterized by a unique DNA-binding domain that does not show homology to other known DNA-binding motifs, indicating a novel structure (Reith1994RFX1). The DNA-binding domain of RFX1 is composed of 74 amino acids and is centrally located within the protein (Reith1994RFX1). This domain is predicted to contain three α helices and a β strand, with helix III proposed as the recognition helix that contacts DNA (Emery1996A). The C-terminal region of RFX1 contains the dimerization domain, which is crucial for forming homodimers and heterodimers with other RFX family members (Reith1994RFX1). This region also includes an acidic stretch that influences nuclear localization and DNA-binding activity (Katan‐Khaykovich2001Nuclear).

RFX1 can form both homodimers and heterodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure and allowing it to bind DNA as either a monomer or a dimer (Reith1994RFX1). The protein is involved in the transcriptional regulation of various genes, including those related to the hepatitis B virus and MHC class II genes (Reith1994RFX1). RFX1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its nuclear import and DNA-binding activity (Katan‐Khaykovich2001Nuclear).

## Function
RFX1 (Regulatory Factor X1) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of both viral and cellular genes. It is involved in the transcriptional regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes, which are crucial for the immune response, and the hepatitis B virus (HBV) enhancer I, indicating its role in both immune function and viral gene expression (Reith1994RFX1; Katan‐Khaykovich2001Nuclear). RFX1 binds to specific DNA sequences, including the X-box motif, and can function as a monomer or dimer, forming part of nuclear complexes that bind to enhancer factor C (EF-C) sites (Reith1994RFX1).

The protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal region that mediates dimerization and transcriptional repression. The N-terminal part contains regions that interact with other proteins, such as c-Abl, and contribute to its regulatory functions (Katan‐Khaykovich2001Nuclear). RFX1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it is involved in both activation and repression of transcription, depending on the context and interactions with other transcription factors or DNA sequences (Katan1997The; Katan‐Khaykovich2001Nuclear). Its activity is modulated by its structure and interactions, which are crucial for its role in gene regulation (Katan1997The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RFX1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving immune system dysregulation. In coronary artery disease (CAD), downregulation of RFX1 in CD14+ monocytes leads to the overexpression of TLR4, a gene associated with monocyte activation and atherosclerosis. This occurs through epigenetic mechanisms, including decreased DNA methylation and histone modifications, contributing to the pathogenesis of CAD (Du2019RFX1).

In autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), RFX1 is downregulated in CD4+ T cells, resulting in the overexpression of genes like IL-17A, CD11a, and CD70. This is due to decreased DNA methylation and histone modifications at their promoters, which enhances Th17 cell differentiation and contributes to autoimmune responses (Zhao2010RFX1; Zhao2018IL6STAT3). The IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway is known to inhibit RFX1 expression, further exacerbating Th17-dependent autoimmune conditions (Zhao2018IL6STAT3).

These findings suggest that RFX1 plays a critical role in regulating immune responses, and its dysregulation can lead to significant clinical consequences in both cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
RFX1 is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, forming multiprotein complexes that influence transcriptional regulation. It is part of a novel family of DNA-binding proteins, including RFX2 and RFX3, which are involved in forming nuclear complexes such as EF-C, EP, MDBP, or rpL30a. These complexes are observed as discrete bands in EMSA experiments, indicating their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Reith1994RFX1).

RFX1 has a split dimerization domain, known as the Extended Dimerization Domain (EDD), which is crucial for forming stable homodimeric complexes. This domain allows RFX1 to bind to both palindromic and non-palindromic DNA sites, forming alternative complexes that are linked to transcriptional repression (KatanKhaykovich1999The; KatanKhaykovich1998RFX1). The EDD mediates different types of homodimeric interactions, affecting the transcriptional activity of RFX1 (KatanKhaykovich1998RFX1).

RFX1 also interacts with the EP element, a DNA element found in regulatory regions of viral and cellular genes. This interaction is context-dependent, allowing RFX1 to function as a dual-function regulator, contributing to the regulation of transcription through both activation and repression (Katan1997The). The formation of distinct DNA-protein complexes, such as complex a and complex a*, is influenced by the integrity of the B-C-D region of RFX1, which plays a significant role in its function as a transcriptional regulator (KatanKhaykovich1998RFX1).
