# EIF4A1

## Overview
EIF4A1 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A1 (eIF4A1), a member of the DEAD-box protein family, which is characterized by its ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity. This protein plays a pivotal role in the initiation of translation by unwinding RNA secondary structures in the 5' untranslated regions of mRNAs, facilitating ribosome recruitment and scanning. eIF4A1 is a crucial component of the eIF4F complex, interacting with other proteins such as eIF4G and eIF4E to enhance its helicase function. The activity of eIF4A1 is regulated through post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which influence its stability and interactions. Aberrant expression of EIF4A1 is associated with various cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression and poor prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Schmidt2023eIF4A1dependent; Huang2023Eukaryotic; Modelska2015The).

## Structure
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A1 (eIF4A1) is a member of the DEAD-box protein family, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) and functions as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase involved in the initiation of translation (Huang2023Eukaryotic). The protein structure includes two RecA-like domains, which provide binding sites for nucleotides and facilitate interactions between conserved motifs within its structural domains (Huang2023Eukaryotic). These domains are crucial for its helicase activity, allowing it to unwind RNA strands during the translation initiation process.

eIF4A1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination at Lys-369, which affects its stability and function. This modification is regulated by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X, which prevents proteasome-dependent degradation of eIF4A1 (Li2017USP9X). The protein's activity is also influenced by phosphorylation, which may regulate its interactions with inhibitors like hippuristanol (Steinberger2020Identification).

eIF4A1 is part of the eIF4F complex, interacting with other proteins such as eIF4G, eIF4B, and eIF4H, which enhance its helicase activity and modulate its conformational cycle (Huang2023Eukaryotic). These interactions are essential for its role in mRNA translation initiation.

## Function
EIF4A1 encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells. It is a component of the eIF4F complex, which is essential for the recruitment of ribosomes to the mRNA cap structure, a critical step in translation initiation (Schmidt2023eIF4A1dependent). EIF4A1 functions as an ATP-dependent helicase, unwinding stable secondary structures in the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. This unwinding is necessary for the loading of mRNA onto the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) and its subsequent translocation along the 5' UTR to the translation start site (Schmidt2023eIF4A1dependent; Xue2021Expression).

The helicase activity of EIF4A1 is modulated by its interaction with cofactors such as eIF4G and eIF4H, which enhance its unwinding activity in an RNA sequence-specific manner (Schmidt2023eIF4A1dependent). EIF4A1-dependent mRNAs often contain purine-rich sequences in their 5' UTRs, which activate localized EIF4A1 unwinding through multimerization, facilitating translation (Schmidt2023eIF4A1dependent). This process is particularly important for mRNAs involved in cell cycle regulation and mTORC signaling pathways (Schmidt2023eIF4A1dependent). EIF4A1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it ensures efficient and accurate protein synthesis by resolving RNA secondary structures that could hinder ribosomal scanning (Modelska2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF4A1 gene are implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of EIF4A1 is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several cancer types, including gastric, colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers, as well as melanoma (Huang2023Eukaryotic). In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-negative types, EIF4A1 upregulation is linked to higher histological grades and contributes to malignant phenotypes (Modelska2015The). In colorectal cancer, EIF4A1 is highly expressed in primary tissues and is associated with tumor progression (Huang2023Eukaryotic).

EIF4A1 is also involved in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, where elevated mRNA levels correlate with DNA hypomethylation and exert oncogenic effects through BRD2 signaling (Huang2023Eukaryotic). In Myc-amplified G3-type medulloblastoma, EIF4A1 expression correlates with Myc expression, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting tumor growth when inhibited (Huang2023Eukaryotic). Inhibition of EIF4A1 has been shown to reduce tumor proliferation in nerve sheath tumors (Huang2023Eukaryotic).

EIF4A1 is targeted by microRNAs such as miR-133a and miR-1284, which inhibit its expression in colon and gastric cancers, respectively (Huang2023Eukaryotic). Small molecule inhibitors like Rocaglamide and Cevistro have been shown to reduce EIF4A1 activity and associated cancer cell behaviors (Huang2023Eukaryotic).

## Interactions
EIF4A1 is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in the initiation of translation by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is a component of the eIF4F complex, which includes eIF4E and eIF4G, and is essential for the recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA. EIF4A1 interacts with eIF4G, forming a stable complex that enhances its ATPase activity, which is critical for unwinding mRNA secondary structures (Schütz2008Crystal). The interaction between eIF4A1 and eIF4G involves specific structural features, such as the DEAD-box sequence motifs, which are crucial for RNA and ATP binding (Schütz2008Crystal).

In the context of pancreatic cancer, EIF4A1 interacts with phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and eIF4E, facilitating the assembly of the eIF4F complex on the 5' mRNA structure, which promotes translation initiation and tumor growth (Ma2019Phosphoglycerate). EIF4A1 also interacts with the RNA helicase Ded1, enhancing its unwinding activity of secondary structures in mRNA 5'UTRs, which is important for translation initiation (Gulay2020Distinct).

Inhibitory interactions have been identified with novel compounds such as RBF197 and RBF208, which inhibit EIF4A1 by stabilizing its complex with RNA, thereby reducing its helicase activity (Kayastha2022Novel).
