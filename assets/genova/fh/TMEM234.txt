# TMEM234

## Overview
TMEM234 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 234, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and cell-cell communication. The specific functions and interactions of transmembrane protein 234 remain to be fully elucidated, but it is hypothesized to be involved in pathways that are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. Further research is needed to understand the precise biological roles and potential clinical significance of TMEM234 and its encoded protein.
