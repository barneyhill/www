# ZNF2

## Overview
ZNF2 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 2, a member of the Kruppel-like family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by the presence of nine zinc finger motifs, which are indicative of its role in DNA binding and gene regulation (Rosati1991Members). The zinc finger protein 2 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, due to its ability to interact with specific DNA sequences. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may contribute to its functional versatility (Rosati1991Members). The structural features of the protein, such as the finger preceding box (FPB) region, further suggest its involvement in complex regulatory networks within the cell (Rosati1991Members).

## Structure
The ZNF2 gene encodes a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of nine zinc finger motifs, which are typical of Kruppel-like gene products. These motifs follow the pattern CX2CX3FX5LX2HX3H and are preceded by a conserved sequence known as the H/C link (Rosati1991Members). The protein includes a long open reading frame (ORF) of 428 residues, with the zinc finger domains suggesting a role in DNA binding (Rosati1991Members).

The ZNF2 protein structure features a finger preceding box (FPB) region, divided into two modules: FPB-A (residues 1-42) and FPB-B (residues 43-65). These modules are encoded by separate exons, with introns strategically positioned within the gene (Rosati1991Members). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in at least two isoforms, cZNF2.1 and cZNF2.2, which differ by the presence of an additional 72 base pairs in cZNF2.1. This additional segment introduces 24 amino acids upstream of the FPB-A module, extending the ORF and incorporating an in-frame ATG codon (Rosati1991Members).

Northern analysis has identified two transcripts of approximately 4,200 and 2,600 nucleotides, indicating the expression of these splice variants in human cell lines (Rosati1991Members). The presence of zinc finger domains and the exon-intron arrangements suggest that the protein's structure is likely influenced by these features, contributing to its functional diversity.
