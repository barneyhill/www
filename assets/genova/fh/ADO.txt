# ADO

## Overview
The ADO gene encodes the enzyme 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase, a non-heme iron enzyme that belongs to the thiol dioxygenase family. This enzyme is integral to the metabolism of sulfur-containing compounds, specifically catalyzing the oxidation of cysteamine to hypotaurine, a precursor to taurine, which is vital for cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative stress (Sarkar2017Understanding; Dominy2007Discovery). Structurally, the ADO protein is characterized by a 'jelly roll' β-barrel typical of the cupin superfamily, with a ferrous iron center at its active site, coordinated by histidine residues and water molecules (Wang2021Crystal). ADO's role extends to the regulation of protein stability through posttranslational modifications, suggesting its function as a conserved oxygen sensor in animals, akin to plant cysteine oxidases (Wang2020Characterization). The enzyme's activity within mitochondria underscores its importance in maintaining cellular redox balance and detoxification processes (Dominy2007Discovery).

## Structure
The human 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO) protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes primary, secondary, and tertiary elements. The primary structure of ADO consists of a sequence rich in proline residues, with 34 prolines accounting for 12.6% of its amino acids, contributing to its structural stability (Wang2021Crystal). The secondary structure features three α-helices and ten β-strands, forming a 'jelly roll' β-barrel, typical of the cupin superfamily (Wang2021Crystal). This β-barrel structure supports the catalytic center of the enzyme.

The tertiary structure of ADO includes a proline-rich hairpin loop at the catalytic entrance, which is conserved among ADOs and plant cysteine oxidases (PCOs) and is crucial for substrate interaction (Wang2021Crystal). The enzyme's active site is characterized by a ferrous iron center coordinated by three histidine residues and three water molecules, forming a typical ligand scaffold for thiol dioxygenases (Wang2021Crystal).

ADO does not form stable quaternary structures due to its tendency to form multiple oligomer states through intramolecular disulfide bonds, which were mitigated in structural studies by mutating surface cysteine residues (Wang2021Crystal). The enzyme also features a Cys-Tyr cofactor, which is autocatalytically generated and plays a role in amplifying enzymatic activities (Wang2020Characterization).

## Function
The ADO gene encodes the enzyme 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase, which plays a critical role in the metabolism of cysteamine, a derivative of the amino acid cysteine. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of cysteamine to hypotaurine, a precursor to taurine, which is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress (Sarkar2017Understanding; Dominy2007Discovery). ADO is a non-heme iron enzyme that functions as a thiol dioxygenase, participating in sulfur metabolism and oxygen homeostasis by oxidizing thiol substrates to sulfinates (Wang2020Characterization).

In healthy human cells, ADO is involved in the regulation of protein stability through the oxidation of N-terminal cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid, a posttranslational modification that influences protein degradation (Wang2020Characterization). This function is analogous to plant cysteine oxidase and suggests ADO's role as a conserved oxygen sensor in animals, affecting cellular responses to hypoxia (Wang2020Characterization). ADO is active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to cellular redox balance and detoxification processes, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative stress (Dominy2007Discovery).

## Interactions
2-Aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO) is known to interact with several proteins, as predicted by the STRING database. ADO interacts with proteins such as CSAD (Cysteine Sulphinic Acid Decarboxylase), CDON (Cell adhesion associated, oncogene-regulated), GAD1 and GAD2 (Glutamate Decarboxylase), which are also known to interact with CDO (Cysteine Dioxygenase) (Sarkar2017Understanding). ADO also interacts with adenosine kinase (ADK), which is involved in the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of adenosine, potentially regulating extracellular adenosine and intracellular adenine nucleotide concentrations. Additionally, ADO interacts with ribose 5-phosphate isomerase A (RPIA), a protein involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and complement component 3 (C3), a crucial protein for the immune system's complement pathway (Sarkar2017Understanding).

The structural features of ADO, such as its open catalytic cavity and specific loops, facilitate interactions with protein substrates, potentially enhancing protein-protein interactions (Wang2021Crystal). The proline-rich regions of ADO, particularly in loops and flexible regions, may also play a role in facilitating protein-protein interactions (Wang2021Crystal). However, specific details about interactions with nucleic acids are not provided in the available context.
