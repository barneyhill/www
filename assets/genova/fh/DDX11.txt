# DDX11

## Overview
DDX11 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD/H-box helicase 11, a member of the super-family 2 (SF2) of DNA helicases. This protein is characterized by its ATP-dependent helicase activity, which unwinds DNA duplexes in a 5' to 3' direction, playing a crucial role in DNA replication, repair, and sister chromatid cohesion. DEAD/H-box helicase 11 contains several conserved domains, including an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster and an Arch domain, which are essential for its function in maintaining genomic stability (van2020Warsaw; Pisani2018Molecular). The protein interacts with various components of the replication machinery, such as the Timeless protein and the cohesin complex, to ensure proper chromosomal cohesion and replication fork progression (Cortone2018Interaction; Pisani2018Molecular). Mutations in the DDX11 gene are linked to Warsaw breakage syndrome, a cohesinopathy characterized by chromosomal instability, and have implications in cancer progression and relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (Zhou2023Mutations; Bottega2021Genomic).

## Structure
The DDX11 protein, also known as DEAD/H-box helicase 11, is characterized by several conserved domains and motifs. It belongs to the super-family 2 (SF2) of DNA helicases and contains an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, a feature common among certain DNA helicases, which is located between the Walker A and B boxes (van2020Warsaw; Pisani2018Molecular). The protein's structure includes two canonical RecA folds forming the catalytic helicase core, and two accessory domains: the Fe-S and the Arch domains. The Arch domain acts as a 'cap' above the RecA domains, potentially playing a role in DNA substrate binding (Pisani2018Molecular).

DDX11 also has a specific insertion upstream of the Fe-S domain, which is less conserved and likely partially unstructured, containing charged residues. This insertion includes a region that interacts with the Timeless protein, crucial for cohesin's stable association with replication forks (Pisani2018Molecular). The protein's helicase activity is ATP-dependent, with a 5′ to 3′ directionality, and it requires a 5′ single-stranded region for helicase loading (Pisani2018Molecular). DDX11 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional domains and structural conformation (Pisani2018Molecular).

## Function
The DDX11 gene encodes a DNA helicase that plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability in human cells. It is involved in several key molecular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and sister chromatid cohesion. DDX11 operates as an ATP-dependent DNA helicase with 5' to 3' directionality, unwinding DNA duplexes to facilitate replication fork progression and maintain genomic integrity (Mahtab2021The; Pisani2018Molecular).

In healthy human cells, DDX11 is essential for sister chromatid cohesion, a function conserved across species. It interacts with the Timeless protein, which is part of the fork-protection complex, to stabilize replication machinery and ensure proper chromosomal cohesion during the cell cycle (Pisani2018Molecular). DDX11 also plays a role in resolving G-quadruplex structures, which are critical for preventing DNA damage and ensuring proper chromatid cohesion (van2020Warsaw).

DDX11 is active in the nucleus, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle, and is involved in the recruitment of heterochromatin protein-1 at chromosomal sites, influencing chromatin structure and epigenetic inheritance (Pisani2018Molecular). It also acts as a positive regulator of ribosomal RNA gene transcription, crucial for ribosome biogenesis and cellular proliferation (Sun2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DDX11 gene are primarily associated with Warsaw breakage syndrome (WABS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. WABS is characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, intellectual disability, hearing loss, and skin pigmentation abnormalities. These clinical features are due to defects in sister chromatid cohesion, leading to chromosomal instability and a typical railroad chromosome structure, classifying WABS as a cohesinopathy (Bottega2021Genomic; van2020Warsaw). Specific mutations such as R263Q, K897del, and p.Leu836Pro have been identified, which impair the helicase activity of DDX11, crucial for DNA unwinding and chromosomal cohesion (Sun2015The; Bottega2021Genomic).

DDX11 mutations have also been linked to increased relapse risk in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with normal cytogenetics. These mutations, particularly germline ones, are associated with a higher cumulative incidence of relapse and worse relapse-free survival (Zhou2023Mutations). Additionally, DDX11 is implicated in various cancers, such as kidney cancer, melanoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, where it is often up-regulated, correlating with poor prognosis or cancer progression (Zhou2023Mutations). The gene's role in maintaining genomic stability suggests that its altered expression or interactions may contribute to oncogenesis.

## Interactions
DDX11, also known as ChlR1, is a DNA helicase that participates in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a vital role in DNA replication and repair processes. It interacts with Timeless, a component of the replication fork-protection complex, through a conserved peptide motif. This interaction is essential for sister chromatid cohesion and the stable association of cohesin with replication forks (Cortone2018Interaction; Pisani2018Molecular). DDX11 also binds to the cohesin complex, facilitating its loading onto chromatin during the S phase, which is crucial for chromosomal cohesion (Cortone2018Interaction).

DDX11 interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), FEN1, and the Ctf18-replication factor C (RFC) complex, suggesting a role in DNA replication and repair (van2020Warsaw; Pisani2018Molecular). It also forms complexes with DNA polymerase delta, aiding in lagging-strand DNA replication (Simon2020The). DDX11's helicase activity is essential for resolving secondary DNA structures at replication sites, which may facilitate sister chromatid entrapment into cohesin rings (van2020Warsaw). These interactions underscore DDX11's role in maintaining genomic stability and coordinating DNA unwinding with synthesis.
