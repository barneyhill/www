# SMPDL3A

## Overview
SMPDL3A is a gene that encodes the protein sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid like 3A, which is a member of the sphingomyelinase family involved in lipid metabolism. This protein functions primarily within the lysosome, where it catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to produce ceramide, a lipid molecule essential for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and facilitating signal transduction (Zhang2022Sphingomyelin). Structurally, the SMPDL3A protein is characterized by a calcineurin-like metallophosphodiesterase domain, which includes a binuclear metal site crucial for its enzymatic activity (Lim2016The). It is a monomeric protein that undergoes post-translational modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation, enhancing its stability (Lim2016The). SMPDL3A is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, colon, and liver, and is regulated by Liver X Receptors (LXRs), indicating its involvement in immune responses and inflammation (Noto2024Analysis). The protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms suggest a broader role in cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis, including cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia (Zhong2023Molecular).

## Structure
The SMPDL3A protein is characterized by a calcineurin-like metallophosphodiesterase domain, which includes a binuclear metal site with two zinc ions crucial for its catalytic activity (Lim2016The). The primary structure of SMPDL3A consists of residues 23-453, with a signal peptide preceding these residues (Lim2016The). Its secondary structure features 12 alpha-helices wrapping around a beta sandwich composed of six beta-strands on each side (Lim2016The). The tertiary structure forms a V-shaped pocket at the active site, which is solvent-accessible and involved in catalysis (Lim2016The).

SMPDL3A is a monomeric protein in solution, as confirmed by multi-angle light scattering data (Lim2016The). It undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation at Asn69, Asn131, Asn263, and Asn356, which contribute to its thermal stability (Lim2016The). Disulfide bonds are also present, enhancing structural integrity (Lim2016The). The protein's structure is similar to other members of the calcineurin-like family, particularly cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, as indicated by a DALI search (Lim2016The). SMPDL3A does not have a saposin domain, distinguishing it from its paralogue, acid sphingomyelinase (Gorelik2016Crystal).

## Function
SMPDL3A (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid like 3A) is a gene encoding a protein that is part of the sphingomyelinase family, involved in lipid metabolism. This protein is primarily active in the lysosome, where it plays a role in the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to produce ceramide, a process crucial for maintaining membrane structure and facilitating signal transduction (Zhang2022Sphingomyelin). SMPDL3A is regulated by Liver X Receptors (LXRs) in a cell-type specific manner, particularly in human monocytes and macrophages, suggesting its involvement in immune responses and inflammation (Noto2024Analysis).

The expression of SMPDL3A is notably high in tissues such as the kidney, colon, placenta, lung, and liver, indicating a potential role in epithelial cells and various physiological processes (Noto2024Analysis). In macrophages, SMPDL3A expression is upregulated by LXR agonists, which may influence cholesterol and lipid metabolism, as well as immune modulation (Noto2024Analysis). The protein's regulation by LXRs and its increased expression in response to cholesterol load suggest a broader function beyond its enzymatic activity, potentially impacting cell differentiation and immunomodulation (Zhang2022Sphingomyelin).

## Clinical Significance
SMPDL3A has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), SMPDL3A is identified as a diagnostic marker, with its expression significantly downregulated in CML samples compared to normal samples. This downregulation is associated with immune cell infiltration and cancer-related signaling pathways, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Zhong2023Molecular). In hepatocellular carcinoma, high expression of SMPDL3A is linked to poor prognosis and promotes cancer growth, indicating its role in tumor progression (Zhong2023Molecular).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), SMPDL3A is significantly upregulated, and higher expression levels are associated with favorable overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Park2020In). The gene's expression is also increased in bladder tumors, although the specific implications of this alteration are not fully detailed (Lim2016The).

SMPDL3A's regulation by Liver X Receptor (LXR) activity in macrophages suggests a role in inflammation and immune response, although the exact clinical implications of this regulation remain to be fully elucidated (Noto2024Analysis). Further research is needed to clarify the gene's role in these and other conditions.

## Interactions
SMPDL3A (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid like 3A) is known to interact with various proteins, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SMPDL3A has been shown to interact with the Enhancer of Rudimentary Homolog (ERH). This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses. The interaction between SMPDL3A and ERH is significant in promoting HCC cell proliferation, as overexpression of SMPDL3A increases cell proliferation, while knockdown of ERH in SMPDL3A-overexpressing cells inhibits this proliferation (Zhang2022Sphingomyelin).

SMPDL3A also exhibits nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity, hydrolyzing nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates, which suggests potential interactions with nucleic acids or nucleotide-related proteins. The enzyme's activity is most stabilized by ATP, indicating a possible interaction with ATP or ATP-binding proteins (Lim2016The).

Additionally, SMPDL3A is regulated by the Liver X Receptor (LXR), which suggests that it may be involved in LXR-mediated pathways, potentially interacting with other LXR target genes or proteins involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol regulation (Noto2024Analysis). These interactions highlight SMPDL3A's role in complex cellular signaling networks.
