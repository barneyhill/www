# YTHDF2

## Overview
YTHDF2 is a gene that encodes the YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein F2, a member of the YTH domain family of proteins. This protein functions as a critical 'reader' of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on RNA, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of mRNA metabolism. YTHDF2 is primarily involved in the degradation of m6A-modified mRNAs, thereby influencing RNA stability and gene expression. The protein achieves this by recruiting the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, which initiates mRNA decay. Structurally, YTHDF2 contains a YTH domain characterized by a unique aromatic cage that facilitates the recognition of m6A modifications. Beyond its fundamental role in mRNA decay, YTHDF2 is implicated in various biological processes, including adipogenesis, neural development, and cellular stress responses. Its dysregulation has been associated with several cancers, where it can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the cellular context (Fang2021EGFR/SRC/ERK-stabilized; Du2016YTHDF2; Chen2023N6-methyladenosine).

## Structure
The YTHDF2 protein contains a YTH domain that is crucial for recognizing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in RNA. The crystal structure of YTHDF2 has been resolved at 2.1 Å resolution, revealing a globular fold with a central core of four-stranded β-sheets surrounded by α helices (Zhu2014Crystal). The YTH domain includes a basic patch and a hydrophobic pocket formed by specific residues, which are essential for RNA recognition. Key residues such as W432 and W486 are involved in m6A recognition, with mutations in these residues reducing m6A-RNA selectivity (Zhu2014Crystal).

The YTH domain of YTHDF2 also features an aromatic cage formed by three tryptophan residues (Trp432, Trp486, and Trp491), which are critical for binding m6A through π-π interactions, cation-π interactions, and hydrogen bonds (Li2014Structure). This arrangement is similar to domains that recognize methylated lysine and arginine, highlighting the specificity of the YTH domain for m6A modifications.

The YTHDF2 protein is part of the YTH domain family, which acts as 'readers' of m6A to regulate mRNA degradation, with a dissociation constant of 1.2 μM for m6A-containing RNA (Li2014Structure).

## Function
YTHDF2 is a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of mRNA metabolism in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the degradation of m6A-modified mRNAs by promoting deadenylation, which is the initial step in mRNA decay. This process is facilitated by the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex through a direct interaction between the N-terminal region of YTHDF2 and the SH domain of CNOT1, a component of the complex (Du2016YTHDF2). YTHDF2's function in mRNA decay is crucial for maintaining RNA stability and regulating gene expression, as it accelerates the decay of its mRNA targets, contributing to proper RNA turnover and cellular function (Zou2023The; Du2016YTHDF2).

In addition to its role in mRNA decay, YTHDF2 is involved in various biological processes, including adipogenesis and neural development. It regulates these processes by degrading specific mRNAs and affecting pathways critical for cell cycle progression and differentiation (Chen2023N6-methyladenosine). YTHDF2 is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for cellular stress responses, differentiation, and development, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting cell differentiation and proliferation (Zou2023The).

## Clinical Significance
YTHDF2 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in m6A RNA methylation, affecting mRNA stability and degradation. In glioblastoma (GBM), YTHDF2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and is necessary for tumor growth and invasion. It is stabilized by the EGFR/SRC/ERK signaling pathway, leading to the repression of target genes like LXRA and HIVEP2, which are involved in cholesterol dysregulation and tumorigenesis (Fang2021EGFR/SRC/ERK-stabilized). 

In liver cancer, YTHDF2 promotes the cancer stem cell phenotype and metastasis by enhancing OCT4 expression through m6A methylation. Its overexpression correlates with poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients (Zhang2020YTHDF2). Conversely, in HCC, YTHDF2 can act as a tumor suppressor by destabilizing EGFR mRNA, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation (Zhong2019YTHDF2).

In lung cancer, YTHDF2 supports tumor growth by enhancing the translation of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase mRNA, crucial for cancer cell metabolism (Sheng2019YTH). In gliomas, YTHDF2 facilitates the decay of UBXN1 mRNA, activating the NF-κB pathway and promoting malignancy (Chai2021YTHDF2). These findings suggest that YTHDF2's role in cancer is complex and context-dependent, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
YTHDF2 is known for its interactions with various RNA modifications and protein complexes. It binds to N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified RNA, facilitating RNA degradation by recruiting the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. This interaction is mediated through the N-terminal region of YTHDF2, which directly interacts with the SH domain of the CNOT1 subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex. This recruitment is crucial for initiating deadenylation and subsequent decay of m6A-containing RNAs (Du2016YTHDF2).

YTHDF2 also interacts with 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in RNA, playing a role in ribosomal RNA maturation. It binds to m5C-bearing RNA, affecting the m5C profile in ribosomal RNA and influencing pre-rRNA processing (Dai2019YTHDF2). Additionally, YTHDF2 can bind to N1-methyladenosine (m1A)-modified RNA, showing a preference for m1A-modified sequences and contributing to transcript destabilization (Seo2019YTHDF2).

These interactions highlight YTHDF2's role in RNA modification recognition and processing, impacting RNA stability and gene expression regulation through its association with various RNA modifications and protein complexes.
