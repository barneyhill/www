# FOXQ1

## Overview
FOXQ1 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box Q1 protein, a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by a conserved forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. The FOXQ1 protein is primarily involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and development, and it has been shown to delay cellular senescence by modulating the expression of SIRT1, a key regulator of longevity and inflammation (Wang2017FOXQ1). FOXQ1 is also implicated in epithelial differentiation, hair development, and gastric acid production (Earley2018Genetic). Clinically, alterations in FOXQ1 expression have been associated with various cancers, including prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis (Han2019MiR4319; Zhang2016Inhibition). As a transcription factor, FOXQ1 interacts with several protein complexes, such as the MLL complex, to regulate gene expression related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and osteogenic differentiation (Mitchell2022FOXQ1; Xiang2020FOXQ1).

## Structure
FOXQ1 is a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a conserved forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain. This domain typically consists of approximately 110 amino acids and forms a helix-turn-helix motif, a structural feature that facilitates DNA binding. The FOXQ1 protein, like other FOX proteins, may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. These modifications can influence the protein's activity and stability, potentially affecting its role in transcriptional regulation. The specific structural details of FOXQ1, including any known splice variant isoforms or additional domains, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The FOXQ1 gene encodes a transcription factor that is part of the forkhead box family, characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain. In healthy human cells, FOXQ1 is involved in regulating several cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. It plays a significant role in delaying cellular senescence by modulating the expression of SIRT1, a key regulator of longevity and inflammation. FOXQ1 increases the mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1, which in turn suppresses the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 through the NF-κB pathway (Wang2017FOXQ1).

FOXQ1 is also implicated in epithelial differentiation and inhibiting smooth muscle differentiation, as well as mediating hair development and controlling gastric acid production in stomach mucous cells (Earley2018Genetic). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression related to these processes. In the context of cellular senescence, FOXQ1 expression is downregulated, and its overexpression can delay senescence, while silencing FOXQ1 leads to premature senescence in human fibroblasts (Wang2017FOXQ1). This regulatory function highlights FOXQ1's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on aging and age-related diseases.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FOXQ1 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In prostate cancer, FOXQ1 is highly expressed, and its inhibition leads to increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. This effect is mediated through the regulation of BCL11A and MDM2 expression, suggesting that targeting FOXQ1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer (Zhang2016Inhibition).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FOXQ1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, including higher tumor stage and venous invasion. FOXQ1 promotes proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cancer stemness. It is a direct target of miR-4319, and overexpression of miR-4319 reduces FOXQ1 expression, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for HCC (Han2019MiR4319; Xia2014Forkhead).

FOXQ1 is also a target of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial in colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Although FOXQ1 is overexpressed in CRC, its expression does not correlate with metastasis or cancer stage, but it serves as a marker for Wnt pathway activation (Christensen2013FOXQ1).

## Interactions
FOXQ1 is known to interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of breast cancer metastasis and osteogenic differentiation. In breast cancer, FOXQ1 recruits the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) complex to activate transcription of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This interaction is facilitated by FOXQ1 binding to the RbBP5 subunit of the MLL core complex. The N-terminal region of FOXQ1's Forkhead domain, specifically between residues 75-142, is critical for this binding. Mutations in this region, such as A129S and I132S, significantly reduce FOXQ1's ability to bind RbBP5, impacting its role in EMT and metastasis (Mitchell2022FOXQ1).

FOXQ1 also interacts with other components of the MLL complex, including WDR5 and ASH2L, which are involved in the regulation of H3K4me3 at gene promoters. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of EMT-related genes (Mitchell2022FOXQ1).

In the context of osteogenic differentiation, FOXQ1 enhances the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by interacting with Annexin A2 (ANXA2). This interaction facilitates the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, promoting the transcriptional activity necessary for osteogenic differentiation (Xiang2020FOXQ1).
