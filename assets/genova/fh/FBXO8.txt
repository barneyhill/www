# FBXO8

## Overview
FBXO8 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 8, a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by the presence of an F-box motif. This protein is a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a system responsible for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. F-box protein 8 plays a pivotal role in modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for controlling inflammatory responses. By inhibiting NF-κB activation, FBXO8 helps regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis. Additionally, FBXO8's interactions with other cellular components, such as Cullin-4 and the ASC-1 complex, suggest its involvement in broader signaling pathways, including MAPK and AP-1, highlighting its potential significance in immune regulation and cellular signaling (georgana2020inhibition).

## Function
FBXO8 (F-box protein 8) is a member of the F-box protein family, characterized by an F-box motif in its N-terminal region and a Sec7 domain in the C-terminal region. It functions as part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination, thereby regulating their activity and stability within the cell (georgana2020inhibition). FBXO8 is involved in the negative regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, a key transcription factor involved in inflammatory responses. It acts at the level or upstream of the IKK complex, inhibiting NF-κB activation and thus controlling the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (georgana2020inhibition).

In healthy human cells, FBXO8 helps maintain balanced inflammatory responses by modulating NF-κB signaling. Its activity is crucial for preventing excessive NF-κB activation, which can lead to heightened inflammatory responses (georgana2020inhibition). FBXO8 also interacts with Cullin-4 and the ASC-1 complex, suggesting a broader role in regulating immune responses and potentially influencing other signaling pathways such as MAPK and AP-1 (georgana2020inhibition).

## Interactions
FBXO8 (F-box protein 8) is involved in forming SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complexes, which function as E3 ubiquitin ligases. The F-box domain of FBXO8 is responsible for binding to SKP1, a crucial interaction for the function of F-box proteins within the SCF complex. This interaction facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, playing a significant role in the ubiquitin pathway (Hundley2021A).

FBXO8 has been identified in studies focusing on the ubiquitin pathway, particularly in the context of mitosis. It is noted for its involvement in resistance phenotypes, such as resistance to the vesicular transport inhibitor brefeldin A. This resistance is linked to the presence of a Sec7-like domain in FBXO8, suggesting a potential role in vesicular transport (Hundley2021A). However, specific details on the physical interactions of FBXO8 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its role in the SCF complex are not extensively documented in the available literature (Hundley2021A).
