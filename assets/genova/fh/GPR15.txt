# GPR15

## Overview
GPR15 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 15, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is primarily involved in immune regulation, particularly in directing the migration of T cells to specific tissues such as the colon and skin. GPR15 functions as a colon-homing receptor, interacting with ligands like C10orf99 and thrombomodulin to mediate immune cell trafficking and endothelial cell protection. It also serves as a co-receptor for certain strains of HIV and SIV, highlighting its role in viral pathogenesis. Clinically, GPR15 is implicated in various conditions, including inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and patient prognosis (Okamoto2023Emerging; Bauer2021The; Namkoong2023GPR15).

## Structure
GPR15 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain structure, typical of class-A GPCRs. The primary structure of GPR15 includes a sequence of amino acids that form these transmembrane helices, which are crucial for its function in signal transduction (Wang2019An). The secondary structure is dominated by these alpha-helical transmembrane segments, which are integral to the receptor's ability to interact with ligands and transduce signals across the cell membrane (Wang2019An).

The tertiary structure of GPR15 involves the folding of these helices into a compact, functional receptor capable of binding ligands. The receptor's structure includes a disulfide bond between Cys106 and Cys183, which contributes to its stability and proper folding (Wang2019An). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the available context, but GPCRs typically function as monomers or dimers.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence GPR15's function, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided. The receptor's structure and function are significant for its role in immune regulation and potential as a target in cancer therapy (Wang2019An).

## Function
GPR15 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in immune homeostasis and inflammation by directing the migration of leukocytes, particularly T cells, to tissues. It functions as a colon-homing receptor for T cells, with its natural ligand being C10orf99, a chemokine-like polypeptide expressed in gastrointestinal tissues (Okamoto2023Emerging). GPR15 is involved in the regulation of innate immunity and the homing of T-cells, particularly in the gut epithelium, where it regulates FOXP3+ regulatory T-cells (Kõks2017Activation). 

In humans, GPR15 is expressed by subsets of memory, regulatory, and effector lymphocytes in the blood, but not on naïve T cells. The ligand for GPR15, known as GPR15L, induces chemotaxis in GPR15-expressing cells, facilitating their migration to specific tissues such as the colon and skin (Ocón2017A). GPR15 activation on endothelial cells has been linked to cytoprotection and pro-angiogenic activity, mediated by the receptor-ligand interaction with soluble thrombomodulin fragments, which activate signaling pathways like ERK and AKT to upregulate anti-apoptotic proteins and prevent capillary leakage (Bauer2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the GPR15 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In colon cancer, reduced expression of GPR15 is associated with poor survival outcomes. Studies have shown that GPR15 deficiency in mouse models leads to increased tumor development and severe inflammation, suggesting a protective role for GPR15 in colitis-associated colon cancer (Namkoong2023GPR15). 

In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, GPR15 is involved in the homing of regulatory T cells to the large intestine. GPR15 deficiency results in reduced Treg numbers, increased inflammation, and higher cytokine production, exacerbating colitis symptoms (Kim2013GPR15Mediated; Kõks2017Activation). 

GPR15 also plays a role in rheumatoid arthritis, where its expression is upregulated in macrophages, monocytes, and T lymphocytes, suggesting involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Okamoto2023Emerging). In cancer, GPR15 expression is significantly downregulated in colon adenocarcinoma and rectal adenocarcinoma, and its expression levels are associated with cancer prognosis, influencing immune responses and potentially serving as a target for cancer therapy (Wang2019An).

## Interactions
GPR15, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacts with several proteins and ligands, playing significant roles in various physiological processes. It serves as a co-receptor for certain strains of HIV and SIV, where the viral envelope protein gp120 binds to GPR15, specifically at the variable loop 3 (V3) region (Bauer2021The). The interaction with gp120 is highly specific, as single amino acid substitutions in V3 can prevent the virus from infecting GPR15+ cells (Bauer2021The).

GPR15 also interacts with endogenous ligands such as C10orf99 and thrombomodulin (TM). C10orf99, a chemokine-like polypeptide, binds to GPR15, influencing immune cell migration and intestinal homeostasis (Okamoto2023Emerging). This interaction is crucial for T cell trafficking to the colon and is modulated by post-translational modifications like tyrosine sulfation (Okamoto2023Emerging; Bauer2021The). Thrombomodulin, particularly its fifth epidermal growth factor-like region (TME5), also binds to GPR15, promoting cytoprotective and pro-angiogenic effects in endothelial cells (Okamoto2023Emerging; Bauer2021The).

Additionally, a fragment of cystatin C can bind to GPR15, inhibiting the entry of GPR15-tropic viruses without activating the receptor (Bauer2021The). These interactions highlight GPR15's diverse roles in immune regulation and disease pathophysiology.
