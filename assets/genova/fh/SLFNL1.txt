# SLFNL1

## Overview
The SLFNL1 gene encodes the protein schlafen-like 1, which is part of the Schlafen family of proteins. These proteins are known for their roles in regulating cell growth and immune responses. Schlafen-like 1 is categorized as a regulatory protein, and it is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of cell cycle progression and differentiation. The gene is expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting a broad functional significance. Research indicates that SLFNL1 may play a role in immune system regulation and has potential implications in cancer biology, although the precise mechanisms remain under investigation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
