# MATN1

## Overview
The MATN1 gene encodes matrilin-1, a multidomain extracellular matrix protein predominantly expressed in cartilage. Matrilin-1 is classified as an adaptor protein due to its role in facilitating interactions between collagen fibrils and other matrix components, contributing to the structural integrity and function of cartilage. The protein is characterized by its two von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domains, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and a coiled-coil oligomerization domain, which enable it to form both homo- and hetero-oligomers, particularly with matrilin-3. These structural features allow matrilin-1 to participate in the assembly of filamentous networks within the extracellular matrix, enhancing its multivalency and ability to connect various ECM components. The gene's involvement in skeletal disorders, such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, underscores its clinical significance (Fresquet2010Structural; Chen2008Promoter; Nicolae2007Abnormal).

## Structure
Matrilin-1, encoded by the MATN1 gene, is a protein primarily expressed in cartilage, where it plays a crucial role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly. The protein is composed of two von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domains, known as M1A1 and M1A2, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and a coiled-coil oligomerization domain (Fresquet2010Structural). The vWFA domains contain metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motifs, which are essential for ligand binding and protein-protein interactions (Fresquet2010Structural; Becker2015Characterization).

The secondary structure of matrilin-1 includes a Rossmann-fold, characterized by a central beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices, typical of vWFA domains (Becker2015Characterization). Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification in matrilin-1, enhancing its thermal stability without affecting its secretion or folding (Fresquet2010Structural). The glycosylation sites are located differently on M1A1 and M1A2, potentially influencing their binding to collagen (Fresquet2010Structural).

Matrilin-1 can form homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with matrilin-3, increasing multivalency and facilitating the connection of various ECM components (Fresquet2010Structural; Wiberg2003Complexes). The coiled-coil domain is responsible for the oligomerization, contributing to the quaternary structure of the protein (Klatt2011The).

## Function
Matrilin-1, encoded by the MATN1 gene, is a multidomain protein that plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). It is predominantly expressed in cartilaginous tissues, where it functions as an adaptor protein, facilitating interactions between collagen fibrils and other matrix components. Matrilin-1 is involved in forming filamentous networks within the ECM, contributing to the structural integrity and function of cartilage (Fresquet2010Structural; Nicolae2007Abnormal).

The protein contains two von Willebrand factor A-domains, which are crucial for its binding to type II and IX collagens. These interactions are essential for the assembly and stability of the cartilage ECM (Fresquet2010Structural). Matrilin-1 also forms disulfide-bonded oligomers with matrilin-3, enhancing multivalency and the ability to connect various ECM components, thereby regulating the organization of macromolecular structures in cartilage (Fresquet2010Structural).

Glycosylation of matrilin-1 A-domains enhances their thermal stability, which may contribute to protein longevity in the ECM. The presence of Zn2+ is essential for the binding of matrilin-1 A-domains to collagen, supporting strong binding interactions that are crucial for maintaining cartilage integrity (Fresquet2010Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the MATN1 gene have been associated with several skeletal disorders. In particular, alterations in MATN1 have been linked to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a condition characterized by an abnormal curvature of the spine. Studies have identified specific polymorphisms, such as rs1149048, in the promoter region of MATN1 that are associated with both susceptibility to AIS and the severity of the condition. Individuals with the GG genotype of rs1149048 tend to develop more severe scoliosis, as indicated by a larger Cobb angle, compared to those with AA or AG genotypes (Chen2008Promoter). 

Additionally, MATN1 polymorphisms have been implicated in class III skeletal malocclusion with mandibular prognathism, particularly in the Deutero-Malay population. Specific polymorphisms in exon 5 of the MATN1 gene have been studied as potential risk factors for this condition (Laviana2021Role). 

Furthermore, MATN1 has been associated with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity (SEMDJL) in the Caucasian Afrikaner community, where novel mutations were identified through whole exome sequencing (Chimusa2018Detecting). These findings suggest that MATN1 plays a significant role in the genetic predisposition to various skeletal disorders.

## Interactions
Matrilin-1 (MATN1) is an extracellular matrix protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, contributing to the structural organization of cartilage. MATN1 forms complexes with collagen VI microfibrils, where it binds to the globular domains at the N termini of collagen VI. This interaction is crucial for connecting collagen VI microfibrils to other matrix components such as collagen II and aggrecan (Wiberg2003Complexes).

MATN1 also interacts with small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans (SRLPs) like biglycan and decorin, facilitating the linkage between collagen VI and other extracellular matrix constituents. These interactions are specific, as MATN1 does not bind to chondroadherin (Wiberg2003Complexes). Additionally, MATN1 is known to bind covalently to aggrecan, forming stable complexes that are resistant to reduction (Wagener2005The).

In cartilage, MATN1 can form hetero-oligomers with matrilin-3, enhancing multivalency and facilitating connections between various extracellular matrix components. This interaction is important for the assembly and organization of the cartilage extracellular matrix (Fresquet2010Structural). The A-domains of MATN1, particularly M1A1 and M1A2, interact with type II and IX collagens, with these interactions being metal ion-dependent, especially requiring Zn2+ (Fresquet2010Structural).
