# CRABP2

## Overview
Cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2) is a gene that encodes a small cytosolic protein involved in the regulation of retinoic acid (RA) signaling, a critical pathway for cell differentiation and proliferation. The CRABP2 protein is categorized as a binding protein, specifically facilitating the transport of RA to the nucleus, where it interacts with retinoic acid receptors (RARs) to modulate gene expression (Dong1999Distinct; Budhu2002Direct). Structurally, CRABP2 is characterized by a β-barrel formation and a hydrophobic pocket that binds RA, undergoing conformational changes upon ligand binding (Kleywegt1994Crystal; Lixa2019Retinoic). Functionally, CRABP2 plays a pivotal role in enhancing the transcriptional activity of RA-responsive genes, influencing cellular processes such as apoptosis and growth inhibition in various tissues (Gyöngyösi2013RDH10; Budhu2002Direct). Its expression and interactions are significant in the context of cancer, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the cellular environment and cancer type (Xiao2014CRABPII; Li2021Expression).

## Structure
CRABP2, or cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2, is a small cytosolic protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of retinoic acid. The primary structure of CRABP2 consists of a polypeptide chain with a sequence of amino acids. Its secondary structure is characterized by 10 antiparallel β-sheets (βA-βJ) arranged in a β-barrel structure, along with an N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif (α1-loop-α2) (Lixa2019Retinoic). The tertiary structure features a hydrophobic pocket that binds retinoic acid, with the ligand-binding site divided into a hydrophobic region and a centrally located polar pocket (Kleywegt1994Crystal; Lixa2019Retinoic).

CRABP2 undergoes significant conformational changes upon binding with all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), leading to rigidification and dimerization, although the primary structure remains largely unchanged (Lixa2019Retinoic). The protein's quaternary structure involves dimerization in the atRA-bound state, forming a homodimer in solution (Lixa2019Retinoic). Post-translational modifications include SUMOylation at residue Lys101, which affects its cellular localization and function (Lixa2019Retinoic). The protein's dynamics are crucial for its function, influencing interactions with downstream partners such as importins and retinoic acid receptors (RARs) (Lixa2019Retinoic).

## Function
CRABP2 (cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2) plays a crucial role in the regulation of retinoic acid (RA) signaling, a derivative of vitamin A essential for cell differentiation and proliferation. CRABP2 binds RA with high affinity in the cytoplasm and facilitates its transport to the nucleus, where it interacts with retinoic acid receptors (RARs) to enhance transcriptional activation of RA-responsive genes (Dong1999Distinct; Budhu2002Direct). This protein is involved in the direct channeling of RA to RAR, forming a short-lived complex that enhances the transcriptional activity of RAR by stabilizing the RA nuclear complex (RANC) (Delva1999Physical; Budhu2002Direct).

CRABP2 is predominantly cytosolic in the absence of RA but translocates to the nucleus upon RA binding, where it associates with RAR to facilitate RA ligation (Budhu2002Direct). This process is particularly important in cells with high RA synthesis or demand, such as mammary carcinoma cells, where CRABP2 enhances sensitivity to RA-induced growth inhibition (Budhu2002Direct). The protein's activity is crucial for modulating RA-mediated differentiation and proliferation in various tissues, including skin and immune cells (Gyöngyösi2013RDH10).

## Clinical Significance
CRABP2 (cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2) is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), CRABP2 is highly expressed, distinguishing malignant from benign pancreatic conditions, and is considered a potential diagnostic marker (Xiao2014CRABPII). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), elevated plasma CRABP2 levels correlate with poorer overall survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Kim2018Plasma). 

CRABP2 expression is also associated with breast, ovarian, and retinoblastoma cancers, often correlating with poor prognosis or higher tumor grade (Kim2018Plasma). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), CRABP2 acts as a tumor suppressor, with lower expression levels linked to poorer outcomes (Li2021Expression). Conversely, in papillary thyroid carcinoma, higher CRABP2 expression is linked to more aggressive tumors, especially in the presence of TERT promoter mutations (Rusinek2020TERT).

CRABP2's role in cancer is complex, as it can both promote and inhibit tumorigenesis depending on the cancer type and context. Its interactions with other proteins, such as FABP5, and involvement in signaling pathways like HIPPO and integrin β1/FAK/ERK, further influence cancer progression and metastasis (Li2021Expression).

## Interactions
CRABP2 interacts with the RNA-binding protein HuR, enhancing HuR's affinity for target mRNAs by more than three orders of magnitude. This interaction is sensitive to retinoic acid (RA), which causes CRABP2 to dissociate from HuR and the target transcripts. However, the complex reforms after a short period, indicating a transient but significant interaction (Vreeland2014Transcript). CRABP2 does not directly bind RNA but stabilizes mRNAs such as Apaf1 and Elavl1 through its cooperation with HuR. This stabilization is crucial for enhancing apoptosis and suppressing carcinoma cell growth (Vreeland2014Transcript).

CRABP2 also interacts with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP26A1, affecting the metabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA). CRABP2 modulates atRA metabolism by inhibiting CYP26A1 and altering its kinetic parameters, suggesting a protein-protein interaction mechanism (Yabut2022CRABPs). Additionally, CRABP2 interacts with retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and undergoes structural changes upon binding atRA, which facilitates its nuclear translocation and interaction with other molecular partners (Lixa2019Retinoic). These interactions highlight CRABP2's role in regulating retinoic acid signaling and its potential impact on cellular processes.
