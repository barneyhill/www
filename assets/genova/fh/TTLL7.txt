# TTLL7

## Overview
TTLL7 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin tyrosine ligase like 7, which is a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family. This protein functions as an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin, specifically through the process of polyglutamylation. Polyglutamylation is a critical modification that influences the stability and function of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. TTLL7 primarily targets β-tubulin, adding polyglutamate chains that can alter the protein's charge and affect its interactions with microtubule-associated proteins and motor proteins. This modification is particularly important in neuronal cells, where TTLL7 plays a role in maintaining proper neuronal function and structure by regulating glutamate concentration in the brain. The activity of TTLL7 is modulated by various factors, including CSAP, which enhances its glutamylation activity, and synthetic inhibitors that target its enzymatic functions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Bompard2018CSAP; Ping2023Tubulin; lliu2015inhibition).

## Function
TTLL7 (tubulin tyrosine ligase like 7) is a protein that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of tubulin through a process known as polyglutamylation. This modification involves the addition of glutamate residues to tubulin, which affects the stability and function of microtubules, essential components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells (Bompard2018CSAP; Ping2023Tubulin). TTLL7 specifically targets β-tubulin, adding polyglutamate chains that increase the negative charge of the protein, potentially altering its affinity for other proteins and influencing interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and motor proteins (Ping2023Tubulin).

In healthy cells, TTLL7 is crucial for maintaining proper neuronal function and structure. It is involved in regulating glutamate concentration in the brain, which is important for neuronal signaling and preventing excitability that could lead to epilepsy-like symptoms (Ping2023Tubulin). The activity of TTLL7 is also regulated by CSAP, which enhances its glutamylation activity, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism that ensures proper microtubule dynamics and neuronal health (Bompard2018CSAP).

## Interactions
TTLL7, a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family, is involved in the polyglutamylation of tubulins, a post-translational modification that affects microtubule dynamics and interactions with other proteins. TTLL7 preferentially binds to polymerized microtubules rather than free β-tubulin, indicating a preference for intact microtubule structures (liu2015inhibition). This enzyme plays a crucial role in the polyglutamylation of β-tubulins, which influences the binding affinity of various microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and motor proteins. For instance, proteins such as KTN1 and p180 show a stronger binding affinity to microtubules that are polyglutamylated by TTLL7 compared to those modified by other enzymes like TTLL4 (Zheng2021ER).

The polyglutamylation activity of TTLL7 is also subject to inhibition by small polypeptides that mimic the tubulin C-terminal tail, suggesting that TTLL7 can interact with truncated substrates (liu2015inhibition). This interaction is significant for the regulation of microtubule stability and function, impacting cellular processes such as intracellular transport and mitosis. The enzyme's activity is further modulated by synthetic inhibitors designed to target its initiation and elongation activities, highlighting its potential as a target for drug development (liu2015inhibition).
