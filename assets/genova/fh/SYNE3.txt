# SYNE3

## Overview
The SYNE3 gene encodes the protein spectrin repeat containing nuclear envelope family member 3, commonly known as nesprin-3. This protein is a critical component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, which plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope and facilitating interactions between the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton. Nesprin-3 is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily localized at the outer nuclear membrane, where it interacts with the cytoskeletal linker protein plectin. This interaction is essential for connecting the nucleus to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton, thereby influencing cellular processes such as nuclear positioning, cell differentiation, and maintaining cellular morphology (Wilhelmsen2005Nesprin3). The gene's expression is highly conserved among mammals, underscoring its evolutionary significance, and it is implicated in various diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer, where its altered expression levels may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Wu2024Expression).

## Structure
The SYNE3 gene encodes the protein nesprin-3, which is a component of the linker of the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton (LINC) complex. This protein is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the nuclear envelope and facilitating interactions between the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton. Nesprin-3 exists in two isoforms: nesprin-3α and nesprin-3β, with nesprin-3α being the dominant isoform. The structure of nesprin-3α includes spectrin repeats, a KASH domain, and a coiled-coil region, which are significant for its function (Liao2020Expression).

The spectrin repeats contribute to the protein's flexibility and ability to interact with other proteins, playing a vital role in linking the nuclear envelope to the cytoskeleton. The KASH domain is involved in anchoring the protein to the nuclear envelope, facilitating its role in the LINC complex. The coiled-coil region likely aids in protein-protein interactions, essential for the structural integrity of the complex (Liao2020Expression).

The SYNE3 gene shows high conservation among mammals, indicating its evolutionary importance, although there is significant variation between humans and zebrafish (Liao2020Expression). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its function. Alternative splicing may result in different isoforms, affecting the protein's structural and functional properties.

## Function
The SYNE3 gene encodes nesprin-3, a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope and facilitating interactions between the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton in healthy human cells. Nesprin-3 is a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, which is essential for nuclear positioning and stability. It is localized at the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) and associates with the cytoskeletal linker protein plectin, linking the nucleus to the intermediate filament (IF) cytoskeleton (Wilhelmsen2005Nesprin3).

Nesprin-3 is involved in various cellular processes, including nuclear migration, cell differentiation, and maintaining cellular morphology. It is expressed in multiple tissues, with strong expression in breast and lung epithelial cells, indicating its role in cellular structure and function (Wu2024Expression; Liao2020Expression). The protein's interaction with plectin and its presence in the LINC complex suggest its involvement in transmitting mechanical forces and maintaining cellular tone (Wu2024Expression). Nesprin-3's function in linking the nuclear envelope to the cytoskeleton is vital for normal cellular processes and may influence cell division and differentiation (Wilhelmsen2005Nesprin3).

## Clinical Significance
The SYNE3 gene, also known as Spectrin Repeat Containing Nuclear Envelope Family Member 3, has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SYNE3 expression is significantly lower compared to normal lung tissues, and this reduced expression is negatively correlated with tumor size, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression (Wu2024Expression). The study by Yunxi Wu highlights that SYNE3 may have an inhibitory role in NSCLC and could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Wu2024Expression).

SYNE3 is also involved in the NEAT1/SATB1-miR-330-3p/miR-149-5p-SYNE3 signaling pathway, which regulates nuclear functions and transcription. This pathway can promote tumor cell apoptosis by affecting the cell cycle and recruiting immune cells, indicating its role in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2024Expression). The expression of SYNE3 is influenced by factors such as smoking history and gender, with lower expression observed in male patients and those with a smoking history, suggesting a sex-specific role in tumorigenesis (Wu2024Expression).

## Interactions
SYNE3, also known as nesprin-3, is a protein that plays a significant role in linking the nucleus to the cytoskeleton. It is a novel outer nuclear membrane protein that interacts with the cytoskeletal linker protein plectin. This interaction is crucial for connecting the nucleus to the intermediate filament (IF) cytoskeleton. Nesprin-3 binds specifically to the actin-binding domain (ABD) of plectin, allowing plectin's plakin repeats to associate with the IF system (Wilhelmsen2005Nesprin3). This binding is specific, as nesprin-3 does not interact with the ABDs of other proteins like dystrophin, α-actinin-1, and filamin-A and -B (Wilhelmsen2005Nesprin3).

Nesprin-3 has two splice variants, nesprin-3α and nesprin-3β, with nesprin-3α being the predominant form that strongly interacts with plectin. The first spectrin repeat of nesprin-3α is critical for high-affinity binding to plectin, termed the plakin-binding domain (Wilhelmsen2005Nesprin3). This interaction suggests a structural linkage from the nucleus to the extracellular matrix through the IF cytoskeleton, potentially involving integrin α6β4 at hemidesmosomes (Wilhelmsen2005Nesprin3). The competitive binding dynamics between nesprin-3, actin filaments, and plectin highlight its role in cellular organization and nuclear positioning (Wilhelmsen2005Nesprin3).
