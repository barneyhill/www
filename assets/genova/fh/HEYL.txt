# HEYL

## Overview
HEYL is a gene that encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, known as hes related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif like. This protein is a member of the hairy/enhancer-of-split-related family and functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor. It plays a significant role in various biological processes, including the regulation of cell fate decisions, proliferation, and differentiation, particularly as a downstream target of the Notch signaling pathway. HEYL is involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state of neural stem cells, promoting epithelial integrity, and contributing to cardiovascular development. The protein's structure is characterized by a bHLH domain, a nuclear localization sequence, and a nuclear export sequence, along with distinct repression domains and a YRPW motif, which are crucial for its function. HEYL's interactions with other proteins, such as forming heterodimers with other Hes and Hey family members and acting as a corepressor of the androgen receptor, underscore its role in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in various cellular processes (Noguchi2019Cellautonomous; Lavery2011Repression; Heisig2012Target).

## Structure
HEYL is a transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, characterized by a bHLH domain that facilitates DNA binding and dimerization (Heisig2012Target). The protein consists of 328 amino acids and shows high sequence similarity to HEY1 (Lavery2011Repression). HEYL contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) at amino acids 42-51, which is crucial for its nuclear import, and a nuclear export sequence (NES) at amino acids 132-155, which is involved in nuclear export (Lavery2011Repression). 

HEYL has two distinct repression domains: an N-terminal HDAC-independent domain and a C-terminal domain, which includes conserved motifs like YHSW (Lavery2011Repression). The C-terminal domain (residues 165-328) is primarily responsible for repressing androgen receptor (AR) activity (Lavery2011Repression). The Orange domain, unique to the bHLH-Orange family, is present but does not appear to be involved in repression (Lavery2011Repression). 

HEYL also contains a YRPW motif, which is crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor (Heisig2012Target). The protein's repressive activity is largely HDAC-independent, differing from other family members like HEY1 (Lavery2011Repression).

## Function
The HEYL gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, primarily acting as a transcriptional repressor. HEYL is a downstream target of the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell fate decisions, proliferation, and differentiation in multiple tissues (Heisig2012Target). In the nervous system, HEYL plays a significant role in maintaining the undifferentiated state of human fetal neural stem cells (hfNSCs) by inhibiting neuronal differentiation. This is achieved through its expression in SOX2-positive cells and its absence in CTIP2-positive cells, indicating its role in repressing neuronal differentiation markers while promoting undifferentiated markers (Hirano2016LSD1).

In the context of airway epithelial cells, HEYL is involved in the differentiation of basal cells into club cells, a process regulated by NOTCH3 signaling. Knockdown of HEYL results in impaired club cell differentiation and reduced epithelial integrity, highlighting its importance in maintaining epithelial structure and function (Bodas2021The). HEYL also participates in cardiovascular development, where it is involved in the formation of the ventricular septum and valve development, demonstrating its role in embryonic development and organogenesis (Heisig2012Target).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HEYL gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal and breast cancer. In colorectal cancer, high levels of HEYL expression are associated with decreased overall survival and an increased presence of distant metastasis, particularly in patients classified as AJCC stage IV. This suggests that HEYL may play a role in promoting metastasis formation in colorectal cancer (Weber2019The). In breast cancer, HEYL is overexpressed in both tumor epithelial and endothelial cells, contributing to neoangiogenesis and tumor growth. This overexpression is linked to increased tumor vessel density and faster tumor progression. Targeting HEYL-induced angiogenic factors, along with VEGF, has shown potential in improving therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer treatment (Han2021HEYL).

In cardiovascular development, the combined loss of HEYL and its related gene Hey1 leads to severe congenital heart defects, such as ventricular septal defects and dysplastic atrioventricular valves. These defects are attributed to impaired epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a critical process for heart development (Heisig2012Target; Fischer2007Combined). The redundancy and overlapping functions of HEY family proteins, including HEYL, are crucial for normal cardiac morphogenesis.

## Interactions
HEYL, a member of the hairy/enhancer-of-split-related family of transcription factors, participates in various protein interactions that influence its function. HEYL can form heterodimers with other Hes and Hey family proteins, such as Hes1, Hes5, Hey1, and Hey2, as well as homodimers with itself. These interactions are facilitated through their basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domains, Orange domains, or tetrapeptide motifs (Jalali2011HeyL). In muscle stem cells, HEYL forms a heterodimer with Hes1, which enhances its DNA-binding capability, particularly to the cis-element of Hey1 and E-box sequences, contributing to its role in maintaining muscle stem cells in an undifferentiated state (Noguchi2019Cellautonomous).

HEYL also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), acting as a potent corepressor. It binds to the AR's N-terminal transactivation domain, inhibiting AR activity by competing with coactivators like SRC1e. This interaction reduces androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell growth and represses AR-regulated genes (Lavery2011Repression). These interactions highlight HEYL's role in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in various cellular processes.
