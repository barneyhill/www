# USP17L22

## Overview
USP17L22 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 22, which is part of the ubiquitin-specific peptidase family. This protein functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme, playing a critical role in the regulation of protein stability by removing ubiquitin moieties from target proteins. One of its key interactions is with hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), where it modulates the stability and function of HAS2 by preventing its degradation through the proteasome pathway. This interaction is particularly significant during the G2/M and mitosis phases of the cell cycle, indicating a role in cell cycle regulation and hyaluronan production (Mehić2017The). The activity of USP17L22 is crucial for maintaining cellular processes related to protein stability and cell cycle progression.

## Structure


## Function


## Interactions
USP17L22, a member of the ubiquitin-specific peptidase family, interacts with hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) to modulate its stability and function. The USP17L22 isoform efficiently removes polyubiquitination from HAS2, which is associated with protein degradation in proteasomes. This deubiquitination process stabilizes HAS2, significantly extending its half-life from approximately 5 hours to 36 hours when co-expressed with USP17L22 (Mehić2017The). The interaction between USP17L22 and HAS2 is crucial for the stability of HAS2, suggesting a specific role of USP17L22 in regulating HAS2 degradation pathways (Mehić2017The).

USP17L22 is also involved in cell cycle regulation, with its interaction with HAS2 being abundant during the G2/M and mitosis phases. This interaction is cell cycle-dependent, highlighting the role of USP17L22 in cell cycle progression and hyaluronan production (Mehić2017The). The catalytic activity of USP17L22 is essential for the deubiquitination of HAS2, although it is not necessary for the interaction itself (Mehić2017The). These interactions suggest that USP17L22 plays a significant role in cellular processes related to protein stability and cell cycle regulation.
