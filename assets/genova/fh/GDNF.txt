# GDNF

## Overview
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, characterized by a cystine-knot motif. The GDNF protein plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system, particularly in the survival and differentiation of various neuronal populations, including dopaminergic neurons, which are crucial for motor control (Paratcha2008GDNF; Sariola2003Novel). As a neurotrophic factor, GDNF functions by forming a complex with the GFRα1 receptor and the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, activating intracellular signaling pathways that influence neuronal survival and plasticity (Sariola2003Novel). Additionally, GDNF can signal independently of RET through interactions with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), affecting synapse formation and neuronal connectivity (Paratcha2008GDNF). Beyond its neural functions, GDNF is involved in non-neural processes such as kidney morphogenesis and spermatogonial differentiation, underscoring its diverse biological roles (Sariola2003Novel).

## Structure
The GDNF protein is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily and is characterized by a cystine-knot motif, which is crucial for its stability and function (Grimm1998Analysis). The primary structure of GDNF includes a signal peptide and a mature peptide, with the mature protein encoded by a single exon (Grimm1998Analysis). The secondary structure of GDNF consists of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming two long fingers made of anti-parallel β-strands connected by loops, a cystine-knot core motif, and an α-helical heel region (Wang2013Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, the GDNF protein forms a covalent homodimer, a common quaternary structure for this family of proteins. The two monomers are arranged in a 'hand-shake' like head-to-tail orientation, with the helices from the heel region flanking the cystine-knot motifs at the center (Wang2013Structural). The GDNF homodimer is more bent compared to other family members like ARTN, due to differences in the hinge angle between the finger and heel regions (Wang2013Structural).

GDNF undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, which are essential for its function (Grimm1998Analysis). The protein also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functions (Airavaara2011Identification).

## Function
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a critical protein involved in the survival, maintenance, and development of various neuronal populations in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It was initially identified as a survival factor for midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which are crucial for motor control and are affected in Parkinson's disease (Paratcha2008GDNF; Sariola2003Novel). GDNF supports the survival and differentiation of motoneurons and other peripheral neurons, including sympathetic, parasympathetic, sensory, and enteric neurons (Sariola2003Novel).

GDNF functions by binding to the GFRα1 receptor, forming a complex with the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, which activates several intracellular signaling pathways. These pathways include the MAP kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase Cγ (PLC-γ) pathways, which are involved in various cellular functions such as neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity (Sariola2003Novel). GDNF can also signal independently of RET through the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), influencing synapse formation and neuronal connectivity (Paratcha2008GDNF).

Beyond the nervous system, GDNF acts as a morphogen in kidney development, promoting ureteric branching, and regulates spermatogonial differentiation in the testis (Sariola2003Novel). Its role in these processes highlights its importance in both neural and non-neural tissues, contributing to the organismal outcomes of development and regeneration.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GDNF gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), genetic variations in the GDNF promoter can affect its expression and modify the severity of the disease. Specific mutations at positions -613 and -232 in the GDNF promoter have been shown to influence transcription levels, potentially impacting HSCR severity in animal models (Huang2016Genetic).

GDNF is also associated with neurological conditions. It plays a crucial role in the survival and function of dopamine neurons, and its deficiency is linked to Parkinson's disease, where it can prevent dopamine neuron death and promote recovery in animal models (Airaksinen2002The). In epilepsy, defects in GDNF signaling pathways are implicated in seizure susceptibility (Ibáñez2017Biology).

In psychiatric disorders, GDNF levels are altered in conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Decreased circulating GDNF levels have been observed in depression, while increased levels are noted in schizophrenia (Ibáñez2017Biology). Additionally, GDNF gene variations have been linked to medullary sponge kidney (MSK) disease, suggesting a role in renal development and function (Torregrossa2010Identification).

## Interactions
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) interacts with several proteins to form functional complexes that are crucial for its biological activity. GDNF forms a ternary complex with the GDNF family receptor alpha 1 (GFRα1) and the RET tyrosine kinase receptor. This complex is essential for GDNF-induced signaling, which promotes neuronal survival and differentiation. The interaction between GFRα1 and GDNF is direct and necessary for stimulating RET, with specific regions of GFRα1 and GDNF involved in binding (Amoresano2005Direct).

GDNF also interacts with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) to induce neurite outgrowth, independent of RET. This interaction involves the Ig3 module of NCAM and a specific region in GDNF known as the heel region. The Gliafin peptide, derived from this region, can mimic GDNF's effects on NCAM, promoting neurite outgrowth (Nielsen2009Role).

In addition to these interactions, GDNF can engage in RET-independent signaling pathways. It can promote cell adhesion through GFRα1 without RET involvement, potentially involving other transmembrane receptors or mechanisms like ligand-induced cell adhesion (Ibáñez2020RETindependent).
