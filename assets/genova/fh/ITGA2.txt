# ITGA2

## Overview
The ITGA2 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 2, a critical component of the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules. This gene is responsible for producing a transmembrane protein that pairs with the beta 1 subunit to form the integrin α2β1 complex, which plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. The integrin α2β1 complex is primarily involved in interactions with extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and laminin, facilitating processes like tissue regeneration, angiogenesis, and immune cell regulation (AdornoCruz2019Regulation). The ITGA2 gene is expressed in various cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells, and is implicated in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, such as cancer progression and metastasis (AdornoCruz2019Regulation; Adorno-Cruz2021ITGA2). The integrin α2 subunit contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS motif), essential for its ligand-binding capabilities, which are crucial for initiating intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cellular dynamics (AdornoCruz2019Regulation).

## Structure
The ITGA2 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 2, which is part of the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules. The primary structure of ITGA2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein's backbone. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of ITGA2 is characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail (AdornoCruz2019Regulation).

In its quaternary structure, ITGA2 pairs with the beta 1 subunit to form the integrin α2β1 complex, which is crucial for cell adhesion and signaling. This complex contains specific domains, such as the Von Willebrand factor type A domain (or I domain) in the extracellular head, which is responsible for ligand binding. The I domain is essential for recognizing ligands, primarily occurring at the α subunit (AdornoCruz2019Regulation). The α2 subunit also features a metal ion-dependent adhesion site known as the MIDAS motif, which is critical for ligand binding and is cation-dependent (AdornoCruz2019Regulation).

Common post-translational modifications of ITGA2 include glycosylation, which can affect the protein's function and interactions. These structural features enable ITGA2 to play a significant role in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling.

## Function
The ITGA2 gene encodes the integrin alpha-2 subunit, which pairs with the beta-1 subunit to form the integrin α2β1 complex. This integrin is a crucial cell adhesion molecule involved in maintaining the integrity of the cytoskeletal-extracellular matrix (ECM) linkage. It is widely distributed in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, blood cells, and epithelial cells, playing significant roles in cell adhesion, motility, angiogenesis, and immune cell regulation (AdornoCruz2019Regulation; Chin2015Regulation).

In healthy human cells, integrin α2β1 primarily functions as a receptor for collagen and laminin, facilitating cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is essential for processes such as tissue regeneration, repair, and angiogenesis, where it modulates endothelial cell adhesion and migration, impacting blood vessel formation (AdornoCruz2019Regulation). Integrin α2β1 also plays a role in platelet adhesion to collagen, influencing platelet aggregation and immune cell functions like mast cell activation and T cell regulation (AdornoCruz2019Regulation).

The integrin α2 subunit contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS motif) necessary for ligand binding, which is cation-dependent. This binding initiates signaling cascades that regulate cytoskeletal organization, cellular motility, and other cellular processes (AdornoCruz2019Regulation). Integrin α2 is also a marker for mesenchymal stem cells and is highly expressed in certain progenitor cells, contributing to their differentiation and function (AdornoCruz2019Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in ITGA2 expression have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ITGA2 acts as an oncogenic promoter of metastasis and cancer stemness. High ITGA2 expression is associated with poor relapse-free survival in basal-like breast cancer, and its knockdown reduces lung metastasis and mammosphere formation, indicating its role in promoting cancer progression (Adorno-Cruz2021ITGA2). In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), ITGA2 is upregulated and correlates with poor prognosis, promoting cell growth and invasion in collagen-rich environments (Rattanasinchai2022Elevated). 

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high ITGA2 expression is linked to poor survival outcomes and is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role in tumor growth and metastasis (Zhang2023SDC1). In prostate cancer, ITGA2 expression is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, with decreased methylation leading to increased expression and enhanced migratory capacity of cancer cells (Chin2015Regulation). 

Contrastingly, in some contexts, ITGA2 acts as a metastasis suppressor. In breast and prostate cancer, loss of ITGA2 expression is associated with increased metastasis and decreased survival, highlighting its complex role in cancer biology (Ramirez2011The).

## Interactions
ITGA2, or integrin subunit alpha 2, forms a heterodimer with the beta 1 subunit to create the integrin α2β1 complex, which is involved in various protein interactions. This integrin primarily binds to extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and laminin, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion and signaling (AdornoCruz2019Regulation). ITGA2 also interacts with proteoglycans like decorin and perlecan, which modulate its function in angiogenesis. Decorin enhances ITGA2-dependent endothelial cell adhesion and migration, while perlecan's fragment endorepellin inhibits angiogenesis by interacting with ITGA2 and VEGFR2 (AdornoCruz2019Regulation).

In the context of cancer, ITGA2 is involved in protein-protein interactions that influence tumor progression. For instance, in liver carcinoma, ITGA2 interacts with proteins such as ITGA1, ITGB2, FLT4, LAMB1, and AGRN, as identified through protein-protein interaction analysis (Zhang2018Is). In pancreatic cancer, ITGA2 is coexpressed with UCA1 and targets the expression of miR-107 through the focal adhesion pathway, indicating a regulatory network involving these molecules (Gong2018Coexpression). These interactions highlight ITGA2's role in cellular processes like migration, adhesion, and signaling, which are critical in both normal physiological and pathological contexts.
