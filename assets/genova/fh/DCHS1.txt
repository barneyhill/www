# DCHS1

## Overview
DCHS1 (dachsous cadherin-related 1) is a gene that encodes a large atypical cadherin protein, which is integral to cell adhesion and signaling processes. The protein, characterized by its 27 cadherin repeat domains, is a member of the cadherin superfamily and plays a pivotal role in maintaining planar cell polarity and tissue architecture. DCHS1 interacts with the FAT4 protein to regulate polarized cell behaviors, which are essential for proper tissue and organ development, including skeletal morphogenesis and gut development. The protein's function is modulated by calcium-dependent interactions and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. Mutations in the DCHS1 gene have been linked to several genetic disorders, including Van Maldergem Syndrome and severe microtia-atresia, highlighting its significance in developmental biology and disease (Medina2023Structure; Meijuan2024Dachsous; Sotos2017A).

## Structure
The DCHS1 gene encodes a large atypical cadherin protein involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The protein contains 27 cadherin repeat domains, which are characteristic of the cadherin superfamily and are crucial for its function in cell-cell adhesion (Meijuan2024Dachsous). These cadherin repeats form the primary structure of the protein, with each repeat contributing to the overall stability and function of the protein through calcium-dependent interactions (Medina2023Structure).

The secondary structure of DCHS1 includes beta-sheets typical of cadherin proteins, which help form the cadherin folds necessary for its adhesive properties (Wang2019Identification). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these repeats into a compact domain, allowing for specific interactions with other proteins, such as Fat4, to regulate cell polarity and growth (Medina2023Structure).

DCHS1's quaternary structure is characterized by its ability to form heterophilic interactions with Fat4, creating a complex that is essential for maintaining planar cell polarity (Medina2023Structure). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can modulate its interaction with Fat4 and affect its binding affinity (Medina2023Structure). The presence of splice variant isoforms of DCHS1 suggests a level of functional diversity, although specific details on these isoforms are not extensively covered in the available literature (Tripathi2024Contributions).

## Function
DCHS1 (dachsous cadherin-related 1) is a calcium-dependent adhesion membrane protein that plays a significant role in cell-cell adhesion and the regulation of planar cell polarity. It is involved in various molecular processes essential for the development and maintenance of tissue architecture in mammals. DCHS1 contains a single peptide, 27 cadherin repeat domains, and a unique cytoplasmic region, which contribute to its function in cell adhesion and signaling (Meijuan2024Dachsous).

In healthy human cells, DCHS1 is crucial for regulating cell movements such as convergence-extension and cell migration, which are vital for proper tissue formation and organ development. It also influences tissue proliferation and stem cell activity by regulating the YAP/TAZ pathway independently of the Hippo kinase cascade (Meijuan2024Dachsous). The FAT4-DCHS1 signaling axis is particularly important in gut development, ensuring proper vilification and mesenchymal clustering (Meijuan2024Dachsous).

DCHS1, in conjunction with the Fat4 gene, regulates polarized cell behaviors during skeletal morphogenesis, particularly in the development of the sternum. This regulation is essential for establishing cell polarity, which is necessary for proper skeletal development and the formation of the sternum's shape and dimensions (Mao2016Dchs1–Fat4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DCHS1 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, most notably Van Maldergem Syndrome (VMS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. VMS is characterized by intellectual disability, craniofacial anomalies, auditory malformations, and skeletal and limb malformations. The syndrome is linked to disruptions in the DCHS1-FAT4 signaling pathway, which affects neuronal migration and brain development, leading to conditions such as periventricular neuronal heterotopia (ZwavelingSoonawala2017Clues; Sotos2017A).

DCHS1 mutations have also been implicated in severe microtia-atresia, a condition affecting ear development. A specific mutation, c.481C > T, p.R161C, in DCHS1 has been identified as potentially deleterious, impacting the cadherin 2 domain crucial for cell-cell interactions (Wang2019Identification).

Additionally, DCHS1 is considered a candidate gene for pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS), a condition that can lead to hormonal deficiencies and other developmental anomalies. This association is due to the gene's role in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis development (Lodge2020Requirement; ZwavelingSoonawala2017Clues). The gene's involvement in these conditions underscores its critical role in developmental processes and its potential impact when mutated.

## Interactions
DCHS1 (dachsous cadherin-related 1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions, primarily with FAT4, another member of the cadherin superfamily. The interaction between DCHS1 and FAT4 is crucial for regulating planar cell polarity and tissue morphogenesis. The binding between these proteins involves a head-to-tail arrangement across their extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, specifically Fat4(EC1) with Dchs1(EC4), Fat4(EC2) with Dchs1(EC3), and Fat4(EC4) with Dchs1(EC1). The Fat4(EC4):Dchs1(EC1) interface is characterized by a hydrophobic cluster, while the Fat4(EC1):Dchs1(EC4) interface is less hydrophobic due to a salt bridge formed by an arginine residue (Medina2023Structure).

Mutations in these domains can significantly affect binding affinity. For instance, the R297A mutation in Dchs1(EC2) reduces binding to nearly undetectable levels, highlighting the importance of specific residues in maintaining the interaction (Medina2023Structure). DCHS1 also interacts with other proteins, as identified through bioinformatics tools like BioGRID and STRING, which have revealed interactions with proteins such as LIX1L, PCDHGB1, and DYRK1A (Meijuan2024Dachsous). These interactions suggest a role for DCHS1 in various biological processes, including the Wnt signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer (Meijuan2024Dachsous).
