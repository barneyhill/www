# RBM8A

## Overview
RBM8A is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 8A (Y14), a crucial component of the exon junction complex (EJC), which is involved in various aspects of RNA processing, including splicing, export, and surveillance. The Y14 protein is characterized by an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal arginine/serine (RS) repeat-containing region, which are essential for its function and interactions with other proteins and RNA. These structural features enable Y14 to participate in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and other cellular processes that ensure RNA stability and proper gene expression. RBM8A is implicated in critical biological functions such as cell cycle progression and neural development, and its dysregulation is associated with several diseases, including Thrombocytopenia with Absent Radii (TAR) syndrome, neurodevelopmental disorders, and various cancers (McSweeney2020Full; Tatsuno2018Cterminal; Zou2015A).

## Structure
The RBM8A gene encodes the Y14 protein, which is a component of the exon junction complex (EJC) and plays a crucial role in RNA processing. The Y14 protein is characterized by several structural features, including an RNA recognition motif (RRM) that is essential for its RNA binding capability and interaction with MAGOH, forming a heterodimer that is a core component of the EJC (Tatsuno2018Cterminal; Monteiro2022ThrombocytopeniaAbsent). 

The protein also contains a C-terminal short arginine/serine (RS) repeat-containing region, which is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and methylation. These modifications are crucial for the protein's function and localization, influencing its distribution between the nucleoplasm and nucleoli (Tatsuno2018Cterminal). Phosphorylation of the RS domain is mediated by the SRPK protein kinase family, while dephosphorylation is modulated by protein phosphatase PP1 (Tatsuno2018Cterminal).

The RS repeats in Y14 are involved in protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, and they play roles in splicing activation and histone binding (Tatsuno2018Cterminal). The N-terminal localization signal of Y14 is sufficient for nuclear localization, but the C-terminal RS repeat-containing region provides additional regulatory signals (Tatsuno2018Cterminal).

## Function
RBM8A is a critical component of the exon junction complex (EJC), which plays a significant role in RNA processing, including splicing, export, and surveillance. In healthy human cells, RBM8A is involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a mechanism that degrades mRNAs with premature stop codons, thus preventing the production of faulty proteins (McSweeney2020Full; Zou2015A). The EJC, including RBM8A, helps distinguish premature termination codons from normal stop codons, ensuring RNA stability and proper gene expression (McSweeney2020Full).

RBM8A is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing cell cycle progression and neural development. It regulates the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, maintaining a balance crucial for proper cortical development (Zou2015A; McSweeney2020Full). In the context of neurogenesis, RBM8A is essential for the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of both excitatory and interneuron progenitor cells during embryonic brain development (Asthana2022The).

RBM8A also interacts with various cellular pathways, including the STAT-3 cancer target pathway, indicating its involvement in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation (Asthana2022The). Its role in mRNA processing and cell cycle regulation highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RBM8A gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Thrombocytopenia with Absent Radii (TAR) syndrome is a notable condition caused by compound inheritance of a rare null allele and low-frequency regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RBM8A. This results in reduced transcription of the gene, leading to Y14 insufficiency and defects in the exon-junction complex (EJC), which are implicated in the syndrome's characteristic low platelet counts and skeletal abnormalities (Kocere2023Rbm8a; Albers2012Compound).

RBM8A is also linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Altered expression of RBM8A affects neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, with overexpression promoting proliferation and knockdown leading to premature differentiation. These changes are associated with various neurological conditions, including microcephaly and agenesis of the corpus callosum (Zou2015A).

In cancer, RBM8A overexpression is observed in hepatocellular carcinoma and glioblastoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Its role in regulating pathways like the Notch/STAT3 and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Lin2019Expression; Martin2022Diverse).

## Interactions
RBM8A, a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC), participates in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It associates with other EJC components such as Aly/REF, RNPS1, and Magoh, and is involved in mRNA export and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) processes. RBM8A binds to mRNA 20-24 nucleotides upstream of a spliced exon-exon junction, playing a role in spliced mRNA nuclear export and NMD of mRNAs with premature stop codons (Sutherland2004RNA).

RBM8A forms a specific complex with the protein Magoh, which remains associated with cytoplasmic spliced mRNA, serving as a splicing memory. This complex is involved in the active transport of EJC-tagged mRNA through the nuclear pore complex, facilitated by interactions with the nuclear export factor TAP and Magoh. If the mRNA is not targeted for NMD, the RBM8A-Magoh complex is released during translation and translocated back into the nucleus, mediated by importin 13 (Sutherland2004RNA).

In glioblastoma, RBM8A interacts with the Notch/STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and invasion. It regulates the transcriptional activity of C promoter-binding factor 1 (CBF1), which interacts with the Notch1 receptor to activate the pathway (Lin2021RBM8A).
