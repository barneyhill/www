# KDM4C

## Overview
KDM4C is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 4C, a member of the KDM4 family of histone demethylases. This protein is characterized by its ability to demethylate specific lysine residues on histone proteins, particularly histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9) and lysine 36 (H3K36), which plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure (Lee2021Histone). The protein contains several functional domains, including the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, as well as Jumonji N (JmjN), tandem plant homeodomain (PHD), and tandem Tudor domains that facilitate chromatin localization and interaction with methylated histones (Upadhyay2018Targeting). KDM4C is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, and its dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gregory2013Natural; Zeng2023KDM4C).

## Structure
KDM4C, also known as lysine demethylase 4C, is a member of the KDM4 family of histone demethylases, characterized by its Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is crucial for its demethylase activity. The protein also contains a Jumonji N (JmjN) domain, a tandem plant homeodomain (PHD), and a tandem Tudor domain, which are involved in chromatin localization and enzymatic function (Lee2021Histone; Upadhyay2018Targeting). The tandem Tudor domains are particularly important for binding specific lysine methylation marks on histone proteins (Upadhyay2018Targeting).

KDM4C is involved in the demethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9) and lysine 36 (H3K36), which plays a significant role in regulating gene expression (Lee2021Histone). The protein's structure includes regions that are targeted by peptide-based inhibitors, which bind to less conserved areas on the surface, offering potential for selective inhibition (Leurs2014Substrate). The protein sequence used in studies corresponds to Uniprot ID: Q9H3R0, human KDM4C, isoform 1, indicating the presence of different isoforms that may affect its activity and interactions (Su2016Reader).

## Function
KDM4C, a histone demethylase, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by demethylating trimethylated lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3) to dimethylated forms (H3K9me2), which is associated with transcriptional activation. This activity influences chromatin structure and promotes the expression of genes involved in cell growth, such as proto-oncogenes and those regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis (Gregory2013Natural). KDM4C is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to target gene promoters, facilitating increased gene expression and cell proliferation (Gregory2013Natural).

In healthy human cells, KDM4C expression levels correlate with cell proliferation rates and cell cycle progression, with higher expression leading to faster cell growth and more cells in the S, G2, and M phases (Gregory2013Natural). The enzyme's activity is regulated by genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the KDM4C gene, which affect its expression levels and enhancer activity (Gregory2013Natural). KDM4C's role in gene regulation is significant across different cell types, including fibroblasts and B cells, where it acts as a positive regulator of gene expression (Gregory2013Natural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the KDM4C gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KDM4C is overexpressed, promoting cell growth, proliferation, and migration. Silencing KDM4C in HCC cells impairs the G2/M checkpoint, increases radiation-induced DNA damage, and enhances radiosensitivity, partly through the upregulation of the chemokine CXCL2 (Zeng2023KDM4C).

In breast cancer, particularly aggressive basal-like subtypes, KDM4C is significantly amplified and overexpressed. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and transformation in non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. KDM4C's role in breast cancer is further highlighted by its interaction with HIF-1a, contributing to drug resistance and aggressive cancer phenotypes (Holowatyj2015Abstract; Varghese2021KDM4).

A novel germline variant in KDM4C, specifically the p.H217R mutation, has been linked to a multi-cancer phenotype in a family with a history of early-onset cancers, including papillary thyroid carcinoma and chondrosarcoma. This variant affects histone modification and gene expression, suggesting a gain-of-function effect that may contribute to cancer susceptibility (Katainen2021Novel).

## Interactions
KDM4C, a lysine demethylase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence gene expression and chromatin dynamics. In B cells, KDM4C forms complexes with NF-κB, specifically the RELA subunit, to regulate gene expression in response to T follicular helper cell signals. This interaction is crucial for the activation and proliferation of B cells, as KDM4C, along with KDM4A, targets genes like WDR5, which is involved in histone methylation (Hung2018The).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), KDM4C interacts with oncogenic fusion proteins such as MOZ-TIF2 and MLL fusions, including MLL-GAS7 and MLL-AF9. These interactions facilitate the removal of repressive H3K9 methylation marks, maintaining an open chromatin state for gene expression. KDM4C's interaction with PRMT1 is also significant in AML, as they co-regulate transcriptional pathways critical for leukemogenesis (Cheung2016Targeting).

In glioblastoma, KDM4C interacts with the transcription factor TCF4 and β-catenin within the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes, contributing to tumorigenesis. KDM4C also binds to the c-Myc promoter, enhancing its expression, and interacts with p53, demethylating it to inhibit its pro-apoptotic functions (Lee2021Histone; Chen2020WntInduced).
