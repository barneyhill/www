# SCYL1

## Overview
SCYL1 is a gene that encodes the SCY1 like pseudokinase 1 protein, which is a member of the pseudokinase family. Despite its kinase-like domain, SCYL1 lacks catalytic activity, classifying it as a pseudokinase (Burman2008Scyl1; Schmidt2007Mutation). The protein is characterized by its involvement in intracellular trafficking, particularly in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus and facilitating COPI-mediated retrograde transport between the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Burman2008Scyl1). SCYL1 is localized primarily to the cis-Golgi and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), where it acts as a scaffold protein, linking these compartments and playing a crucial role in protein transport and cellular homeostasis (Burman2008Scyl1; KaeserPebernard2022mTORC1). Mutations in the SCYL1 gene have been associated with various neurodegenerative and developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both cellular and organismal functions (Pelletier2012An; Amano2020SCYL1).

## Structure
The SCYL1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains an N-terminal kinase-like domain, although it is catalytically inactive, classifying it as a pseudokinase (Burman2008Scyl1; Schmidt2007Mutation). The protein also features a C-terminal region with three Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, PR65/A, TOR (HEAT) repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Burman2008Scyl1; Schmidt2007Mutation). Additionally, SCYL1 has a coiled-coil domain, which contributes to its structural stability and potential for oligomerization (Burman2008Scyl1; Burman2010Scyl1).

SCYL1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation. Notably, mTORC1 phosphorylates SCYL1 at the Ser754 site, which is crucial for its localization and function in maintaining Golgi architecture (KaeserPebernard2022mTORC1). Arginine methylation at the C-terminal is also essential for its interaction with γ2-COP, a component of the COPI coat (Amano2020SCYL1).

The protein is known to oligomerize via its central HEAT repeats, suggesting a quaternary structure that facilitates its role as a scaffold protein linking Golgi and ERGIC compartments (KaeserPebernard2022mTORC1). SCYL1 does not exhibit measurable kinase activity despite its kinase-like domain (KaeserPebernard2022mTORC1).

## Function
The SCYL1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining Golgi apparatus structure and function, which is essential for intracellular trafficking and protein transport. SCYL1 is involved in COPI-mediated retrograde transport, facilitating the movement of proteins from the Golgi back to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Burman2008Scyl1). It interacts with components of the COPI coat, such as αCOP, βCOP, and β'COP, through motifs that are crucial for the retrieval of ER-resident proteins (Burman2008Scyl1). SCYL1 is predominantly localized to the cis-Golgi and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), indicating its role in early Golgi functions (Burman2008Scyl1).

SCYL1 also plays a role in neuronal development by interacting with γ2-COP to form COPI vesicles, which are vital for Golgi organization and axon outgrowth (Amano2020SCYL1). The protein is phosphorylated by mTORC1, which regulates its localization and function in vesicular transport (KaeserPebernard2022mTORC1). SCYL1's involvement in these processes is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein distribution, impacting both cellular and organismal functions (Burman2008Scyl1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCYL1 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative and developmental disorders. SCYL1 mutations have been linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 21 (SCA21), a condition characterized by progressive ataxia and motor dysfunction (Burman2008Scyl1). SCYL1 deficiency in mice leads to a progressive motor neuron disorder with features similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), including neurogenic atrophy, axonal degeneration, and lower motor neuron loss (Pelletier2012An). This disorder is associated with the mislocalization of TDP-43, a protein linked to neurodegenerative diseases (Pelletier2012An).

SCYL1 variants are also implicated in CALFAN syndrome, which involves chronic liver disease, hepatomegaly, and neurodegeneration. These variants lead to Golgi fragmentation and altered COPI vesicle distribution, affecting organ morphology and function (Amano2020SCYL1; KaeserPebernard2022mTORC1). Additionally, SCYL1 mutations can result in skeletal anomalies, such as short stature and lumbar lordosis (Amano2020SCYL1).

Alterations in SCYL1 expression or function can disrupt Golgi morphology and protein trafficking, contributing to neurodegenerative conditions and developmental abnormalities (Burman2010Scyl1; KaeserPebernard2022mTORC1).

## Interactions
SCYL1 (SCY1 like pseudokinase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. SCYL1 interacts with components of the COPI coat complex, including αCOP, βCOP, and β'COP, which are essential for COPI-mediated retrograde trafficking between the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (Burman2008Scyl1). This interaction is mediated through a motif similar to the KKXX-COO⁻ motif found in ER-resident proteins, specifically an RKLD-COO⁻ sequence in SCYL1 (Burman2008Scyl1).

SCYL1 is also a target of mTORC1, which phosphorylates SCYL1 at Ser754, a modification necessary for its localization at the Golgi and proper vesicular transport (KaeserPebernard2022mTORC1). This phosphorylation supports SCYL1's role in maintaining Golgi structure and function by promoting COPI-coated vesicle-mediated retrograde transport (KaeserPebernard2022mTORC1).

Additionally, SCYL1 interacts with the SLO-2 potassium channel, facilitating its physiological functions. This interaction is conserved across species, indicating a broader regulatory mechanism (Niu2020Slo2). SCYL1 also binds to SCYL1-BP1, which can interact with MDM2, promoting its self-ubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Yan2010A).
