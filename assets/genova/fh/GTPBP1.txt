# GTPBP1

## Overview
GTPBP1 is a gene that encodes the GTP binding protein 1, a member of the GTPase family, which plays a significant role in mRNA turnover and protein synthesis. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, a function that is crucial for its involvement in mRNA decay and translation processes. GTP binding protein 1 interacts with the exosome complex and RNA-binding proteins, facilitating the degradation of specific mRNAs and modulating mRNA stability. It also participates in translation by delivering aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site, although its efficiency in this role is less than that of other elongation factors, potentially leading to ribosome stalling and activation of mRNA surveillance mechanisms. The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and is implicated in maintaining neuronal homeostasis, with its deficiency linked to neurodegenerative processes. Additionally, GTPBP1 is involved in immune responses, as its expression is upregulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (Zinoviev2018Functions; Terrey2020GTPBP1; Woo2011Modulation).

## Structure
GTPBP1 is a GTPase with a primary structure that is highly conserved between humans and mice, showing 97% identity at the amino acid level (Senju2000Immunocytochemical). It contains three elongation-factor-Tu (EF-Tu)-like GTP-binding domains, one in the N-terminal region and two in the C-terminal region (Woo2011Modulation). The N-terminal GTP-binding domain includes conserved amino acid residues similar to those found in other small and large G proteins, such as the dynamin superfamily (Woo2011Modulation). 

GTPBP1's structure is related to elongation factor 1α (eEF-1α) and elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), which are key components of protein synthesis machinery in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, respectively (Senju2000Immunocytochemical). The protein is capable of GTP binding and has GTPase activity, which are essential for its function in mRNA stability and interaction with hnRNPs and the exosome (Woo2011Modulation). 

The full-length GTPBP1 is necessary for complete GTP binding and GTPase activity, indicating that the structural integrity of the protein is crucial for its function (Woo2011Modulation). The protein's interaction with guanine nucleotides is significantly increased by aminoacylated initiator and elongator tRNAs (Zinoviev2018Functions).

## Function
GTPBP1 (GTP binding protein 1) is a GTPase involved in mRNA turnover and protein synthesis in human cells. It plays a critical role in mRNA decay by interacting with the exosome complex and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), facilitating the degradation of specific mRNAs. GTPBP1 modulates mRNA stability by destabilizing interactions between RBPs and the cytoplasmic exosome, thereby accelerating mRNA decay when overexpressed and stabilizing it when reduced (Woo2011Modulation). 

GTPBP1 also participates in translation processes, where it exhibits elongation activity similar to eEF1A, delivering aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site. However, its role in elongation is less efficient, potentially causing ribosome stalling and enabling mRNA surveillance and quality control mechanisms (Zinoviev2018Functions). 

In addition to its role in mRNA turnover and translation, GTPBP1 is involved in maintaining neuronal homeostasis by resolving paused ribosomes. Its deficiency can activate the integrated stress response (ISR), leading to neurodegeneration (Terrey2020GTPBP1). GTPBP1 is most abundant in the brain and its levels increase in response to IFN-γ, suggesting a role in innate immunity (Zinoviev2018Functions).

## Clinical Significance
GTPBP1 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in the expression of GTPBP1 have been associated with cancer progression. The GTPBP family, including GTPBP1, is differentially expressed in various cancers and is linked to cancer prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Hu2022Pancancer). GTPBP1 is also involved in the progression of Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL), where it is identified as a gene with significant expression changes, indicating its potential role as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Zarei2022Integration).

In addition to its role in cancer, GTPBP1 is involved in mRNA surveillance and ribosome-associated quality control. It has been shown to stimulate exosomal degradation of mRNAs engaged in 80S elongation complexes, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zinoviev2018Functions). Although the context does not directly link GTPBP1 to specific neurodegenerative diseases, its involvement in RNA metabolism and cellular stress pathways suggests a potential connection to conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease, as alterations in these pathways are known to contribute to such disorders. However, further research is needed to clarify these associations.

## Interactions
GTPBP1 interacts with guanine nucleotides and aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA), with its GTP-binding activity significantly enhanced by the presence of aa-tRNA, particularly elongator tRNAs. This interaction stabilizes the binding by reducing the dissociation rate, similar to yeast eEF1A (Zinoviev2018Functions). GTPBP1 can form ternary complexes with GTP and aa-tRNA, delivering aa-tRNAs to the A site and promoting elongation. It also interacts strongly with deacylated tRNA, delivering it to the A site, unlike other translational GTPases (Zinoviev2018Functions).

GTPBP1 is involved in mRNA turnover by interacting with the exosome and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). It binds directly to the exosome component Rrp4p and hnRNP Q, acting as a bridge between the exosome and hnRNPs on mRNAs targeted for degradation (Woo2011Modulation). GTPBP1's interaction with hnRNPs is crucial for regulating mRNA degradation, as mutations in its GTP-binding domain affect its ability to bind hnRNP Q and reduce mRNA decay rates (Woo2011Modulation). GTPBP1 also interacts with AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' UTRs of certain mRNAs, such as TNF-α, influencing mRNA stability through its GTP-bound state (Woo2011Modulation).
