# UMAD1

## Overview
UMAD1 (UBAP1-MVB12-associated domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, specifically within the ESCRT-I complex. The protein, also referred to as UBAP1, is integral to the multivesicular body (MVB) sorting of ubiquitinated cargo, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as receptor down-regulation, mitotic spindle maintenance, cytokinesis, and viral budding. UBAP1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with endosomes, and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell signaling. Mutations and alterations in the expression of UMAD1 have been linked to various diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia, rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease, and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, highlighting its clinical significance (Imbert2017A; Furukawa2021Biomarkers; Thomsen2017Genomewide; Wunderley2013The).

## Function
The UMAD1 (UBAP1-MVB12-associated domain containing 1) protein, also known as UBAP1, plays a critical role in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, specifically within the ESCRT-I complex. This complex is essential for the multivesicular body (MVB) sorting of ubiquitinated cargo, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is crucial for receptor down-regulation and degradation in the lysosome (Wunderley2013The). UBAP1 is selectively incorporated into the ESCRT-I complex with VPS37A, a process that requires both the minimal ESCRT-I binding region and a neighboring predicted helix, ensuring the functional specialization of the ESCRT-I complex (Wunderley2013The).

UBAP1's role extends beyond MVB sorting, as it is involved in other cellular processes such as mitotic spindle maintenance, cytokinesis, and viral budding, indicating its broad significance in cell biology (Wunderley2013The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with endosomes, and contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell signaling (Imbert2017A). The depletion of UBAP1 disrupts ubiquitin-dependent sorting at the MVB, highlighting its specific role in this pathway (Wunderley2013The).

## Clinical Significance
The UMAD1 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its mutations and alterations in expression levels. In the context of neurological disorders, UMAD1 is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), a condition linked to its significant expression in the brain, particularly the cerebellum. This expression pattern suggests that the pathogenicity of UMAD1 might be related to ataxia phenotypes, although specific clinical significance of UMAD1 mutations in these disorders is not fully established (Suroliya2023Computational; Suroliya2024Identifying).

In the realm of interstitial lung diseases, a single nucleotide variant (SNV) in the RPA3-UMAD1 gene, rs12702634, has been identified as significantly associated with rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) through a Japanese genome-wide association study (GWAS) (Furukawa2021Biomarkers).

Additionally, UMAD1 has been linked to monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) and its potential progression to multiple myeloma (MM). A genome-wide association study identified SNPs associated with MGUS, including rs10251201, which is mapped to UMAD1, suggesting a possible regulatory role in these conditions (Thomsen2017Genomewide).
