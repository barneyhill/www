# NAP1L1

## Overview
NAP1L1 (nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 1) is a gene that encodes a histone chaperone protein involved in chromatin assembly and remodeling. The NAP1L1 protein plays a critical role in the assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes, which are essential for DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation. It is characterized by a conserved NAP domain, which facilitates its interaction with histone proteins, particularly the H2A-H2B dimers, and is crucial for its function in chromatin dynamics (Park2006Structure; Andrews2010The). NAP1L1 is involved in various cellular processes, including modulating p53 acetylation and enhancing chromatin remodeling activities, which are vital for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression (Lee2017NAP1L1; Tanaka2019Nucleosome). Additionally, NAP1L1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, where its expression levels correlate with tumor progression and prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2021NAP1L1; Shen2022NAP1L1).

## Structure
NAP1L1 is a nucleosome assembly protein characterized by a conserved NAP domain, which is essential for histone binding and nucleosome assembly (Park2006Structure). The protein consists of 391 amino acids and includes three acidic domains, a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence, a long N-terminal sequence with a conserved NAP domain, and a C-terminal acidic domain (Gupta2016KSHV). The C-terminal region is highly conserved among the NAP-family of histone chaperones, suggesting its importance in histone interactions (Gupta2016KSHV).

The NAP domain is characterized by a dome-shaped architecture formed by a dimerization helix and an alpha-beta domain in each monomer, which is crucial for its function as a histone chaperone (Park2006Structure). The acidic C-terminal domain, although mostly unstructured, contributes to histone binding (Park2006Structure). NAP1L1 also contains nuclear import and export sequences, facilitating its role in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Park2006Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence NAP1L1's function and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided (Park2006Structure). NAP1L1 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional roles in chromatin assembly and remodeling (Park2006Structure).

## Function
NAP1L1 (nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 1) functions as a histone chaperone involved in chromatin assembly and disassembly, playing a crucial role in nucleosome formation. It facilitates the proper assembly of histones onto DNA, which is essential for DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation (Park2006Structure; Andrews2010The). NAP1L1 interacts with histone H2A-H2B dimers to assemble nucleosomes, suggesting its role in de novo chromatin assembly (Gupta2016KSHV). It also promotes nucleosome sliding, which is vital for chromatin dynamics and gene expression regulation (Çevik2017Hepatitis).

In the context of cell biology, NAP1L1 modulates p53 acetylation, influencing cell fate decisions. It interacts with transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 and core histones, forming a multicomponent complex that regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis by controlling the expression of p53-responsive genes (Tanaka2019Nucleosome). NAP1L1 is active in the nucleus, where it enhances the chromatin remodeling activity of Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler essential for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision DNA repair (Lee2017NAP1L1). By decreasing the binding of CSB to DNA and promoting the dissociation of DNA-bound CSB, NAP1L1 helps maintain dynamic CSB-DNA interactions, crucial for efficient DNA repair and transcription regulation (Lee2017NAP1L1).

## Clinical Significance
NAP1L1 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers due to its role as a tumor promoter. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NAP1L1 is upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis. It promotes tumor growth by recruiting hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and interacting with c-Jun, a transcription factor that induces cell cycle factors, thereby facilitating cell proliferation (Zhang2021NAP1L1; Shen2022NAP1L1). In ovarian cancer, high NAP1L1 expression is associated with reduced survival rates, and its knockdown leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for poor prognosis (Xiaohua2022NAP1L1).

In pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, NAP1L1 is overexpressed and contributes to tumor proliferation by inhibiting the tumor suppressor gene p57 Kip2 through promoter methylation. This process is linked to the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation (Schimmack2014A). In breast cancer, NAP1L1 interacts with HDGF to recruit c-Jun, promoting cancer growth by upregulating CCND1, a cell cycle promoter (Liu2021NAP1L1). These findings suggest that NAP1L1's expression and interactions are significant in cancer pathogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
NAP1L1 (nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in chromatin assembly and regulation. It interacts with the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), facilitating nucleosome assembly on newly replicated viral DNA. This interaction is specific to the N-terminal domain of LANA and the acidic domain of NAP1L1, and is essential for viral DNA replication and transcription regulation (Gupta2016KSHV).

NAP1L1 also interacts with histone proteins, particularly the H2A-H2B heterodimer and its variants, playing a role in their transport and deposition onto chromatin. It co-purifies with histone variants such as H2A.X and macroH2A1.2, indicating its involvement in histone dynamics (Okuwaki2009Functional).

In the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, NAP1L1 binds to the NS3 protein, suggesting a role in the viral life cycle, particularly in virus entry (Yin2018NAP1L1).

NAP1L1 also interacts with DGKζ, a diacylglycerol kinase isozyme, influencing its subcellular localization by affecting its interaction with importins, which are responsible for nuclear import (Okada2011Interaction). These interactions highlight NAP1L1's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and viral pathogenesis.
