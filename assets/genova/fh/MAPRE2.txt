# MAPRE2

## Overview
MAPRE2, or microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, a critical component of cellular structure and function. The protein, also known as EB2, is categorized as a microtubule plus-end tracking protein, which plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as mitotic progression, cell motility, and differentiation. EB2 features a calponin homology (CH) domain that facilitates its binding to microtubule plus ends, thereby influencing microtubule stability and organization (Isrie2015Mutations; Thues2021MAPRE2). The gene's expression and mutations have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and congenital disorders, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Kleeff2009The; Feng2020A).

## Structure
MAPRE2, also known as EB2, is a member of the microtubule-associated protein family and features a calponin homology (CH) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with microtubules (Isrie2015Mutations; Thues2021MAPRE2). This domain is responsible for binding to microtubule plus ends, playing a significant role in microtubule dynamics and reorganization during cell differentiation (Isrie2015Mutations). The CH domain's interaction with microtubules is enhanced in certain MAPRE2 mutations, which increase the protein's dwell time at microtubule plus ends (Isrie2015Mutations).

The primary structure of MAPRE2 includes specific residues such as Asn68, which is conserved across the MAPRE family, indicating its structural and functional importance (Thues2021MAPRE2). The N68S mutation affects protein stability by altering hydrogen bonding, specifically with Tyr75, and increases the aggregation propensity of a strong aggregation-prone region (APR) within the protein (Thues2021MAPRE2).

The tertiary structure of MAPRE2 is not fully elucidated, but a homology model based on MAPRE1 suggests structural similarities within the CH domain (Thues2021MAPRE2). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence MAPRE2's interactions with other proteins, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided. Splice variants of MAPRE2 can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and localization (Kleeff2009The).

## Function
MAPRE2, a member of the microtubule plus-end tracking proteins, plays a significant role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which is crucial for various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, MAPRE2 is involved in the regulation of focal adhesion (FA) turnover, a process essential for cell motility. Microtubules grow towards FAs and promote their turnover at the cell periphery, facilitating cell movement. MAPRE2 acts as an adaptor, recruiting signaling molecules to microtubule ends and interacting with proteins like MAP4K4 and HAX1 in the FA turnover complex. This interaction influences processes such as wound healing and cell motility (Thues2021MAPRE2).

MAPRE2 is also involved in mitotic progression and the reorganization of microtubules during early apical-basal differentiation in epithelial cells. The calponin homology domain of MAPRE2 is crucial for its function, as it tracks and interacts with the plus-end tip of growing microtubules (Thues2021MAPRE2). In the context of cranial neural crest cells, MAPRE2 is essential for proper migration, which is critical for normal craniofacial development. Mutations in MAPRE2 can lead to altered migration dynamics, affecting craniofacial morphology (Thues2021MAPRE2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAPRE2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In pancreatic cancer, MAPRE2 expression is significantly increased in cells with high nerve invasion potential, contributing to perineural invasion, a characteristic feature of this cancer that is associated with pain and local recurrence. High MAPRE2 mRNA levels in pancreatic cancer tissues are correlated with reduced postoperative survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kleeff2009The).

MAPRE2 mutations are also associated with congenital symmetric circumferential skin creases type 2 (CSCSC2), a condition characterized by ringed skin creases, intellectual disability, and facial dysmorphism. A specific de novo missense variant, p.Arg173Gln, has been identified as pathogenic, likely disrupting microtubule binding (Feng2020A). Similarly, mutations in MAPRE2 have been linked to circumferential skin creases Kunze type (CSC-KT), affecting microtubule dynamics and craniofacial development (Isrie2015Mutations).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, MAPRE2 expression is modulated by circAGFG1 and miR-4306 interactions, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Zhang2021CircAGFG1).

## Interactions
MAPRE2, also known as EB2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in microtubule dynamics and cellular processes. EB2 interacts with EB1, another member of the microtubule end-binding protein family, facilitating the shift of EB1 from plus-end to lattice association, which increases microtubule stability (Goldspink2013The). This interaction is important for the recruitment of ACF7, a protein that co-aligns microtubules and actin filaments, suggesting a role in stabilizing microtubules and facilitating their organization during epithelial differentiation (Goldspink2013The).

EB2 also interacts with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene product, similar to other EB family proteins, indicating its involvement in microtubule function and mitotic spindle formation (Su2001Characterization). The interaction with APC and other proteins like CLIP-170 and p150Glued suggests that EB2 plays a role in intracellular transport and maintaining cell structure.

Mutations in the calponin-homology (CH) domain of MAPRE2 enhance its binding to microtubules, which may affect its interactions with other proteins and influence microtubule reorganization during epithelial differentiation (Isrie2015Mutations). These interactions highlight the importance of MAPRE2 in cellular dynamics and structural integrity.
