# HIRIP3

## Overview
HIRIP3, or HIRA interacting protein 3, is a gene located on the short arm of chromosome 16 that encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein involved in chromatin dynamics and histone metabolism. The HIRIP3 protein is characterized as a histone chaperone, playing a crucial role in nucleosome assembly and chromatin structure maintenance by interacting with core histones, particularly H2A and H2B, to form dimer complexes (Ignatyeva2024Identification). It is heavily phosphorylated by the serine-threonine kinase CK2, which influences its function in chromatin-related processes (Assrir2007HIRIP3). The protein's interaction with the HIRA complex suggests its involvement in chromatin assembly and gene expression regulation, as well as participation in DNA repair pathways such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (Lorain1998Core; Ignatyeva2024Identification). HIRIP3's role in chromatin dynamics and its association with various clinical conditions, including congenital malformations, autism spectrum disorders, and cancer, highlight its significance in cellular and developmental processes (Lin2018Intrauterine; Ryczek20235’; AvdjievaTzavella2012Detection).

## Structure
The HIRIP3 protein is a 556-amino-acid mammalian protein located on the short arm of chromosome 16, consisting of seven exons (Assrir2007HIRIP3; Ignatyeva2024Identification). It is highly charged, with 20.1% acidic and 21.1% basic residues, and has a basic isoelectric point of 8.7 (Assrir2007HIRIP3; Ignatyeva2024Identification). The protein features a glutamic-acid-rich region in its N-terminal and a polyserine region centrally, which may serve as a phosphorylation site (Ignatyeva2024Identification). The C-terminus contains a CHZ motif, conserved from yeast to humans, crucial for interaction with histone H2A.Z (Ignatyeva2024Identification).

HIRIP3 is heavily phosphorylated, with CK2 kinase identified as a key phosphorylating enzyme (Assrir2007HIRIP3). The protein interacts with core histones H2A, H2B, and H3, forming complexes that suggest a role in chromatin dynamics (Lorain1998Core; Ignatyeva2024Identification). The interaction with histones is mediated by the CHZ motif, with residues 403-527 identified as the minimal domain necessary for full-affinity binding to H2A/H2B dimers (Ignatyeva2024Identification). The protein's apparent molecular weight is larger than predicted, possibly due to its highly charged nature or post-translational modifications (Assrir2007HIRIP3).

## Function
HIRIP3 (HIRA interacting protein 3) is a histone chaperone involved in chromatin dynamics and histone metabolism in healthy human cells. It primarily functions by interacting with H2A and H2B histones, forming H2A/H2B dimer complexes, which are crucial for nucleosome assembly and chromatin structure maintenance (Ignatyeva2024Identification). HIRIP3 is associated with the CK2 kinase, which phosphorylates H2A at serine 1, influencing histone specificity and potentially affecting chromatin-related processes (Ignatyeva2024Identification).

In the nucleus, HIRIP3 forms complexes with nucleosomal core histones and the FACT complex, suggesting a role in histone metabolism and chromatin remodeling (Ignatyeva2024Identification). It is involved in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway, indicating its participation in DNA repair processes (Ignatyeva2024Identification). HIRIP3's interaction with the HIRA complex suggests a role in chromatin assembly and gene expression regulation (Lorain1998Core).

HIRIP3 is mainly nuclear, scattered throughout the nucleus except in nucleoli during interphase, and is concentrated in mitotic spindles during metaphase and midbody junctions at telophase, indicating its involvement in cell division (Ignatyeva2024Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The HIRIP3 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation. Alterations in HIRIP3 expression or mutations can contribute to congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. Haploinsufficiency of HIRIP3 might result in these malformations, although this hypothesis requires further investigation (Lin2018Intrauterine). 

HIRIP3 is also associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The 16p11.2 microdeletion, which includes the HIRIP3 gene, is one of the most common recurrent genomic disorders linked to autism. This microdeletion is noted for its significant developmental implications, although the specific role of HIRIP3 within this context remains to be fully elucidated (Freitag2009Genetics; AvdjievaTzavella2012Detection).

In cancer research, HIRIP3 has been linked to breast cancer. It interacts with the HIRA histone chaperone, which is associated with breast cancer promotion. The expression of HIRIP3 is significantly higher in breast cancer cells compared to non-cancerous cells, suggesting its involvement in maintaining open chromatin and normal gene transcription, which may contribute to cancer development (Ryczek20235’). 

Overall, while HIRIP3 is implicated in various conditions, further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance and the mechanisms by which it contributes to these diseases.

## Interactions
HIRIP3 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that interacts with several proteins and histones, playing a role in chromatin dynamics. It interacts with the HIRA protein, a histone chaperone involved in chromatin assembly and remodeling, suggesting a role in histone metabolism (Assrir2007HIRIP3; Lorain1998Core). HIRIP3 binds to core histones H2B and H3, but not to H2A and H4, in the absence of HIRA, indicating a potential complex formation with HIRA that directly interacts with these histones (Lorain1998Core).

HIRIP3 also interacts with the serine-threonine kinase CK2, serving as a substrate for phosphorylation. This interaction involves both the catalytic (CK2a) and regulatory (CK2b) subunits of CK2, and HIRIP3 is heavily phosphorylated by CK2, which may influence its function in chromatin metabolism (Assrir2007HIRIP3).

In HeLa cells, HIRIP3 forms a complex with CK2 and the four nucleosomal core histones, suggesting its involvement in histone chaperoning and chromatin-associated processes. It interacts with H2A/H2B dimers, facilitated by its CHZ domain, which is crucial for this interaction (Ignatyeva2024Identification). HIRIP3's interaction with histones and CK2 suggests a role in chromatin dynamics and possibly DNA repair pathways (Ignatyeva2024Identification).
