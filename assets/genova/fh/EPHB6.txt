# EPHB6

## Overview
EPHB6 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor B6, a member of the Eph receptor family, which are receptor tyrosine kinases involved in various cellular processes. Unlike most Eph receptors, EPH receptor B6 is characterized by its lack of intrinsic kinase activity due to a mutation in its kinase domain, which distinguishes it from other members of the family (Luo2002EphB6). Despite this, EPH receptor B6 plays a crucial role in cell signaling, particularly in the immune system, where it is involved in T cell activation and function (Luo2002EphB6). The receptor is predominantly expressed on T cells and is known to enhance T cell responses by modulating the threshold for T cell receptor activation (Luo2002EphB6). Structurally, EPH receptor B6 includes a ligand-binding domain and fibronectin-type-3 domains, which contribute to its interactions with ephrin ligands and other proteins, influencing cellular responses such as motility and invasion (Mason2021Structure; Strozen2021The). EPHB6's involvement in various signaling pathways and its interactions with other Eph receptors underscore its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer and blood pressure regulation (Mason2021Structure; Luo2012Receptor).

## Structure
The EPHB6 receptor is a member of the Eph receptor family, characterized by its atypical structure due to the lack of kinase activity. The molecular structure of the EPHB6 receptor ectodomain (ECD) was determined using X-ray crystallography, revealing a resolution of 3 Å (Mason2021Structure). The EPHB6 ECD shares structural similarities with EphA2 and EphA4, with root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) values of 3.803 Å and 4.412 Å, respectively, indicating both similarities and differences (Mason2021Structure).

The EPHB6 ECD includes a ligand-binding domain and two fibronectin-type-3 (FN3) domains. The N-terminal FN3 domain adopts an immunoglobulin-like fold, while the C-terminal FN3 domain is not clearly visible, suggesting flexibility (Mason2021Structure). Unique structural features include an 11-serine insert in the J-K loop and a serine-rich motif in the H-I loop, which may influence ligand binding and receptor interactions (Mason2021Structure). The first FN domain of EPHB6 has a seven-residue insertion, differing from other Eph receptors, potentially affecting oligomerization (Mason2021Structure).

The molecular surface of EPHB6 is predominantly neutral with some negatively charged regions, and the structure includes β-strands, random coils, and disulfide bridges, similar to A-class receptors (Mason2021Structure). EPHB6 is kinase-inactive and may rely on other Eph receptors for signaling, with the FN loop potentially involved in receptor interactions (Mason2021Structure).

## Function
EPHB6 (EPH receptor B6) is a member of the Eph receptor family, which are receptor tyrosine kinases involved in cell signaling. Despite lacking intrinsic kinase activity due to a mutation in its kinase domain, EPHB6 plays a significant role in T cell activation and function. It is predominantly expressed on T cells in peripheral blood and is upregulated after culture (Luo2002EphB6). EPHB6 enhances T cell responses by lowering the threshold for T cell receptor (TCR) activation, facilitating T cell proliferation and lymphokine production, such as IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β, TNF-α, and GM-CSF (Luo2002EphB6).

EPHB6 is involved in the TCR signaling pathway, where it aggregates and colocalizes with TCR upon stimulation, enhancing TCR signaling and leading to p38 MAPK activation (Luo2002EphB6). It also associates with adaptor proteins like Cbl, Grb2, and CrkL, potentially interacting with other signaling pathways (Luo2002EphB6). EPHB6's role in T cell costimulation is crucial for effective immune responses, as demonstrated by compromised T cell function in EphB6-null mice (Luo2004EphB6null). Despite its kinase inactivity, EPHB6 interacts with kinase-active Eph receptors, influencing signaling outcomes in various biological contexts (Mason2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EPHB6 gene have been implicated in various cancers and other conditions. In cancer, EPHB6 mutations, such as the Q926R mutation, are associated with paclitaxel resistance. This mutation leads to increased stability of the EPHA2 protein, activating signaling pathways like JNK, which contribute to aggressive cancer behavior and drug resistance (Yoon2019EPHB6). The EPHB6 Q926R mutation also results in higher expression of CDH11, which is linked to cell adhesion and worse overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients (Yoon2019EPHB6).

In colorectal cancer, EPHB6 overexpression, particularly alongside APC mutations, promotes tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Xu2016EphB6). EPHB6 is also highly expressed in non-functioning pituitary neuroendocrine tumors, correlating with tumor size and potentially contributing to tumorigenesis (Rubinfeld2024Erythropoietinproducing).

Beyond cancer, EPHB6 is involved in blood pressure regulation. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of EPHB6 leads to increased blood pressure, particularly in the absence of testosterone, indicating its role in vascular smooth muscle cell contraction and blood pressure modulation (Luo2012Receptor).

## Interactions
EPHB6, a member of the Eph receptor family, engages in various protein interactions despite lacking intrinsic kinase activity. It interacts with ephrin ligands, particularly ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2, facilitating cell signaling and modulating cellular responses such as motility and invasion (Strozen2021The). EPHB6 forms clusters with ephrinB1 at the plasma membrane, leading to the formation of double-membrane tubular structures that stabilize cell-cell adhesion and reduce cancer cell invasiveness (Liang2024Coclustering). These clusters are resistant to endocytosis, highlighting a unique aspect of EPHB6's function (Liang2024Coclustering).

EPHB6 also interacts with the chaperone protein Hsp90, which stabilizes it at the cell surface. This interaction is disrupted upon stimulation with ephrin-B2, leading to EPHB6 downregulation (Allonby2014Ligand). EPHB6 can bind to other Eph receptors, such as EphA2, modulating signaling pathways. This interaction decreases EphA2-mediated anoikis resistance, suggesting a role for EPHB6 in suppressing oncogenic signaling (Akada2014EphB6). Additionally, EPHB6 can bind nucleotides, which may induce conformational changes necessary for interactions with other proteins (Strozen2021The). These interactions highlight EPHB6's role in cellular signaling and its potential impact on cancer progression.
