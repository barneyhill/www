# GSTCD

## Overview
The GSTCD gene encodes the protein glutathione S-transferase C-terminal domain containing, which is structurally related to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family. Despite its nomenclature, GSTCD does not exhibit classical GST enzymatic activity, as it lacks the N-terminal domain typically required for such function. Instead, GSTCD contains a C-terminal α-helical domain and a potential methyltransferase domain, suggesting a role in cellular processes such as cell viability and apoptosis (Henry2019Defining). The protein is expressed in various human tissues, particularly in the respiratory system, and is implicated in lung function and respiratory health. Genetic variants of GSTCD have been associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other lung function parameters, highlighting its clinical significance in respiratory conditions (Kheirallah2016Translating; Liu2019Exposure).

## Structure
The GSTCD protein, associated with lung function and COPD, does not exhibit classical glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymatic activity, despite its name. Structurally, GSTCD contains a C-terminal α-helical domain, which is characteristic of the GST family, but it lacks the N-terminal thioredoxin-type domain typically required for GST activity (Henry2019Defining). This suggests that GSTCD may not function as a typical GST enzyme. Instead, protein structure analyses have identified a potential methyltransferase domain within GSTCD, which is linked to cell viability and apoptosis (Henry2019Defining).

The protein exists in at least two isoforms, differing in the presence of exon 2, resulting in proteins of 633 and 546 amino acids (Henry2019Defining; Obeidat2013GSTCD). These isoforms are expressed in various cell types, including human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and human airway smooth muscle cells (HASM) (Henry2019Defining). Structural modeling using tools like I-TASSER, SWISS-MODEL, and Phyre2 has frequently identified methyltransferase enzymes as structural templates for GSTCD, suggesting a role in rRNA methyltransferase function (Henry2019Defining). The protein's structure and function may also be related to its homology with transport receptors and other proteins involved in nuclear transport and cell signaling (Henry2019Defining).

## Function
The GSTCD gene encodes a protein that is structurally related to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which is known for its role in detoxification processes. GSTCD is involved in cellular defense against oxidative stress by potentially participating in the conjugation of glutathione to various substrates, although its specific enzymatic activity in the respiratory system remains unclear (Liu2019Exposure; Oakley2023Hidden). The protein is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in the bronchial epithelium and lung macrophages, but it is absent in pneumocytes (Kheirallah2016Translating).

GSTCD is implicated in lung function and respiratory health, with genetic variants linked to lung function parameters such as forced expiratory volume and the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Liu2019Exposure). In mouse models, GSTCD has been shown to influence airway contraction and inflammation, suggesting a role in modulating inflammatory responses (Liu2019Exposure). Despite its structural similarity to other GSTs, GSTCD's specific molecular activities and functions in healthy human cells are not fully understood, and it may lack detectable GST activity due to structural differences (Oakley2023Hidden).

## Clinical Significance
The GSTCD gene has been implicated in several respiratory conditions, most notably chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Genetic variants within GSTCD have been associated with lung function measures such as Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the FEV1/FVC ratio, which are critical indicators of respiratory health (Hall2018Genetic; Kheirallah2016Translating). The SpiroMeta and Charge consortiums identified GSTCD as a significant locus associated with these lung function traits, suggesting its role in COPD susceptibility (Hall2018Genetic; Kheirallah2016Translating).

Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GSTCD, such as rs11728716, have shown strong associations with COPD, with significant odds ratios indicating increased risk (Matsson2016Targeted). This variant is believed to affect the transcription of GSTCD, potentially influencing the gene's role in managing oxidative stress in lung tissues (Matsson2016Targeted). Additionally, GSTCD is co-expressed with INTS12 in lung tissues, and alterations in its expression have been linked to lung function decline, further implicating it in COPD pathogenesis (Kheirallah2016Translating; Probert2015Developmental). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GSTCD in respiratory health and disease.
