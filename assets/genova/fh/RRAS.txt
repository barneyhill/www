# RRAS

## Overview
The RRAS gene encodes a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases, which are pivotal in regulating various cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. The protein product of the RRAS gene, known as RAS-related protein, functions as a molecular switch that cycles between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, influencing downstream signaling pathways. RRAS is particularly involved in modulating the activities of the Rho family of GTPases, thereby impacting cell morphology and movement (Wozniak2005RRas). Structurally, RRAS shares significant homology with other RAS proteins but is distinguished by unique regions that contribute to its specific functional roles (Flex2014Activating). The protein's interactions with various signaling molecules, such as integrins and components of the MAPK pathway, underscore its importance in cellular dynamics and its implication in pathological conditions, including RASopathies and certain cancers (Flex2014Activating; Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural).

## Structure
The RRAS protein is a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases, characterized by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP. The primary structure of RRAS includes a unique 26-amino acid region at the N-terminus, which distinguishes it from other RAS proteins (Flex2014Activating). The protein shares approximately 55-60% amino acid identity with classic RAS proteins, indicating a conserved sequence that is crucial for its function as a molecular switch (Flex2014Activating).

In terms of secondary structure, RRAS contains conserved regions known as switch I and switch II, which undergo conformational changes to activate effector proteins (Flex2014Activating). These regions are essential for the transition between active and inactive states, a common feature among RAS family proteins.

The tertiary structure of RRAS involves a GTP-binding pocket, which is critical for its function. Mutations in this pocket, such as p.Gln87Leu and p.Gly39dup, can lead to oncogenic activity by affecting the protein's ability to bind GTP (Flex2014Activating).

Post-translational modifications of RRAS include geranylgeranylation, carboxymethylation, and phosphorylation, which are important for its membrane association and function (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). These modifications play a significant role in the protein's localization and signaling capabilities.

## Function
The RRAS gene encodes a small GTPase protein that plays a significant role in cell migration and membrane protrusion by regulating the activities of the Rho family of GTPases, specifically Rac and Rho. In healthy human cells, RRAS is involved in the spatial and temporal regulation of these GTPases, which are crucial for cell movement and morphology. Activated RRAS enhances Rho activity while decreasing Rac activity, promoting the stabilization of cell protrusions and efficient cell migration (Wozniak2005RRas).

RRAS is active at the leading edge of migrating cells, where it influences the dynamics of lamellipodial protrusion and retraction, essential for cell movement. It also plays a role in establishing cellular polarity by affecting actin dynamics and the localization of components like p16 of the Arp2/3 complex, which is vital for actin nucleation and cytoskeletal organization (Wozniak2005RRas).

RRAS interacts with various signaling pathways, including the PI3-Kinase pathway, which is important for cell migration and adhesion. It also modulates focal adhesion dynamics through the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway, affecting cell motility and the formation of stress fibers and lamellipodia (Wozniak2005RRas; Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RRAS gene are implicated in a spectrum of disorders known as RASopathies, which include developmental abnormalities and predisposition to certain malignancies. Specific germline mutations, such as p.Gly39dup and p.Val55Met, have been associated with phenotypes overlapping with Noonan syndrome, characterized by cardiac defects, growth issues, and distinctive facial features (Flex2014Activating). These mutations enhance RRAS function and MAPK activation, contributing to signaling perturbations that underlie these conditions (Flex2014Activating).

RRAS mutations are also linked to hematologic malignancies. Somatic mutations like p.Gly39dup and p.Gln87Leu have been identified in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a childhood myeloproliferative disorder that can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Flex2014Activating). These mutations affect oncogenic hotspots, promoting aberrant signaling through pathways such as MEK, ERK, and AKT, which are crucial in leukemogenesis (Flex2014Activating).

The RRAS G39dup mutation, in particular, shows increased binding affinity to several effectors, leading to enhanced phosphorylation of signaling proteins and resistance to GAP stimulation, further implicating it in the pathogenesis of RASopathies and leukemia (Flex2014Activating). These findings underscore the role of RRAS mutations in disease development through dysregulated cellular signaling.

## Interactions
RRAS, a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases, engages in various interactions with proteins that influence cellular signaling pathways. It binds to Filamin A (FLNa), which is crucial for promoting endothelial barrier function. Disruption of the RRAS-FLNa interaction results in the loss of this function (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). RRAS also interacts with gridin, which associates with VE-cadherin to regulate transendothelial permeability (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural).

RRAS is involved in the activation of integrins, particularly in macrophages, in response to inflammatory mediators. This process involves a pathway with RAP1, leading to the activation of aMb2 integrin (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). RRAS also stimulates focal adhesion formation through FAK and p130CAS and activates phospholipase C epsilon (PLCE), which is involved in controlling the actin cytoskeleton arrangement (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural).

The RRAS-RIN2-RAB5 axis recruits the RACGEF TIAM1 to control RAC1-dependent endothelial cell adhesion (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). Additionally, RRAS interacts with RAF1 and BRAF, which are downstream effectors in the MAPK signaling pathway (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). These interactions highlight the role of RRAS in modulating various cellular processes, including adhesion, migration, and permeability.
