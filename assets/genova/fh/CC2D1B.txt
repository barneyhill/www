# CC2D1B

## Overview
CC2D1B is a human gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil and C2 domain containing 1B, also known as Freud-2. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a C2 domain and multiple DM14 domains, which facilitate its role as a transcriptional repressor and its involvement in nuclear envelope reformation. The C2 domain is particularly important for lipid binding, while the DM14 domains mediate interactions with ESCRT-III proteins, crucial for cellular processes such as mitotic nuclear envelope reformation. CC2D1B is implicated in the regulation of gene expression, notably repressing the serotonin-1A receptor gene, and is involved in developmental myelination within the central nervous system. Alterations in CC2D1B expression or function have been linked to neurological and developmental disorders, including intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Hadjighassem2009Human; Acheta2022Cc2d1b; Ventimiglia2018CC2D1B).

## Structure
The CC2D1B protein, encoded by the human gene CC2D1B, is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its structure and function. It contains a predicted membrane-binding C2 domain and four DM14 domains. The C2 domain forms a classical beta-sandwich structure with two four-stranded beta sheets, classifying it as a class II C2 domain. This domain is atypical due to the presence of two short alpha helices inserted into the loops connecting beta strands, which are conserved in human CC2D1A/B orthologs, suggesting functional importance (Ventimiglia2018CC2D1B). The C2 domain is involved in lipid binding, specifically phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIns(4,5)P2), and is crucial for the protein's localization and function during nuclear envelope reformation (Ventimiglia2018CC2D1B).

The DM14 domains of CC2D1B autonomously bind the core region of the CHMP4 family of ESCRT-III proteins, with the fourth DM14 domain specifically binding to CHMP7 (Ventimiglia2018CC2D1B). The protein also contains a predicted helix-loop-helix domain and a conserved protein kinase C region (Hadjighassem2009Human). These structural features suggest a role in protein interactions and DNA binding, supporting its function as a transcriptional repressor (Hadjighassem2009Human).

## Function
The CC2D1B gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of gene expression and nuclear envelope reformation. In healthy human cells, CC2D1B acts as a transcriptional repressor of the postsynaptic serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor gene. It binds to the downstream repressor element (DRE) in the 5-HT1A gene, reducing its transcriptional activity, which is crucial for maintaining the basal level of 5-HT1A receptor expression in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells (Hadjighassem2009Human).

CC2D1B is also involved in the mitotic reformation of the nuclear envelope (NE). It coordinates the activity of the ESCRT-III complex, essential for NE resealing after mitosis. The protein contains a C2 domain that binds to phosphoinositides, facilitating its recruitment to the reforming NE. This recruitment is crucial for the proper timing and coordination of ESCRT-III polymerization, ensuring the integrity and functionality of the nuclear compartment (Ventimiglia2018CC2D1B).

Additionally, CC2D1B is expressed in myelinating cells within the central nervous system, where it contributes to the regulation of developmental myelination, particularly in large-diameter fibers of the optic nerves (Acheta2022Cc2d1b).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CC2D1B gene have been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders. CC2D1B is associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While biallelic loss of function mutations in its homolog CC2D1A are known to cause a rare form of autosomal recessive ID, CC2D1B is thought to have a compensatory role, and its loss can lead to cognitive deficits (Zamarbide2018Loss). 

CC2D1B also plays a role in the regulation of serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor expression, which is linked to mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Freud-2, the protein encoded by CC2D1B, acts as a repressor of the 5-HT1A receptor gene. Alterations in Freud-2 expression can lead to changes in 5-HT1A receptor levels, potentially contributing to mental health conditions (Hadjighassem2009Human). 

In the context of myelination, CC2D1B is crucial for proper myelination of large-diameter fibers in the central nervous system, particularly in the optic nerves. Its absence can result in hypomyelination, which may affect neural function (Acheta2022Cc2d1b).

## Interactions
The CC2D1B protein, also known as Freud-2, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with ESCRT-III proteins, specifically binding to CHMP7 and CHMP4B. The DM14 domains of CC2D1B are crucial for these interactions, with the fourth DM14 domain binding to CHMP7 and the other domains interacting with CHMP4B. This interaction is essential for coordinating the activities of these proteins during mitotic nuclear envelope reformation (Ventimiglia2018CC2D1B).

CC2D1B also plays a role in inhibiting the polymerization of ESCRT-III components, such as CHMP4B, and in recruiting Spastin to ESCRT-III filaments, which is crucial for spindle microtubule severing (Ventimiglia2018CC2D1B). Additionally, CC2D1B interacts with phosphoinositides through its C2 domain, specifically binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIns(4,5)P2), which is important for its localization and function during nuclear envelope reformation (Ventimiglia2018CC2D1B).

In the context of transcriptional regulation, CC2D1B acts as a repressor of the serotonin-1A receptor gene by binding to specific DNA sequences in the promoter region, known as dual repressor elements (DRE) (Hadjighassem2009Human).
