# TMEM275

## Overview
TMEM275 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 275, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and cell communication. The specific functions and interactions of transmembrane protein 275 remain under investigation, but it is hypothesized to be involved in pathways that are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. Understanding the role of TMEM275 and its encoded protein could provide insights into its potential implications in health and disease, particularly in the context of its expression patterns and interactions with other cellular components (Qiu2020aarFDC).
