# CDKN3

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 3 (CDKN3) is a gene that encodes a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the cell cycle. The protein product of CDKN3, also referred to as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 3, functions primarily by dephosphorylating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), such as CDK1 and CDK2, thereby acting as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression. This phosphatase activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and ensuring proper cell cycle transitions, particularly during mitosis and the G1/S phase transition (Cress2017Expression; Barrón2015CDKN3). CDKN3 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with various cell cycle proteins to exert its regulatory effects. Its role in cell cycle control has significant implications in cancer biology, as aberrant expression of CDKN3 is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several cancer types (Fan2015Overexpression; AbdelTawab2022Evaluation).

## Structure


## Function
The CDKN3 gene encodes a dual-specificity protein phosphatase that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation by dephosphorylating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly CDK1 and CDK2. In healthy human cells, CDKN3 is involved in the dephosphorylation of Thr160 on CDK2, which is necessary for full CDK2 activity and cell cycle progression. By dephosphorylating this residue, CDKN3 inhibits cell cycle progression, acting as a negative regulator of CDK activity (Cress2017Expression; Barrón2015CDKN3). CDKN3 also interacts with CDK1, inhibiting its activity and playing a role in the regulation of mitosis exit. This dephosphorylation is essential for antagonizing CDK activity in late mitosis, allowing cells to exit mitosis and enter cytokinesis (Barrón2015CDKN3).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other cell cycle proteins to maintain proper cell cycle control. This regulation is crucial for ensuring genomic stability and preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Fan2015Overexpression). CDKN3's role in dephosphorylating CDK1 and CDK2 is essential for proper cell cycle progression, particularly in the transition from mitosis to the next cell cycle phase (Cress2017Expression).

## Clinical Significance
CDKN3 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels rather than mutations, which are rare. In lung adenocarcinoma, CDKN3 overexpression is linked to poor survival, with no significant mutations detected in the TCGA cohort or lung cancer cell lines, suggesting its role in cancer is related to cell cycle regulation rather than genetic alterations (Fan2015Overexpression). In cervical cancer, CDKN3 is significantly upregulated, particularly in HPV16-positive cases, and is associated with decreased survival rates, indicating its potential as a biomarker for prognosis and a therapeutic target (Barrón2015CDKN3).

In esophageal cancer, CDKN3 is overexpressed and contributes to tumor progression and cisplatin resistance through its interaction with RAD51, a DNA damage response protein. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which CDKN3 confers chemoresistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (CDKN3; p&gt; Wang2019&lt). CDKN3 is also upregulated in gastric carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and may serve as a diagnostic and predictive biomarker (AbdelTawab2022Evaluation). These findings highlight CDKN3's role in cancer progression and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.

## Interactions
CDKN3, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, interacts with several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to regulate cell cycle progression. It primarily binds to CDK2, inhibiting its activity by dephosphorylating the activating loop threonine residues, which reduces the kinase's ability to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, thereby affecting the G1/S transition in the cell cycle (LI2014CDKN3; Fan2015Overexpression). CDKN3 also interacts with CDK1, functioning as a negative regulator by dephosphorylating its threonine residues, which impacts substrate and ATP binding activities (Fan2015Overexpression).

In addition to CDK2 and CDK1, CDKN3 has been shown to interact with CDC2, another kinase, through structural alignment and interaction databases, which is significant in the context of cancer (Dawelbait2005Structural). CDKN3 also forms complexes with proteins such as p53 and Mdm2, influencing cell cycle regulation and potentially affecting tumor progression (LI2014CDKN3; Dai2020CDKN3). These interactions highlight CDKN3's role in modulating key cell cycle checkpoints and its potential impact on cancer development and progression.
