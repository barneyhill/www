# OR1J4

## Overview
The OR1J4 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily J member 4, which is part of the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The OR1J4 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, a common feature of GPCRs, which allows it to transduce extracellular signals through interaction with G-proteins. While the primary function of OR1J4 is related to olfactory perception, its expression and potential roles in other physiological processes have been subjects of research, although its direct involvement in specific diseases or conditions remains to be fully elucidated (Kerslake2020Co‑expression; Loughnan2022Hemochromatosis).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR1J4 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, is not well-documented in terms of specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from its mutations or expression alterations. However, some studies have explored its potential associations. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, OR1J4 is among the olfactory receptors whose expression patterns were analyzed, although no direct link to COVID-19 symptoms or outcomes was established (Kerslake2020Co‑expression). The gene was also investigated in a study on Hemochromatosis, where it was associated with the Hemochromatosis Brain phenotype through exome burden testing, but specific diseases linked to OR1J4 were not detailed (Loughnan2022Hemochromatosis).

In a case study of a critically ill infant with renal tubular dysgenesis, a variant in OR1J4 was identified, but it was noted that OR1J4 is not known to be associated with Mendelian diseases, and the focus was on another gene, AGTR1, for the condition (AlMaraghi2024A). Overall, while OR1J4 has been mentioned in various genetic studies, its direct clinical implications remain unclear.
