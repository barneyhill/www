# AARS2

## Overview
The AARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (mtAlaRS), a critical enzyme involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for the accurate translation of genetic information into proteins by catalyzing the attachment of specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs. mtAlaRS is essential for the proper functioning of the mitochondrial translation machinery, as it ensures the correct incorporation of alanine into mitochondrial proteins, a process vital for cellular energy production and overall mitochondrial function. The enzyme's structure includes distinct domains for aminoacylation and editing, which contribute to its role in maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis by preventing the misincorporation of amino acids. Mutations in the AARS2 gene have been linked to various mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its importance in human health (Zhou2019Novel; Euro2015Structural; Kuo2019AlanyltRNA).

## Structure
The AARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase (mtAlaRS), which is crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. The protein structure includes several domains: an aminoacylation domain, a conserved editing domain, and a C-terminal domain. The editing domain is responsible for deacylating mischarged tRNAs, preventing the misincorporation of amino acids (Euro2015Structural). The editing domain contains a β-barrel subdomain, which is involved in complex interactions crucial for protein stability (Sommerville2018Instability).

The tertiary structure of mtAlaRS is characterized by a large tRNA-binding cavity, with all three domains contributing to tRNA binding during aminoacylation. The C-terminal domain has the highest tRNA binding affinity, enhancing the rate of aminoacylation (Euro2015Structural). Structural modeling based on the alanyl-tRNA synthetase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus suggests that mtAlaRS shares unique structural features with other AlaRSs, despite having a lower sequence identity (Euro2015Structural).

The protein is monomeric, unlike other AlaRSs that form dimers, due to fewer conserved hydrophobic residues that typically mediate dimer formation (Zeng2019The). The primary sequence of mtAlaRS includes specific regions that interact with tRNA, contributing to its unique recognition mechanism (Zeng2019The).

## Function
The AARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme crucial for protein synthesis within mitochondria. This enzyme is responsible for attaching the amino acid alanine to its corresponding tRNA, a process known as aminoacylation, which is essential for the accurate translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins (Zhou2019Novel; Euro2015Structural). AARS2 operates in the mitochondria, where it plays a vital role in maintaining mitochondrial protein synthesis, which is critical for cellular energy production and overall cellular function (Kuo2019AlanyltRNA).

The enzyme catalyzes a two-step reaction: first, it forms an aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate by recognizing alanine and ATP, and second, it transfers the aminoacyl group to the terminal adenosine of the tRNA (Zhou2019Novel). This process ensures the correct incorporation of alanine into proteins, which is necessary for the proper function of the oxidative phosphorylation system, a key component of cellular respiration and ATP production (Euro2015Structural).

AARS2 also contains an editing domain that deacylates mischarged tRNAs, preventing errors in protein synthesis that could lead to dysfunctional proteins and cellular stress (Euro2015Structural). This editing function is crucial for maintaining the fidelity of mitochondrial protein synthesis and, consequently, mitochondrial function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AARS2 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, primarily affecting the central nervous system and other high-energy-demand organs. AARS2 mutations have been linked to leukodystrophies, a group of genetic disorders characterized by the degeneration of white matter in the brain. These include autosomal recessive spastic ataxia with leukodystrophy (ARSAL), distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN), and leukodystrophy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) (Wang2019Novel). 

AARS2 mutations can also lead to adult-onset leukoencephalopathy, which is marked by progressive cerebral white matter degeneration, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms. In females, this condition may present with ovarian failure, known as ovarioleukodystrophy (Tang2019AARS2; Fan2022Novel). 

Additionally, AARS2 mutations are implicated in infantile mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, a severe condition affecting the heart, and in some cases, optic atrophy and retinopathy (Peragallo2017Retinopathy). The clinical presentation of AARS2-related disorders is highly variable, with symptoms ranging from cognitive and motor impairments to metabolic abnormalities, reflecting the gene's role in mitochondrial function and protein synthesis (Dong2018An; Felhi2020Mutations).

## Interactions
The AARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase (mtAlaRS), which is involved in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of alanine to its corresponding tRNA. This enzyme interacts with mitochondrial tRNA and is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function. The structural domains of mtAlaRS, including the aminoacylation, editing, and C-terminal domains, all contribute to tRNA binding. The editing domain, where the R592W mutation is located, plays a role in proofreading and stabilizing the tRNA's position during aminoacylation (Euro2015Structural).

mtAlaRS also forms complexes with other mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. It has been shown to directly interact with human mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase (hmtSerRS) both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction is mediated by the aminoacylation domains of both proteins, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. These interactions suggest that mtAlaRS and hmtSerRS form complexes that may fine-tune tRNA aminoacylation (Peng2022RNA). The formation of these complexes indicates a potential role in the regulation of mitochondrial translation and highlights the importance of tRNA binding capacity for the enrichment of mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in mitochondrial RNA granules (Peng2022RNA).
