# CDK5R2

## Overview
CDK5R2 is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit 2, commonly referred to as p39. This protein is a regulatory subunit that plays a critical role in the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a serine/threonine kinase predominantly active in the nervous system. The p39 protein is characterized by its myristoylation site, which facilitates membrane association, and its involvement in various cellular processes, including neuronal migration, synaptic function, and cytoskeletal dynamics (Arif2012Extraneuronal; Malumbres2014Cyclin-dependent). While CDK5R2 is primarily expressed in neuronal tissues, it also has implications in extraneuronal contexts, such as cancer, where its dysregulation is associated with tumor progression and metastasis (PérezMorales2018Hyperphosphorylation). The gene's role in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, has been explored, highlighting its potential involvement in disease susceptibility through its interaction with CDK5 (Rademakers2005Association).

## Structure
CDK5R2, also known as p39, is a regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). The primary structure of CDK5R2 includes a myristoylation site at the N-terminus, which is essential for its association with cellular membranes. This feature is crucial for the protein's localization and function. The protein also contains several phosphorylation sites, which play a significant role in modulating its activity and stability.

The secondary structure of CDK5R2 is characterized by the presence of alpha helices and beta sheets. These structural elements contribute to the protein's overall conformation and are important for its functional interactions. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices and sheets into a compact three-dimensional form, which is necessary for its biological activity.

In terms of quaternary structure, CDK5R2 interacts with CDK5 to form an active complex. This interaction is vital for the regulation of CDK5 activity, which is involved in various cellular processes. CDK5R2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affect its function and interactions with other proteins. These modifications are important for the dynamic regulation of its activity in response to cellular signals.

## Function
CDK5R2, also known as p39, is a regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), primarily active in the nervous system. It plays a crucial role in neuronal biology by regulating processes such as neuronal migration, synaptic function, and cytoskeletal dynamics. CDK5R2, along with another activator, p35, is essential for the activation of CDK5, which is involved in various cellular processes, including axonal growth, dendritic spine development, and synaptic plasticity (Arif2012Extraneuronal; Malumbres2014Cyclin-dependent).

In healthy cells, CDK5R2 is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics through its interaction with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). This interaction influences axonal growth and synaptic plasticity, which are critical for brain development and function (Shah2016A). CDK5R2 also plays a role in the phosphorylation of various substrates, affecting processes such as axonal transport and synaptic transmission, which are vital for memory formation and cognitive functions (Pao2021Three).

The activity of CDK5R2 is tightly regulated, and its dysregulation can lead to pathological conditions. In healthy neurons, CDK5R2 ensures proper localization and activation of CDK5, preventing aberrant activity that could lead to neurodegenerative diseases (Pao2021Three).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDK5R2 gene, which encodes the p39 protein, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In lung cancer, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), overexpression of p39 is associated with tumor progression, staging, and metastasis. The increased expression of p39 correlates with hyper-phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) at serine 249, which is linked to impaired cell adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), critical processes in cancer metastasis (PérezMorales2018Hyperphosphorylation).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, the CDK5R2 gene, as part of the CDK5 complex, has been studied for its potential role in early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although no direct causal mutations in CDK5R2 were identified, the gene's involvement in the CDK5 complex suggests a possible link to AD pathology. The study found that certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CDK5 gene, which interacts with CDK5R2, were associated with an increased risk of early-onset AD, indicating that genetic variations in this pathway might contribute to disease susceptibility (Rademakers2005Association).

## Interactions
CDK5R2, also known as p39, is a regulatory subunit that interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) to form an active kinase complex. This interaction is crucial for CDK5's function in various cellular processes. CDK5R2 is known for its restricted expression in extraneuronal tissues compared to its counterpart p35 (CDK5R1) (Nikhil2023CDK5:). 

CDK5R2 has a myristoylated region at the N-terminus, which aids in membrane localization, and a small tail at the C-terminus that binds muskelin. This binding facilitates the transport of CDK5R2 to the cell periphery, which is essential for its physiological functions (Nikhil2023CDK5:). Under neurotoxic conditions, CDK5R2 is cleaved to form p29, leading to hyperactivation and mislocalization of CDK5-p29 complexes, contributing to neurotoxicity (Nikhil2023CDK5:).

In the context of cancer, CDK5R2 is overexpressed in certain types, such as lung cancer, where it is associated with cancer staging and metastasis. However, attempts to increase Rb phosphorylation by forcing p39 expression in certain cell lines were unsuccessful, suggesting complex regulatory mechanisms (PérezMorales2018Hyperphosphorylation).
