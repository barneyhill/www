# ALDH8A1

## Overview
The ALDH8A1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 8 family member A1, which is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism, where it catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of 2-aminomuconic semialdehyde to 2-aminomuconate, thus playing a crucial role in the degradation of L-tryptophan (Davis2018Reassignment). Initially mischaracterized as a retinal dehydrogenase, ALDH8A1 has been reassigned as a human aminomuconate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (AMSDH) (Davis2018Reassignment). The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, contributing to cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative stress. Its involvement in the kynurenine pathway links it to immune responses and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential medical significance (Davis2018Reassignment). The gene's expression and mutation status have been associated with various clinical outcomes, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Yao2021Comprehensive).

## Structure
The human ALDH8A1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, which is involved in the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. ALDH8A1 has two transcriptional variants: ALDH8A1_v1 and ALDH8A1_v2. ALDH8A1_v1 is the longer transcript, encoding a 487-residue protein, while ALDH8A1_v2 is a splice variant that lacks an in-frame segment within the coding region, resulting in a 433-amino-acid protein (Black2009Human).

The protein structure of ALDH8A1 includes a NAD(P)-binding domain and a catalytic domain, both of which are Rossmann folds, a common feature in the ALDH superfamily (Xanthis2023Human). The active site is located at the interface of the catalytic and cofactor binding domains, with conserved residues crucial for enzymatic activity (Xanthis2023Human). ALDH8A1 shares significant sequence identity with pfAMSDH, an enzyme in the kynurenine pathway, and has been shown to catalyze the NAD+-dependent oxidation of 2-aminomuconic semialdehyde to 2-aminomuconate, indicating its role in tryptophan catabolism (Davis2018Reassignment). The homology model of ALDH8A1 aligns well with pfAMSDH, with an RMSD of 1.15 Å for 472 C-alpha carbons, suggesting structural similarities (Davis2018Reassignment).

## Function
The human gene ALDH8A1 encodes an enzyme that plays a significant role in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism. Initially thought to function as a retinal dehydrogenase, ALDH8A1 has been reassigned as a human aminomuconate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (AMSDH) due to its ability to catalyze the NAD+-dependent oxidation of 2-aminomuconic semialdehyde (2-AMS) to 2-aminomuconate (2-AM) (Davis2018Reassignment). This enzymatic activity is crucial for the proper functioning of the kynurenine pathway, which is the primary route for L-tryptophan degradation in mammals and is involved in immune response and neurodegenerative diseases (Davis2018Reassignment).

ALDH8A1 exhibits typical steady-state kinetics with a kcat of 0.42 s-1 and a Km of 590 nM, indicating its catalytic efficiency is comparable to that of bacterial AMSDH from Pseudomonas fluorescens (Davis2018Reassignment). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, contributing to cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative stress. Its role in the kynurenine pathway suggests its involvement in the broader tryptophan catabolic process, which has potential medical significance due to its links to neuro-excitatory and neuro-depressive effects (Davis2018Reassignment).

## Clinical Significance
The ALDH8A1 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have shown that the mRNA expression of ALDH8A1 is significantly lower in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues, and this downregulation is associated with more advanced tumor stages and higher malignancy (Yao2021Comprehensive). The expression levels of ALDH8A1 also correlate with immune infiltration levels in HCC, affecting various immune cells such as CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which are crucial for the immune response against tumors (Yao2021Comprehensive). 

Additionally, the mutation frequency of ALDH8A1 in HCC is linked to poor prognosis, suggesting that genetic alterations in this gene may contribute to the progression and severity of liver cancer (Yao2021Comprehensive). The expression of ALDH8A1 varies between different racial groups, with lower expression observed in Asians compared to Whites, which significantly impacts the prognosis of liver cancer patients, particularly in Asian populations (Yao2021Comprehensive). These findings highlight the potential role of ALDH8A1 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in liver cancer.
