# HBS1L

## Overview
HBS1L is a gene located on chromosome 6q23 that encodes the HBS1-like translational GTPase, a protein involved in ribosomal function and mRNA surveillance. This protein is categorized as a translational GTPase and plays a critical role in the dissociation of stalled ribosomes, facilitating ribosomal recycling and ensuring the fidelity of mRNA translation. The HBS1-like protein forms a complex with Pelota, which is essential for the mRNA surveillance pathways, including no-go decay (NGD) and non-stop decay (NSD) (O’Connell2019Mammalian). The gene is also clinically significant due to its association with the regulation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels, impacting the severity of hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia (Lettre2008DNA; Thein2007Intergenic). Variants in the HBS1L-MYB intergenic region have been identified as major quantitative trait loci influencing HbF levels, thereby modifying the clinical expression of these disorders (ElGhamrawy2020Association; Hariharan2021Significance).

## Clinical Significance
The HBS1L gene is clinically significant due to its association with the regulation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels, which impacts the severity of hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia. Variants in the HBS1L-MYB intergenic region on chromosome 6q23 have been identified as major quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing HbF levels in adults. These genetic variants are linked to variations in HbF levels, which can modify the clinical severity of SCD and β-thalassemia by affecting the phenotypic expression of these disorders (Lettre2008DNA; Thein2007Intergenic).

In SCD, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the HBS1L-MYB region, such as rs28384513, rs9399137, and rs4895441, have been associated with higher HbF levels, which correlate with reduced pain crises and improved clinical outcomes (Lettre2008DNA; Sales2020Functional). These SNPs are also linked to the modulation of HBS1L expression, which plays a role in HbF production (Thein2007Intergenic). The genetic variants in the HBS1L-MYB region contribute significantly to the variability in HbF levels, accounting for a substantial portion of the trait variance in different populations (ElGhamrawy2020Association; Hariharan2021Significance).

## Interactions
HBS1L is a translational GTPase involved in several key interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of ribosomal function and mRNA surveillance. It forms a complex with the protein Pelota, which is crucial for the dissociation of stalled ribosomes into subunits, facilitating ribosomal recycling. This interaction is essential for mRNA surveillance pathways, including no-go decay (NGD) and non-stop decay (NSD) (O’Connell2019Mammalian). The HBS1L:Pelota complex is implicated in the dissociation of inactive 80S monosomes, a process that is particularly important under stress conditions (O’Connell2019Mammalian).

In yeast, the orthologous Dom34:Hbs1 complex, which is functionally similar to the HBS1L:Pelota complex in mammals, promotes the dissociation of inactive ribosomes, especially during stress recovery (van2014Dom34Hbs1). This complex, along with the Rli1 NTPase, facilitates the splitting of ribosomal subunits, which is crucial for the restart of translation after stress (van2014Dom34Hbs1). The interaction between HBS1L and Pelota is vital for maintaining Pelota stability, as HBS1L deficiency leads to Pelota depletion and accumulation of 80S monosomes (O’Connell2019Mammalian).
