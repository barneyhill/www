# ZNF625

## Overview
ZNF625 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 625, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate interactions with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes. Although the specific biological functions of zinc finger protein 625 remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in the regulation of gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. Notably, ZNF625 has been associated with colorectal cancer, where its methylation may contribute to tumorigenesis by silencing gene expression (Iwaizumi2022Methylation). This highlights the potential significance of ZNF625 in cancer biology and underscores the importance of further research to understand its role in health and disease.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF625 has been implicated in the development of colorectal cancer through epigenetic alterations. In a case study of a 72-year-old female patient with numerous non-granular type laterally spreading tumors (LST-NG) and colorectal cancer, methylation of CpG island promoters in ZNF625 was observed in both LST-NG lesions and cancer samples. This methylation suggests that ZNF625 may be silenced early in tumorigenesis, potentially contributing to the progression of colorectal cancer (Iwaizumi2022Methylation). The study highlights the role of DNA methylation as an epigenetic mechanism that may influence the development of colorectal cancer, particularly in the context of environmental factors and gut microbiota (Iwaizumi2022Methylation).

The findings suggest that while somatic mutations in genes like TP53 and FBXW7 are present in cancer samples, the methylation of ZNF625 and other genes such as LONRF2, SDC2, and WDR17 may play a significant role in the early stages of tumorigenesis from LST-NG lesions (Iwaizumi2022Methylation). This indicates a potential epigenetic contribution to colorectal cancer development, emphasizing the need for further research into the genetic and epigenetic factors involved in this process (Iwaizumi2022Methylation).
