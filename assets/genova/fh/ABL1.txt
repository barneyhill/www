# ABL1

## Overview
ABL1 is a gene that encodes the ABL proto-oncogene 1, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes such as differentiation, division, adhesion, and response to DNA damage. The ABL1 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including the SH2 and SH3 domains, which are crucial for its interaction with other proteins and its regulatory functions. As a kinase, ABL1 is involved in modulating the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell migration, adhesion, and polarity. It also participates in the DNA damage response and apoptosis, interacting with key proteins like ATM and Tip60. Dysregulation of ABL1, particularly through the formation of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, is implicated in hematological malignancies such as chronic myeloid leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Colicelli2010ABL; Wang2014The).

## Structure
The ABL1 gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including differentiation, division, and adhesion. The protein structure of ABL1 includes several key domains: the SH2 domain, the SH3 domain, and the kinase domain. The SH3 domain, encoded by exon 2, plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and stability of the protein. Deletion of exon 2, which includes residues E27-K84, leads to significant conformational changes, increased fluctuations, and reduced stability in the SH3 domain, affecting the SH2 domain and overall protein conformation (LeyteVidal2024Absence).

The secondary structure of ABL1 consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the folding and stability of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing for interactions with other proteins and ligands. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, such as the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, which results from the Philadelphia chromosome translocation and is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (Zhou2018Chronic).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate the activity of the ABL1 protein. Splice variants of ABL1 can lead to different isoforms, which may have distinct functions and implications in disease contexts (Vinhas2018A).

## Function
The ABL1 gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. ABL1 is involved in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, which is essential for cell adhesion, migration, and polarity. It modulates the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating cellular protrusions and migration by activating small GTPases like Rac1 and Rap1 (Khatri2016Multifunctional). ABL1 also regulates spindle orientation by phosphorylating proteins such as NuMA, ensuring proper spindle alignment during cell division (Matsumura2012ABL1).

In response to DNA damage, ABL1 interacts with ATM kinase and Tip60 acetyltransferase, modulating apoptosis and maintaining mitochondrial function (Wang2014The). ABL1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes like DNA damage repair and actin remodeling (Colicelli2010ABL). It also plays a role in receptor endocytosis and autophagy, coordinating cytoskeleton remodeling and phosphoregulation of receptors (Colicelli2010ABL).

ABL1's activity is regulated by various stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and oxidative stress, and it is involved in processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Wang2014The). Its functions are crucial for normal development and cellular homeostasis, with dysregulation potentially leading to oncogenic transformations (Colicelli2010ABL).

## Clinical Significance
The ABL1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various hematological malignancies, primarily through the formation of fusion genes. The most notable fusion is BCR-ABL1, which is a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is also found in some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Walz2008Comparison). The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein results from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, creating a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives the proliferation of myeloid cells (Walz2008Comparison). 

Mutations in the ABL1 gene, particularly in the kinase domain, are associated with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib, which is used to treat CML. These mutations can reactivate the kinase activity of BCR-ABL1, leading to decreased drug sensitivity (Walz2008Comparison). The T315I mutation is notably resistant to imatinib and other TKIs such as nilotinib and dasatinib (Walz2008Comparison).

In addition to its role in cancer, germline mutations in ABL1 have been linked to a multisystemic syndrome characterized by congenital heart defects, facial dysmorphism, and developmental delays (BravoGil2019Expanding). These mutations can affect the SH2 domain of the ABL1 protein, potentially altering its normal function (BravoGil2019Expanding).

## Interactions
ABL1 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling and regulation. It engages with proteins through its SH2 and SH3 domains, which are essential for its function and regulation. ABL1 forms oligomers to enhance its kinase activity and interacts with cytoskeletal components like F-actin through a calponin homology domain, which inhibits its kinase activity, suggesting a regulatory feedback mechanism (Colicelli2010ABL). 

ABL1 also forms heterodimers with ABL2 in response to oxidative stress, mediating apoptosis. It interacts with proteins such as ABI1 and ABI2, which bind to PxxP motifs in ABL1, influencing its function and potentially facilitating oligomerization. RIN1 binds directly to ABL1, increasing its catalytic efficiency by stabilizing an active conformation (Colicelli2010ABL). 

In the context of DNA damage response, ABL1 interacts with DNA repair mediators like ATM, ATR, and RAD51, and forms complexes with proteins such as MLH1 (Colicelli2010ABL). ABL1 is also involved in receptor endocytosis, interacting with receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR and ERBB2, promoting endocytosis and modulating receptor signaling (Colicelli2010ABL).
