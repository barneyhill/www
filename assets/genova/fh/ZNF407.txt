# ZNF407

## Overview
ZNF407 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 407, a transcription factor characterized by multiple zinc finger domains that facilitate DNA binding and gene regulation. This protein plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation, influencing various cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and metabolic regulation. ZNF407 is particularly significant in brain development and cognitive function, with mutations in the gene linked to intellectual disabilities and autism. The protein is also involved in metabolic processes, enhancing the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), which is crucial for adipogenesis and glucose homeostasis. Additionally, ZNF407 interacts with other proteins, such as the PPARγ/RXRα complex, to modulate transcriptional activity, and is implicated in cancer metastasis through its regulation by WDR5 (Tan2017PI3KAKTmediated; Charrier2024Molecular; Kambouris2014Mutations).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF407 encodes a zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily through its role as a transcription factor. This protein contains multiple zinc finger domains, which facilitate its binding to DNA and regulation of gene expression. ZNF407 is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation, and is active in the nucleus where it interacts with other proteins to modulate transcriptional activity (Kambouris2014Mutations).

In healthy human cells, ZNF407 plays a significant role in brain development and cognitive function. Mutations in ZNF407 have been linked to intellectual disability and autism, indicating its importance in normal cognitive development (Ren2013Balanced). The protein's function is also associated with the regulation of genes involved in metabolic processes. ZNF407 has been shown to enhance the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor involved in adipogenesis and metabolic regulation (Charrier2024Molecular).

The protein's activity is not limited to direct gene expression regulation; it also influences the expression of PPARγ target genes, such as GLUT4, which is crucial for glucose homeostasis. This regulatory role suggests that ZNF407 is involved in maintaining metabolic health and may have implications for conditions like type 2 diabetes (Charrier2024Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF407 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including intellectual disability (ID) and autism. A study identified a balanced translocation t(3;18)(p13;q22.3) in a patient with moderate non-syndromic ID and autism, which resulted in a 40% reduction in the expression of isoform 1 of the ZNF407 protein. This reduction was not observed in the patient's parents, suggesting a de novo occurrence that may contribute to the development of these conditions (Ren2013Balanced). Further analysis of patients with similar clinical presentations revealed missense mutations in the ZNF407 gene, such as Y460C and P1195A, which are predicted to interfere with the protein's function by affecting critical linker regions between zinc finger structures (Ren2013Balanced).

In another study, a mutation c.C5054G/p.S1685W in the ZNF407 gene was identified in a consanguineous Arab family, leading to a unique autosomal recessive cognitive impairment syndrome characterized by cognitive impairment, failure-to-thrive, and hypotonia. This mutation affects the linker between zinc finger domains, potentially disrupting DNA binding and gene expression (Kambouris2014Mutations). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZNF407 in maintaining normal cognitive function and its potential role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders.

## Interactions
ZNF407, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. It is known to interact with the PPARγ/RXRα protein complex in the nucleus of adipocytes. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of PPARγ signaling, which is important for adipocyte differentiation and metabolism. ZNF407 directly binds to PPARγ, as demonstrated by the significant overlap of ZNF407 peaks with PPARγ peaks in ChIP-seq analyses, indicating a direct interaction (Charrier2024Molecular).

ZNF407 also contains conserved LxxLL and CoRNR motifs, which are essential for its interaction with PPARγ and RXR, respectively. Mutations in these motifs negate the synergistic effect of ZNF407 on PPARγ transcriptional activity, suggesting that direct binding is necessary for transcriptional activation (Charrier2024Molecular).

In the context of cancer, ZNF407 is a downstream target of WDR5, a protein that promotes colorectal cancer metastasis. WDR5 binds to the ZNF407 promoter, upregulating its transcription and influencing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, which is crucial for cancer metastasis (Tan2017PI3KAKTmediated).
