# ADAM9

## Overview
ADAM9 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 9, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family. This protein is characterized by its multi-domain structure, which includes a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin domain, and a transmembrane domain, among others. These domains facilitate its involvement in various cellular processes, such as cell adhesion, ectodomain shedding, and cell signaling (Chou2020An; Haoyuan2020Structure). ADAM9 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and plays a crucial role in physiological functions, including developmental processes and inflammatory responses. It is also implicated in pathological conditions, such as cancer progression and neurodegenerative diseases, due to its altered expression and interactions with other proteins (Chou2020An; Haoyuan2020Structure).

## Structure
ADAM9 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a complex multi-domain structure. It includes a leader peptide domain, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tail (Chou2020An; Haoyuan2020Structure). The leader peptide domain functions as an intramolecular chaperone, ensuring proper protein folding and regulating protease activity through a cysteine-switching mechanism (Haoyuan2020Structure).

The metalloprotease domain contains a catalytic zinc-binding motif essential for enzymatic activity (Chou2020An). The disintegrin domain interacts with integrins and the extracellular matrix, playing a role in cell adhesion (Chou2020An). The cysteine-rich domain can bind ECM independently of the disintegrin-integrin interaction (Chou2020An). The EGF-like domain's function is not fully understood, but it is present in most ADAMs except ADAM10 and ADAM17 (Chou2020An).

ADAM9 exists in two forms: ADAM9-L, the complete transmembrane form, and ADAM9-S, a shorter secreted form lacking certain domains due to a mutation (Chou2020An; Haoyuan2020Structure). The intracellular tail contains potential SH3 binding sites, influencing catalytic activity and intracellular trafficking (Chou2020An). Post-translational modifications, such as cleavage by meprin β, can enhance its protease activity (Chou2020An).

## Function
ADAM9 is a membrane-anchored protein involved in various physiological functions in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in cell adhesion, ectodomain shedding of cell surface proteins, and cell signaling, influencing developmental processes, inflammation, and degenerative diseases (Chou2020An). ADAM9 is expressed in multiple tissues, including monocytes, macrophages, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and various organs, contributing to processes such as monocyte fusion, inflammatory responses, and angiogenic signaling pathways (Chou2020An).

The protein contains several domains, including a metalloprotease domain essential for its catalytic activity, a disintegrin domain that interacts with integrins, and a transmembrane domain that anchors it to the cell membrane (Chou2020An). ADAM9 is initially synthesized as an inactive zymogen and becomes active through cleavage by furin-like proprotein convertases (Chou2020An).

ADAM9 is involved in the shedding of membrane-bound cytokines and growth factors, influencing cell signaling and adhesion (Chou2020An). It also plays a role in the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, potentially reducing amyloid beta-peptide production, which is relevant in Alzheimer's disease (Chou2020An). Despite its wide distribution, ADAM9 deficiency in mice does not result in significant morphological changes, suggesting compensation by other ADAM family members (Chou2020An).

## Clinical Significance
ADAM9 is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In cancer, ADAM9 overexpression is linked to tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. It is involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), lung cancer, colon carcinoma, and bladder cancer, where its expression affects cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Haoyuan2020Structure). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ADAM9 enhances cell adhesion and invasion, particularly associated with brain metastases (Shintani2004Overexpression). In prostate and pancreatic cancers, elevated ADAM9 levels correlate with disease progression and poor survival outcomes (Oria2018The).

ADAM9 also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases. It is involved in Alzheimer's disease by cleaving the amyloid precursor protein, potentially reducing amyloid beta-peptide production (Cong2011Promoter). In retinal diseases, mutations in ADAM9 are linked to cone-rod dystrophy, affecting photoreceptor function and visual acuity (Kropatsch2010Generalized).

In inflammatory conditions, ADAM9 is associated with acute lung injury and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where it promotes emphysema development (Chou2020An). Its expression is also upregulated in abdominal aortic aneurysms, contributing to inflammatory cascades (Chou2020An).

## Interactions
ADAM9 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis. In prostate cancer, ADAM9's stability is maintained through its interaction with N-α-Acetyltransferase 10 protein (Naa10p), which prevents its degradation and promotes tumor growth and metastasis (Chou2020An). ADAM9 also interacts with integrin β1, affecting its endocytosis and stability, which influences cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, with both proteins co-localizing on early endosomes (Chou2020An).

In liver cancer, ADAM9 cleaves membrane-bound MICA to release soluble MICA, acting as an immunological decoy to suppress immune surveillance (Chou2020An). In pancreatic cancer, circular ADAM9 (circ-ADAM9) interacts with miR-127, a tumor suppressor, inhibiting it and promoting ERK signaling, which enhances cell proliferation and migration (Chou2020An).

ADAM9's disintegrin domain interacts with multiple β1 integrins, including α1, α3, α6, αv, and β1 subunits, regulating cell-matrix adhesion (MAHIMKAR2005The). In lung metastasis, ADAM9 on tumor cells binds to platelet integrin α6β1, facilitating platelet adhesion and activation, which promotes tumor cell extravasation (MammadovaBach2016Platelet).
