# LZTS3

## Overview
LZTS3, or leucine zipper tumor suppressor family member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, including inflammation regulation and apoptosis. The protein, also named LZTS3, is categorized as a tumor suppressor and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with various cellular components to maintain normal cell function and prevent tumorigenesis (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). LZTS3 modulates inflammatory responses by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and plays a role in apoptosis regulation by influencing the expression of apoptotic proteins (Liang2024Thalidomide). It is also implicated in cancer biology, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, where its expression is regulated by microRNA miR-1275, affecting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (he2018mir). The protein's interactions with other members of the leucine zipper tumor suppressor family and its potential regulatory role in kinase activity further underscore its significance in cellular signaling pathways related to tumor suppression (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization).

## Function
LZTS3 (leucine zipper tumor suppressor family member 3) is involved in several critical cellular processes, including the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis. In oral epithelial cells, LZTS3 modulates inflammatory responses by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-6, and TNF-α. It achieves this by affecting the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, a key factor in inflammation, thereby reducing its translocation into the nucleus and potentially diminishing inflammatory responses (Liang2024Thalidomide).

LZTS3 also plays a role in apoptosis regulation. Its upregulation is associated with increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9, indicating an anti-apoptotic effect (Liang2024Thalidomide). In the context of cancer, LZTS3 is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor, with its expression linked to reduced cell proliferation and migration (Feng2020Long).

The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with other cellular components to maintain normal cell function and prevent tumorigenesis (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). Its precise role in healthy human cells, however, remains less well-defined.

## Clinical Significance
LZTS3 (leucine zipper tumor suppressor family member 3) is implicated in various cancers, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alterations in LZTS3 expression are associated with cancer progression due to its role in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. In NSCLC, the expression of LZTS3 is regulated by microRNA miR-1275, which is up-regulated in cancerous tissues. This up-regulation of miR-1275 leads to decreased LZTS3 expression, promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (he2018mir). 

The long non-coding RNA PGM5P4-AS1 has been shown to inhibit lung cancer progression by sponging miR-1275, thereby increasing LZTS3 expression. This interaction suggests that PGM5P4-AS1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA, modulating the miR-1275/LZTS3 axis. The down-regulation of PGM5P4-AS1 results in increased miR-1275 levels and decreased LZTS3 expression, contributing to enhanced cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conversely, overexpression of PGM5P4-AS1 suppresses these malignant behaviors by up-regulating LZTS3 (Feng2020Long). 

These findings highlight the potential of targeting the miR-1275/LZTS3 axis as a therapeutic strategy in lung cancer, emphasizing the clinical significance of LZTS3 expression alterations in oncogenesis.

## Interactions
LZTS3, a member of the leucine zipper tumor suppressor family, is known to interact with the DYRK1A protein, a kinase involved in various cellular processes. Although the specific effects of LZTS3 on DYRK1A activity have not been thoroughly analyzed, it is suggested that LZTS3 might contribute to the residual activity of DYRK1A when LZTS1 or LZTS2 are knocked down, indicating a potential regulatory role in DYRK1A's function (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). 

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LZTS3 expression is regulated by miR-1275. The dual luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that miR-1275 directly regulates LZTS3, suggesting a role in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (he2018mir). 

While specific protein interactions involving LZTS3 are not extensively detailed, its relationship with other LZTS family members, such as LZTS1 and LZTS2, and its potential involvement in the DYRK1A interaction network, highlight its significance in cellular signaling pathways related to tumor suppression and neurological disorders (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization).
