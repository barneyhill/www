# ZFP36L1

## Overview
ZFP36L1 is a gene that encodes the ZFP36 ring finger protein like 1, a member of the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its tandem zinc finger (TZF) domains, which facilitate binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of target mRNAs, leading to their degradation. ZFP36L1 plays a pivotal role in regulating mRNA stability and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses. It is particularly significant in monocyte and macrophage differentiation, as well as in the regulation of inflammatory cytokine production and vascular development. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its stability and interaction with other proteins and complexes, such as the CCR4-NOT complex. Alterations in the expression or function of ZFP36L1 have been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Bell2006The; Loh2020RNABinding; Kaehler2021ZFP36L1).

## Structure
The ZFP36L1 protein is characterized by its tandem zinc finger (TZF) domains, which are crucial for binding to AU-rich elements in mRNA. These domains contain a CCCH-type zinc finger motif, consisting of cysteines and histidines that coordinate zinc ions, essential for RNA-binding activity (Frederick2008A; Lai2019The). The presence of zinc transforms the TZF domain from an unstructured to a folded state, even in the absence of RNA (Lai2019The).

The C-terminal region of ZFP36L1 includes a serine-rich cluster spanning amino acids 241-338, which is highly disordered and evolutionarily conserved. This region is divided into an ordered segment (amino acids 241-274) and a disordered segment (amino acids 275-322), with the latter containing major phosphorylation sites critical for nuclear localization (Matsuura2020Nuclear). Phosphorylation within this serine-rich cluster influences the protein's nuclear accumulation and stability, with different phosphorylation patterns potentially affecting its localization and function (Matsuura2020Nuclear).

ZFP36L1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its stability and function (Matsuura2020Nuclear). The protein also exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their regulatory roles and interactions.

## Function
ZFP36L1 is a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and degradation. It binds to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of target mRNAs, leading to their decay. This activity is essential for controlling gene expression related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses (MartínezCalle2019Epigenomic; Loh2020RNABinding).

In healthy human cells, ZFP36L1 plays a significant role in monocyte and macrophage differentiation by repressing CDK6, a key regulator of cell cycle progression. This repression facilitates the differentiation process, which is vital for normal hematopoiesis (Chen2015ZFP36L1). ZFP36L1 also inhibits cell proliferation in a cyclin D-dependent and p53-independent manner, contributing to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase (Suk2018ZFP36L1).

ZFP36L1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates the stability of mRNAs involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of inflammatory cytokine production (Loh2020RNABinding). It also plays a role in vascular development by post-transcriptionally regulating VEGF expression, which is crucial for normal vascularization and heart development (Bell2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZFP36L1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. ZFP36L1 is frequently mutated and epigenetically silenced in bladder and breast carcinomas, with its mutation rate comparable to other oncogenic drivers like RB1 and TP53 (Loh2020RNABinding). In bladder cancer, ZFP36L1 is significantly mutated and underexpressed, which is associated with worse survival outcomes (Loh2020RNABinding). The gene's downregulation is often due to somatic mutations, deletions, or DNA/histone methylation, particularly in enhancer regions, leading to its inactivation (MartínezCalle2019Epigenomic).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), ZFP36L1 expression is deregulated and increases during the development of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib. This suggests a complex role in cell cycle regulation and drug resistance (Kaehler2021ZFP36L1). ZFP36L1 also negatively regulates CDKN1A, a cell cycle inhibitor, indicating that it may not always act as a tumor suppressor (Kaehler2021ZFP36L1).

Overall, alterations in ZFP36L1 expression or function can impact cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
ZFP36L1 is an RNA-binding protein that interacts with adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, leading to their degradation. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of mRNA stability and is mediated through AUUUA motifs present in the 3' UTRs of target genes such as HIF1A, CCND1, and E2F1 (Loh2020RNABinding). ZFP36L1 also interacts with the CCR4-NOT complex, a multiprotein complex involved in mRNA decay, to facilitate deadenylation of ARE-containing mRNAs (Otsuka2020AREbinding). 

The protein's interaction with the CCR4-NOT complex is significant for its role in mRNA translation repression, which can occur independently of deadenylation (Otsuka2020AREbinding). ZFP36L1's function is influenced by its interaction with other proteins, such as its paralog ZFP36L2, suggesting a regulatory crosstalk within the ZFP36 family (Loh2020RNABinding). Additionally, ZFP36L1 is a downstream target of protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), ERK/RSK, and MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), with phosphorylation affecting its interaction with the CCR4-NOT complex and influencing RNA stability (Loh2020RNABinding).
