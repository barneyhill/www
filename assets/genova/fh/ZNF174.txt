# ZNF174

## Overview
ZNF174 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 174, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its DNA-binding capabilities. The protein plays a crucial role as a transcription factor, primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. It contains a SCAN domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, allowing it to form both homodimers and heterodimers with other SCAN domain-containing proteins. This dimerization is essential for its function in transcriptional regulation, influencing the expression of genes involved in growth and development, such as PDGF-B and TGF-β1 (Collins2005The; Sander2003The). ZNF174's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, which affect its stability and interactions within the cellular environment. The protein's ability to form complex regulatory networks through selective dimerization underscores its significance in cellular processes and transcriptional control (Noll2008Heterodimer; Stone2002The).

## Structure
ZNF174 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. The primary structure of ZNF174 is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which are essential for the coordination of zinc ions. These residues contribute to the formation of the zinc finger motifs that define the protein's function and stability.

The secondary structure of ZNF174 includes both beta sheets and alpha helices, which are typical of zinc finger proteins. These structural elements facilitate the protein's interaction with DNA, allowing it to bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression.

The tertiary structure of ZNF174 is stabilized by the coordination of zinc ions, which help maintain the integrity of the zinc finger domains. This coordination is critical for the protein's structural conformation and its ability to interact with DNA.

Post-translational modifications of ZNF174 may include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can influence the protein's activity, stability, and interactions with other molecules. These modifications play a role in regulating the protein's function within the cell. The presence of these modifications suggests that ZNF174 is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms that modulate its activity in response to cellular signals.

## Function
ZNF174 is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a role in transcriptional regulation by binding to specific DNA sequences. It contains a SCAN domain, a conserved dimerization motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions, but does not directly activate or repress transcription (Collins2005The). The SCAN domain allows ZNF174 to form dimers, which can increase the selectivity of protein-DNA interactions, potentially influencing the transcriptional regulation of target genes (Collins2005The).

ZNF174 has been shown to selectively repress the promoter-reporter expression of growth factors such as PDGF-B and TGF-β1, indicating its involvement in regulating these factors (Sander2003The). This repression suggests a role in modulating cellular processes related to growth and development. The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell by modulating the expression of target genes (Sander2003The).

The SCAN domain of ZNF174 also participates in forming heterodimeric complexes with other SCAN domain-containing proteins, such as MZF1, which may influence the distribution of nuclear protein complexes and contribute to the regulation of gene expression (Noll2008Heterodimer).

## Interactions
ZNF174, a zinc finger protein, is known to participate in various protein-protein interactions primarily through its SCAN domain. This domain facilitates the formation of both homodimers and heterodimers, which are crucial for its function in transcription regulation. The SCAN domain of ZNF174 forms stable homodimers, as demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography and equilibrium sedimentation analysis (Stone2002The). These homodimers exhibit significant alpha-helical content and high thermodynamic stability, with a melting temperature of 75°C (Stone2002The).

ZNF174 also engages in selective heterodimerization with other SCAN domain-containing proteins. It can form heterodimers with proteins such as MZF1, ZNF24, and ZNF202, indicating its role in assembling regulatory protein networks (Noll2008Heterodimer; Maksimenko2021CTCF). However, ZNF174 does not interact with all SCAN domains, as shown by its lack of interaction with Zfp206 (Liang2012Structural).

These interactions are important for the functional regulation of transcription factors, as the SCAN domain's ability to dimerize may enhance the selectivity of protein-DNA interactions, similar to the bZIP protein family (Collins2005The).
