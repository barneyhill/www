# C1D

## Overview
The C1D gene encodes the C1D nuclear receptor corepressor protein, a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as RNA processing and DNA repair. This protein is categorized as a nuclear receptor corepressor and is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability. The C1D protein is characterized by the presence of the Sas10/C1D domain, which facilitates its interactions with nucleic acids and other proteins, including DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and components of the exosome complex (Mitchell2010Rrp47; Jackson2016C1D). Through these interactions, C1D is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and the processing of pre-rRNA, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and stress response pathways (Schilders2007C1D; Yavuzer1998DNA). The gene's role in these pathways highlights its potential clinical significance, particularly in conditions related to genomic instability and immune responses (Tomita2018C1D).

## Structure
The C1D nuclear receptor corepressor protein is a small, 16-kDa mammalian nuclear matrix protein involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin folding and DNA binding (Jackson2016C1D). It contains the Sas10/C1D domain, a helical structure approximately 80 amino acids long, which forms a binding surface for interactions with RNA or DNA (Mitchell2010Rrp47). This domain is crucial for the protein's function in RNA processing and DNA repair (Jackson2016C1D).

C1D is known to interact with DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a key player in DNA double-strand break repair, and has high DNA affinity (Mitchell2010Rrp47). It can be phosphorylated by DNA-dependent protein kinase, although the in vivo significance of this modification is not fully understood (Mitchell2010Rrp47). The protein also interacts with other components involved in DNA repair, such as xeroderma pigmentosum B (XPB) and TRAX, suggesting a role in nucleotide excision repair (Jackson2016C1D).

C1D's yeast homologue, Rrp47, has been structurally characterized as an α-helix rich protein, with some helices interacting with Rrp6, enhancing its stability (Tomita2018C1D). However, specific details about the tertiary or quaternary structure of C1D itself are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The C1D protein is a nuclear receptor corepressor involved in several critical cellular processes, including RNA processing, DNA repair, and maintaining genomic stability. In healthy human cells, C1D is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in pre-rRNA processing. It forms a complex with the exosome subunit PM/Scl-100 and MPP6, which is essential for the nucleolar localization of C1D and the maturation of 5.8S rRNA. This complex is involved in the 3'-5' processing of nucleolar RNA, highlighting C1D's role in RNA processing (Schilders2007C1D).

C1D also participates in DNA damage response pathways, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). It interacts with DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), facilitating the repair process by potentially targeting DNA-PK to the nuclear matrix (Yavuzer1998DNA; Jackson2016C1D). Additionally, C1D is implicated in protecting cells from oxidative stress by regulating gene expression, although it is not directly involved in the repair of UV-damaged DNA (Tomita2018C1D).

Overall, C1D's functions in RNA processing and DNA repair are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function, underscoring its importance in cell biology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the C1D gene have potential clinical significance, particularly in conditions involving oxidative stress and immune responses. C1D is implicated in maintaining genomic stability and cellular responses to stress, which are crucial for preventing diseases such as cancer. Alterations in C1D expression can affect the regulation of stress-related genes, such as DDIT3 and APEX1, which may influence cell survival and stress response pathways (Tomita2018C1D). 

C1D's interaction with DNA-PK suggests its involvement in DNA double-strand break repair, and disruptions in this interaction could compromise DNA repair mechanisms, potentially leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis (Mitchell2010Rrp47). Additionally, an autoantibody against C1D has been identified in patients with polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome, indicating a possible role in autoimmune conditions (Tomita2018C1D). 

While the direct clinical implications of C1D mutations are not fully addressed, the gene's role in transcription regulation and DNA repair suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders (Tomita2018C1D).

## Interactions
The C1D protein interacts with several other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. C1D forms a heterotrimeric complex with MPP6 and PM/Scl-100, which is crucial for its role in RNA processing. This interaction is essential for the nucleolar localization of C1D, as the knock-down of PM/Scl-100 disrupts C1D's nucleolar accumulation (Schilders2007C1D). C1D also binds directly to the exosome subunit PM/Scl-100, and this interaction is not mutually exclusive with MPP6 binding to PM/Scl-100 (Schilders2007C1D).

C1D interacts with DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), specifically binding to its catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). This interaction is direct and does not require DNA, although C1D can activate DNA-PK in the presence of supercoiled plasmid DNA (Yavuzer1998DNA). C1D is also phosphorylated by DNA-PK, indicating its role as a substrate for this kinase (Yavuzer1998DNA).

In the context of DNA repair, C1D interacts with XPB, a component of the nucleotide excision repair pathway, to facilitate DNA repair following UV radiation (Jackson2016C1D). C1D competes with TRAX for binding to Translin at sites of double-strand breaks, potentially influencing recombination during DNA damage (Jackson2016C1D).
