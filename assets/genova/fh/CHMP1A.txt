# CHMP1A

## Overview
The CHMP1A gene encodes the charged multivesicular body protein 1A, a crucial component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-III). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane remodeling, multivesicular body formation, and endosomal sorting. CHMP1A is characterized by its dual localization in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it performs distinct functions. In the cytoplasm, it participates in the trafficking and degradation of ubiquitinated transmembrane receptor proteins, while in the nucleus, it influences chromatin modification and cell cycle regulation by interacting with the Polycomb group protein BMI1 (Mochida2012CHMP1A; Tsang2006A). The protein's involvement in the secretion of Sonic Hedgehog on extracellular vesicles is vital for neuroprogenitor proliferation during brain development (Coulter2018The). Mutations in CHMP1A are linked to neurological disorders such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 8 and microcephaly, highlighting its significance in cerebellar development and cellular homeostasis (Mochida2012CHMP1A; He2023Novel).

## Structure
The CHMP1A protein is a member of the ESCRT-III complex, which is involved in multivesicular body formation and endosomal sorting. The primary structure of CHMP1A consists of 196 amino acids encoded by the CHMP1A gene, structured across seven exons (Mochida2012CHMP1A). The protein features a basic N-terminal half containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and an acidic C-terminal half with a MIT-interacting motif (MIM) domain (Manohar2011Chromatin). The NLS is crucial for the protein's growth inhibition function, while the MIM domain is necessary for interaction with proteins containing a microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain (Manohar2011Chromatin).

CHMP1A can localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with its nuclear presence being significant for its role in chromatin modification and cell cycle regulation (Mochida2012CHMP1A; Tsang2006A). The protein interacts with the Polycomb-group protein BMI1, influencing chromatin structure and cell cycle progression (Manohar2011Chromatin). CHMP1A also has splice variant isoforms, as aberrant transcripts with insertions have been identified in affected individuals (Mochida2012CHMP1A). However, detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as specific post-translational modifications, is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CHMP1A gene encodes a protein that is a component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is essential for various cellular processes, including membrane remodeling and the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Tsang2006A; Li2008Chmp1A). In healthy human cells, CHMP1A is involved in the trafficking and degradation of ubiquitinated transmembrane receptor proteins by facilitating their transport to lysosomes (Mochida2012CHMP1A). It plays a critical role in the secretion of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) on a specific subtype of extracellular vesicles (EVs), known as ART-EVs, which is vital for neuroprogenitor proliferation during brain development (Coulter2018The).

CHMP1A is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it has distinct functions. In the cytoplasm, it is involved in the ESCRT-III complex's role in endosomal sorting and vesicle formation (Tsang2006A). In the nucleus, CHMP1A is suggested to recruit the Polycomb group transcriptional repressor BMI1 to heterochromatin, influencing cell cycle regulation and cerebellar development (Mochida2012CHMP1A). The protein's dual localization and functionality suggest its involvement in multiple cellular processes, including chromatin modification and vesicular trafficking (Tsang2006A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHMP1A gene are associated with several neurological and developmental disorders. One of the primary conditions linked to CHMP1A mutations is pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 8 (PCH8), a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by reduced volume of the pons and cerebellum, severe psychomotor delay, abnormal movements, hypotonia, and visual defects. This condition follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and is caused by pathogenic variants in CHMP1A, such as novel compound heterozygous variations identified in recent studies (He2023Novel). 

CHMP1A mutations have also been implicated in microcephaly, a condition marked by an abnormally small head size, often accompanied by developmental delays and neurological impairments (Mochida2012CHMP1A). The gene's role in cerebellar development is crucial, as evidenced by studies showing that mutations can lead to cerebellar dysplasia and impaired cell proliferation (Mochida2012CHMP1A).

In addition to neurological disorders, alterations in CHMP1A expression have been linked to kidney disease development through mechanisms involving ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death. CHMP1A is involved in exosome formation, and its deficiency can lead to increased susceptibility to kidney damage, particularly in the context of cisplatin-induced injury (Guan2021A).

## Interactions
CHMP1A, a component of the ESCRT-III complex, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with other CHMP proteins, such as CHMP1B and CHMP4, within the ESCRT-III complex, suggesting a role in multivesicular body formation and endosomal sorting (Tsang2006A). CHMP1A also interacts with VPS4A, a protein involved in the disassembly of the ESCRT-III complex, indicating its participation in membrane remodeling (Tsang2006A).

In the nucleus, CHMP1A interacts with proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, such as SSRP1 and SMARCA4, which suggests a role in regulating chromatin structure and cell cycle progression (Tsang2006A). It also interacts with the Polycomb group protein BMI1, which is involved in transcriptional repression and chromatin modification (Mochida2012CHMP1A).

CHMP1A is involved in the sumoylation process through interactions with UBE2I, a SUMO conjugating enzyme, and other proteins like PIAS2 and HIPK2, which are involved in nuclear sumoylation (Tsang2006A). These interactions highlight CHMP1A's diverse roles in both cytoplasmic and nuclear functions.
