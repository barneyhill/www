# MYL4

## Overview
MYL4, or myosin light chain 4, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to muscle contraction, particularly within cardiac tissues. The protein, categorized as a component of the myosin complex, plays a pivotal role in regulating actin-myosin interactions, which are essential for muscle contraction and cellular motility. MYL4 is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, with a notable presence in the atria and a transient expression in fetal and neonatal ventricular tissues. This expression pattern diminishes with age, especially in males, suggesting a sex-based difference in its regulation (Wang2019Human). The protein enhances cross-bridge kinetics and calcium ion sensitivity, thereby augmenting force production in cardiac muscle fibers (Sitbon2019Insights). Despite its established roles, the full spectrum of MYL4's functions, particularly its mosaic expression pattern, remains incompletely understood (Wang2019Human).

## Structure


## Function
MYL4 (myosin light chain 4) encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in muscle contraction, particularly in cardiac tissues. In healthy human cells, MYL4 is involved in the regulation of actin-myosin interactions, which are essential for muscle contraction and cellular motility. This protein is primarily active in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, contributing significantly to heart function and muscle development (Sitbon2019Insights).

MYL4 is robustly expressed in the atria and is universally present in fetal and neonatal ventricular tissues. However, its expression in ventricular cardiomyocytes decreases significantly from infancy to about five years of age, resulting in a mosaic pattern (Wang2019Human). This pattern is more pronounced in males, suggesting a sex-based difference in expression (Wang2019Human).

The protein encoded by MYL4 is part of the myosin complex, which is crucial for muscle contraction and cellular movement. It enhances cross-bridge kinetics and sensitivity to calcium ions, thereby increasing force production in cardiac muscle fibers (Wang2019Human). Despite its known roles in muscle contraction, the precise function of MYL4 in healthy human cells remains not fully understood, particularly regarding its mosaic expression pattern (Wang2019Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYL4 gene have been linked to several cardiac conditions, most notably atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial cardiomyopathy. A specific missense mutation, c.31G>A (p.E11K), has been identified as a causal variant for atrial cardiomyopathy, characterized by atrial-selective electromechanical dysfunction, tachyarrhythmias, and bradyarrhythmias. This mutation leads to reduced myosin ATPase activity, contributing to early-onset atrial fibrillation and atrial contractile dysfunction (Peng2017Dysfunction; Orr2016A). 

The MYL4 gene is crucial for maintaining atrial electrical, contractile, and structural integrity. Dysfunction in MYL4, whether through knockout or targeted knock-in of the human mutation, results in early atrial fibrosis and is associated with enhanced proapoptotic and profibrotic signaling, leading to atrial arrhythmia, contractile failure, and enlargement (Peng2017Dysfunction). 

In addition to the p.E11K mutation, a frameshift deletion (c.234delC) in MYL4 has been associated with early-onset familial atrial fibrillation under a recessive model, significantly increasing the risk of the condition (Gudbjartsson2016A). These genetic alterations highlight the role of MYL4 in atrial-specific cardiomyopathy and its potential impact on cardiac health.

## Interactions
MYL4, or myosin light chain 4, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in muscle contraction. It is a component of the myosin complex and interacts with myosin heavy chains and actin filaments, playing a significant role in muscle contraction and regulation. The binding affinity of MYL4 to actin is influenced by its isoforms, with hALC-1 (atrial-specific) showing a lower affinity for actin compared to hVLC-1 (ventricular-specific), which affects muscle contractile activity (Petzhold2014Distinct).

Mutations in MYL4, such as the E11K mutation, disrupt its interaction with actin, leading to destabilization of the F-actin-Z-disk complex. This disruption impairs calcium signaling and sarcomere structure, contributing to atrial myopathy and arrhythmias (Orr2016A). MYL4 also interacts with other proteins in muscle development pathways, such as MYL5 and ACTC1, indicating its role in muscle growth and signaling (Ye2024The).

In the context of atrial cardiomyopathy, MYL4 mutations have been shown to reduce myosin ATPase activity, affecting force production and contributing to the disease phenotype (Peng2017Dysfunction). These interactions highlight the importance of MYL4 in maintaining muscle function and integrity.
