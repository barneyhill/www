# TCL1B

## Overview
TCL1B is a gene that encodes the protein TCL1 family AKT coactivator B, which is a member of the TCL1 family of proteins. This family is characterized by a unique symmetrical beta-barrel structure that plays a crucial role in its function as an AKT kinase co-activator (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene). The TCL1B protein enhances the activity of AKT, a serine/threonine kinase, by forming stable complexes with it, thereby promoting its phosphorylation and subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways (Teitell2005The). This interaction is significant in cellular processes such as cell survival, growth, and metabolism. TCL1B is primarily expressed during early embryogenesis and in specific fetal and adult tissues, and its dysregulation is associated with various malignancies, including lymphoid and non-lymphoid cancers (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene; Teitell2005The). The gene's role in oncogenesis makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene).

## Structure
The TCL1B protein is a member of the TCL1 family, characterized by a unique symmetrical beta-barrel structure. This structure is shared among the TCL1 family proteins, including TCL1, TCL1B, and MTCP1, and is crucial for its function as an AKT kinase co-activator (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene). The beta-barrel fold facilitates interactions with AKT, enhancing its kinase activity, which is a key aspect of its oncogenic potential (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene).

The tertiary structure of TCL1B, like other TCL1 family proteins, features an 8-stranded beta-barrel with a unique topology. This includes a long surface loop and a short helical region that separates two 4-stranded pseudo-symmetric 'half-barrel' structures, which are important for protein-protein interactions (Petock2002Crystal). The protein's molecular surface is semi-planar, a characteristic that supports its role in binding with AKT (Petock2002Crystal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity of TCL1B, although specific sites are not detailed in the context provided. The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to splice variants, which could result in functional diversity (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene). The quaternary structure details, such as oligomerization states, are not specified for TCL1B in the provided context.

## Function
TCL1B, a member of the TCL1 family of genes, plays a significant role in the regulation of the AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival, growth, and metabolism. The protein encoded by TCL1B acts as a coactivator of AKT kinase, enhancing its activity by forming stable complexes with AKT at the cytoplasmic membrane. This interaction facilitates the phosphorylation of AKT, particularly at Ser473, thereby promoting AKT's kinase activity and influencing downstream signaling pathways (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene; Teitell2005The).

In healthy human cells, TCL1B is primarily expressed during early embryogenesis and in specific fetal and adult tissues, including the fetal liver, kidney, thymus, testis, spleen, tonsil, bone marrow, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (Teitell2005The). The protein's activity is crucial for proper cell proliferation and survival, acting as a signaling rheostat that regulates AKT signal transduction in a concentration-dependent manner (Teitell2005The). The expression of TCL1B is tightly regulated, and its dysregulation is associated with various lymphoid malignancies, although the precise mechanisms in healthy cells are not fully understood (Teitell2005The).

## Clinical Significance
The TCL1B gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role as an Akt kinase co-activator, enhancing Akt activity and promoting oncogenic signaling pathways. Alterations in TCL1B expression are associated with the development of angiosarcoma, a rare cancer originating from endothelial cells. Transgenic mice overexpressing TCL1B have been shown to develop angiosarcoma, suggesting a direct link between TCL1B dysregulation and tumorigenesis (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene).

In human cancers, TCL1B is frequently overexpressed in a range of non-lymphoid malignancies, including cancers of the head and neck, esophagus, stomach, liver, bile duct, pancreas, and lung. This widespread expression indicates its potential involvement in various cancer types beyond hematological malignancies (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene).

The dysregulation of TCL1B, along with other TCL1 family members, is also linked to T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). In T-PLL, TCL1B overexpression is associated with chromosomal rearrangements and enhanced Akt signaling, contributing to the pathogenesis of this aggressive leukemia (Schrader2018Actionable; Teitell2005The). The development of TCL1B inhibitors, such as 'TCL1b-Akt-in', highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in treating these malignancies (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene).

## Interactions
TCL1B interacts with the serine/threonine kinase AKT, enhancing its kinase activity. This interaction is facilitated by the formation of stable heteromeric complexes at the cytoplasmic membrane, acting as a signaling rheostat to regulate AKT signal transduction in a concentration-dependent manner (Teitell2005The). TCL1B enhances AKT kinase activity through a mechanism involving dimerization-mediated transphosphorylation, similar to the related protooncogene TCL1 (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene). This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells, such as 293T and COS-7 cells (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene).

TCL1B's interaction with AKT is specific, as it binds to AKT1 and AKT2, but not to AKT3, which only interacts with TCL1A (Teitell2005The). The interaction involves the AKT PH domain, enhancing AKT's kinase activity and its transport to the nucleus, potentially leading to cell proliferation (Petock2001Structure). This interaction is crucial for the oncogenic potential of TCL1B, as it promotes oncogenic signaling pathways similar to those activated by Myr-Akt and TCL1 (Hashimoto2013Protooncogene).
