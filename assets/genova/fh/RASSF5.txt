# RASSF5

## Overview
RASSF5, also known as Ras association domain family member 5, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a tumor suppressor, primarily involved in the Hippo signaling pathway. The protein, often referred to as NORE1A, is characterized by several domains, including a Ras association (RA) domain, a SARAH (Sav-RASSF-Hippo) domain, and a C1-type zinc finger domain, which facilitate its interactions with Ras-like GTPases and other components of the Hippo pathway (Hossain2020In; van2007The). RASSF5 plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis by activating MST1/2 kinases, leading to the suppression of oncogenic processes (Liao2017The). The gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, and its inactivation through mechanisms such as CpG hypermethylation is associated with various cancers (Richter2009The; Park2010Tumor). Understanding the molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms of RASSF5 is essential for elucidating its role in tumor suppression and potential therapeutic applications.

## Structure
The RASSF5 protein, also known as NORE1A, is a tumor suppressor that plays a significant role in the Hippo signaling pathway. It contains several key domains, including a Ras association (RA) domain, a SARAH (Sav-RASSF-Hippo) domain, and a C1-type zinc finger domain (Hossain2020In; van2007The). The RA domain is crucial for binding to GTP-bound Ras, facilitating interactions with Ras-like GTPases (Hossain2020In; van2007The). The SARAH domain forms an antiparallel coiled coil structure, which can exist as a heterodimer with MST1/2 or as a homodimer with another RASSF5, with the heterodimeric interaction being stronger due to electrostatic attractions (Liao2017The).

RASSF5 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including RASSF5A (NORE1A) and RASSF5C (NORE1B), which contain both the RA and SARAH domains, while RASSF5B lacks the SARAH domain (Richter2009The). The protein's structure is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Hossain2020In). The SARAH domain's interaction with the RA domain is transient, allowing for the activation of MST kinases upon Ras binding (Liao2017The).

## Function
RASSF5, also known as NORE1A, is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a critical role in regulating several cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the modulation of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is essential for controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis. RASSF5 activates MST1/2 kinases by forming a SARAH heterodimer, leading to a kinase cascade that results in the phosphorylation and degradation of YAP1, a transcriptional co-activator. This process suppresses cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis, thereby preventing tumor growth (Liao2017The).

RASSF5 interacts with Ras GTPases through its Ras association (RA) domain, linking the Ras and Hippo pathways. This interaction is crucial for the activation of MST1/2 and the subsequent signaling cascade that limits cell proliferation and stimulates apoptosis (Liao2017The; Hossain2020In). Additionally, RASSF5 is involved in cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and senescence, acting as a growth inhibitor through processes involving p53 (Hossain2020In; Djos2012The).

RASSF5 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular processes such as growth inhibition and senescence. Its inactivation is associated with oncogenesis and increased cell proliferation in various cancers (Hossain2020In; Volodko2014RASSF).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RASSF5 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. RASSF5 is frequently inactivated in various cancers through mechanisms such as CpG hypermethylation, which leads to reduced expression and impaired tumor suppressor function (Park2010Tumor; Djos2012The). In neuroblastoma, RASSF5 is often methylated, especially in MYCN-amplified tumors, suggesting a role in tumor progression and aggressiveness (Djos2012The). 

The gene's interaction with Ras proteins is crucial for its tumor-suppressing activities. Mutations in the Ras association domain, such as P350R, F321L, and R277W, can decrease protein stability and disrupt binding with H-Ras, potentially leading to oncogenesis (Hossain2020In). These mutations may impair the Hippo signaling pathway, which is vital for tumor suppression (Hossain2020In).

RASSF5 is also regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, which promotes its degradation. This process is influenced by acetylation, with hyperacetylation preventing degradation and potentially affecting RASSF5's tumor suppressor functions (Suryaraja2013The). These findings highlight the complex regulation of RASSF5 and its critical role in cancer development.

## Interactions
RASSF5, also known as NORE1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a tumor suppressor. It interacts with the proapoptotic kinase MST1, a mammalian homolog of Hippo, to mediate apoptosis. This interaction is essential for the activation of MST1, which is involved in apoptosis through phosphorylation of histone H2B and the transcription factor FOXO3a (Park2010Tumor). RASSF5 also forms complexes with other proteins in the Hippo signaling pathway, including WW45, LATS1, and YAP1, although these interactions occur at substoichiometric levels (Park2010Tumor).

The SARAH domain of RASSF5 plays a critical role in its interactions, particularly with MST1/2. The SARAH domain forms a heterodimer with MST1/2, facilitating kinase domain dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation, which leads to cell apoptosis (Liao2017The). The interaction between the SARAH domain of RASSF5 and MST2 is characterized by strong electrostatic contributions, with specific residues such as E385, E388, and R403 in RASSF5 being crucial for the dimer interface (Liao2017The).

RASSF5 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, which regulates its stability. Itch promotes the degradation of the RASSF5A isoform via the 26S proteasome pathway, a process that is dependent on Itch's catalytic activity (Suryaraja2013The). This interaction is modulated by acetylation, which negatively regulates the binding between RASSF5 and Itch, thereby stabilizing RASSF5 in transformed cells (Suryaraja2013The).
