# CTSC

## Overview
The CTSC gene encodes the protein cathepsin C, a lysosomal cysteine protease that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by activating various serine proteases. Cathepsin C is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and undergoes a maturation process to become an active tetrameric enzyme. This enzyme is crucial for the activation of pro-inflammatory neutrophil serine proteases, which are essential for immune defense mechanisms, including microbial killing and inflammation regulation. The CTSC gene is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the lungs, spleen, kidneys, and liver, and its protein product is active in the lysosomal or endosomal compartments of cells. Mutations in the CTSC gene are linked to several genetic disorders, including Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome and Haim-Munk syndrome, which are characterized by severe periodontitis and other systemic symptoms due to impaired immune function (Chitsamankhun2024Cathepsin; Ketterer2017Inherited).

## Structure
Cathepsin C (CTSC) is a lysosomal cysteine protease with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of CTSC includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, and the mature enzyme. The secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a papain-like fold in the tertiary structure (Chitsamankhun2024Cathepsin; Turk2001Structure).

The quaternary structure of CTSC is a tetramer, consisting of four identical subunits. Each subunit is composed of an N-terminal fragment, a heavy chain, and a light chain. The N-terminal fragment folds into a beta-barrel structure, which is crucial for the enzyme's dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity (Turk2001Structure). The enzyme's active sites are located on the outside of the structure, allowing it to bind four molecules of cystatin per oligomer (Turk2001Structure).

A unique feature of CTSC is the exclusion domain, which transforms the papain-like endopeptidase framework into a robust oligomeric protease-processing enzyme. This domain is an enclosed structure that folds independently, forming an up-and-down beta-barrel with eight antiparallel beta-strands (Turk2001Structure). The exclusion domain plays a significant role in modulating substrate specificity and stability by blocking access to certain binding sites (Chitsamankhun2024Cathepsin; Turk2001Structure). 

CTSC requires halide ions and a thiol reducing compound for activity, and it is involved in the activation of various serine proteases (Turk2001Structure). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is typical for lysosomal enzymes (Chitsamankhun2024Cathepsin).

## Function
Cathepsin C (CTSC) is a lysosomal cysteine protease that plays a crucial role in the activation of serine proteases within immune cells, such as neutrophils, mast cells, and macrophages. It is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and undergoes a maturation process to form an active tetrameric enzyme, which is essential for its enzymatic function (Korkmaz2018Therapeutic; Chitsamankhun2024Cathepsin). CTSC is predominantly expressed in tissues like the lungs, spleen, kidneys, and liver, and is active in the lysosomal or endosomal compartments of cells (Chitsamankhun2024Cathepsin).

CTSC activates pro-inflammatory neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3 by cleaving their N-terminal dipeptides, which is crucial for immune defense mechanisms, including microbial killing and inflammation regulation (Korkmaz2018Therapeutic). The enzyme exhibits broad substrate specificity, cleaving two-residue units until a stop sequence is reached, and is most active in slightly acidic conditions (Chitsamankhun2024Cathepsin).

CTSC's role in activating serine proteases underscores its significance in maintaining immune and inflammatory defenses, and its deficiency can lead to conditions such as Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome, characterized by severe periodontal disease (Chitsamankhun2024Cathepsin; Li2016Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTSC gene, which encodes the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin C, are associated with several genetic disorders, primarily characterized by severe periodontitis. Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome (PLS) is a notable condition linked to CTSC mutations. It is an autosomal recessive disorder marked by palmoplantar keratoderma and aggressive periodontitis, leading to early tooth loss (Hart1999Mutations; Ketterer2017Inherited). Over 90 different mutations in the CTSC gene have been identified in PLS patients, often resulting in reduced enzyme activity and impaired immune function (Wu2019CTSC; Ketterer2017Inherited).

Haim-Munk syndrome (HMS) is another condition associated with CTSC mutations, sharing symptoms with PLS but also including features like arachnodactyly and onychogryphosis (Ketterer2017Inherited). Isolated aggressive periodontitis (AP1) is a nonsyndromic form of periodontitis linked to a novel CTSC variant, highlighting the gene's role in periodontal disease without other systemic symptoms (Molitor2019Exome).

The clinical manifestations of these conditions are due to the critical role of cathepsin C in immune and inflammatory pathways. Mutations often lead to a lack of CTSC activity, affecting the activation of serine proteases necessary for immune function, which contributes to the severe periodontal and dermatological symptoms observed in these syndromes (Hewitt2004The; Ketterer2017Inherited).

## Interactions
Cathepsin C (CTSC), also known as dipeptidyl peptidase I, is a lysosomal cysteine protease that plays a crucial role in the activation of various serine proteases in immune cells. CTSC is responsible for converting neutrophil serine protease zymogens, such as neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3), and cathepsin G (CTSG), into their active forms by removing N-terminal dipeptides during their biosynthesis and transport into granules (Korkmaz2018Therapeutic; Adkison2002Dipeptidyl). This activation is essential for the proper functioning of these proteases in immune responses and inflammation (Adkison2002Dipeptidyl).

CTSC interacts with other lysosomal hydrolases, including cathepsin B (CTSB), cathepsin D (CTSD), and cathepsin L (CTSL). While CTSC does not undergo autocatalytic activation, it relies on endopeptidases like CTSL for its activation. CTSD, on the other hand, degrades both inactive and mature forms of CTSC (John2019Deficiency). CTSC's role in activating serine proteases extends to various immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and mast cells, highlighting its importance in immune and inflammatory defenses (Chitsamankhun2024Cathepsin).
