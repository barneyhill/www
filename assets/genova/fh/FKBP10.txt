# FKBP10

## Overview
The FKBP10 gene encodes the protein FKBP prolyl isomerase 10, also known as FKBP65, which is a member of the FK506-binding protein family. This protein functions primarily as a molecular chaperone within the endoplasmic reticulum, playing a crucial role in the folding and stabilization of type I procollagen, a vital component of the extracellular matrix that contributes to the structural integrity of various tissues, including bone. FKBP65 is involved in the hydroxylation of telopeptide lysines, a process essential for collagen cross-linking and bone strength. It interacts with other proteins such as lysyl hydroxylase 2 (LH2) to facilitate these biochemical processes. Mutations in the FKBP10 gene are linked to several autosomal recessive disorders, including osteogenesis imperfecta and Bruck syndrome, which are characterized by defects in collagen processing and bone fragility (Schwarze2012Mutations; Alanay2010Mutations).

## Function
The FKBP10 gene encodes the protein FKBP65, a member of the FK506-binding protein family, which functions as a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of healthy human cells. FKBP65 is involved in the folding and stabilization of type I procollagen, a critical component of collagen that contributes to the structural integrity of various tissues, including bone (Alanay2010Mutations). It assists in the proper folding of procollagen molecules by converting cis-to-trans isomers of peptidyl-prolyl bonds, although its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity does not significantly impact the formation of the procollagen triple helix (Gjaltema2016Molecular).

FKBP65 also plays a role in the hydroxylation of telopeptide lysines in bone collagen, a process crucial for collagen cross-linking and bone strength (Schwarze2012Mutations). It interacts with lysyl hydroxylase 2 (LH2) to facilitate the hydroxylation necessary for stable collagen cross-links, contributing to the strength and resilience of connective tissues (Schwarze2012Mutations). The protein is essential for the proper secretion and intracellular processing of mature type I procollagen, ensuring its transport to the Golgi apparatus and subsequent release into the extracellular matrix (Alanay2010Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FKBP10 gene are associated with several autosomal recessive disorders, primarily affecting bone and connective tissue. These include osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), Bruck syndrome, and Kuskokwim syndrome. Osteogenesis imperfecta, often referred to as brittle bone disease, is characterized by bone fragility, deformity, and growth deficiency. FKBP10 mutations lead to defects in collagen posttranslational modification, folding, and crosslinking, resulting in reduced collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix (Essawi2020New; Lietman2014Connective).

Bruck syndrome is characterized by congenital joint contractures and fragile bones. Mutations in FKBP10 disrupt the hydroxylation of telopeptide lysines in bone collagen, affecting bone strength and structure (Schwarze2012Mutations). Kuskokwim syndrome, found among Yup'ik Eskimos, involves congenital contractures without skeletal manifestations and is caused by a specific FKBP10 mutation leading to the loss of a conserved residue in FKBP65 (Barnes2013Kuskokwim).

The clinical manifestations of FKBP10 mutations are variable, with some individuals experiencing severe symptoms while others have milder presentations. This variability is attributed to different types of mutations, including frameshift, missense, and nonsense mutations, which lead to unstable mRNA and, in many cases, no protein production (Schwarze2012Mutations; Essawi2020New).

## Interactions
FKBP10, also known as FKBP prolyl isomerase 10, is involved in several critical protein interactions, particularly in the context of collagen biosynthesis and processing. FKBP10 interacts with lysyl hydroxylase 2 (LH2), forming a complex that is essential for the dimerization and activation of LH2, which is crucial for collagen pyridinoline cross-linking. This interaction is not affected by mutations in the catalytic domain of LH2 or the PPIase domain of FKBP10, although the efficiency of complex formation can vary (Gjaltema2016Disentangling).

FKBP10 also forms a chaperone complex with HSP47 and BiP, which modulates lysyl hydroxylation of type I procollagen. FKBP10 enhances the stability and association of LH2 with type I procollagen, promoting hydroxylation of telopeptide lysines. However, FKBP10 and HSP47 compete for binding to LH2, which can affect LH2 activity (Duran2017A).

In lung fibroblasts, FKBP10 interacts with type VI collagen and fibulin-1, regulating their expression. FKBP10 deficiency leads to reduced expression of collagen VI and increased expression of fibulin-1, affecting cell migration and adhesion (Knüppel2018FK506binding). These interactions highlight FKBP10's role in collagen-related processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in related disorders.
