# HSD17B8

## Overview
HSD17B8 is a gene that encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 8, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This enzyme is primarily involved in steroid metabolism, catalyzing the conversion of active steroid hormones such as estradiol to estrone and testosterone to androstenedione, thereby playing a critical role in regulating hormone levels and influencing physiological processes like growth, reproduction, and lipid metabolism (Zhao2024Inhibiting; Ma2015Bovine). The protein is a component of the heterotetrameric human 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase (HsKAR) complex, which is essential for mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (Venkatesan2014Insights). HSD17B8 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver and kidney, and is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, contributing to cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism (Ma2015Bovine). Its interaction with the tumor suppressor protein PTEN suggests a potential role in cancer biology, particularly in breast cancer, where it may influence cell proliferation through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (Zhao2024Inhibiting).

## Structure
The HSD17B8 protein is a component of the heterotetrameric human 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase (HsKAR), which also includes the CBR4 subunit. The HsKAR complex exhibits a quaternary structure characterized by a dimer of HSD17B8 and CBR4 dimers, forming a stable heterotetramer with approximate 222 (D2) symmetry (Venkatesan2014Insights). The tertiary structure of HSD17B8 is well conserved, featuring a central parallel beta-sheet composed of seven beta-strands sandwiched between alpha-helices, typical of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family (Venkatesan2014Insights).

The HSD17B8 subunit specifically binds NAD(H), with the binding site stabilized by conserved hydrogen bonding interactions, including residues such as aAsp42 (Venkatesan2014Insights). The catalytic triad of HSD17B8 includes aSer156, aTyr169, and aLys173, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity, interacting with the nicotinamide moiety of NAD(P)+ (Venkatesan2014Insights). The serine residue (aSer156) is proposed to form an oxyanion hole for the substrate's thioester oxygen (Venkatesan2014Insights).

HSD17B8 can form homotetramers, although these are less stable and soluble compared to the heterotetrameric HsKAR complex (Venkatesan2014Insights). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and steroid metabolism.

## Function
HSD17B8 encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 8, which plays a crucial role in steroid metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of estradiol (E2) to estrone (E1) and testosterone to androstenedione. This conversion is significant in regulating the levels of active steroid hormones, thereby influencing various physiological processes such as growth, reproduction, and lipid metabolism (Zhao2024Inhibiting; Ma2015Bovine). The enzyme is primarily expressed in the salpinx, liver, and kidney, and is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, contributing to cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism (Ma2015Bovine).

In healthy human cells, HSD17B8 is involved in the regulation of intracellular levels of active steroids, impacting the balance of sex hormones. This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing abnormal cell proliferation (Zhao2024Inhibiting). The enzyme's activity is NAD-dependent, and it is part of the broader family of 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, which are involved in both the synthesis and inactivation of steroid hormones across various tissues (Mindnich2004The). The expression of HSD17B8 is regulated by transcription factors such as C/EBP b, particularly in the liver, indicating its role in lipid and energy metabolism (Ma2015Bovine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the HSD17B8 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and congenital disorders. In breast cancer, specifically within the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, the knockdown of HSD17B8 has been shown to suppress cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. This effect is attributed to the accumulation of estradiol (E2) and a reduction in estrone (E1) levels, suggesting that HSD17B8 plays a role in the conversion of E2 to E1, which influences breast cancer cell growth (Zhao2024Inhibiting). The interaction between HSD17B8 and the tumor suppressor PTEN is also significant, as PTEN may inactivate HSD17B8's function, affecting the E2/E1 conversion and thus impacting cell proliferation (Zhao2024Inhibiting).

In addition to its role in cancer, HSD17B8 has been studied in the context of hypospadias, a congenital condition affecting the male reproductive system. Dysregulated expression of androgen metabolism genes, including HSD17B8, has been observed in hypospadias, highlighting its potential involvement in the condition's genetic basis (Chen2020Dysregulated). These findings underscore the clinical significance of HSD17B8 in both cancer and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
HSD17B8, or hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 8, is known to physically interact with the tumor suppressor protein PTEN. This interaction has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments, indicating that PTEN can bind to HSD17B8. Although PTEN does not alter the expression or phosphorylation levels of HSD17B8, it may inactivate HSD17B8 through this physical interaction. This suggests a potential mechanism by which PTEN exerts its tumor suppressor functions, possibly involving nonphosphatase activity that affects the conversion of estradiol (E2) to estrone (E1), thereby influencing cell proliferation (Zhao2024Inhibiting).

The interaction between PTEN and HSD17B8 is significant in the context of breast cancer cells, where it may impact the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Knocking down HSD17B8 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells has been shown to reduce ERK phosphorylation, linking HSD17B8 to ERK signaling and its role in cell proliferation (Zhao2024Inhibiting). This interaction is not dependent on the oxidation state of PTEN, as PTEN interacts with HSD17B8 regardless of its oxidation status (Zhao2024Inhibiting).
