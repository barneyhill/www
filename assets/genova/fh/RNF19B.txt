# RNF19B

## Overview
RNF19B is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 19B, a member of the RBR (RING-between-RING) E3 ubiquitin ligase family. This protein is characterized by its RING-IBR-RING domain structure, which is essential for its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. RNF19B is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it targets misfolded proteins for cytosolic degradation. This function is particularly significant in the context of diseases such as cystic fibrosis, where RNF19B mediates the degradation of the misfolded CFTR-F508del protein. Additionally, RNF19B has been implicated in various cancers, including neuroblastoma and glioblastoma, where its expression levels are associated with patient prognosis (Nakamura2011The; Chen2021Comprehensive; Rajagopalan2019Degradation).

## Structure
RNF19B, a member of the RBR (RING-between-RING) E3 ubiquitin ligase family, is characterized by its distinct domain architecture. The protein contains a RING finger domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitination activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 conjugating enzymes to substrate proteins (Nakamura2011The; Rajagopalan2019Degradation). The RBR signature of RNF19B includes two RING domains linked by an in-between-ring (IBR) domain. The N-terminal RING (RING1) forms a canonical cross-brace structure, while the C-terminal RING (RING2) has a different tertiary structure, binding one metal ion, indicating functional differences between the two RING domains (Nakamura2011The).

The IBR domain comprises two zinc-binding structures in a C6HC configuration, which are sometimes required for correct E3 functions by mediating protein-protein interactions with E2 enzymes and substrate proteins (Nakamura2011The). RNF19B also features hydrophobic regions, although its specific membrane insertion sites have not been determined (Nakamura2011The). Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation can affect the function of RNF19B, and splice variants may exist, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions. However, specific details on these modifications and isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
RNF19B, or ring finger protein 19B, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It functions by facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 conjugating enzymes to substrate proteins, marking them for degradation. This process is essential for protein quality control, signal transduction, and cell cycle regulation (Nakamura2011The; Kaneko2016Genomewide).

RNF19B is part of the RBR (RING-Between-RING) family of proteins, characterized by their RING-IBR-RING domain structure, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination activity (Nakamura2011The; Luo2019Molecular). It is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is implicated in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it helps manage misfolded proteins by targeting them for cytosolic degradation (Kaneko2016Genomewide).

In healthy human cells, RNF19B is involved in the degradation of the misfolded CFTR-F508del protein, a process that is significant in the context of cystic fibrosis. Silencing RNF19B has been shown to increase the expression and function of CFTR-F508del, suggesting its role in regulating protein stability and function (Rajagopalan2019Degradation).

## Clinical Significance
RNF19B, also known as ring finger protein 19B, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in protein ubiquitination. Alterations in the expression of RNF19B have been associated with neuroblastoma (NB) and glioblastoma (GBM). In neuroblastoma, RNF19B is highly expressed in MYCN non-amplified NB cell lines, and its expression is negatively correlated with MYCN expression. This suggests that RNF19B may play a role in the prognosis of NB, with higher expression levels associated with better overall survival in patients (Chen2021Comprehensive). 

In glioblastoma, RNF19B is identified as a target gene of the NRF1 transcription factor, and its expression is linked to poor patient survival outcomes. This association is independent of other factors such as age, gender, and therapy, indicating that RNF19B may serve as a prognostic marker in GBM (Bhawe2020Nuclear). 

Additionally, RNF19B is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where its expression is elevated in response to ER stress. However, its role in protecting cells from ER stress-induced cell death is not as pronounced as other E3 ligases (Kaneko2016Genomewide).

## Interactions
RNF19B, a member of the RBR E3 ubiquitin ligase family, is involved in various protein interactions that facilitate its role in ubiquitination and protein degradation. It interacts with the ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme UBE2L6 to promote the degradation of the CFTR-F508del protein, a misfolded protein associated with cystic fibrosis. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of CFTR-F508del, highlighting RNF19B's role in protein quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum (Rajagopalan2019Degradation).

RNF19B also interacts with other RING E3 ligases, such as RNF122 and RNF19A, which are bound to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a collaborative role in identifying and degrading misfolded proteins (Rajagopalan2019Degradation). In the context of neuroblastoma, RNF19B is part of a protein-protein interaction network and is regulated by MYCN, a transcription factor involved in cancer signaling pathways. This interaction network includes multiple transcription factors and microRNAs, indicating RNF19B's involvement in complex regulatory mechanisms (Chen2021Comprehensive). Additionally, RNF19B is implicated in the ubiquitination of the small molecule BRD1732, which affects the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Li2024Highly).
