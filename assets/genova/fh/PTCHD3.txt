# PTCHD3

## Overview
PTCHD3 is a gene that encodes the protein patched domain containing 3, which is part of the patched domain-containing family. This protein is potentially involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, a critical pathway for regulating cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. PTCHD3 is predominantly expressed in male germ cells, with its mRNA being exclusive to the testis, and it is developmentally regulated in the testes. The protein is localized to the midpiece of sperm in various species, including mice, rats, and humans, suggesting a role in sperm development and function (Fan2007Male). Despite its potential involvement in significant biological processes, PTCHD3 is considered a non-essential gene in humans, as individuals with homozygous deletions do not exhibit overt abnormal phenotypes (Ghahramani2011Human). The gene's expression in multiple tissues, such as the testes, lymph nodes, and tongue, further supports its non-essential role in human biology (Ghahramani2011Human).

## Function
The PTCHD3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the patched domain-containing family, which is potentially involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for various biological processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. PTCHD3 is specifically expressed in male germ cells, with its mRNA being exclusive to the testis. It exists in two isoforms, Ptchd3a and Ptchd3b, which are developmentally regulated in the testes. The PTCHD3 protein is located on the midpiece of sperm in mice, rats, and humans, suggesting a role in sperm development and function (Fan2007Male).

Despite its potential involvement in the Hh signaling pathway, PTCHD3 is considered a non-essential gene in humans. Studies have shown that individuals with homozygous deletions of PTCHD3 do not exhibit overt abnormal phenotypes, indicating that its absence does not significantly impact normal human function (Ghahramani2011Human). The gene's expression in various tissues, including the testes, lymph nodes, and tongue, further supports its non-essential role in human biology (Ghahramani2011Human).

## Clinical Significance
PTCHD3 is a gene that has been studied in the context of various conditions, but its clinical significance remains unclear. Research has shown that deletions and mutations in PTCHD3 are not significantly associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or other clinical phenotypes. A study found a recurrent heterozygous deletion of PTCHD3 in approximately 1.4% of ASD cases and 1.6% of North American Caucasian controls, with no statistically significant association with ASD (Ghahramani2011Human). Additionally, PTCHD3 deletions were observed in 0.67% of individuals in the Human Genome Diversity Panel, suggesting a Mediterranean/Middle East origin, but no obvious clinical phenotype was associated with these deletions (Ghahramani2011Human).

In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), PTCHD3 was considered a potential tumor-suppressor gene. However, biallelic germline inactivation of PTCHD3 did not result in an overt phenotype, indicating it may not play a significant role in CRC susceptibility (Smith2013Exome). Despite the identification of germline truncating mutations in PTCHD3 in some CRC patients, the lack of a clear phenotype upon inactivation suggests that PTCHD3 is a poor candidate for CRC predisposition (Smith2013Exome). Overall, PTCHD3 is considered a non-essential gene with no strong links to specific diseases or conditions.
