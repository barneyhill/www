# KHDC1

## Overview
KHDC1 is a gene that encodes the KH domain containing 1 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of translation and cell cycle progression. The KH domain containing 1 protein is characterized by its KH domain, a conserved RNA-binding motif that facilitates interactions with nucleic acids and other proteins. This protein is implicated in the regulation of mRNA polyadenylation and translational repression, playing a significant role in oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. KHDC1 proteins, including KHDC1A and KHDC1B, are known to form multimers and interact with key translational regulators such as cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 1 (mCPEB1) and eIF4E, indicating their involvement in cell cycle-dependent processes (Cai2012KHDC1A; Cai2010KHDC1B).

## Interactions
KHDC1 proteins, specifically KHDC1A and KHDC1B, are involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. KHDC1B is a novel binding partner of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 1 (mCPEB1), which is crucial for oocyte maturation and cell cycle progression. This interaction is independent of RNA and requires the C-terminal RNA-binding domain of mCPEB1 (Cai2010KHDC1B). KHDC1B also associates with the translational regulator eIF4E, with this interaction being strengthened when cells are synchronized at metaphase, suggesting cell cycle-dependent interactions (Cai2010KHDC1B).

KHDC1A and KHDC1B can form homo- or hetero-multimers, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating their potential to regulate RNA-binding affinity and specificity through multimerization (Cai2010KHDC1B). KHDC1A is known to interact with CPEB, acting as a translational repressor and inducing apoptosis through an endoplasmic reticulum-dependent pathway. This interaction suggests a role in controlling the polyA length of mRNAs (Cai2012KHDC1A). These interactions highlight the involvement of KHDC1 proteins in translational regulation and cell cycle processes, particularly in oocytes and early embryonic development.
