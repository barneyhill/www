# ISLR

## Overview
The ISLR gene encodes a protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), known as ISLR or Meflin. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a signal peptide, a flank-LRR-flank domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a transmembrane domain, which suggest its role as a membrane protein involved in cellular signaling and adhesion (Nagasawa1999Human). The ISLR protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in biological processes. Functionally, ISLR is implicated in skeletal muscle regeneration and mesenchymal stem cell maintenance, where it stabilizes key signaling pathways such as the Wnt pathway (Zhang2018Islr). Additionally, ISLR interacts with other proteins, influencing pathways like the Hippo signaling pathway, which is significant in cancer and tissue regeneration contexts (Xu2019Stromal). Its expression levels have clinical significance, particularly in cancer prognosis and treatment response, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Li2020An).

## Structure
The ISLR protein, encoded by the ISLR gene, is composed of 428 amino acids and is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (Nagasawa1999Human). The protein structure includes several distinct domains: a signal peptide, a flank-LRR-flank domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a transmembrane domain (Nagasawa1999Human). These domains suggest that ISLR functions as a membrane protein involved in cellular signaling and adhesion (Nagasawa1999Human).

The LRRs in ISLR are characterized by a consensus sequence pattern, which is typical for LRR proteins, and these repeats form a solenoid structure with a concave surface and ascending and descending loops (Matsushima2019Leucine). The presence of highly conserved leucine residues contributes to the hydrophobic core of the LRR domain, which is crucial for protein stability and function (Matsushima2019Leucine).

The ISLR protein is highly conserved between humans and mice, with 86.2% identity and 92.3% similarity in amino acid sequences, indicating a conserved structural and functional role across species (Nagasawa1999Human). The protein's structure, including its leucine-rich and immunoglobulin-like domains, is indicative of its role in cellular signaling pathways (Nagasawa1999Human). However, specific details on the tertiary or quaternary structure of ISLR are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ISLR gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in skeletal muscle regeneration and mesenchymal stem cell function. In skeletal muscle, ISLR is crucial for stabilizing the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for the differentiation of satellite cells into mature myotubes. This process is mediated through the stabilization of Dishevelled-2 (Dvl2), a key component of the Wnt pathway, by preventing its autophagic degradation. The loss of ISLR results in delayed muscle regeneration, highlighting its importance in maintaining muscle homeostasis (Zhang2018Islr).

ISLR is also identified as a marker for mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) and is involved in maintaining their undifferentiated state. It is expressed in various tissues, including the bone marrow and perivascular cells, and its expression decreases as MSCs differentiate into other cell types such as osteoblasts and chondrocytes (Nagasawa1999Human; Takahashi2021Roles). The protein is characterized by a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and an immunoglobulin-like domain, suggesting its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Nagasawa1999Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ISLR gene have been implicated in various cancers, including gastric and colorectal cancer. In gastric cancer, high ISLR expression is associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival, particularly in certain subgroups such as well-differentiated tumors and stage 3 cancers. This high expression is also linked to low sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents like PX-12 and NSC632839, suggesting a role in chemoresistance. However, patients with high ISLR expression treated with 5-Fu-based adjuvant therapy show better prognosis, indicating a complex relationship with drug response (Li2020An).

In colorectal cancer, ISLR is involved in stromal-epithelial interactions, promoting tumorigenesis by modulating signaling pathways. It suppresses Hippo signaling and activates YAP signaling, which is crucial for cell proliferation and cancer progression. ISLR expression is regulated by the oncogenic transcription factor ETS1 and is associated with poor survival and lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer (Xu2019Stromal). Additionally, ISLR interacts with BMP7 to enhance BMP signaling, which is linked to improved survival in colorectal cancer patients (Kobayashi2021The). These findings suggest that ISLR expression and its interactions play significant roles in cancer progression and could serve as potential therapeutic targets.

## Interactions
The ISLR protein, also known as Meflin, is involved in several significant interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cancer and tissue regeneration. One of the primary interactions is with the transmembrane protein FAT1. ISLR binds directly to the extracellular region of FAT1, which is an upstream activator of the Hippo signaling pathway. This binding attenuates Hippo signaling and activates YAP signaling, promoting epithelial regeneration and tumorigenesis. The interaction between ISLR and FAT1 suggests that ISLR functions as an extracellular ligand for FAT1, impairing FAT1's ability to recruit and activate MST1/2 kinases, key components of the Hippo pathway (Xu2019Stromal).

In gastric cancer, ISLR interacts with MGAT5, a glycan processing enzyme. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The presence of ISLR appears to enhance the expression of MGAT5, which is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer cells. Knockdown of ISLR reduces MGAT5 expression and inhibits these malignant processes, indicating a synergistic role in promoting cancer progression (zuo2023islr).
