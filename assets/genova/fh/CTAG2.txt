# CTAG2

## Overview
CTAG2, or cancer/testis antigen 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cancer/testis antigen family, which is characterized by its restricted expression pattern, typically limited to the testis and various cancerous tissues. The protein encoded by CTAG2 is involved in cellular processes such as centrosome repositioning, microtubule dynamics, and intracellular trafficking, which are crucial for cell polarity and migration. It interacts with centrosomal proteins, notably Pericentrin, and plays a role in the stability of protein complexes at centrosomes. CTAG2's expression is notably upregulated in several cancers, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is associated with aggressive phenotypes and poor clinical outcomes. Due to its cancer-specific expression, CTAG2 is being investigated as a potential biomarker and target for immunotherapy in oncology (Kulkarni2012Cancertestis; Maine2016The; Wang2019Genome‑wide).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
CTAG2, also known as cancer/testis antigen 2, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In breast cancer, CTAG2 is necessary for directional migration and is associated with the centrosomal protein Pericentrin, influencing cancer cell invasion (Maine2016The). Its expression is increased in cells that have undergone an epigenetic conversion to an invasive state, suggesting a role in the transition from benign to malignant growth (Maine2016The). CTAG2 is also linked to poor outcomes in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer, indicating its potential as a biomarker for metastatic disease risk (Maine2016The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CTAG2 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and has diagnostic value, with a notable area under the curve in diagnostic tests (Wang2019Genome‑wide). It is also part of a biomarker panel for serous ovarian cancer, showing significant sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing cancer from healthy controls (Katchman2017Autoantibody).

CTAG2's expression is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes and is being explored as a target for immune therapy, particularly in cancers where it is overexpressed, such as infantile hemangioma and prostate cancer (Stiles2013Gene; Kulkarni2012Cancertestis).

## Interactions
CTAG2, a cancer/testis antigen, is known to interact with the centrosomal protein Pericentrin. This interaction is evidenced by the co-localization of CTAG2 and Pericentrin in SUM159T cells and the co-immunoprecipitation of Pericentrin with CTAG2, indicating a physical interaction between the two proteins. Despite this interaction, CTAG2 is not essential for the transport of Pericentrin to the centrosome, as its depletion does not affect Pericentrin's localization. However, the depletion of Pericentrin disrupts the foci of CTAG2, suggesting that CTAG2 interacts with the centrosome in intact cells (Maine2016The).

CTAG2 is also implicated in influencing the stability of protein-protein complexes at centrosomes or in recruiting proteins not typically found at centrosomes in somatic cells. It may play a role in transporting cargo along microtubules, indicating potential interactions with proteins involved in these processes (Maine2016The). These interactions suggest that CTAG2 contributes to cellular processes such as centrosome repositioning, microtubule dynamics, and intracellular trafficking, which are important for cell polarity and migration (Maine2016The).
