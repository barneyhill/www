# SEPTIN7

## Overview
SEPTIN7 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 7, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins. Septin 7 is characterized by its conserved GTPase domain and plays a critical role in the formation of filamentous structures within cells. As a structural protein, septin 7 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, microtubule nucleation, and the maintenance of cellular architecture. It forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with other septins, such as septin 2 and septin 6, which are essential for the stability and function of septin filaments (Wang2018The; Chen2020Septin). Septin 7 is also implicated in the nervous system, where it influences dendritic spine formation and axonal branching, highlighting its importance in neuronal development and function (Dolat2013Septin). The gene's expression and regulation are significant in various pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and reproductive disorders, underscoring its clinical relevance (Wang2018The; Montagna2015Mammalian).

## Structure
SEPTIN7 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, characterized by a conserved GTPase domain. The primary structure of SEPTIN7 includes 418 amino acids, encoded by an open reading frame of 1254 nucleotides located on chromosome 7P14.4-14.1 (Wang2018The). The protein contains a central GTP-binding domain (GBD), which is crucial for its function in filament assembly and interaction with other septins (Chen2020Septin).

The secondary structure of SEPTIN7 features a canonical Ras-like G-domain, consisting of six β-strands and five α-helices (Wang2018The). This domain is involved in forming a dimer via a G interface, with the monomer-dimer equilibrium influenced by nucleotide presence (Brognara2019Revisiting).

In terms of tertiary structure, SEPTIN7 includes unique features such as the β9, β10/β7, β8-meander, and an additional C-terminal α-helix, which are essential for filament assembly (Brognara2019Revisiting). The quaternary structure involves SEPTIN7 forming hetero-oligomeric complexes, such as the SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 hexamer, which is crucial for filament formation and stability (Neubauer2017The; Cao2009The).

SEPTIN7 is also subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may regulate its interactions and functions within the cell (Gönczi2022Septin7).

## Function
SEPTIN7 is a crucial component of the septin family, involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the formation of filamentous structures by binding with other septin family members, such as septin 2 and septin 6, to form hetero-oligomeric complexes like septin 2/6/7. This complex is particularly abundant in brain tissues and HeLa cells, providing a framework for septin complexes and maintaining cellular structure and function (Wang2018The).

SEPTIN7 is also a centrosomal protein essential for cell cycle progression, particularly for entry into the S phase and microtubule nucleation. It localizes to the centrosome, a primary microtubule-organizing center, and is involved in maintaining the abundance of p150glued, a component of centriole subdistal appendages. This interaction is crucial for proper S phase entry, microtubule nucleation, and cell migration (Chen2020Septin).

In the nervous system, SEPTIN7 is involved in the formation and function of dendritic spines and axonal branching. It localizes to dendritic branch points and the base of dendritic spines, influencing neurite outgrowth, axon extension, and growth cone motility (Dolat2013Septin). SEPTIN7's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of neurons.

## Clinical Significance
SEPTIN7 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in SEPTIN7 expression are associated with several cancers, including gliomas and papillary thyroid carcinoma, where it acts as a tumor suppressor. Overexpression of SEPTIN7 inhibits cell proliferation in gliomas, while its knockdown increases proliferation and gliomagenesis (Montagna2015Mammalian). In diabetic nephropathy, SEPTIN7 expression is elevated in glomerular podocytes under high glucose conditions, contributing to podocyte apoptosis and disease progression (Li2018Septin). SEPTIN7 is also linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, where it is involved in synaptic changes and memory formation (Wang2018The). In schizophrenia, altered SEPTIN7 expression is observed in the prefrontal cortex, affecting spine density (Wang2018The). SEPTIN7 plays a role in the reproductive system, with deficiencies linked to sperm abnormalities and conditions like asthenospermia (Wang2018The). Its involvement in maintaining epithelial and endothelial barrier integrity suggests a role in inflammatory responses and tissue fibrosis (Ivanov2021Novel). These associations highlight SEPTIN7's clinical significance in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SEPTIN7 is a crucial component of various septin complexes, including septin 2/6/7, septin 7/9b/11, and septin 5/7/11. These complexes are essential for the formation of filamentous structures, with SEPTIN7 playing a key role in maintaining their integrity. The absence of SEPTIN7 leads to the destabilization and loss of other septin proteins within these complexes (Wang2018The).

SEPTIN7 interacts with the microtubule-binding protein MAP4, inhibiting its association with microtubules. This interaction is crucial for regulating microtubule stability and cell division. SEPTIN7 binds to the proline-rich domain of MAP4, preventing it from binding to microtubules, which affects microtubule nucleation and bundling (Kremer2005Mammalian).

In neurons, SEPTIN7 interacts with α-tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3), influencing dendritic morphology and microtubule remodeling into filopodia. This interaction is important for axon collateral branch formation (Neubauer2017The).

SEPTIN7 also forms a complex with the protein p150glued, which is essential for microtubule nucleation and S phase entry. This interaction is independent of other cytoskeletal proteins and is crucial for maintaining the abundance of p150glued at the centrosome (Chen2020Septin).
