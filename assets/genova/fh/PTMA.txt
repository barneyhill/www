# PTMA

## Overview
Prothymosin alpha (PTMA) is a gene that encodes the protein prothymosin alpha, an intrinsically disordered protein involved in various cellular processes. The PTMA gene is expressed in numerous tissues and plays a critical role in chromatin remodeling, cell proliferation, and the regulation of oxidative stress responses. Prothymosin alpha is characterized by its highly acidic nature and lack of stable secondary or tertiary structure, which allows it to interact flexibly with a range of molecular partners. These interactions are crucial for its functions in the nucleus, including facilitating histone exchange and modulating transcriptional activity. Additionally, prothymosin alpha is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and cellular stress responses, highlighting its importance in cell survival and proliferation. Alterations in PTMA expression and localization have been associated with various cancers, underscoring its potential role in tumorigenesis and as a biomarker for disease prognosis (Karapetian2005Nuclear; Antifeeva2020Interaction; Tsai2019Prothymosin‐α).

## Structure
Prothymosin alpha (PTMA) is a small, highly acidic protein characterized by a primary structure rich in acidic amino acids, contributing to its overall negative charge (Antifeeva2020Interaction). PTMA is classified as an intrinsically disordered protein, meaning it lacks a stable secondary or tertiary structure under physiological conditions (Antifeeva2020Interaction). This disordered nature allows PTMA to remain flexible and interact with various molecular partners, which is crucial for its role in cellular processes.

The protein does not form a quaternary structure, as it remains monomeric in solution (Antifeeva2020Interaction). Despite its lack of defined structure, PTMA can undergo post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Antifeeva2020Interaction).

In alkaline conditions, PTMA assumes a disordered structure, exposing its negatively charged amino acids to the solvent, which can lead to weak electrostatic interactions with positively charged molecules like Thioflavin T (ThT) (Antifeeva2020Interaction). This interaction is nonspecific and does not result in significant changes in ThT's spectral properties compared to its binding to amyloid fibrils (Antifeeva2020Interaction).

## Function
Prothymosin alpha (PTMA) is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily within the nucleus. It plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling by interacting with core histones and facilitating histone exchange, which is crucial for maintaining chromatin structure and function (GÓMEZMÁRQUEZ1998Prothymosin; George2010Prothymosin). PTMA is also implicated in cell proliferation, as its expression is induced upon growth stimulation of resting lymphocytes and other cells, suggesting a role in cell division (Manrow1991Nuclear). 

In addition to its nuclear functions, PTMA is involved in the regulation of oxidative stress-protecting genes. It interacts with Keap1, a protein that inhibits the transcription factor Nrf2, thereby facilitating the transcription of Nrf2-dependent genes involved in detoxifying and antioxidant responses (Karapetian2005Nuclear). PTMA also acts as an anti-apoptotic factor, potentially by inhibiting apoptosome formation and interacting with proteins like ANP32A and ANP32B, which are involved in apoptotic control and chromatin activity regulation (Kijogi2016Subcellular; Freire2018Prothymosin). These functions highlight PTMA's role in cell survival and proliferation, as well as its involvement in cellular stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and localization of the PTMA gene have been implicated in various cancers. In bladder cancer, PTMA is typically a nuclear protein, and its aberrant expression, particularly the loss of its nuclear localization, is associated with tumor growth and reduced survival. PTMA enhances the expression of the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, which negatively regulates the PI3K pathway and is involved in Nrf2 signaling regulation. Loss of nuclear PTMA expression is linked to shorter disease-free survival in bladder cancer patients, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Tsai2019Prothymosin‐α).

In colorectal cancer, PTMA expression is upregulated and is associated with the malignant phenotype of the disease. The circular RNA hsa_circ_0004277 sponges miR-512-5p, leading to increased PTMA expression, which contributes to cancer progression by promoting cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis (Yang2020Circular).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, PTMA is a target of miR-370-5p, and its expression is modulated by circCOL1A1, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA. This interaction influences tumor growth and metabolic changes, highlighting PTMA's role in cancer pathobiology (Zhou2024Circular).

## Interactions
Prothymosin alpha (PTMA) is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of its key interactions is with Keap1, a protein that regulates the transcription factor Nrf2, which is crucial for oxidative stress response. PTMA binds directly to Keap1, potentially displacing Nrf2 from the Keap1-Nrf2 complex, thereby promoting the expression of Nrf2-dependent genes involved in oxidative stress protection (Karapetian2005Nuclear). This interaction is specific and involves a particular region of PTMA, with mutations in this region leading to a loss of binding (Karapetian2005Nuclear).

PTMA also interacts with the repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA), enhancing estrogen receptor (ER) transcriptional activity. This interaction is specific to ERα and does not extend to other nuclear hormone receptors. PTMA's interaction with REA neutralizes its inhibitory effect on ER, thereby enhancing the transcriptional response to estradiol (Martini2000Prothymosin).

Additionally, PTMA binds to the AU-rich element (ARE) of its own mRNA, influencing RNA stability. This interaction involves RNA-binding proteins that recognize the stable stem-loop structure of the ARE, highlighting PTMA's role in mRNA stabilization (Patrucco2015Identification).
