# RANGRF

## Overview
The RANGRF gene encodes the RAN guanine nucleotide release factor, a protein that plays a critical role in intracellular transport processes. This protein is involved in the regulation of the RAN GTPase cycle, which is essential for the transport of proteins and RNA across the nuclear envelope. As a guanine nucleotide release factor, RAN guanine nucleotide release factor facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on RAN, a small GTPase, thereby influencing various cellular processes, including mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. The proper functioning of RANGRF is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and disruptions in its activity have been implicated in cardiac conditions such as Brugada syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the RANGRF gene have been associated with cardiac conditions, particularly Brugada syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by abnormal heart rhythms that can lead to sudden cardiac death. The involvement of RANGRF in Brugada syndrome is linked to its role in regulating intracellular transport processes. Disruptions in the normal interactions of RANGRF can impair cellular transport and signaling, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease. These disruptions may affect the heart's electrical activity, leading to the arrhythmias observed in Brugada syndrome. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which RANGRF mutations or expression changes lead to these cardiac abnormalities is an area of ongoing research. The study of RANGRF's interactions and their impact on cellular function is crucial for developing potential therapeutic strategies for conditions like Brugada syndrome.
