# LAMA3

## Overview
The LAMA3 gene encodes the laminin subunit alpha 3, a critical component of the laminin-332 protein complex, which is integral to the structural and functional integrity of basement membranes in epithelial tissues. Laminin subunit alpha 3 is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein, playing a pivotal role in cell adhesion, migration, and tissue organization. The protein is involved in key biological processes such as wound healing and epithelial cell differentiation, primarily through its interactions with integrins. Mutations in LAMA3 are linked to genetic disorders like junctional epidermolysis bullosa, while its expression levels and splicing variants have significant implications in cancer prognosis and progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Domogatskaya2012Functional; Feng2021LAMA3; Miner2008Laminins).

## Structure
The LAMA3 gene encodes the alpha 3 chain of laminin, a component of the heterotrimeric protein laminin-5, which is crucial for cell adhesion and basement membrane structure. The alpha 3 chain includes a large COOH-terminal globular domain known as the G domain, subdivided into five laminin G (LG) modules (LG1-LG5) (Di2014A; Miner2008Laminins). The LG45 tandem, comprising the C-terminal globules 4 and 5, is involved in cell adhesion and has protumorigenic properties (Di2014A).

The protein structure features heptad repeats characteristic of alpha-helical coiled-coil structures, facilitating the formation of heterotrimeric assemblies with beta and gamma chains (Ryan1994Cloning; Miner2008Laminins). The presence of cysteine residues in domain II may stabilize these structures through disulfide bonds (Ryan1994Cloning).

LAMA3 undergoes significant alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including LAMA3A and LAMA3B, which differ in their exon composition and protein structure (Hamill2009Identification; Miner2008Laminins). These isoforms contribute to the diversity of laminin-5 and its functional roles in tissue morphogenesis and cellular interactions (Hamill2009Identification).

## Function
The LAMA3 gene encodes the laminin subunit alpha 3, a crucial component of the laminin-332 protein complex, which plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of the basement membrane in epithelial tissues. Laminin-332 is involved in cell adhesion, differentiation, and migration, primarily through its interactions with integrins such as α3β1 and α6β4. These interactions facilitate the anchoring of epithelial cells to the basement membrane via hemidesmosomes, which are essential for stable cell attachment and tissue integrity (Goldfinger1998Processing; Tzu2008Bridging).

The alpha 3 chain of laminin-332 is particularly important in wound healing, where it promotes epithelial cell spreading and granulation tissue formation. It is upregulated at wound sites, indicating its role in repair processes (Domogatskaya2012Functional; Ryan1994Cloning). The processing of the alpha 3 subunit by enzymes such as plasmin is crucial for its functional conversion from a motility factor to an adhesive factor, enabling hemidesmosome assembly and reducing cell motility (Goldfinger1998Processing).

Mutations in LAMA3 can lead to disorders such as junctional epidermolysis bullosa, characterized by skin blistering due to compromised cell adhesion (Domogatskaya2012Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LAMA3 gene are associated with several significant clinical conditions. A homozygous nonsense mutation in LAMA3 is linked to Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (H-JEB), a severe genetic disorder characterized by extensive blistering of the skin and mucous membranes, often resulting in early postnatal death. This mutation leads to a truncated α3 polypeptide, affecting the assembly of functional laminin 5 molecules and causing widespread defects in epithelial tissues (Kivirikko1995A).

In cancer, LAMA3 expression and splicing variants have been implicated in poor prognosis. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a hypoxia-related splice variant of LAMA3, known as LAMA3-A, is associated with reduced survival rates and increased tumor invasiveness (MollerLevet2009Exon). Similarly, in ovarian cancer, LAMA3 hypermethylation correlates with chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for treatment outcomes (Feng2021LAMA3).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, high LAMA3 expression is linked to poor survival, indicating its role as an independent prognostic factor (Tian2021High). These findings underscore the clinical significance of LAMA3 in various diseases, particularly in its role in cancer progression and genetic disorders.

## Interactions
LAMA3, encoding the laminin subunit alpha 3, is a component of the laminin-332 complex, which plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, migration, and tissue organization. LAMA3 interacts with integrins, particularly integrin α3β1 and α6β4, facilitating cell-matrix adhesion and signal transduction, which are essential for processes such as tumor invasion and metastasis (Huang2020Laminin‑332). 

In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), LAMA3, along with its associated subunits LAMB3 and LAMC2, is upregulated and contributes to cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These interactions suggest that LAMA3 is involved in the modulation of tumorigenic processes and could serve as a potential therapeutic target (Huang2020Laminin‑332).

In cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), LAMA3 is also upregulated and plays a role in cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and EMT. The knockdown of LAMA3 in CCA cells leads to reduced expression of EMT markers such as vimentin and Slug, indicating its involvement in maintaining EMT and cell adhesion properties (Islam2023Upregulated). These findings highlight the significance of LAMA3 in cancer progression and its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.
