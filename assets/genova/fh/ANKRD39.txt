# ANKRD39

## Overview
ANKRD39 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 39 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ankyrin repeat domain 39 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction capabilities. While the specific biological functions of ANKRD39 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in several diseases, including neurocognitive disorders and certain cancers, highlights its potential significance in human health (Thami2020Whole; Gollin2014Cytogenetic; Rahaie2024CNVDeep:). Further research is needed to understand the precise mechanisms by which ANKRD39 and its encoded protein contribute to these conditions.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ANKRD39 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In the context of HIV-1 progression, rare genetic variants within ANKRD39 have been significantly associated with the disease's progression in a Southern African population. These variants may influence HIV-1 replication by affecting DNA synthesis and cell division, suggesting a potential role in HIV-1 pathogenesis (Thami2020Whole).

ANKRD39 is also associated with neurocognitive disorders. Deletions in this gene have been linked to schizophrenia, indicating its potential involvement in the disorder's pathophysiology (Rahaie2024CNVDeep:). In Alzheimer's disease, ANKRD39 has been identified as a hub gene associated with the disease, although specific details on its clinical significance in this context are not provided (Zou2019Identification).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, ANKRD39 is located in a region of chromosomal gain, though the clinical significance of this alteration is not directly addressed (Gollin2014Cytogenetic). These findings suggest that ANKRD39 may play a role in various diseases, warranting further investigation into its clinical implications.
