# RASSF2

## Overview
RASSF2 is a gene that encodes the protein Ras association domain family member 2, which is a crucial component of the Ras effector protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a Ras association (RA) domain and a Salvador-RASSF-Hippo (SARAH) domain, which facilitate its interactions with Ras GTPases and other SARAH domain-containing proteins, respectively (Volodko2014RASSF; Vos2003RASSF2). RASSF2 functions primarily as a tumor suppressor, playing a significant role in regulating cell growth and apoptosis. It is involved in key cellular processes such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, particularly through its interactions with K-Ras and Hippo kinases MST1 and MST2 (Stoner2020The; Kumari2009Extracellular). The gene is frequently down-regulated in various cancers due to promoter hypermethylation, highlighting its importance in tumorigenesis and its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Aydin2015Prognostic; Vos2003RASSF2).

## Structure
RASSF2 is a protein encoded by the RASSF2 gene, characterized by the presence of a Ras association (RA) domain and a Salvador-RASSF-Hippo (SARAH) domain. The RA domain is involved in interactions with Ras GTPases, particularly K-Ras, in a GTP-dependent manner, while the SARAH domain facilitates protein-protein interactions and dimerization with other SARAH domain-containing proteins such as MST1 and MST2 (Volodko2014RASSF; Vos2003RASSF2). RASSF2 lacks the cysteine-rich domain found in other RASSF family members like RASSF1A and NORE1 (Richter2009The; van2007The).

RASSF2 is primarily a nuclear protein and is involved in regulating cell growth and apoptosis. Its nuclear export is mediated by MAPK/ERK-2 phosphorylation, and nuclear retention is crucial for its function in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Volodko2014RASSF). The protein is known to interact with K-Ras, promoting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and is frequently down-regulated in lung tumor cell lines (Vos2003RASSF2).

RASSF2 has multiple isoforms, with RASSF2A being the primary isoform. The RASSF2A isoform is a 326-amino acid protein containing the RA and SARAH domains (van2007The). The gene's promoter region is often hypermethylated in various cancers, leading to its downregulation (Richter2009The).

## Function
RASSF2 is a tumor suppressor protein that plays a critical role in regulating cell growth and apoptosis in healthy human cells. It is part of the Ras effector protein family and modulates cell growth in a Ras-dependent manner (Kumari2009Extracellular). RASSF2 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, a process regulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK-2) mediated phosphorylation. This phosphorylation is crucial for its nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, which is necessary for its function in cell growth control (Kumari2009Extracellular).

In the nucleus, RASSF2 is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly arresting cells at the G1/S phase, and inducing apoptosis. Its nuclear localization is essential for these functions, as demonstrated by experiments showing that nuclear export-defective mutants can still arrest the cell cycle, while nuclear import-defective mutants cannot (Kumari2009Extracellular). RASSF2 also interacts with K-Ras, forming a GTP-dependent complex that induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, further inhibiting tumor formation (Donninger2016Ras).

The protein's ability to shuttle between cellular compartments and its interactions with other proteins highlight its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oncogenic transformation (Kumari2009Extracellular).

## Clinical Significance
RASSF2 is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in its expression, often through promoter hypermethylation, are linked to tumorigenesis. In lung cancer, RASSF2 is frequently down-regulated, suggesting its loss contributes to tumor development (Vos2003RASSF2; van2007The). In thyroid cancer, RASSF2 undergoes epigenetic silencing in 88% of patients, a phenomenon not observed in benign conditions like goiter, indicating its specific role in malignancy (Volodko2014RASSF). 

In gastric cancer, low RASSF2 expression correlates with poor prognosis, including reduced disease-free and overall survival rates. It is also associated with advanced disease stages and recurrence, making it a potential prognostic marker (Aydin2015Prognostic). RASSF2 promoter methylation is prevalent in colorectal cancer and is linked to early tumor development and KRAS/BRAF mutations, suggesting a role in cancer progression (van2007The). 

RASSF2's interaction with K-Ras is crucial, as its loss enhances K-Ras's oncogenic potential, leading to increased tumor invasion and transformation (Donninger2016Ras). These findings highlight RASSF2's clinical significance as a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring its tumor-suppressive functions.

## Interactions
RASSF2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It binds directly to K-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner via its RA domain, although it only weakly interacts with H-Ras (Richter2009The; van2007The). RASSF2 also interacts with Hippo kinases MST1 and MST2 through its SARAH domain, which is crucial for its stabilization and protection from proteasomal degradation. This interaction is independent of the kinase activity of MST1 and MST2, indicating a noncanonical signaling mechanism (Stoner2020The).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RASSF2 has been shown to associate with DOCK2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac GTPases. This interaction is significant as it links RASSF2 to Rac GTPase signaling, which is important for various cellular processes, including immune responses (Stoner2020The). RASSF2's interaction with MST1 and MST2 is essential for its tumor-suppressive function, particularly in the context of RUNX1-ETO leukemic transformation (Stoner2020The).

RASSF2 is also involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, as it can disrupt the actin stress fiber network and increase cortical actin, suggesting a role in the suppression of the RAS-Rho pathway (Richter2009The).
