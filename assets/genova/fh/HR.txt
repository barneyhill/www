# HR

## Overview
The HR gene encodes the HR lysine demethylase and nuclear receptor corepressor, a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of hair growth and development. This protein is categorized as a nuclear receptor corepressor and is involved in chromatin remodeling through its demethylase activity, which influences gene expression by modifying histones. Mutations in the HR gene have been linked to various forms of alopecia, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal hair follicle function. The HR protein's ability to interact with other molecular pathways underscores its importance in cellular processes beyond hair growth, potentially impacting broader aspects of human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
