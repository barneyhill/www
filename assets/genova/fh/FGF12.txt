# FGF12

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 12 (FGF12) is a gene that encodes an intracellular protein belonging to the fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) subfamily. Unlike other members of the fibroblast growth factor family, FGF12 does not interact with FGF receptors but instead modulates voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav channels), playing a critical role in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission (Zhang2012Roles; Hanada2018Fibroblast). The FGF12 protein is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, as well as in cardiac and muscle myocytes, and is involved in various intracellular signaling pathways (Biadun2024Uncovering). It is characterized by its ability to form complexes with nuclear proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and to interact with galectins, suggesting a multifaceted role in cellular processes (Gędaj2024The; Sochacka2022FGF12). Mutations in the FGF12 gene have been implicated in neurological disorders such as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Seiffert2021Modulating).

## Structure
The FGF12 protein consists of 181 amino acids, with its open reading frame containing 546 bases. The functional domain of FGF12 spans from exon 2 to exon 4, including amino acids from the 13th (threonine) to the 136th (phenylalanine) (Hanada2018Fibroblast). The three-dimensional structure of FGF12 is composed of twelve β-trefoils located from exon 2 to exon 4 (Hanada2018Fibroblast). In FGF12-KO mice, a frameshift mutation leads to a premature stop codon after the 45th amino acid, resulting in a truncated protein that contains only two of the twelve β-trefoils, disrupting its functional structure (Hanada2018Fibroblast).

FGF12 is part of the fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs), which do not bind to FGF receptors but instead regulate voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav channels) (Hanada2018Fibroblast). The FGF12 protein is expressed in the nervous system and interacts with voltage-gated sodium channels to regulate neuronal activity (Zhang2012Roles). FGF12 has multiple transcription initiation sites, leading to different mRNA and protein isoforms, with 'A' isoforms containing nuclear localization signals and 'B' isoforms being cytoplasmic (Zhang2012Roles).

## Function
Fibroblast growth factor 12 (FGF12) is an intracellular protein primarily expressed in the nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in modulating voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav channels), which are essential for the generation and transmission of action potentials in neurons (Zhou2021Production; Zhang2012Roles). FGF12 interacts with the C terminus of these channels, influencing their properties and thereby regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission (Zhang2012Roles; Itoh2010Fibroblast).

FGF12 is part of the FGF homologous factors (FHFs) subfamily, which includes FGF11, FGF13, and FGF14. These proteins are traditionally considered non-signaling intracellular proteins, but recent studies have shown that they can be secreted into the extracellular space under stress conditions (Biadun2024Uncovering). FGF12 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two isoforms: a longer isoform with a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that localizes to the nucleus, and a shorter isoform found mainly in the cytoplasm (Biadun2024Uncovering).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, FGF12 is expressed in other excitable tissues, such as cardiac and muscle myocytes, and in non-excitable cells like fibroblasts (Biadun2024Uncovering). It is involved in intracellular signaling pathways, potentially forming signaling hubs with FGF receptors on the cell surface (Biadun2024Uncovering).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FGF12 gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, primarily due to its role in modulating neuronal sodium channels. Pathogenic variants in FGF12 have been linked to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These variants can cause both gain-of-function and loss-of-function effects on sodium channels NaV1.2 and NaV1.6, influencing their fast inactivation kinetics and contributing to the pathophysiology of these conditions (Seiffert2021Modulating).

Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy type 47 is specifically associated with mutations in FGF12, characterized by severe developmental delay, drug-resistant epilepsy, and other neurological symptoms. A notable mutation, c.155G>A (p.Arg52His), has been identified in patients with early-onset epilepsy, expanding the phenotype to include intellectual disability and autism (MarínHernández2020Calcinosis).

Duplications of the FGF12 gene have also been reported, leading to phenotypes similar to those caused by intragenic mutations, including epilepsy and developmental delays. These duplications may result in a toxic gain of function, increasing neuronal excitability and contributing to the observed symptoms (Willemsen2020Epilepsy).

## Interactions
FGF12 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. In the mammalian brain, FGF12 is a component of the voltage-gated sodium channel 1.2 (Nav1.2) macromolecular complex. It colocalizes with Nav1.2 at the axon initial segment, a critical area for action potential initiation in neurons. This interaction is crucial for modulating Nav1.2-encoded currents, affecting the voltage-dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation, and is influenced by the CaMKII signaling pathway (Wildburger2015Quantitative).

FGF12 also interacts with nuclear proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis. It forms complexes with NOLC1 and TCOF1 in the nucleolus, which are essential for ribosome assembly. These interactions are phosphorylation-dependent and require the C-terminal region of FGF12. FGF12 is unique among fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) in its ability to bind both NOLC1 and TCOF1, facilitating the assembly of the nucleolar NOLC1/TCOF1 complex (Sochacka2022FGF12).

Additionally, FGF12 interacts with galectins, particularly galectin-1, in the nucleus and cytosol. These interactions are direct and glycosylation-independent, suggesting a role in the assembly of ribosome biogenesis complexes (Gędaj2024The).
