# CHCHD3

## Overview
CHCHD3, or coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 3, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein integral to the maintenance of mitochondrial structure and function. The protein is a key component of the MICOS (mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system) complex, which is essential for the organization of mitochondrial cristae—structures critical for cellular energy production and apoptosis regulation. By supporting the structural organization necessary for efficient oxidative phosphorylation, CHCHD3 plays a vital role in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis. Disruptions in CHCHD3 function can lead to impaired mitochondrial dynamics and have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Zhao2024ASB1).

## Function
CHCHD3 (coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 3) is a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. It is a component of the MICOS complex, which is essential for the organization of mitochondrial cristae, the folds in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These cristae are crucial for mitochondrial dynamics, energy production, and the regulation of apoptosis. CHCHD3's involvement in the MICOS complex helps ensure proper mitochondrial morphology and function, which are vital for cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis.

In healthy human cells, CHCHD3 contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity by supporting the structural organization necessary for efficient oxidative phosphorylation, the process by which cells generate ATP, the primary energy currency. This protein's role in organizing the mitochondrial cristae is fundamental to the cell's ability to produce energy efficiently and respond to metabolic demands. The proper functioning of CHCHD3 is therefore integral to cellular health and energy balance, impacting overall organismal physiology by influencing processes such as energy metabolism and programmed cell death. The disruption of CHCHD3 function can lead to impaired mitochondrial dynamics and has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer (Zhao2024ASB1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the CHCHD3 gene can significantly impact mitochondrial dynamics, leading to various diseases. CHCHD3 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and structure, and disruptions in its normal activity are associated with conditions such as mitochondrial myopathy and neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions arise due to the gene's role in mitochondrial integrity, where any dysfunction can result in impaired energy production and cellular stress.

Changes in the expression levels of CHCHD3 or its interactions with other mitochondrial proteins may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. For instance, altered interactions can disrupt the balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion, processes essential for mitochondrial health and function. This imbalance can lead to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, which is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders.

Research into CHCHD3 has highlighted its potential involvement in various pathologies beyond mitochondrial myopathy and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise mechanisms by which CHCHD3 mutations or expression changes lead to these conditions are still under investigation. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies that could mitigate the effects of CHCHD3-related mitochondrial dysfunction.

## Interactions
CHCHD3, a mitochondrial protein, is involved in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. It is part of the MICOS (mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system) complex, where it interacts with other MICOS components such as CHCHD6 and MIC60. These interactions are crucial for the formation of cristae junctions and the organization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The MICOS complex plays a significant role in mitochondrial morphology and the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA.

In the context of prostate cancer, CHCHD3 interacts with the ASB1 protein. ASB1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes the degradation of CHCHD3 through K48-linked ubiquitination. This interaction leads to a reduction in CHCHD3 protein levels, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The degradation of CHCHD3 by ASB1 affects cellular proliferation via oxidative stress pathways, highlighting its role in mitochondrial homeostasis and tumor growth regulation (Zhao2024ASB1). The interaction between ASB1 and CHCHD3 is visualized using bioinformatics tools and confirmed through immunostaining, showing colocalization in prostate cancer cell lines (Zhao2024ASB1).
