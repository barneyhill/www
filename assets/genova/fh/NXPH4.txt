# NXPH4

## Overview
NXPH4 is a gene that encodes the protein neurexophilin 4, a secreted glycoprotein belonging to the neurexophilin family. Neurexophilin 4 is characterized by its neuropeptide-like properties and functions primarily as a ligand for the presynaptic cell adhesion molecule α-neurexin. This protein plays a crucial role in the modulation of synaptic functions, particularly in the regulation of inhibitory synapses within the cerebellum, which are essential for motor coordination and learning (Meng2019Neurexophilin4). Beyond its neurological functions, NXPH4 has been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, where it influences key signaling pathways and cellular processes, thereby affecting tumor progression and patient prognosis (Yang2021A; Yang2024NXPH4). The multifaceted roles of NXPH4 in both neural and oncological contexts underscore its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Structure
Neurexophilin 4 (NXPH4) is a secreted glycoprotein that shares structural similarities with other members of the neurexophilin family. The primary structure of NXPH4 includes a signal peptide, a pro-domain, a polybasic cleavage site, and a mature fragment (Wilson2019Structures). The protein is characterized by a domain structure that includes conserved cysteine residues and N-glycosylation sites, which are crucial for its stability and interaction with α-neurexin (Petrenko1996Structure; Meng2019Neurexophilin4).

NXPH4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is essential for its proper folding and function. Glycosylation was confirmed by a reduction in molecular weight following glycosidase treatment or mutation of glycosylation sites (Meng2019Neurexophilin4). The protein's secondary structure likely includes a β-sandwich, as suggested by the presence of an extra sequence insert between b4 and b5, forming a large loop (Wilson2019Structures).

NXPH4 interacts with specific domains of α-neurexin, particularly the LNS2 and LNS4 domains, and this interaction is independent of calcium ions (Meng2019Neurexophilin4). The protein is expressed in specific neuronal subpopulations and is involved in modulating synaptic functions (Meng2019Neurexophilin4).

## Function
Neurexophilin 4 (NXPH4) is a neuropeptide-like glycoprotein that functions as a ligand for the presynaptic cell adhesion molecule α-neurexin. It is selectively expressed in specific neurons within the brain, particularly those involved in motor coordination and learning, such as cerebellar Golgi cells (Meng2019Neurexophilin4). NXPH4 interacts with α-neurexin and GABA A receptors, playing a crucial role in regulating inhibitory synapse function between Golgi and granule cells in the cerebellum. This interaction is essential for maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals, which is necessary for proper motor function (Meng2019Neurexophilin4).

The protein's interaction with α-neurexin is calcium-independent and specific, as it does not bind to β-neurexin (Meng2019Neurexophilin4). NXPH4's role in synaptic function is further supported by its involvement in modulating synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release, which are critical for neural communication and motor behaviors (Yang2024NXPH4). The absence of NXPH4 leads to impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and reduced synapse numbers, resulting in motor deficits (Meng2019Neurexophilin4).

## Clinical Significance
NXPH4 has been implicated in several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In CRC, NXPH4 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and increased tumor aggressiveness. It contributes to cancer progression by inhibiting the degradation of HIF1A, a factor involved in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, through competitive binding to PHD4 (Yang2024NXPH4). High NXPH4 expression in CRC is linked to lower overall survival and is considered an independent prognostic factor (Yu2023Elevated; Fan2023Forkhead).

In NSCLC, NXPH4 is also overexpressed and promotes tumorigenesis by interacting with CDKN2A, affecting the cyclinD-CDK4/6-pRB pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation. This interaction leads to increased cell proliferation and migration (Yang2021A). The expression of NXPH4 in NSCLC is regulated by EZH2, and its knockdown results in reduced tumor growth (Yang2021A).

NXPH4's role in these cancers suggests it could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention, as its expression and interactions significantly influence tumor progression and patient outcomes.

## Interactions
NXPH4 (neurexophilin 4) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cancer progression. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NXPH4 interacts with CDKN2A, a protein crucial for cell cycle regulation. This interaction affects the cyclinD-CDK4/6-pRB pathway, influencing cell proliferation and migration by reducing CDKN2A protein levels and stability (Yang2021A).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), NXPH4 is associated with the HIF signaling pathway. It stabilizes HIF1A by competitively binding to PHD4, a prolyl hydroxylase, preventing HIF1A degradation. This interaction enhances HIF1A signaling, contributing to cancer progression (Yang2024NXPH4). Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the interaction between NXPH4 and PHD4, showing that NXPH4 upregulation weakens the interaction between PHD4 and HIF1A (Yang2024NXPH4).

NXPH4 also interacts with the transcription factor FOXK1 in CRC. FOXK1 promotes NXPH4 transcription, which in turn influences cancer cell behavior, including proliferation, metastasis, and glycolysis. This interaction has been validated through luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (Fan2023Forkhead). These interactions highlight NXPH4's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes in cancer.
