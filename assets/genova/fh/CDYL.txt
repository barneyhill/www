# CDYL

## Overview
CDYL (chromodomain Y like) is a gene that encodes a chromodomain protein involved in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. The protein, also referred to as CDYL, is characterized by its N-terminal chromodomain, which recognizes methylated histones, and a C-terminal enoyl-CoA hydratase-like domain, suggesting a role in metabolic processes related to histone modification (EscamillaDelArenal2013Cdyl; Liu2017Chromodomain). Functionally, CDYL acts as a corepressor, forming complexes with other proteins such as REST and G9a to mediate gene repression, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing oncogenic transformation (Mulligan2008CDYL). CDYL's involvement extends to neurological and reproductive health, where it plays a role in regulating neuronal excitability and spermatogenesis, respectively (Liu2017CDYL; Xia2019Germline). Its dysregulation has been implicated in various disorders, including epilepsy, depression, and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Liu2017CDYL; Qiu2019CDYL).

## Structure
CDYL (chromodomain Y like) is a protein characterized by the presence of an N-terminal chromodomain and a C-terminal enoyl-CoA hydratase-like domain, also known as the CoA pocket or CoAP domain. The chromodomain is involved in recognizing methylated histones, such as H3K9me3, which is crucial for its recruitment to chromatin (EscamillaDelArenal2013Cdyl). The CoAP domain resembles enoyl-CoA hydratase, suggesting a role in hydration reactions, specifically converting crotonyl-CoA to b-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, which impacts histone crotonylation (Liu2017Chromodomain).

CDYL can form homodimers, which influences its quaternary structure. It is part of a family of chromodomain Y-related proteins, including CDYL2, and has splice variants such as Cdyl1a, Cdyl1b, and Cdyl1c, with Cdyl1b being the main isoform enriched on the inactive X chromosome (EscamillaDelArenal2013Cdyl). Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, affect its function and interactions (EscamillaDelArenal2013Cdyl).

The protein's structure is similar to members of the crotonase superfamily, which stabilizes an enolate anion intermediate derived from an acyl-CoA substrate (Liu2017Chromodomain). This structural similarity underpins its function as a crotonyl-CoA hydratase, playing a significant role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling.

## Function
The CDYL gene encodes a chromodomain protein that functions as a corepressor in transcriptional regulation. In healthy human cells, CDYL plays a crucial role in gene repression by forming complexes with other proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. It acts as a bridge between the neuronal gene repressor REST and the histone methyltransferase G9a, facilitating their interaction, which is essential for the repression of REST target genes. This interaction leads to the recruitment of G9a and subsequent H3K9 dimethylation, a marker of gene repression, thereby suppressing transcription of proto-oncogenes like TrkC (Mulligan2008CDYL).

CDYL is also involved in the suppression of cellular transformation, as demonstrated in telomerase-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (TLM-HMEC). Knockdown of CDYL in these cells enhances the transformation phenotype, indicating its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and preventing oncogenic transformation (Mulligan2008CDYL).

In the brain, CDYL regulates neuronal excitability by repressing the expression of the SCN8A gene, which encodes the Nav1.6 sodium channel. This regulation is crucial for maintaining neuronal excitability and preventing disorders such as epilepsy (Liu2017CDYL).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDYL gene have been implicated in several neurological and reproductive disorders. In the context of male fertility, the CDYL gene is crucial for normal spermatogenesis. Studies in mice have shown that the deletion of the Cdyl gene leads to teratozoospermia and progressive infertility, characterized by defects in spermatogonia maintenance and spermatozoon morphogenesis. This suggests that CDYL is essential for male fertility, and its dysfunction may contribute to reproductive issues (Xia2019Germline).

In neurological disorders, CDYL has been linked to epilepsy. It suppresses epileptogenesis by repressing the expression of the Nav1.6 sodium channel, encoded by the SCN8A gene. Altered CDYL expression affects seizure susceptibility and progression, with decreased CDYL expression associated with increased seizure severity (Liu2017CDYL).

CDYL is also involved in stress-induced depressive behaviors. Its expression is upregulated in response to chronic stress, contributing to depression-like behaviors. CDYL regulates histone crotonylation and gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex, affecting synaptic plasticity and structural changes linked to depression (Liu2019Chromodomain).

In small cell lung cancer, CDYL contributes to chemoresistance by regulating H3K27 trimethylation at the CDKN1C promoter, highlighting its role in cancer epigenetics (Qiu2019CDYL).

## Interactions
CDYL (chromodomain Y like) is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. CDYL forms a multiprotein complex with REST (RE1-silencing transcription factor) and histone methyltransferases, specifically G9a and EuHMT1, facilitating the recruitment of G9a to REST target genes, which is essential for gene repression (Mulligan2008CDYL). CDYL directly binds to both REST and G9a, acting as a bridge between them, which is critical for the repression of REST target genes (Mulligan2008CDYL).

In the context of X chromosome inactivation, CDYL interacts with histone marks H3K9me2 and H3K27me3, and its recruitment to the inactive X chromosome (Xi) is dependent on these marks and Xist RNA. CDYL associates with the G9a protein, which is necessary for its chromatin association, and interacts with the MAX gene-associated protein (MGA) during early embryonic stem cell differentiation (EscamillaDelArenal2013Cdyl). CDYL also interacts with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, although these interactions are weaker compared to its interactions with REST and G9a (EscamillaDelArenal2013Cdyl). These interactions highlight CDYL's role in epigenetic regulation and transcriptional repression.
