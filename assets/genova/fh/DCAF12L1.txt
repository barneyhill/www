# DCAF12L1

## Overview
DCAF12L1 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 12 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as an adaptor within the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is crucial for the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for the targeted degradation of proteins, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. The DCAF12L1 protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences processes such as DNA repair and transcription regulation by modulating protein stability (Zou2016Genomewide). It plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response, and its dysfunction has been linked to conditions such as male infertility and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (Nagirnaja2022Diverse; Wu2023Screening). Additionally, DCAF12L1 is implicated in the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of ketamine, suggesting its broader relevance in human health and disease (Qiao2019Investigation).

## Function
DCAF12L1 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 12 like 1) encodes a protein that functions as an adaptor in the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which regulates protein degradation, a critical process for maintaining cellular homeostasis. By facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, DCAF12L1 plays a vital role in regulating cell cycle progression and responding to DNA damage (Zou2016Genomewide). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes by modulating protein stability, thereby impacting cellular functions such as DNA repair and transcription regulation (Zou2016Genomewide).

In the context of human health, DCAF12L1 has been associated with male infertility, particularly azoospermia, due to its involvement in the ubiquitination pathways that are crucial for spermatogenesis (Nagirnaja2022Diverse). The gene's expression and function in healthy cells are essential for normal cellular operations, and disruptions in its activity can lead to significant physiological consequences. Despite its critical roles, specific details about the function of DCAF12L1 in healthy human cells remain under investigation, highlighting the need for further research to fully elucidate its biological significance.

## Clinical Significance
DCAF12L1 has been identified as a key prognostic marker in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Its expression is downregulated in UCEC, and this alteration is associated with increased mortality rates in patients. The study by Wu et al. demonstrated that higher risk scores, linked to the expression levels of DCAF12L1 and other genes, correlate with poorer survival outcomes in UCEC patients. This suggests that DCAF12L1 plays a significant role in the progression of UCEC and could be used for risk stratification and survival prediction in affected individuals (Wu2023Screening).

In the context of depression treatment, DCAF12L1 expression is also implicated in the molecular mechanisms of ketamine's antidepressant effects. In rat models of depression, the expression of DCAF12L1 was found to decrease following ketamine administration. This change in expression may contribute to the antidepressant effects of ketamine, although the specific clinical significance of DCAF12L1 in this context requires further investigation (Qiao2019Investigation).

Overall, alterations in DCAF12L1 expression are linked to significant clinical outcomes in both cancer and depression, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for these conditions.
