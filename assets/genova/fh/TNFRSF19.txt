# TNFRSF19

## Overview
TNFRSF19, also known as TROY, is a gene that encodes the TNF receptor superfamily member 19, a transmembrane receptor protein. This protein is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, characterized by its extracellular domain containing conserved cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are typical of TNF receptors (Deng2018TNFRSF19). Unlike many other members of its family, TNF receptor superfamily member 19 does not bind to TNF-related ligands and is considered an orphan receptor (Deng2018TNFRSF19). It is distinct in lacking a death domain, which is often involved in apoptotic signaling, and instead interacts with the TGFβ receptor type I (TβRI) to modulate TGFβ signaling pathways (Deng2018TNFRSF19). The protein is highly expressed in skin and hair follicles, and its expression is regulated by the 13q-Enh enhancer in a p53-dependent manner, playing a role in DNA repair and protection against carcinogen-induced damage (Shao2019The). TNFRSF19 is implicated in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and has been associated with both tumor suppressive and oncogenic roles in different cancer types (Shao2019The; Paulino2010TROY).

## Structure
TNFRSF19, also known as TROY, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. It is characterized by an extracellular domain containing four conserved cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are typical features of TNF receptors (Deng2018TNFRSF19). These CRDs are crucial for the structural integrity and potential ligand interactions of the receptor, although TNFRSF19 does not bind to TNF-related ligands and remains an orphan receptor (Deng2018TNFRSF19).

Unlike many other TNF receptors, TNFRSF19 lacks a death domain in its cytoplasmic region, which is often involved in apoptotic signaling pathways (Deng2018TNFRSF19). This structural distinction contributes to its unique functional role, as it does not affect NF-κB activity and does not associate with TRAF proteins (Deng2018TNFRSF19).

TNFRSF19 interacts with the TGFβ receptor type I (TβRI) through its intracellular domain, specifically binding to the kinase domain of TβRI. This interaction inhibits the formation of the active TβRI/R-Smad complex, thereby blocking TGFβ signaling (Deng2018TNFRSF19). The protein is highly expressed in skin and hair follicles, indicating a functional distinction from canonical TNFRs, which are typically expressed in lymphoid tissues (Deng2018TNFRSF19).

## Function
TNFRSF19, also known as TROY, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, TNFRSF19 is highly expressed in normal airway and bronchial epithelial cells, indicating its importance in maintaining normal lung tissue function (Shao2019The). It is involved in DNA repair and protection against carcinogen-induced damage, as its expression is regulated by the 13q-Enh enhancer in a p53-dependent manner (Shao2019The). This enhancer facilitates the upregulation of TNFRSF19 through chromatin looping, which is crucial for its expression (Shao2019The).

TNFRSF19 is also implicated in the regulation of TGFβ signaling pathways. It interacts with the TGFβ receptor type I (TβRI), inhibiting the formation of the active TβRI/R-Smad complex, which is essential for TGFβ signaling. This interaction blocks TGFβ-induced antiproliferative effects, suggesting that TNFRSF19 acts as a repressor of TGFβ signaling (Deng2018TNFRSF19). The protein's activity in these pathways highlights its role in cellular signaling, influencing processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in healthy cells (Deng2018TNFRSF19).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TNFRSF19 gene, also known as TROY, have been implicated in various cancers. In lung cancer, TNFRSF19 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression significantly reduced in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous ones. This downregulation is associated with advanced tumor stages and decreased patient survival, suggesting that TNFRSF19 expression is crucial for maintaining normal lung tissue phenotypes (Shao2019The). In contrast, TNFRSF19 is overexpressed in glioblastoma, where it promotes tumor cell invasion and correlates with poor patient outcomes. This overexpression is linked to the activation of the Pyk2-Rac1 signaling pathway, enhancing cell migration and invasion (Paulino2010TROY).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), TNFRSF19 is also overexpressed and inhibits the TGFβ signaling pathway by interacting with the TGFβ receptor type I. This interaction prevents the formation of the active TβRI/R-Smad complex, reducing TGFβ's antiproliferative effects and promoting tumorigenesis (Deng2018TNFRSF19). These findings highlight the dual role of TNFRSF19 as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the tissue context.

## Interactions
TNFRSF19, also known as TROY, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cancer progression. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), TNFRSF19 interacts with the TGFβ receptor type I (TβRI), inhibiting TGFβ signaling by blocking the association of Smad2/3 with TβRI. This interaction prevents the phosphorylation and activation of R-Smads, thereby inhibiting TGFβ-mediated transcriptional responses (Deng2018TNFRSF19). TNFRSF19 binds directly to the kinase domain of TβRI, which overlaps with the binding region of R-Smads, thus blocking the formation of the active TβRI/R-Smad complex (Deng2018TNFRSF19).

In glioblastoma, TNFRSF19 interacts with JAK1, leading to the activation of the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. This interaction enhances the phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3, promoting glioblastoma cell migration and resistance to therapy (Ding2020TROY). The cytoplasmic domain of TNFRSF19 is necessary for its association with JAK1, specifically the region between residues D240 and M254 (Ding2020TROY). TNFRSF19 also interacts with Pyk2, a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase, which is crucial for glioma cell migration and invasion through the Pyk2-Rac1 signaling pathway (Paulino2010TROY). These interactions highlight TNFRSF19's role in modulating key signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis.
