# FOXD4L4

## Overview
FOXD4L4 is a gene that encodes the protein forkhead box D4 like 4, which is a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by a distinct forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain, which plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in various biological processes, including development, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation. The FOXD4L4 gene is part of a larger family of FOXD genes, which are known to be involved in the regulation of embryonic development and have been implicated in several developmental disorders. The protein encoded by FOXD4L4 is thought to function as a transcriptional regulator, although its specific roles and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Understanding the function and regulation of FOXD4L4 is important for comprehending its potential implications in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
