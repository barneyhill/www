# METTL26

## Overview
The METTL26 gene encodes the protein methyltransferase-like 26, which is part of the methyltransferase family. Methyltransferases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups to various substrates, a process that can significantly impact gene expression and protein function. Although the specific substrates of METTL26 remain unidentified, its expression has been implicated in various cancer types, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis. The protein's involvement in exon skip alternative splicing further highlights its possible contribution to cancer biology (Campeanu2021Multiomics). Research into METTL26 is ongoing, with studies indicating its differential expression across cancer types, which may influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Zhu2022Glia; Campeanu2021Bioinformatic).

## Clinical Significance
METTL26 has been identified as upregulated at mRNA and protein levels in a subset of human cancers compared to normal tissue, suggesting a potential role in cancer biology (Campeanu2021Multiomics). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), high expression of METTL26 is linked to poor prognosis, indicating its possible involvement in cancer progression (Campeanu2021Bioinformatic). Although the specific substrate of METTL26 remains unknown, it has been associated with exon skip alternative splicing in cancer, which may contribute to its oncogenic potential (Campeanu2021Multiomics).

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), METTL26 is downregulated in GMFB overexpressing Caki-2 cells, suggesting a complex role in cancer biology that may vary depending on the cancer type and context (Zhu2022Glia). The gene is also mentioned in the context of breast cancer, where its expression is correlated with GPR176, a gene associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes (Yun2023Oncogenic). Despite these associations, the clinical significance of METTL26 gene mutations, expression alterations, or interaction changes remains underexplored, warranting further investigation to fully understand its role in cancer development and progression (Campeanu2021Bioinformatic).
