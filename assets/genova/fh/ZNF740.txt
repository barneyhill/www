# ZNF740

## Overview
ZNF740 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 740, a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and RNA modification. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and other proteins, allowing it to influence gene expression. ZNF740 has been implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), through its role in modulating key signaling pathways. In HCC, ZNF740 enhances the expression of METTL3, a gene involved in RNA methylation, thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion. In AML, ZNF740 regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene NOXA, affecting the stability of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 and influencing sensitivity to the drug venetoclax. These functions highlight ZNF740's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Zhang2024ZNF740; Zhang2024CRISPR).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF740 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common form of liver cancer. Studies have shown that ZNF740 is upregulated in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues, and its elevated expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients. ZNF740 enhances the invasive and proliferative capacity of liver cancer cells by regulating the METTL3/HIF1A signaling axis. It binds to the METTL3 promoter, increasing METTL3 expression, which in turn stabilizes HIF1A mRNA, promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Zhang2024ZNF740).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ZNF740 has been identified as a key regulator of sensitivity to the drug venetoclax. Loss of ZNF740 expression leads to resistance to venetoclax, as it affects the stability of the MCL-1 protein, a factor in drug resistance. Conversely, overexpression of ZNF740 enhances sensitivity to venetoclax. This suggests that ZNF740 plays a crucial role in the apoptotic pathways that determine venetoclax efficacy, and its expression levels can significantly impact treatment outcomes in AML (Zhang2024CRISPR).

## Interactions
ZNF740, a zinc finger protein, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing various cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF740 interacts with the METTL3 promoter, enhancing METTL3 expression. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1A (HIF1A) mRNA through an N6-methyladenosine/YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein 1-dependent mechanism, forming a signaling axis that promotes cancer progression (Zhang2024ZNF740). ZNF740 directly binds to the METTL3 promoter, particularly at the P1 motif, acting as a transcription factor for METTL3, which is involved in RNA modifications (Zhang2024ZNF740).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ZNF740 regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene NOXA, which affects the stability of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1. ZNF740 binds at the promoter and enhancer regions of the NOXA gene, influencing venetoclax sensitivity by destabilizing MCL-1. This interaction is significant in modulating the cellular response to BCL-2 inhibition, highlighting the ZNF740-NOXA-MCL-1 axis as a key pathway in venetoclax sensitivity (Zhang2024CRISPR). These interactions underscore ZNF740's role in transcriptional regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
