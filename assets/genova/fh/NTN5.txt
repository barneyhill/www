# NTN5

## Overview
Netrin-5 (NTN5) is a gene that encodes the netrin 5 protein, a member of the netrin family, which is primarily involved in axon guidance and cell migration. Netrin 5 is characterized by its laminin-like domains and EGF-like repeats, which are essential for its role in cellular signaling and interaction with other molecules. Unlike other netrins, netrin 5 lacks the N-terminal laminin VI domain and one of the three EGF motifs, which may influence its specific functions (Yamagishi2015Netrin5). The protein is highly expressed in neurogenic regions of the adult brain, such as the olfactory bulb and hippocampus, where it plays a crucial role in neurogenesis and neuronal migration (Yamagishi2015Netrin5). Netrin 5 interacts with receptors like DCC, influencing neural circuit formation and cell migration (Garrett2016Analysis). Alterations in NTN5 expression have been implicated in various cancers and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and its significance in maintaining normal brain function (Haghshenas¹2024Identification; Ikegaya2020Decreased).

## Structure
Netrin-5 (NTN5) is a protein encoded by the NTN5 gene in humans and is a member of the netrin family, which plays a role in axon guidance and cell migration. The protein is characterized by the presence of laminin-like domains and EGF-like repeats, which are typical features of netrin family proteins. These domains are crucial for the protein's function in cellular signaling and interaction with other molecules.

The primary structure of Netrin-5 includes sequences that encode these specific domains, although detailed information on the exact amino acid sequence is limited. The secondary structure likely involves the formation of alpha helices and beta sheets, common in proteins with laminin-like domains, but specific details are not well-documented. Tertiary structure information is also scarce, but it is expected to involve the folding of these domains into a functional three-dimensional conformation necessary for its biological activity.

Post-translational modifications of Netrin-5 may include glycosylation, which can influence protein stability, localization, and interaction with other cellular components. Information on quaternary structure or potential splice variant isoforms is not available in the current context. Overall, while specific structural details are limited, the presence of laminin-like and EGF-like domains is a defining feature of Netrin-5.

## Function
Netrin-5 (NTN5) is a protein involved in various molecular processes, primarily within the nervous system. It is a member of the netrin family, which plays a crucial role in axon guidance, neuronal migration, and angiogenesis. Unlike other netrins, netrin-5 lacks the N-terminal laminin VI domain and one of the three EGF motifs, which may influence its specific functions (Yamagishi2015Netrin5).

In the adult brain, NTN5 is highly expressed in neurogenic regions such as the olfactory bulb, rostral migratory stream, subventricular zone, and subgranular zone of the hippocampus. It is involved in neurogenesis, particularly in the transition from type 2a to type 3 cells, and is expressed in transit-amplifying cells and neuroblasts, but not in astrocytes (Yamagishi2015Netrin5). This suggests that NTN5 plays a role in the development and maturation of neurons.

In NTN5 knockout mice, there is a reduction in cell proliferation in the ventricular-subventricular zone, disorganized neuroblast migration, and increased oligodendrogenesis, indicating that NTN5 is important for maintaining normal neurogenesis and organized cell migration (Ikegaya2020Decreased). These findings highlight NTN5's potential importance in maintaining normal brain function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NTN5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neurological disorders. In cancer, NTN5 has been identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker for papillary renal cell carcinomas (PRCC), with studies highlighting its upregulation and involvement in key signaling pathways such as the Calcium and cAMP signaling pathways (Haghshenas¹2024Identification). Mutations in NTN5, specifically the X342_splice mutation, have been found in skin cutaneous melanoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, suggesting a role in oncogenesis (Hao2020The). The expression of NTN5 is also affected by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in several cancers, including breast cancer and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in tumor metabolism (Hao2020The).

In the nervous system, NTN5 is expressed in neurogenic regions and is involved in neurogenesis and cell migration. NTN5 knockout mice exhibit decreased proliferation in the ventricular-subventricular zone and disorganized neuroblast migration, which may have implications for neurological conditions (Ikegaya2020Decreased). Although specific diseases directly linked to NTN5 mutations are not detailed, its role in neurogenesis suggests potential relevance to conditions like schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders.

## Interactions
Netrin 5 (NTN5) is known to interact with several proteins, primarily through its role in neural development and cell migration. One of the key interactions of NTN5 is with the receptor DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer). This interaction is suggested by the observation that DCC knockout embryos exhibit a similar motor neuron migration phenotype as NTN5 knockout mice, indicating that DCC may serve as a receptor for NTN5 in preventing aberrant motor neuron migration (Garrett2016Analysis). 

NTN5 may also interact with UNC5 receptors, similar to other netrin family members, although specific interactions with UNC5C are not required for preventing motor neuron ectopias (Garrett2016Analysis). In the context of adult neurogenesis, NTN5 is thought to influence neuroblast migration and oligodendrocyte precursor cell proliferation, potentially through interactions with receptors like DCC and Unc5A, akin to netrin-1 (Ikegaya2020Decreased).

These interactions suggest that NTN5 plays a significant role in neural circuit formation by influencing axon guidance and cell migration, although direct binding tests with DCC have been limited due to NTN5's inefficient secretion into the media (Garrett2016Analysis).
