# TMEM63A

## Overview
TMEM63A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 63A, which is a member of the OSCA/TMEM63 family of mechanosensitive ion channels. These channels are integral to cellular membranes and play a pivotal role in mechanotransduction, the process by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into electrical or chemical signals. The protein is characterized by its eleven transmembrane segments and is involved in various physiological processes, including calcium efflux in lysosomal membranes and surfactant secretion in the lungs (Chen2024Mechanosensitive; Schröder2010The). TMEM63A is also implicated in myelin development in the central nervous system and immune response modulation, highlighting its diverse functional roles across different tissues (Yan2019Heterozygous; Yuan2015Transmembrane). Variants in the TMEM63A gene have been associated with transient hypomyelination during infancy and chronic post-amputation pain, underscoring its clinical significance (Yan2019Heterozygous; Pu2022Mechanosensitive).

## Structure
TMEM63A is a transmembrane protein with eleven predicted transmembrane segments and seven potential N-glycosylation sites, indicating its complex integration within cellular membranes (Schröder2010The). It is part of the OSCA/TMEM63 family, which includes mechanically activated ion channels involved in mechanotransduction processes (JojoaCruz2024Structureguided). The protein possesses a conserved domain of unknown function, DUF221, which may play a role in its mechanosensory capabilities (Schröder2010The).

TMEM63A is known to localize to lysosomal membranes, where it functions as a mechanosensory ion channel, mediating calcium efflux and influencing lysosomal remodeling and homeostasis (Li2024Drosophila). The protein's mechanosensitive properties are crucial for its role in cellular physiology, particularly under conditions of mechanical stress (Li2024Drosophila).

The protein is also involved in lung function, where it mediates lung inflation-induced surfactant secretion, highlighting its role in respiratory processes (Chen2024Mechanosensitive). TMEM63A's structure and function are conserved across species, with homologues identified in both Drosophila and mammals, underscoring its evolutionary significance (Li2024Drosophila).

## Function
TMEM63A is a mechanosensitive ion channel involved in converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as ion transport and osmoregulation. It is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it contributes to the regulation of ion flow in response to mechanical forces (Murthy2018OSCATMEM63). In the lungs, TMEM63A, along with TMEM63B, is essential for mediating surfactant secretion in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. These channels are activated by membrane tension during lung inflation, facilitating the release of surfactant, which is critical for reducing surface tension in the alveoli and maintaining normal lung function (Chen2024Mechanosensitive).

TMEM63A is also highly expressed in oligodendrocytes, suggesting a role in myelin development in the central nervous system. Variants in TMEM63A have been associated with transient hypomyelination during infancy, indicating its importance in myelination processes (Yan2019Heterozygous). The protein's mechanosensitive properties allow it to respond to physical forces, which may be crucial for its function in both lung and neural tissues (Murthy2018OSCATMEM63).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM63A gene are associated with transient hypomyelination during infancy, a condition characterized by delayed myelination that resolves over time. This condition presents with symptoms similar to Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, such as nystagmus and motor developmental delays, but differs in its favorable clinical course and eventual normalization of MRI findings (Yan2019Heterozygous). Specific heterozygous variants, including Gly168Glu, Ile462Asn, and Gly567Ser, have been identified as damaging and are highly conserved across vertebrate species (Yan2019Heterozygous).

A novel nonsense variant in TMEM63A has been linked to infantile transient hypomyelinating leukodystrophy type 19, characterized by transient motor impairment and delayed myelination in the central nervous system. This variant was identified in a patient with mild developmental delay and hypotonia, although MRI did not reveal myelination abnormalities (Siori2024A).

Alterations in TMEM63A expression are also implicated in chronic post-amputation pain (CPAP). TMEM63A is expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons and interacts with macrophages, contributing to a pro-inflammatory environment. Its increased expression is associated with mechanical allodynia, a component of CPAP, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for managing chronic pain (Pu2022Mechanosensitive).

## Interactions
TMEM63A, a transmembrane protein, has been identified as a binding partner for Haemonchus contortus galectin (Hco-Gal-m and -f) in goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This interaction was discovered using a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, which demonstrated the specific binding of TMEM63A to recombinant Hco-Gal-m (Yuan2015Transmembrane). TMEM63A is localized on the plasma membrane of PBMCs, suggesting it may function as a receptor for Hco-Gal-m (Yuan2015Transmembrane).

The interaction between TMEM63A and Hco-Gal-m influences several cellular processes, including cytokine transcription, cell proliferation, phagocytosis, nitric oxide production, and migration in PBMCs. Knockdown of TMEM63A alters these effects, indicating its role in modulating immune responses (Yuan2015Transmembrane). Specifically, TMEM63A knockdown leads to decreased IL-10 and TGF-β1 mRNA levels and increased IFN-γ mRNA levels in cells treated with rHco-Gal-m (Yuan2015Transmembrane).

These findings suggest that TMEM63A participates in significant protein-protein interactions that regulate immune cell functions, potentially through its interaction with Hco-Gal-m, highlighting its role in the immune response modulation in goats (Yuan2015Transmembrane).
