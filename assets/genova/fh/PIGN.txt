# PIGN

## Overview
The PIGN gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class N protein, which is integral to the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are essential for attaching proteins to the cell membrane, influencing various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response (Ihara2017PIGN; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). The PIGN protein is characterized by its complex structure, including 14 transmembrane domains, and plays a dual role in GPI-anchor biosynthesis and protein quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Ihara2017PIGN). Beyond its canonical function in GPI-anchor synthesis, PIGN also contributes to protein homeostasis by preventing protein aggregation, a function independent of its enzymatic activity (Ihara2017PIGN). Mutations in the PIGN gene are linked to Multiple Congenital Anomalies-Hypotonia-Seizures Syndrome 1 (MCAHS1), highlighting its clinical significance (Siavrienė2022PIGNRelated).

## Structure
The PIGN protein, also known as PIGN-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes 14 transmembrane domains and a significant hydrophilic domain within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. This luminal domain contains three conserved motifs crucial for its function (Ihara2017PIGN). The protein's structure is integral to its dual role in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis and protein quality control within the ER. Specific residues within the luminal loop are essential for these functions: R78 is necessary for the non-canonical function related to protein quality control, while H214 and H258 are required for the canonical GPI-anchor biogenesis function. The residue S265 is involved in both functions (Ihara2017PIGN).

The PIGN protein's role in protein quality control is independent of its enzymatic activity for GPI-anchor synthesis, as mutations affecting catalytic motifs do not impair its ability to prevent protein aggregation (Ihara2017PIGN). The study suggests that PIGN might facilitate ATP transport into the ER, which is crucial for chaperone functions in preventing protein aggregation (Ihara2017PIGN). The molecular structure of PIGN is not directly detailed in terms of primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, nor are specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms mentioned in the provided context.

## Function
The PIGN gene encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are crucial for attaching proteins to the cell membrane. This enzyme specifically catalyzes the transfer of phosphoethanolamine to the first mannose residue in GPI-anchor precursors, a critical step in the GPI biosynthetic pathway (Ihara2017PIGN; KINOSHITA2014Biosynthesis). GPI anchors play a significant role in the proper localization and function of proteins on the cell surface, impacting various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response (Alessandri2018Recessive; McInerneyLeo2016Fryns).

In addition to its role in GPI-anchor biosynthesis, PIGN has a non-canonical function in protein quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It prevents protein aggregation, which is essential for maintaining cellular viability and preventing ER stress. This function is independent of its role in GPI synthesis, as demonstrated by studies showing that mutations affecting GPI synthesis do not impair PIGN's ability to prevent protein aggregation (Ihara2017PIGN). The dual functionality of PIGN highlights its importance in both membrane protein anchoring and maintaining protein homeostasis in the ER.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGN gene are associated with Multiple Congenital Anomalies-Hypotonia-Seizures Syndrome 1 (MCAHS1), a rare Mendelian disorder characterized by a spectrum of clinical manifestations. These include intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, minor facial anomalies, and defects in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. More severe phenotypes may present with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, cleft lip or palate, and other malformations (Siavrienė2022PIGNRelated). The disease is caused by pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the PIGN gene, which can be missense, splicing, or nonsense mutations (Siavrienė2022PIGNRelated).

The PIGN gene encodes a protein involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are crucial for anchoring proteins to the plasma membrane. Dysfunction in PIGN leads to reduced expression of GPI-anchored proteins, affecting processes such as embryonic development and immune response (Siavrienė2022PIGNRelated). Pathogenic variants in PIGN have been associated with a significant reduction in GPI-anchored proteins on fibroblasts in individuals with MCAHS1 (Maydan2011Multiple).

Studies have identified various mutations in the PIGN gene, including compound heterozygous variants, which result in premature termination codons and truncated proteins, leading to the MCAHS1 phenotype (Xiao2020Case; Siavrienė2022PIGNRelated). These mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with affected individuals often presenting with severe developmental and neurological symptoms (Maydan2011Multiple).

## Interactions
The PIGN gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins, which are essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. PIGN interacts with several SAC components, including MAD1, MAD2, BUBR1, and MPS1, forming complexes that are vital for SAC function. These interactions occur at various stages of the cell cycle, from early S-phase through mitosis, and are particularly significant during prometaphase (Teye2021PIGN).

PIGN forms a 'pre-SAC' complex with MAD1 and MPS1 during early S-phase and interacts with MAD1 and MAD2 during mitosis. These interactions are crucial for the proper timing and regulation of the cell cycle, impacting mitotic exit and chromosomal stability (Teye2020PIGN; Teye2021PIGN). The loss of PIGN leads to the downregulation of MAD1 and MAD2, while BUBR1 expression is upregulated, resulting in increased chromosomal instability and segregation errors (Teye2021PIGN).

PIGN's interaction with MAD1 is particularly important, as it has been shown to form a complex with MAD1 and MAD2 during SAC activation, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies (Teye2021PIGN). These interactions highlight PIGN's role in maintaining chromosomal stability and preventing leukemic transformation by regulating SAC proteins.
