# SH3D21

## Overview
SH3D21 is a gene that encodes the SH3 domain-containing 21 protein, which is characterized by the presence of an SH3 domain known for mediating protein-protein interactions. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways that regulate cytoskeletal organization and intracellular signaling (Mehrabipour2023A). The SH3D21 protein is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues and is localized in both the nucleus and plasma membrane (Masoudi2019A). While its precise physiological role remains to be fully elucidated, SH3D21 has been implicated in metabolic processes and cancer progression, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer, where it influences drug sensitivity and tumor cell behavior (Masoudi2019A; Tong2024Integrating). The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Tong2024Integrating).

## Function
The SH3D21 gene encodes a protein containing an SH3 domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions crucial for various cellular processes. SH3 domains typically bind to proline-rich motifs, playing a role in signal transduction pathways that regulate cellular activities such as cytoskeletal organization and intracellular signaling (Mehrabipour2023A). The SH3D21 protein is expressed in all human tissues and is localized in the nucleus and plasma membrane of cells (Masoudi2019A). 

Although the specific function of SH3D21 in healthy human cells is not well understood, it has been implicated in the purine ribonucleoside triphosphate catabolic process, which may relate to its role as a sensitizer for the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine. This suggests that SH3D21 might influence the efficacy of gemcitabine by affecting its conversion to gemcitabine triphosphate within cells (Masoudi2019A). Additionally, SH3D21 has been associated with resting metabolic rates through specific SNPs, indicating a potential role in metabolic processes (Masoudi2019A). Despite its high expression in testicular tissue, SH3D21 is not essential for male fertility, as demonstrated in gene-deficient mouse models (Nguyen2024Genedeficient).

## Clinical Significance
The SH3D21 gene is implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common and aggressive form of liver cancer. High expression of SH3D21 is associated with increased proliferation, invasion, and migration of HCC cells, primarily through the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating cellular functions such as metabolism, proliferation, and survival, and its aberrant activation is noted in about 50% of hepatoma cases, influencing tumor initiation and progression (Tong2024Integrating). SH3D21 expression is linked to poor outcomes in HCC patients, and its high expression correlates with pathways related to tumor proliferation and invasion, including cell cycle and DNA replication (Tong2024Integrating).

In pancreatic cancer, SH3D21 has been identified as a sensitizer for the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine. Knockout of SH3D21 in pancreatic cancer cells increases their sensitivity to gemcitabine, suggesting that SH3D21 modulates the drug's efficacy. This sensitization effect is reversed upon re-expression of SH3D21, highlighting its role in influencing gemcitabine's therapeutic action (Masoudi2019A). These findings suggest that SH3D21 could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
SH3D21 is involved in several protein interactions, primarily through its SH3 domain, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions. It has been identified as interacting with latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), a key player in cellular signaling, through a BiFC screen that highlighted its role in LMP1 signaling pathways (Holthusen2015Regulation). This interaction suggests that SH3D21 may play a role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction processes.

In the context of cancer, SH3D21 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating cellular functions such as proliferation and survival, indicating that SH3D21 may influence these processes through its interactions within this signaling cascade (Tong2024Integrating).

Additionally, SH3D21 is part of a protein cluster associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma, which includes proteins involved in Wnt signaling and other cellular processes. This cluster's involvement in transcriptional repression and cancer susceptibility highlights the potential regulatory roles of SH3D21 in tumor biology (Khowal2021Molecular).
