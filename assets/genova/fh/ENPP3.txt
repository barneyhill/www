# ENPP3

## Overview
ENPP3 is a gene that encodes the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 3 (ENPP3) protein, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides. This protein plays a significant role in purinergic signaling and immune response regulation by modulating the availability of signaling molecules such as ATP and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) (Mardjuki2024Identification; Döhler2018Crystal). Structurally, ENPP3 features a catalytic domain and a nuclease-like domain, stabilized by disulfide bridges and coordinated by Zn2+ ions, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Döhler2018Crystal). The protein is also involved in glycosylation processes, particularly in the endometrium, where it is regulated by progesterone and plays a role in endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation (Boggavarapu2016Compartmentalized). ENPP3's expression and activity are implicated in various clinical conditions, including reproductive health and cancer, where it serves as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Minafò2024NAD+).

## Structure
The ENPP3 protein is a membrane-bound glycoprotein with a complex molecular structure. It consists of a catalytic domain and a nuclease-like domain, linked by a loop of 18 residues and stabilized by a disulfide bridge between C429 and C818 (Döhler2018Crystal). The catalytic domain spans residues 140-544, while the nuclease-like domain covers residues 563-875, interacting via a large interface supported by five salt bridges and 16 hydrogen bonds (Döhler2018Crystal). 

The primary structure includes a signal peptide, and the secondary structure features alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, and the quaternary structure may involve dimerization (Döhler2018Crystal). ENPP3 is glycosylated at several sites, with glycosylation at N533 being essential for its catalytic activity (Döhler2018Crystal). 

ENPP3 also contains two N-terminal somatomedin-B-like domains, which are thought to function as protein-interaction domains (Stefan2005NPPtype). The protein's active site includes two Zn2+ ions coordinated by conserved residues, crucial for its enzymatic function (Döhler2018Crystal). The structure of the PDE domain is similar to other NPP family members, with variations in identity and root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) (Döhler2018Crystal).

## Function
The ENPP3 gene encodes a type II transmembrane protein that functions as an ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase. This enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides, including ATP and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), playing a crucial role in purinergic signaling and immune response regulation (Mardjuki2024Identification; Döhler2018Crystal). ENPP3 is primarily active extracellularly, where it efficiently hydrolyzes cGAMP, a molecule involved in immune signaling, thereby modulating the availability of this immunotransmitter (Mardjuki2024Identification). 

In the endometrium, ENPP3 is expressed during the receptive phase of the menstrual cycle and is regulated by progesterone. It is involved in the glycosylation of proteins, which is significant for endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation (Boggavarapu2016Compartmentalized). The enzyme's activity is dependent on divalent ions, particularly Zn2+ and Ca2+, and it operates optimally at neutral to alkaline pH levels (Mardjuki2024Identification). 

ENPP3 also plays a role in regulating glycosyltransferase activity by hydrolyzing UDP-GlcNAc in the Golgi apparatus, affecting protein glycosylation processes (Döhler2018Crystal). This regulation is crucial for various cellular functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
ENPP3 has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In the context of reproductive health, ENPP3 is associated with endometrial receptivity, which is crucial for successful embryo implantation. Its expression is regulated by progesterone and is significantly higher during the mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This suggests that ENPP3 could serve as a molecular marker for assessing endometrial receptivity, particularly in cases of recurrent implantation failure (RIF) in IVF treatments (Boggavarapu2016Compartmentalized).

In oncology, ENPP3 expression is notably altered in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). It is down-regulated in head and neck, lung, and cervical SCC, indicating its potential role in the pathogenesis of these cancers. The down-regulation of ENPP3 in SCCs suggests its involvement in the disease's progression and highlights its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and classification (Minafò2024NAD+). Despite its down-regulation in SCC, ENPP3 is up-regulated in colorectal and renal cancers, where it serves as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Minafò2024NAD+). These findings underscore the gene's complex role in cancer biology and its potential utility in developing targeted therapies.
