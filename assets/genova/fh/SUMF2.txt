# SUMF2

## Overview
SUMF2 (sulfatase modifying factor 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of sulfatase activity within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The protein, also named sulfatase modifying factor 2, is a member of the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) family, although it lacks enzymatic activity itself. Instead, it plays a regulatory role by interacting with other proteins such as SUMF1 and sulfatases, influencing the formation of formylglycine (FGly), a modification essential for sulfatase function (Liang2009SUMF2; Ntenti2024The). SUMF2 is also implicated in immune regulation, particularly through its interaction with interleukin-13 (IL-13), where it inhibits IL-13 secretion in bronchial smooth muscle cells, potentially impacting conditions like asthma and allergic inflammation (Liang2009SUMF2). Additionally, SUMF2 has been studied for its role in cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, where its hypermethylation is associated with poorer patient outcomes, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressor function (Su2022Differential).

## Function
SUMF2 (sulfatase modifying factor 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of sulfatase activity within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is a member of the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) family, which is crucial for the post-translational modification of sulfatases, although SUMF2 itself lacks enzymatic activity (Liang2009SUMF2; Ntenti2024The). SUMF2 interacts with SUMF1 and sulfatases, influencing the formation of formylglycine (FGly), a modification necessary for sulfatase activity (Ntenti2024The). 

In bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMC) and lymphocytes, SUMF2 specifically interacts with interleukin-13 (IL-13) and inhibits its secretion, suggesting a regulatory role in immune responses involving IL-13 (Liang2009SUMF2). This interaction is independent of IL-13 glycosylation, indicating that SUMF2 may regulate IL-13 secretion through a mechanism distinct from glycosylation (Liang2009SUMF2). 

The protein is predominantly located in the ER, where it may also play a role in the post-translational modification and secretion of other proteins, potentially impacting processes such as allergic inflammation and asthma (Liang2009SUMF2).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SUMF2 gene is primarily associated with its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. Research indicates that hypermethylation of SUMF2 in tumor tissues is linked to poorer 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in CRC patients. This suggests that SUMF2 may function as a tumor-suppressor gene, and its methylation status could serve as a prognostic biomarker for CRC, potentially guiding treatment strategies (Su2022Differential).

In addition to its role in cancer, SUMF2 has been studied in the context of allergic inflammation and asthma. It interacts with interleukin-13 (IL-13) in bronchial smooth muscle cells, inhibiting IL-13 secretion. This interaction is independent of IL-13 glycosylation, suggesting that SUMF2 may regulate IL-13 post-translational modification and secretion. These findings highlight the potential role of SUMF2 in modulating allergic inflammation, although the clinical significance of SUMF2 mutations in diseases like asthma is not fully understood (Liang2009SUMF2).

While SUMF2's dysfunction may contribute to conditions related to impaired sulfatase activity, specific diseases directly resulting from SUMF2 mutations have not been extensively documented. Further research is needed to clarify its clinical implications.

## Interactions
SUMF2 (sulfatase modifying factor 2) is known to interact with interleukin-13 (IL-13) in bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMC). This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, which demonstrated that SUMF2 binds to both the 12 kDa and 17 kDa forms of IL-13. The interaction is independent of IL-13 glycosylation, as shown by experiments using tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation, which did not prevent the interaction between SUMF2 and the non-glycosylated form of IL-13 (Liang2009SUMF2). 

SUMF2 also plays a role in modulating IL-13 secretion. Knockdown of SUMF2 in BSMC led to reduced intracellular IL-13 levels, while its expression in lymphocytes increased intracellular IL-13. This suggests that SUMF2 specifically inhibits IL-13 secretion without affecting its mRNA expression levels (Liang2009SUMF2). 

Additionally, SUMF2 interacts with SUMF1 and sulfatases, influencing their activities and the formation of FGly, a critical modification for sulfatase function. This interaction may affect the modification and secretion of IL-13, indicating a potential role for SUMF2 in asthma (Ntenti2024The).
