# ZNF117

## Overview
ZNF117 is a gene located on chromosome 7 that encodes the zinc finger protein 117, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a DNA-binding transcription factor, characterized by its multiple zinc finger motifs that facilitate its role in gene regulation (Liu2022ZNF117; Chen2020Whole‑transcriptome). Zinc finger protein 117 is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of adipogenesis and the differentiation of glioblastoma stem cells, highlighting its significance in both metabolic and oncological contexts (Liu2022ZNF117; Clark2023ERV31ZNF117:). The gene's expression and its interaction with the Notch signaling pathway, particularly through the JAG2 ligand, underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as glioblastoma multiforme and metabolic disorders (Liu2022ZNF117; Clark2023rs67047829).

## Structure
ZNF117, or zinc finger protein 117, is characterized by the presence of multiple C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which are indicative of its role as a DNA-binding transcription factor (Liu2022ZNF117; Chen2020Whole‑transcriptome). These motifs contribute to the protein's secondary structure, typically involving a beta-pleat and alpha-helix configuration, stabilized by zinc ions (Clark2023ERV31ZNF117:). The zinc finger domains are crucial for the protein's function in binding DNA and potentially regulating gene expression.

The ZNF117 gene is located on chromosome 7 and has several transcripts, including ZNF117-201, ZNF117-202, and ZNF117-203, which may result in different isoforms of the protein (Clark2023rs67047829). The rs67047829 variant is located in a retained intron of ZNF117-202, suggesting potential regulatory effects on the expression of these transcripts (Clark2023rs67047829).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, affecting the protein's function and interactions, although specific modifications for ZNF117 are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's role in various biological processes, including adipogenesis and glioblastoma stem cell differentiation, highlights its functional significance (Liu2022ZNF117; Clark2023ERV31ZNF117:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF117 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and metabolic disorders. In the context of GBM, ZNF117 is highly expressed in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and plays a critical role in their differentiation towards the oligodendroglial lineage. Downregulation of ZNF117 has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, stemness, and tumor development in GSCs, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for GBM differentiation therapy (Liu2022ZNF117). The gene regulates Notch signaling through interaction with JAG2, a Notch ligand, which is crucial for GSC self-renewal and differentiation (Liu2022ZNF117). Targeting ZNF117 could enhance the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, a common treatment for GBM, by sensitizing GSCs to the drug (Liu2022ZNF117).

In metabolic disorders, the rs67047829 variant in the ZNF117 gene has been associated with body mass index (BMI) in the Polish population. This variant is linked to a lower likelihood of being overweight or obese, indicating a potential protective effect against higher BMI (Clark2023rs67047829). The gene's role in obesity and type-2 diabetes is suggested by its upregulation in pancreatic islet cells from diabetes patients and its involvement in brown adipogenesis (Clark2023rs67047829).

## Interactions
ZNF117, a zinc finger protein, is involved in interactions with the Notch signaling pathway, particularly through its interaction with JAG2, a Notch ligand. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) differentiation. ZNF117 binds to the promoter region of JAG2, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and ChIP-PCR analyses, which confirm its role as a transcription factor influencing JAG2 expression (Liu2022ZNF117). The downregulation of ZNF117 leads to decreased JAG2 expression, which in turn affects the Notch signaling pathway, reducing GSC proliferation and promoting differentiation towards the oligodendroglial lineage (Liu2022ZNF117).

The interaction between ZNF117 and JAG2 was further validated using luciferase reporter assays, which showed decreased luciferase activity in cells with downregulated ZNF117, indicating reduced transcriptional activity at the JAG2 promoter (Liu2022ZNF117). This interaction highlights the role of ZNF117 in modulating the Notch pathway, which is essential for maintaining GSC self-renewal and differentiation (Liu2022ZNF117). These findings suggest that ZNF117's interaction with JAG2 is a key mechanism in glioblastoma progression and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
