# ACVRL1

## Overview
The ACVRL1 gene encodes the Activin A receptor-like type 1 (ALK1), a type I transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor that plays a pivotal role in the TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathways. This receptor is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells and is integral to angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation. ALK1 functions by forming receptor complexes with other proteins, such as BMPR2 and endoglin, to mediate signaling cascades that regulate vascular development and stability. Mutations in the ACVRL1 gene are linked to several vascular disorders, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), due to disrupted TGF-beta signaling pathways (Alaa2015Functional; Wang2022Endothelial; Bocci2018Activin).

## Structure
The ACVRL1 protein, also known as ALK1, is a receptor involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway and plays a crucial role in vascular signaling. It is a single-pass membrane protein with distinct regions: an extracellular domain (amino acids 22-118), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 119-141), and an intracellular domain (amino acids 142-503) (Iwasa2023Computational). The intracellular region contains a serine/threonine protein kinase domain (amino acids 193-493), which is essential for its signaling function (Iwasa2023Computational).

The ACVRL1 protein includes several conserved motifs, such as the GS domain (amino acids 172-201), which is phosphorylated upon ligand binding and acts as a hub for interaction with SMAD and FKBP12 (Iwasa2023Computational). The L45 loop (amino acids 262-270) is involved in forming a stable trimer with the BMPR2 kinase domain and the SMAD1 MH2 domain, crucial for its interaction with SMAD1 (Iwasa2023Computational). The NANDOR domain (amino acids 479-489) is important for receptor complex formation (Iwasa2023Computational).

Mutations in the ACVRL1 gene can lead to impaired protein folding and trafficking, often resulting in retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and degradation, which is linked to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Alaa2015Functional).

## Function
The ACVRL1 gene encodes the Activin Receptor-Like Kinase 1 (ALK1), a type I transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor involved in the TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathways. This receptor is primarily expressed in endothelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels. ALK1 functions as a partner for BMPR2, a type II receptor, in the TGF-beta pathway. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor phosphorylates and activates ALK1, which subsequently phosphorylates receptor-regulated Smad proteins (Smad1, Smad5, or Smad8). These phosphorylated Smads dimerize with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus to activate the transcription of specific genes (Alaa2015Functional; Bocci2018Activin).

In healthy human cells, ALK1 is activated by ligands such as BMP9 and BMP10, with BMP9 being the only active circulating member of the TGF-beta family in adult human serum capable of activating ALK1. This activation is thought to regulate endothelial quiescence, maintaining vascular stability and function (Alaa2015Functional). The gene's expression is strongly correlated with endothelial cell content, indicating its significant role in vascular biology and endothelial cell function (Bocci2018Activin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACVRL1 gene are associated with several vascular disorders, most notably hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). HHT2 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectasias, recurrent epistaxis, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in various organs, including the lungs, liver, and brain (Letteboer2004Hereditary; Zhao2019Variant). Mutations in ACVRL1 disrupt normal TGF-β signaling, leading to these vascular abnormalities (Piao2016Identification).

In PAH, mutations in ACVRL1 result in sustained elevation of pressure in the pulmonary vascular system, impairing vascular function due to abnormalities in the TGF-β/BMP-9 pathway (Piao2016Identification). The gene's mutations are located in the kinase domain, crucial for its function, and lead to impaired response to BMP-9, a ligand involved in TGF-β receptor signaling (Piao2016Identification).

ACVRL1 mutations have also been linked to brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs), with certain polymorphisms increasing the risk of these malformations (Ge2017Association). The gene's role in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis is critical, and its mutations can lead to significant clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
The ACVRL1 gene encodes the Activin A receptor type II-like kinase 1 (ALK1), which is involved in several key interactions within endothelial cells. ALK1 forms a receptor complex with endoglin (ENG) and the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2) to mediate signaling pathways, particularly those involving the ligands BMP9 and BMP10 (Wang2022Endothelial; Ornati2014ACVRL1). This complex is crucial for the phosphorylation of SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8, which are downstream signaling molecules that translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Wang2022Endothelial).

The transcription factor Sp1 binds to the ACVRL1 promoter, particularly in the -510/-260 and -89/-56 regions, to regulate its transcription. This interaction is essential for the basal transcription of ACVRL1, with Sp1 binding independently to both sites in the promoter region (GarridoMartin2010Characterization). The transcription factor FOXF1 also directly binds to the ACVRL1 promoter, specifically to an evolutionarily conserved 80 bp sub-fragment, and works synergistically with the ETS transcription factor FLI1 to enhance ACVRL1 expression (Wang2022Endothelial). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms controlling ACVRL1 expression and function in endothelial cells.
