# CSNK1D

## Overview
The CSNK1D gene encodes the protein casein kinase 1 delta (CK1δ), a serine/threonine-specific kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. As a member of the casein kinase 1 family, CK1δ is involved in regulating the circadian rhythm, cell cycle, and signal transduction pathways, including Wnt, Hedgehog, and Hippo pathways (Xu2019Structure). The protein's structure is characterized by a kinase domain essential for its enzymatic activity, and it undergoes post-translational modifications that modulate its function (Xu2019Structure; Schittek2014Biological). CK1δ's interactions with various proteins influence processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and circadian rhythm, underscoring its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis (Schittek2014Biological; Wang2023Prognostic). The gene's dysregulation is associated with several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2023Prognostic; Rosenberg2015Therapeutic).

## Structure
The CSNK1D gene encodes the protein kinase CK1δ, which is a serine/threonine-specific kinase involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of CK1δ includes a kinase domain spanning amino acids 9 to 277, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Xu2019Structure). This domain contains a catalytic cleft formed between the N- and C-terminal lobes, connected by a hinge region, and features a glycine-rich P-loop that holds the non-transferable phosphate of ATP (Xu2019Structure).

The secondary structure of CK1δ is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets typical of kinases. The tertiary structure involves a conserved ATP-binding site, with key residues such as Lys-38, Asp-128, and those in the DFG motif (Asp-149, Phe-150, Gly-151) playing crucial roles in ATP binding (Xu2019Structure).

CK1δ can form dimers, with dimerization involving an α-helix from the C-lobe binding to a hydrophobic cavity in the N-lobe of another CK1δ molecule, which regulates its enzymatic activity (Xu2019Structure). Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific sites like Ser-370 and Thr-397, modulate CK1δ activity and interactions (Xu2019Structure; Schittek2014Biological). The protein exists in multiple transcription variants, with TV1, TV2, and TV3 showing differences in their C-terminal sequences (Xu2019Structure).

## Function
The CSNK1D gene encodes the protein kinase CK1δ, which is involved in numerous cellular processes in healthy human cells. CK1δ plays a critical role in regulating the circadian rhythm by phosphorylating PER proteins, which are part of the feedback loop controlling the circadian clock. This phosphorylation affects the stability and activity of circadian proteins, influencing the periodicity of the circadian cycle (Xu2019Structure).

CK1δ is also involved in cell cycle regulation, genomic stability, and mitosis. It phosphorylates proteins such as Wee1, leading to its degradation and promoting mitosis by increasing active CDK1 levels. CK1δ's role in microtubule dynamics is crucial for processes like cell division and ciliogenesis, where it interacts with proteins like AKAP450 to maintain Golgi organization (Xu2019Structure).

In the context of signaling pathways, CK1δ is a key player in the Wnt, Hedgehog, and Hippo pathways, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. It phosphorylates components like β-catenin, affecting its stability and activity, which is central to the Wnt signaling pathway (Xu2019Structure).

CK1δ is distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with increased levels near the Golgi apparatus, and is involved in processes such as vesicle transport and synaptic functions (Xu2019Structure). Its activity is regulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular function (Xu2019Structure).

## Clinical Significance
The CSNK1D gene, encoding casein kinase 1 delta (CK1δ), is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and genetic amplifications. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2+ subtypes, CSNK1D is often amplified and overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis. Targeting CK1δ in these cancers has shown potential in reducing tumor growth and metastasis (Bar2018Silencing; Rosenberg2015Therapeutic). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high CSNK1D expression is associated with advanced tumor stages and poorer survival outcomes, making it a potential prognostic marker. Inhibiting CSNK1D expression in HCC cells can hinder proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in tumor aggressiveness (Wang2023Prognostic).

CSNK1D is also involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and Hippo, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Wang2023Prognostic). Its overexpression is linked to reduced survival rates across multiple malignancies, highlighting its significance as a therapeutic target (Wang2023Prognostic). 

In addition to cancer, CSNK1D mutations or altered interactions may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, although specific details are less well-documented in the provided context.

## Interactions
CSNK1D, or casein kinase 1 delta, is involved in various protein interactions that influence multiple cellular processes. It interacts with Dishevelled Segment Polarity Protein 3 (DVL3), a key regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and immunofluorescence analysis, which demonstrated the colocalization of CSNK1D and DVL3 in HepG2 cells. The interaction stabilizes DVL3, enhancing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with aggressive cancer traits (Zhu2022Circadian).

CSNK1D also interacts with various proteins involved in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and several signaling pathways. It is known to interact with BID (apoptosis), Chk1 (cell cycle), and components of the Wnt signaling pathway such as APC, AXIN1, AXIN2, CTNNB1, and DVL1-3. These interactions suggest its involvement in regulating cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell survival, which are critical in tumor progression (Schittek2014Biological).

Additionally, CSNK1D interacts with proteins involved in circadian rhythm regulation, such as PER1, PER2, and PER3, influencing the entrainment of the circadian clock and other related processes (Wang2023Prognostic).
