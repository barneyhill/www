# SLC25A18

## Overview
SLC25A18 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 18, a transmembrane protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family and plays a crucial role in the transport of L-glutamate across the mitochondrial membrane, either with protons (H+) or in exchange for hydroxide ions (OH-). The transport activity of SLC25A18 is essential for mitochondrial metabolism, particularly in facilitating the entry of glutamate into the mitochondrial matrix, where it serves as a substrate for glutamate dehydrogenase, contributing to the urea cycle and overall cellular homeostasis (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological; Palmieri2004The). The protein's function is influenced by the mitochondrial membrane potential and the protonmotive force, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy balance (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

## Structure
The SLC25A18 protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, characterized by a tripartite structure with three homologous domains, each approximately 100 amino acids in length. These domains contain two hydrophobic stretches that span the mitochondrial inner membrane as alpha-helices, separated by hydrophilic regions (Palmieri2013The; Palmieri2004The). The protein's structure includes six transmembrane alpha-helices arranged in a counter-clockwise order, forming a funnel-shaped cavity open towards the cytosol. This arrangement is stabilized by a salt-bridge network formed by charged residues of the signature motifs, which closes the cavity on the matrix side (Palmieri2013The).

The SLC25A18 protein functions as a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to the formation of the transmembrane channel. The N- and C-termini of the protein are located on the cytosolic side of the membrane (Palmieri2004The). The protein's primary role is to transport L-glutamate across the mitochondrial membrane, either with H+ or in exchange for OH-, a process crucial for mitochondrial metabolism (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological; Palmieri2004The). The protein's structure and function are influenced by the mitochondrial membrane potential and the protonmotive force (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

## Function
SLC25A18, also known as GC2, is a glutamate carrier located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is highly homologous to SLC25A22 (GC1), sharing 63% identity. Both isoforms transport glutamate along with protons, and their transport is dependent on the chemical component of the protonmotive force (pH) (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The primary physiological role of SLC25A18 is to import glutamate into the mitochondrial matrix, where it serves as a substrate for mitochondrial-restricted glutamate dehydrogenase. This enzyme converts glutamate into oxoglutarate and NH4+, which then enters the urea cycle (Palmieri2004The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

SLC25A18 facilitates the transport of L-glutamate either with H+ or in exchange for OH-, but it does not transport structurally related compounds such as L-aspartate, L-glutamine, and L-homocysteinesulphinate. The transport of glutamate is dependent on the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, favoring entry in energized mitochondria (Palmieri2004The). This process is crucial for feeding the urea cycle, even if glutamate is the only ammonium source for mitochondrial synthesis of carbamoylphosphate (Palmieri2004The). SLC25A18 is thought to meet the basic requirements of all tissues, contributing to overall cellular and organismal homeostasis (Palmieri2004The).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC25A18 gene is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its role as a glutamate transporter on the mitochondrial membrane. Studies have shown that SLC25A18 is differentially expressed in AD, with its expression positively correlated with the disease. This up-regulation is observed in various brain regions, including the entorhinal cortex, temporal association cortex, and hippocampus, in both animal models and in vitro studies using Aβ1-42-induced Neuro 2A cells. The increased expression of SLC25A18 suggests its involvement in excitatory neurotoxicity, a key feature of AD pathology, potentially linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted glutamate transport (Song2022Expression).

In addition to its role in AD, altered expression of SLC25A18 has been noted in the hypothalamus of mice subjected to social stress, which may model aspects of anxiety or depression. This suggests a potential link between SLC25A18 expression and physiological or behavioral changes associated with stress-related disorders (Babenko2018Altered). While specific diseases directly caused by mutations in SLC25A18 are not detailed, its role in glutamate transport and mitochondrial function indicates its broader significance in neurological disorders (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).
