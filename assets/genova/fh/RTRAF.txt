# RTRAF

## Overview
The RTRAF gene encodes the RNA transcription, translation, and transport factor, a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes. This protein plays a pivotal role in RNA processing, mRNA transport, and translation, contributing to mRNA stability and the regulation of gene expression. Functioning as both a transcription factor and a protein transporter, RTRAF is active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing cellular homeostasis and development. It is also involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly the transition from the G1 to S phase, and in maintaining redox homeostasis through interactions with other proteins such as EI24. These interactions are crucial for controlling reactive oxygen species production and insulin synthesis. RTRAF's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Pei2024Translational; Esfandiarpoor2023The).

## Function
The RTRAF gene, also known as RNA transcription, translation, and transport factor, is a multifunctional gene involved in various molecular processes essential for gene expression. RTRAF functions as a transcription factor and a protein transporter, playing a significant role in RNA processing and transport, which influences mRNA stability and translation. It is active in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, contributing to cellular homeostasis and proper organismal development (Esfandiarpoor2023The).

In healthy human cells, RTRAF is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly influencing the transition from the G1 to S phase. This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cell proliferation and preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Esfandiarpoor2023The). RTRAF also plays a role in maintaining hydrogen peroxide homeostasis and insulin synthesis through its interaction with EI24, which recruits RTRAF to the 3'-UTRs of Nox4 mRNA, inhibiting its translation. This interaction is essential for controlling the production of reactive oxygen species, which are important for cell signaling and metabolic regulation (Pei2024Translational).

Overall, RTRAF's activities in RNA processing, cell cycle regulation, and redox homeostasis highlight its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RTRAF gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of thyroid conditions and insulin synthesis. In thyroid tissues, a significant reduction in RTRAF expression has been observed in benign goiter tissues compared to adjacent healthy tissues. This reduction may hinder cancer cell growth, suggesting a potential role in impeding the progression of malignancy in thyroid cells (Esfandiarpoor2023The). However, no significant difference in RTRAF expression was found between papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tissues and their adjacent healthy tissues, indicating that its role in malignant thyroid conditions remains unclear (Esfandiarpoor2023The).

In pancreatic beta cells, RTRAF is involved in the regulation of Nox4 mRNA translation through its interaction with the EI24 protein. This interaction is crucial for maintaining hydrogen peroxide homeostasis and insulin synthesis. Disruption of this interaction, such as through the depletion of EI24, leads to uncontrolled Nox4 translation, increased hydrogen peroxide levels, and impaired insulin production. This dysregulation is associated with oxidative stress and may contribute to the development of diabetes (Pei2024Translational).

## Interactions
RTRAF, also known as RNA transcription, translation, and transport factor, is involved in various protein interactions and complexes. It is a component of the pentameric tRNA ligase complex, which includes DDX1, FAM98B, RTCB, and ASHWIN. This complex is essential for tRNA splicing, and RTRAF's role within it involves forming a heterodimer with FAM98B (Bartolec2022Crosslinking). RTRAF is also part of a complex with hCLE/C14orf166, DDX1, HSPC117, and FAM98B, which is involved in mRNA transport and translation. This complex binds to cap structures on mRNAs, playing a role in mRNA stability and translation initiation (Pazo2019hCLERTRAFHSPC117DDX1FAM98B:).

RTRAF interacts with EI24 to regulate the translation of Nox4 mRNA. This interaction recruits RTRAF to the 3'-UTR of Nox4 mRNA, inhibiting its translation and maintaining hydrogen peroxide homeostasis (Pei2024Translational). The absence of EI24 leads to decreased RTRAF levels and altered subcellular localization, suggesting that EI24 traps RTRAF in the cytoplasm to facilitate its binding to Nox4 mRNA (Pei2024Translational). RTRAF also interacts with the Human Herpesvirus 8 ORF57 protein, indicating its involvement in stress response pathways (Webber2023Human).
