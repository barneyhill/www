# ADPRM

## Overview
The ADPRM gene encodes the enzyme ADP-ribose/CDP-alcohol diphosphatase, which is a member of the metallophosphoesterase family. This enzyme is characterized by its dependence on manganese ions for catalytic activity and is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose and CDP-alcohols. The protein plays a significant role in the turnover of intracellular signaling molecules, influencing various cellular pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of ion channels and immune system signaling. The enzyme's structural integrity, including its alpha helices and beta sheets, is crucial for its function, and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may further modulate its activity (Cabezas2015Molecular).

## Structure
The ADPRM protein is characterized by its role in the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose and is dependent on manganese for its enzymatic activity. It belongs to the metallophosphoesterase family, which is known for its conserved domain that facilitates the binding of metal ions, a feature crucial for the protein's function. The structural composition of ADPRM includes common secondary structures such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which are typical in proteins of this family. These structural elements contribute to the protein's stability and functionality.

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. These modifications are essential for regulating the protein's function and ensuring its proper activity within the cell. The presence of specific domains within ADPRM allows it to effectively participate in its enzymatic role, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity. While detailed information on splice variant isoforms is not provided, the structural features mentioned are integral to the protein's role in cellular processes. The combination of these structural elements and modifications underscores the complexity and specificity of ADPRM's function in human biology.

## Function
The ADPRM gene encodes the enzyme ADP-ribose/CDP-alcohol diphosphatase, which is manganese-dependent and plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose and CDP-alcohols. This enzyme is involved in the turnover of intracellular signaling molecules, such as ADP-ribose and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), which are important for regulating ion channels and immune system signaling (Cabezas2015Molecular). ADPRM is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences various cellular pathways and contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis (Cabezas2015Molecular).

The enzyme exhibits a preference for ADP-ribose, with its catalytic efficiency being highest for this substrate due to a lower Km value (Cabezas2015Molecular). It also shows activity towards cADPR, although this is less efficient compared to ADP-ribose. The enzyme's activity on cADPR suggests a potential role in cADPR turnover, which may be relevant for cADPR's function as a messenger in calcium mobilization and other physiological processes (Ribeiro2018Specific).

Mutagenic engineering of ADPRM has been explored to enhance its specificity for cADPR, which could have applications in studying cADPR's role in biological systems (Ribeiro2018Specific).
