# ALKBH6

## Overview
ALKBH6 is a gene that encodes the protein alkB homolog 6, which is part of the ALKB dioxygenases family. This family of proteins is involved in oxidative dealkylation, a critical process for DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability. AlkB homolog 6 is characterized by its Fe (II) metal center and α-KG binding sites, which are essential for its enzymatic activity in removing alkyl groups from DNA. The protein is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting potential roles in nucleotide or nucleic acid metabolism, possibly involving RNA substrates, although these functions are not yet fully elucidated (Zhao2021Human; Ougland2015Nonhomologous). While its precise biological roles remain under investigation, ALKBH6 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels may influence disease prognosis and therapeutic outcomes (Cai2021Expression; Zhao2021Human).

## Function
ALKBH6 is a member of the ALKB dioxygenases family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability through oxidative dealkylation, a process important for DNA repair. This gene contains an Fe (II) metal center and two α-KG binding sites, which are essential for its function in catalyzing the removal of alkyl groups from DNA, thereby preventing the accumulation of DNA damage (Zhao2021Human). In healthy human cells, ALKBH6 likely functions to prevent DNA damage accumulation and support cell survival under stress conditions, although its specific role remains less understood compared to its function in cancer cells (Zhao2021Human).

The subcellular localization of ALKBH6 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm suggests potential activity on nucleotides or nucleic acids, possibly involving RNA substrates, although this remains speculative (Ougland2015Nonhomologous). Despite its involvement in crucial cellular processes, mice lacking Alkbh6 do not exhibit any overt phenotype, indicating that its function in healthy cells is still a mystery and requires further investigation (Ougland2015Nonhomologous). The precise endogenous activities and roles of ALKBH6 in RNA demethylation or other novel DNA/RNA repair activities are not fully understood (A.2016ALKBHs-facilitated).

## Clinical Significance
ALKBH6 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in maintaining genomic stability and promoting cell survival. In pancreatic cancer, ALKBH6 is crucial for protecting cells from DNA damage caused by alkylating agents. Overexpression of ALKBH6 in pancreatic cancer is associated with better overall survival, although this protective effect is not observed in cases with concurrent p53 mutations, where it correlates with poorer survival outcomes (Zhao2021Human). 

In ovarian serous carcinoma, high transcriptional levels of ALKBH6 are linked to shorter overall survival, while low levels are associated with longer progression-free survival. This suggests that ALKBH6 expression levels may influence the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients (Cai2021Expression). 

In lung adenocarcinoma, ALKBH6 shows reduced expression compared to normal lung tissue, and its expression is not significantly correlated with overall survival, indicating a potentially different role in this cancer type (Wu2021ALKBH18). 

These findings suggest that ALKBH6's role in cancer may vary depending on the cancer type and genetic context, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.
