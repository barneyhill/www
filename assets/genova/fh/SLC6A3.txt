# SLC6A3

## Overview
The SLC6A3 gene encodes the solute carrier family 6 member 3 protein, commonly known as the dopamine transporter (DAT), which is a critical component of the neurotransmitter system in the human brain. This transmembrane protein is primarily responsible for the reuptake of dopamine from the synaptic cleft back into presynaptic neurons, thereby regulating dopamine levels and ensuring proper dopaminergic signaling (Giros1993Molecular; Reith2021The). The structure of DAT includes 12 transmembrane helices, which facilitate its function as a transporter (Nepal2023Overview). DAT's activity is modulated by various factors, including genetic variants and environmental influences, which can impact its role in neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Parkinson's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome (Reith2021The; Ng2023Dopamine). Understanding the SLC6A3 gene and its encoded protein is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying these disorders and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Structure
The SLC6A3 gene encodes the dopamine transporter (DAT), a protein integral to dopaminergic neurotransmission. The primary structure of DAT consists of 620 amino acids, forming a complex tertiary structure characterized by 12 transmembrane (TM) helices. These helices are organized into a bundle, with TM1 to TM5 and TM6 to TM10 exhibiting pseudo-two-fold symmetry (Joseph2019Structure; Nepal2023Overview). The secondary structure includes transmembrane alpha-helices, which are crucial for the transporter's function.

DAT's tertiary structure is influenced by specific structural features, such as a kink in TM12 and the presence of cholesterol molecules that affect its conformation (Nepal2023Overview). The protein's quaternary structure involves oligomerization, forming dimers and tetramers, which is essential for its physiological activity, including transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (Nepal2023Overview).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, palmitoylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation, play significant roles in regulating DAT's function and localization. These modifications occur on the N-terminal domain, intracellular loop 1, C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, and extracellular segments between the third and fourth transmembrane domains (Nepal2023Overview). The presence of splice variant isoforms can also affect the protein's function and localization.

## Function
The SLC6A3 gene encodes the human dopamine transporter (hDAT), a critical protein involved in the reuptake of dopamine from the synaptic cleft back into presynaptic neurons. This process is essential for terminating dopamine signaling and maintaining neurotransmitter balance in the brain (Giros1993Molecular). The dopamine transporter is primarily active in the brain's dopaminergic pathways, influencing mood, reward, and motor control (Reith2021The).

In healthy human cells, the dopamine transporter is dynamically regulated by various signaling pathways and is influenced by psychostimulants like amphetamine (AMPH). AMPH typically reduces DAT expression at the plasma membrane, a process dependent on AMPH transport across the membrane (Bowton2014SLC6A3). The SLC6A3 gene's activity is also modulated by environmental factors such as stress and high-fat food, which can increase its activity, while environmental enrichment can decrease it (Reith2021The).

The SLC6A3 gene's variants can affect the function of hDAT, altering its density and dopamine reuptake activity, which in turn influences the dynamics of dopamine neurotransmission (Reith2021The). These molecular processes are crucial for normal cognitive and motor functions, as they regulate dopamine levels in the brain (Reith2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC6A3 gene, which encodes the dopamine transporter (DAT), are associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Missense mutations in SLC6A3, such as DAT-Ile312Phe and DAT-Asp421Asn, have been linked to early-onset parkinsonism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These mutations result in reduced dopamine uptake capacity and impaired catalytic activity, suggesting a disruption in sodium binding and dopaminergic neurotransmission (Hansen2014Missense). 

Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in SLC6A3 can lead to infantile parkinsonism-dystonia, characterized by early-onset movement disorders. Specific mutations, such as L368Q and P395L, significantly reduce dopamine uptake activity, contributing to the condition (Kurian2009Homozygous). 

Dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome (DTDS), an ultrarare childhood movement disorder, is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in SLC6A3. This results in impaired dopamine transporter function, leading to persistent synaptic dopamine and raised homovanillic acid levels (Ng2023Dopamine). 

Alterations in SLC6A3 expression levels are also implicated in various disorders. Increased SLC6A3 activity is linked to alcohol use disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia, while decreased activity is associated with depression (Reith2021The). Genetic variants in SLC6A3 affect responses to medications, influencing treatment efficacy and side effects in conditions like ADHD and Parkinson's disease (Reith2021The).

## Interactions
The dopamine transporter (DAT), encoded by the SLC6A3 gene, engages in various interactions with proteins that influence its function and regulation. DAT interacts with the dopamine D2 receptor, which enhances its localization to the plasma membrane and increases dopamine uptake activity. This interaction involves the IC3 loop of the D2 receptor and the N-terminal domain of DAT (Nepal2023Overview). Pramipexole, a DA D3 receptor agonist, promotes interactions of DAT with D2/D3 receptors and α-synuclein, although this interaction reduces DAT reuptake activity (Nepal2023Overview).

Syntaxin 1A interacts with the N-terminal domain of DAT, suppressing dopamine uptake and DAT phosphorylation while enhancing amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux. This interaction is dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and is crucial for amphetamine-induced locomotor activity (Nepal2023Overview). DAT also interacts with the Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) and PICK1, a PDZ domain-containing protein, which regulates DAT activity. PICK1 interaction increases DAT uptake activity and aids in ER export and surface expression of DAT (Nepal2023Overview).

The HIV-1 Tat protein interacts with DAT, impairing its functional activity and leading to neurotoxicity. This interaction is particularly detrimental in HIV-1 patients with cocaine use disorder due to the synergistic inhibition of DAT function (Nepal2023Overview).
