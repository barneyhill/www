# CAPN12

## Overview
CAPN12 is a gene that encodes the protein calpain 12, a member of the calpain family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. Calpain 12 is primarily expressed in the skin and hair follicles, where it plays a significant role in epidermal differentiation and hair follicle cycling. The protein is characterized by a central domain with a large β-sandwich motif, which is essential for its structural stability, and it includes protease and calcium-binding domains. Variants of calpain 12, resulting from alternative splicing, may lack certain domains, affecting its calcium-binding capacity and function. Mutations in CAPN12 have been linked to skin disorders such as autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, and its expression levels have been associated with prognostic outcomes in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (Bochner2017Calpain; Xia2023An).

## Structure
The CAPN12 gene encodes calpain 12, a calcium-activated cysteine protease primarily expressed in the skin. The protein structure includes a central domain with a large β-sandwich motif, which is crucial for stabilizing the protein fold. This domain is surrounded by N-terminal and C-terminal domains, contributing to the overall stability of the protein (Bochner2017Calpain). The primary structure of calpain 12 consists of amino acid sequences that form specific domains, including a protease core and calcium-binding domains. The secondary structure likely involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of calpain proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

Calpain 12 has several splice variant isoforms, with some lacking the C-terminal calmodulin-like domain, which may affect calcium binding (Dear2000Gene). The splice variant B is more abundant than variant A, suggesting that a significant portion of CAPN12 proteins may lack the Ca2+ binding domain (Dear2000Gene). The mutation p.P504Q, identified in the central domain, disrupts the hydrophobic core, potentially destabilizing the protein structure (Bochner2017Calpain). The protein's function and stability are influenced by these structural features, which are essential for its role in epidermal differentiation and hair follicle cycling (Bochner2017Calpain).

## Function
Calpain 12 (CAPN12) is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease primarily expressed in the skin and hair follicles, where it plays a crucial role in epidermal differentiation and hair follicle cycling. In healthy human cells, CAPN12 is involved in maintaining skin integrity and normal hair growth by regulating the transition of hair follicles through different phases of the hair cycle. Down-regulation of CAPN12 has been shown to induce catagen-like transformations in hair follicles, leading to increased apoptotic activity, which underscores its importance in hair follicle cycling (Bochner2017Calpain).

CAPN12 also contributes to epidermal differentiation by influencing the processing and activation of components of the cornified cell envelope. Its deficiency is associated with abnormal epidermal differentiation and reduced expression of filaggrin, a key protein in skin barrier function, suggesting that CAPN12 directly regulates filaggrin expression during epidermal maturation (Bochner2017Calpain). The protein's activity is linked to the structural organization of the epidermis, as its down-regulation results in disorganized epidermal architecture and abnormal keratinocyte morphology (Bochner2017Calpain). These functions highlight CAPN12's role in maintaining normal skin and hair physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CAPN12 gene have been implicated in several skin disorders, particularly autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). A study identified a mutation in CAPN12, resulting in a p.P504Q substitution, which is highly conserved and likely damaging to protein function. This mutation was associated with an atypical case of ARCI, characterized by abnormal epidermal differentiation and hair cycling, as well as disorganized epidermal architecture and altered keratin gene expression (Bochner2017Calpain). 

The study also found a 40 bp deletion in CAPN12, predicted to cause frameshift and premature protein termination, leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This deletion was present in the patient's mother, suggesting a potential role in the disease phenotype (Bochner2017Calpain). CAPN12 mutations may also act as genetic modifiers in conditions involving ABCA12 mutations, affecting the clinical presentation of disorders like exfoliative erythroderma (Bochner2017Calpain).

In addition to skin disorders, CAPN12 has been studied in the context of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC). High expression of CAPN12 is associated with better overall survival in ccRCC patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Xia2023An).
