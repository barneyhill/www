# NPL

## Overview
The NPL gene encodes the enzyme N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase, which is involved in the catabolism of sialic acids, a family of nine-carbon sugars that play a crucial role in cellular recognition and signaling processes. This enzyme is categorized as a lyase, specifically functioning to cleave N-acetylneuraminate into pyruvate and N-acetylmannosamine, which are further utilized in various metabolic pathways. The activity of N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has implications in several physiological and pathological processes, including microbial pathogenesis and cancer metastasis (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the regulation and interaction of the NPL gene and its encoded protein is critical for elucidating its role in health and disease.
