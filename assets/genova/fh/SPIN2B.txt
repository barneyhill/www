# SPIN2B

## Overview
SPIN2B is a gene that encodes the protein spindlin family member 2B, which is part of the spindlin family characterized by the presence of Tudor domains. These domains are known for their ability to bind methylated lysine residues, playing a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The SPIN2B protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional activity by interacting with specific histone modifications, such as trimethylated histone marks H3K4me3 and H4K20me3. These interactions facilitate the modulation of chromatin structure, thereby impacting gene expression patterns essential for cell cycle progression, proliferation, and differentiation. The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular health and organismal homeostasis. Alterations in SPIN2B expression have been associated with various diseases, including metabolic disorders and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Frankel2014Genome‐wide; Chang2014Expression; Shanle2017Histone).

## Structure
SPIN2B is a member of the spindlin family, characterized by the presence of Tudor domains, which are known for binding methylated lysine residues. The primary structure of SPIN2B consists of amino acid sequences encoded by the SPIN2B gene. Its secondary structure typically includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these elements, often forming a barrel-like shape, which is a common feature in proteins with Tudor domains. This structural configuration is crucial for its role in recognizing and binding specific methylated residues.

Post-translational modifications of SPIN2B may include methylation and phosphorylation, which can significantly affect the protein's function and interactions. These modifications are essential for regulating the protein's activity and its involvement in various cellular processes. The presence of these modifications suggests that SPIN2B may play a role in signal transduction pathways and gene expression regulation. There is no information provided about the quaternary structure of SPIN2B, indicating that it may function as a monomer or that its multimeric state has not been characterized.

## Function
SPIN2B, a member of the spindlin family, is involved in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression. It plays a significant role in cell cycle progression by influencing transcriptional activity through interactions with histones. This protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to essential cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. By modulating chromatin structure, SPIN2B facilitates the accessibility of transcriptional machinery to DNA, thereby impacting gene expression patterns crucial for normal cellular function. Its activity in the nucleus underscores its importance in maintaining proper cell cycle dynamics and ensuring the fidelity of cell division. Through these molecular processes, SPIN2B supports the growth and development of healthy human cells, highlighting its role in organismal homeostasis and cellular health.

## Clinical Significance
The SPIN2B gene has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In a study on obese spontaneously hypertensive/ndmcr-cp rats, SPIN2B was identified as significantly down-regulated in the adipose tissues, suggesting a potential role in metabolic disorders related to obesity (Chang2014Expression). Additionally, in the context of esophageal adenocarcinoma, SPIN2B was noted in a region with significant copy number gain, indicating a possible involvement in cancer progression through genomic instability (Frankel2014Genome‐wide).

While specific diseases directly linked to SPIN2B mutations are not detailed, its downregulation in the retina of DBA/2J mice, a model for glaucoma, suggests a potential role in retinal health and disease processes (Panagis2010Gene). These findings highlight the importance of SPIN2B in various physiological and pathological contexts, particularly in relation to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which SPIN2B contributes to these conditions and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SPIN2B, a member of the Spindlin family, is known to interact with specific histone modifications, which suggests its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. SPIN2B, like SPIN1, preferentially binds to trimethylated histone marks H3K4me3 and H4K20me3. These interactions were confirmed through peptide pull-down experiments using both purified proteins and cell lysates, indicating that SPIN2B recognizes these histone marks in cellular contexts (Shanle2017Histone). The binding of SPIN2B to these histone marks suggests its involvement in recognizing transcriptional activation and silencing modifications, similar to SPIN1, which can read both activating and deactivating histone post-translational modifications (Shanle2017Histone).

The structural basis of SPIN2B's interactions was further explored through crystallization studies. SPIN2B was crystallized in complex with a peptide containing the ARTK(me3)QTAR(me2a)KS sequence, which provides insights into its binding interactions and structural conformation (Fagan2019A). These studies highlight the potential of SPIN2B to participate in multiprotein complexes and influence transcriptional activity through its interactions with specific histone modifications.
