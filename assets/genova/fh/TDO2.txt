# TDO2

## Overview
TDO2, or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, is a gene that encodes a heme-containing enzyme involved in the catabolism of tryptophan, a crucial amino acid. The enzyme, categorized as a dioxygenase, plays a pivotal role in the kynurenine pathway, which is the primary route for tryptophan degradation in the liver. This pathway is essential for maintaining tryptophan homeostasis and producing metabolites that influence various physiological processes, including immune response and neurotransmitter regulation (Dolšak2021Indoleamine; LewisBallester2016Molecular). TDO2's enzymatic activity is significant in both normal metabolic functions and pathological conditions, such as cancer and psychiatric disorders, where its expression and regulation can impact disease progression and therapeutic outcomes (Boros2018Genetic; Pham2021Clinicopathologic). The structural and functional characteristics of TDO2, including its interactions with other proteins and small molecule inhibitors, make it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various clinical settings (Zhao2021TDO2; LotzJenne2024Discovery).

## Structure
The human tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) enzyme is a heme-containing protein involved in the catabolism of tryptophan. Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids that form a homotetramer, consisting of a dimer of dimers, with each dimer stabilized by domain-swapping of a ~50 residue long N-terminal fragment (Pham2019Structural). The secondary structure features a helix-loop-helix domain, which is crucial for heme binding and is absent in the related enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) (Pham2019Structural).

The tertiary structure of TDO2 includes a core domain that binds heme, essential for its enzymatic activity. The enzyme's quaternary structure is a homo tetramer, which is necessary for its function (Pham2019Structural). The binding sites for heme and tryptophan are well-characterized, with the S a site being responsible for inhibitor binding and activity (Pham2019Structural).

The enzyme's structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, which lock certain loops in a closed conformation, crucial for its catalytic function (Pham2019Structural). The structural rigidity of TDO2 contributes to its specific binding mechanisms, distinguishing it from other similar enzymes (Pham2019Structural).

## Function
Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) is a crucial enzyme in the kynurenine pathway, responsible for the oxidative cleavage of the indole ring of L-tryptophan, converting it into N-formylkynurenine. This reaction is the first and rate-limiting step in tryptophan catabolism, which is significant for maintaining tryptophan homeostasis in the body (Meng2014Structural; LewisBallester2016Molecular). TDO2 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it metabolizes approximately 95% of dietary tryptophan, leading to the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a critical cofactor in cellular energy metabolism (Michels2016Identification; LewisBallester2016Molecular).

In healthy human cells, TDO2 plays a vital role in regulating the balance of tryptophan and its metabolites, which can influence brain function and mood regulation through serotonin production (Michels2016Identification). The enzyme's activity is dependent on a heme cofactor, and it exists as a tetrameric structure, which is conserved across species (Dolšak2021Indoleamine; Meng2014Structural). TDO2's function is not only crucial for metabolic processes but also for modulating immune responses, as its up-regulation can lead to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity (LewisBallester2016Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TDO2 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In psychiatric disorders, polymorphisms in TDO2 are associated with conditions such as autism, Tourette syndrome (TS), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These genetic variations can lead to altered serotonin levels, which are linked to these disorders (Boros2018Genetic; Vasiliev1999Point). TDO2 is also involved in the pathology of schizophrenia, where its upregulation may contribute to increased levels of kynurenic acid, an NMDA receptor antagonist, potentially exacerbating symptoms (Yu2016TDO).

In cancer, TDO2 overexpression is observed in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and is associated with poor prognosis and disease progression. It correlates with immune checkpoint markers and cancer stem cell markers, suggesting a role in immune evasion and tumor aggressiveness (Pham2021Clinicopathologic). TDO2 is also upregulated in uterine leiomyomas with MED12 mutations, promoting tumor growth through the kynurenine-aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway (Zuberi2023MED12).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TDO2 in both neuropsychiatric and oncological contexts, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

## Interactions
Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in various biological processes. In colorectal cancer, TDO2 interacts with proteins in the tryptophan metabolism pathway, notably kynureninase (KYNU) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). These interactions are part of the TDO2–KYNU–AhR pathway, which is implicated in cancer progression (Zhao2021TDO2). TDO2's expression correlates with these proteins, and its knockdown results in decreased mRNA levels of KYNU and AhR, suggesting a regulatory role in this pathway (Zhao2021TDO2).

In liver cancer, TDO2 is associated with the Wnt5a and MAPK signaling pathways. It influences the expression of CD44 and MMP7, proteins linked to cancer cell migration and invasion. Pharmacological inhibition of the MAPK pathway can block TDO2-induced increases in these proteins, highlighting TDO2's role in modulating these pathways (Liu2022TDO2).

TDO2 also interacts with small molecule inhibitors, as demonstrated in studies using the apo form of the enzyme. These interactions are crucial for understanding TDO2's function and potential therapeutic targeting. The binding of inhibitors like Rac-1 to the heme binding pocket of apo-TDO2 has been explored, offering insights into the development of TDO2-specific inhibitors (LotzJenne2024Discovery).
