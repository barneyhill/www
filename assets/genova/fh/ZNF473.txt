# ZNF473

## Overview
ZNF473 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 473, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate its interaction with nucleic acids, thereby influencing gene expression. These domains are stabilized by the coordination of zinc ions, which are essential for the protein's structural integrity and function (Padjasek2020Structural; Kluska2018Metala). ZNF473 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, and has been implicated in several diseases, such as cervical cancer and congenital lung malformations, through its altered expression and interactions with other molecular components (Yang2021Transcriptome; Long2017Systematic). The protein's function and stability can be modulated by post-translational modifications, although these do not directly affect its zinc coordination sites (Kluska2018Metala).

## Structure
ZNF473 is a zinc finger protein characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its structural integrity and function. These domains typically involve the coordination of zinc ions with cysteine and histidine residues, forming a stable core that facilitates the protein's folding into its functional conformation (Padjasek2020Structural). The zinc finger domains in ZNF473 likely adopt a ββα fold, a common structural motif in zinc fingers, which is stabilized by the coordination of zinc ions (Padjasek2020Structural).

The primary structure of ZNF473 is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which are essential for zinc coordination. The secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which are stabilized by zinc binding (Kluska2018Metala). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to facilitate interactions with DNA, as zinc fingers are known for their role in nucleic acid binding (Kluska2018Metala).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the function and stability of ZNF473, although they do not affect the zinc coordination sites directly (Kluska2018Metala). These structural features enable ZNF473 to participate in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF473 has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cervical cancer, ZNF473 is consistently upregulated, suggesting a potential role in the disease's progression. This upregulation has been identified as an intrinsic genetic characteristic of cervical carcinogenesis, indicating its importance in the development and progression of cervical cancer (Long2017Systematic).

In congenital lung malformations, ZNF473 is involved in the pathogenesis through its interaction with long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as FLJ26850. The study by Yang et al. found a significant enrichment of known ZNF473 targets among down-regulated transcripts, suggesting that ZNF473 may play a role in the molecular pathways associated with these malformations (Yang2021Transcriptome).

ZNF473 has also been studied in the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where it shows differential expression related to gender differences. This suggests a potential involvement in the transcriptional misregulation observed in cancer, although the specific clinical significance in HNSCC remains unclear (Thavarajah2020Study).
