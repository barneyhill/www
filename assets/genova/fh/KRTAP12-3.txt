# KRTAP12-3

## Overview
KRTAP12-3 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 12-3, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, which is integral to the structure and function of keratinized tissues such as hair and nails. The protein is characterized by a high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to its stability and structural integrity (Rogers2006Human). KRTAP12-3 is predominantly expressed in the hair cuticle, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments to enhance the mechanical strength and resilience of hair (Rogers2006Human). Beyond its traditional role in hair biology, KRTAP12-3 has been implicated in processes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer, indicating potential roles in pathological conditions (Škalamera2016Genomewide). Despite its involvement in cancer research, the gene's primary function remains associated with maintaining hair structure and quality.

## Structure
The KRTAP12-3 protein is a member of the KAP12 family, characterized by a moderately high cysteine content, ranging from 21.2% to 23.2% (Rogers2006Human). This high cysteine content is crucial for forming disulfide bonds, which contribute to the protein's stability and structural integrity. The primary structure of KRTAP12-3 includes single cysteine-containing pentameric repeats that span the middle sections of the protein, indicating a repetitive sequence pattern (Rogers2006Human).

The protein is also rich in serine, proline, and valine, with serine content ranging from 17.7% to 21.9% (Rogers2006Human). These amino acids contribute to the protein's structural properties and potential post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. The KRTAP12 subfamily, including KRTAP12-3, features motifs like CCVP, CCQP, and CCQPS, with a consensus sequence of CQX3CX4CX4CX3S, which suggests a specific pattern of cysteine and other residues (Shibuya2004A).

Polymorphisms in the KRTAP12.3 gene have been identified, including a substitution at position 50, changing the codon from CGC (arginine) to CAC (histidine), which may affect the protein's function or structure (Shibuya2004A). The protein's expression is specific to the hair cuticle, reflecting its role in hair structure (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP12-3 (keratin associated protein 12-3) is a member of the keratin-associated protein family, which plays a significant role in the structure and function of hair and nails. These proteins interact with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of keratinized tissues. KRTAP12-3 is primarily active in the hair cortex, where it influences hair texture and quality. The protein's interaction with keratin filaments is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of hair, providing it with the necessary strength and flexibility to withstand environmental stressors.

In the context of cancer research, KRTAP12-3 has been identified as a potential driver of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer, suggesting a role beyond its traditional function in hair biology (Škalamera2016Genomewide). However, its expression in colorectal cancer research was found to be variable or low, leading to its exclusion from certain analyses aimed at identifying stable endogenous control genes (Kheirelseid2010Identification). Despite these findings, the primary function of KRTAP12-3 in healthy human cells remains associated with its role in hair structure and quality.
