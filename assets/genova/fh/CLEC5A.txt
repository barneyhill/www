# CLEC5A

## Overview
CLEC5A is a gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain containing 5A, a receptor protein primarily expressed on myeloid cells. This protein is a member of the C-type lectin receptor family, which plays a significant role in the immune system by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns and mediating immune responses. CLEC5A is particularly noted for its involvement in the recognition of viral pathogens, such as the dengue virus and influenza virus, and in the activation of inflammatory pathways. The protein interacts with the adapter protein DAP12, leading to downstream signaling events that are crucial for immune cell activation and cytokine production. Due to its role in modulating immune responses, CLEC5A is implicated in various pathological conditions, including infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders, and certain cancers (Watson2011Structural; Teng2017CLEC5AMediated; Wu2013CLEC5A).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC5A, a C-type lectin domain-containing protein, is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression or interactions. In cancer, CLEC5A is overexpressed in several tumor types, including ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, and colon cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression. Its high expression correlates with increased immune cell infiltration and poor overall survival in cancers like glioblastoma and ovarian cancer (Chen2022A; Shen2021Identification; Fan2019C‐type). In glioblastoma, CLEC5A promotes tumorigenesis through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Fan2019C‐type).

CLEC5A is also involved in inflammatory diseases. It is linked to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with specific polymorphisms providing protective effects against these conditions (Legaki2023Polymorphisms). In infectious diseases, CLEC5A plays a role in the immune response to dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, contributing to severe inflammatory reactions and tissue damage (Sung2019CLEC2; Chen2017CLEC5A). These findings suggest that CLEC5A is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of several diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
CLEC5A, also known as myeloid DAP12-associating lectin-1 (MDL-1), is a C-type lectin receptor that interacts with the adapter protein DAP12. This interaction is crucial for signaling, involving a charge-charge interaction between a lysine residue in CLEC5A and an aspartate residue in DAP12's transmembrane domain. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of DAP12 by Src kinases, which then interacts with Syk to trigger downstream signaling events (Watson2011Structural; Wu2013CLEC5A).

CLEC5A forms homodimers at the cell surface, which enhances its capacity to bind to ligands such as the dengue virus. The dimeric structure allows for a pronounced twisting motion, facilitating interactions with large ligands (Watson2011Structural). CLEC5A also interacts with the hemagglutinin protein of influenza viruses, enhancing inflammatory reactions (Teng2017CLEC5AMediated).

In addition to its role in viral recognition, CLEC5A is involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in human macrophages, which is responsible for the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 in response to dengue virus infection (Wu2013CLEC5A). These interactions highlight CLEC5A's role in modulating immune responses during viral infections.
