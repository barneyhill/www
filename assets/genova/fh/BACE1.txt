# BACE1

## Overview
Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a gene that encodes the protein beta-secretase 1, a type I transmembrane aspartic protease. This enzyme is primarily recognized for its role in the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a critical step in the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Evin2013BACE1; Vassar1999βSecretase). Beyond its involvement in AD, beta-secretase 1 is essential for various physiological processes, including myelination, axon growth, and synaptic plasticity, through its interaction with substrates such as Neuregulin 1 and voltage-gated sodium channel β subunits (Yan2017Physiological; Vassar2009The). The regulation of BACE1 activity and expression is complex, involving interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, which are crucial for its function in both normal and pathological states (Yan2017Physiological; Hébert2003Presenilin1).

## Structure
BACE1 (beta-secretase 1) is a type I transmembrane aspartic protease involved in the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is significant in Alzheimer's disease pathology. The primary structure of BACE1 consists of 501 amino acids, with a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a pro-peptide sequence preceding the mature enzyme, which begins at Glu46 (Holsinger2012Splice; Vassar1999βSecretase). The secondary structure includes an N-terminal domain, a C-terminal domain, and an intermediate domain with six anti-parallel β-sheets (Polgar2014StructureBased).

The tertiary structure of BACE1 is characterized by a bilobed shape with a flap loop extending over the active site, which can exist in open or closed states (Polgar2014StructureBased). The active site contains two catalytic aspartic acid residues, Asp32 and Asp228, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Polgar2014StructureBased). BACE1 is glycosylated at multiple sites, contributing to its molecular mass of approximately 70 kDa (Vassar1999βSecretase).

BACE1 does not form quaternary structures through covalent intermolecular bonds, as it does not dimerize (Haniu2000Characterization). The protein also undergoes N-terminal processing in the Golgi apparatus and is localized in various cellular compartments, including the Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and endosomes (Vassar1999βSecretase).

## Function
BACE1, or β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, is a type I transmembrane aspartic protease involved in the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the β-secretase site, a critical step in the production of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. This enzyme is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and undergoes several post-translational modifications that regulate its activity and stability (Yan2017Physiological). BACE1 is active in acidic intracellular compartments such as endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, where it cleaves APP and other substrates (Vassar2009The).

Beyond its role in APP processing, BACE1 is involved in various physiological functions. It plays a significant role in myelination and remyelination processes by cleaving Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1), which is essential for the proper myelination of peripheral nerves (Yan2017Physiological). BACE1 also influences axon growth, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis, impacting neural precursor cell differentiation through Notch signaling (Yan2017Physiological). Additionally, BACE1 cleaves voltage-gated sodium channel β subunits, affecting neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission (Vassar2009The). These diverse roles highlight BACE1's importance in maintaining normal neuronal and synaptic function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and activity of the BACE1 gene are significantly implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 is crucial for the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which aggregate to form amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD pathology. Increased BACE1 activity and protein levels have been observed in the brains of AD patients, correlating with elevated Aβ levels and plaque formation (Cole2007The; Hampel2021The). This upregulation is also noted in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to AD, suggesting that BACE1 activity could serve as a biomarker for disease progression (Evin2013BACE1).

BACE1 dysregulation is also associated with synaptic dysfunctions, as its accumulation in presynaptic terminals near amyloid plaques exacerbates Aβ production, contributing to synaptic deficits (Das2017Role). Furthermore, BACE1's role in processing other substrates, such as neuregulin-1, links it to conditions like schizophrenia, where alterations in BACE1 activity can affect synaptic plasticity and myelination (Evin2013BACE1; Koelsch2017BACE1). Despite the potential therapeutic benefits of BACE1 inhibition in reducing Aβ levels, complete inhibition may lead to adverse effects on synaptic functions due to its involvement in normal physiological processes (Cole2007The).

## Interactions
BACE1 (beta-secretase 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its function in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. BACE1 directly interacts with Presenilin-1 (PS1), a component of the γ-secretase complex, which is also involved in APP cleavage. This interaction has been demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that PS1 may regulate BACE1's maturation and activity (Hébert2003Presenilin1).

BACE1 also interacts with reticulon family proteins, particularly RTN3. The C-terminal domain of BACE1 is crucial for binding to RTN3, which negatively modulates BACE1 activity by preventing access to its APP substrate. This interaction is essential for RTN3's inhibition of BACE1 activity on APP substrates (He2006Mapping).

In axonal transport, BACE1 is found in vesicles with APP and PS1, co-immunoprecipitating with kinesin-I, indicating a role in the transport of these proteins within axonal membranes. This transport is dependent on APP, as its absence reduces the axonal transport of BACE1 and PS1 (Kamal2001Kinesinmediated).

BACE1 also binds to nicastrin, a component of the gamma-secretase complex, which can activate beta-secretase activity, suggesting a modulatory role of nicastrin on BACE1 (Hattori2002BACE1).
