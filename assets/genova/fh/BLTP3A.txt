# BLTP3A

## Overview
BLTP3A is a gene that encodes the bridge-like lipid transfer protein family member 3A, a protein involved in lipid transport and metabolism. This protein is categorized as a lipid transfer protein, which plays a crucial role in the intracellular movement of lipids, contributing to cellular lipid homeostasis and membrane dynamics. The BLTP3A gene is expressed in various tissues, indicating its potential involvement in diverse physiological processes. Research has suggested that alterations in the expression or function of this protein may have implications in metabolic disorders, although the precise mechanisms remain under investigation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
