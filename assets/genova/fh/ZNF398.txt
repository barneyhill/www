# ZNF398

## Overview
ZNF398 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 398, a transcriptional regulator involved in the maintenance of pluripotency and epithelial characteristics in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). The protein belongs to the family of zinc finger proteins, which are characterized by their ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. ZNF398 functions primarily within the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins such as SMAD3 and EP300 to modulate the transcription of genes associated with the TGF-beta signaling pathway, a critical pathway for stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Through these interactions, zinc finger protein 398 plays a pivotal role in preserving the pluripotent state of hPSCs and facilitating the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Zorzan2020The).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF398, also known as zinc finger protein 398, is a transcriptional regulator that plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency and epithelial character in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). It functions downstream of TGF-beta signaling, a pathway essential for stem cell maintenance and differentiation. ZNF398 promotes the expression of epithelial markers such as EPCAM, ESRP1, and EZR, while repressing differentiation and mesenchymal genes, thereby preserving the pluripotent state of hPSCs (Zorzan2020The).

ZNF398 interacts with SMAD3 and EP300, forming complexes at active enhancers and promoters to activate transcription of TGF-beta target genes. This interaction is specific to hPSCs and does not affect other cell types like fibroblasts (Zorzan2020The). The protein is also involved in the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), facilitating the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and activating endogenous pluripotency factors (Zorzan2020The).

In the nucleus, ZNF398 binds to specific DNA sequences, enhancing the transcription of genes critical for maintaining the pluripotent and epithelial state of stem cells, making it a key player in stem cell biology (Zorzan2020The).

## Interactions
ZNF398, a transcriptional regulator, is known to interact with several proteins and participate in various complexes, influencing gene expression in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). It forms a complex with SMAD3 and the histone acetyltransferase EP300 at active enhancers and promoters, facilitating the transcription of TGF-beta target genes. This interaction is crucial for maintaining pluripotency and epithelial characteristics in hPSCs (Zorzan2020The). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that ZNF398 physically interacts with SMAD3, a key component of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, in hPSCs (Zorzan2020The).

ZNF398 also interacts with ZNF282, another zinc finger protein, through the DUF3669 domain, which mediates protein-protein interactions. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting the role of the DUF3669 domain in facilitating associations between KRAB zinc finger proteins (Helleboid2019The; Al2019DUF3669). These interactions underscore ZNF398's involvement in a network of protein interactions that regulate transcriptional activity and maintain cellular characteristics in hPSCs.
