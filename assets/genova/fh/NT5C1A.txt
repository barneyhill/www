# NT5C1A

## Overview
The NT5C1A gene encodes the enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IA, which is a member of the nucleotidase family involved in nucleotide metabolism. This enzyme plays a critical role in the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates, thereby regulating the balance of intracellular nucleotide pools essential for various cellular processes, including DNA and RNA synthesis, energy homeostasis, and cell replication (Lloyd2015Cytosolic; Kulkarni2011Suppression). The NT5C1A protein is predominantly active in the cytosol and is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it contributes to the regulation of nucleotide metabolism and energy balance (Hunsucker2001Human). The gene is located on chromosome 1p34 and is part of an amplicon associated with cancer, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Saliba2016Pharmacogenetic). Additionally, NT5C1A is implicated in autoimmune diseases, where it serves as a target for autoantibodies, particularly in inclusion body myositis (Lloyd2015Cytosolic; Benjamin2013Cytosolic).

## Structure
The NT5C1A protein is part of the intracellular 5′ nucleotidases family, which is involved in the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates and their analogs. The catalytic core of NT5C1A is composed of four aspartate residues (p.D211, p.D213, p.D328, and p.D329) and a lysine residue (p.K314), which are evolutionarily conserved and likely provide protons needed for the dephosphorylation reaction (Saliba2016Pharmacogenetic). The study by Saliba et al. generated an in-silico three-dimensional homology model for the C-terminal region of NT5C1A (residues 171-368), which includes three conserved functional motifs (Saliba2016Pharmacogenetic). This model was based on the structure of a bacterial phosphatase, AphA, and was refined using computational tools (Saliba2016Pharmacogenetic).

The NT5C1A protein is a 41 kDa enzyme, and its structure includes a conserved nucleotidase domain (Kramp2016Development). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and alternative splicing can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and localization (Kramp2016Development). The NT5C1A gene is located on chromosome 1p34 and is part of an amplicon containing MYCL1, associated with cancer (Saliba2016Pharmacogenetic).

## Function
The NT5C1A gene encodes the enzyme cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase IA, which is involved in the dephosphorylation of non-cyclic nucleoside monophosphates to produce nucleosides and inorganic phosphates. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of intracellular nucleotide pools, which is essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, energy homeostasis, and cell replication (Lloyd2015Cytosolic; Kulkarni2011Suppression).

NT5C1A is primarily active in the cytosol and is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it plays a significant role in regulating nucleotide metabolism. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of AMP to adenosine and phosphate, which is important for the intercellular turnover of AMP in skeletal muscle (Hunsucker2001Human; Kulkarni2011Suppression). The enzyme's activity is regulated by ADP, ATP, and GTP, with ADP being a critical activator, especially during metabolic stress conditions (Hunsucker2001Human).

In healthy human cells, NT5C1A contributes to energy homeostasis by influencing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. The suppression of NT5C1A expression or activity increases the intracellular availability of AMP, activating AMPK, which enhances glucose uptake and lipid oxidation (Kulkarni2011Suppression). This regulatory mechanism underscores the enzyme's role in metabolic processes and energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NT5C1A gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer treatment and autoimmune diseases. Variants in NT5C1A, such as the rare p.L254P missense variant, can impair protein function, potentially altering responses to chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs used in cancer treatment (Saliba2016Pharmacogenetic). Overexpression of NT5C1A has been linked to increased resistance to these drugs, affecting treatment efficacy (Saliba2016Pharmacogenetic).

In autoimmune diseases, NT5C1A is a target of autoantibodies, notably in inclusion body myositis (IBM). Anti-NT5C1A antibodies are prevalent in IBM, with studies showing their presence in a significant percentage of patients, suggesting a potential autoimmune component to the disease (Lloyd2015Cytosolic; Benjamin2013Cytosolic). These antibodies are also found in other autoimmune conditions like dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjögren's syndrome, although they are not associated with specific clinical features in these diseases (Lloyd2015Cytosolic). The presence of anti-NT5C1A antibodies in IBM is used diagnostically to differentiate it from other inflammatory myopathies, such as polymyositis (Lloyd2015Cytosolic; Herbert2015Disease).
