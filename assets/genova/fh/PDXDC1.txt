# PDXDC1

## Overview
PDXDC1 is a gene that encodes the protein pyridoxal dependent decarboxylase domain containing 1, which functions as a vitamin B6-dependent decarboxylase. This protein is integral to various enzymatic processes, particularly those involving pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor, and plays a significant role in amino acid metabolism and cellular metabolic pathways (Song2022Identification). The protein is categorized as a decarboxylase and is expressed in osteoclasts and osteoblasts, indicating its involvement in bone metabolism and health (Song2022Identification). PDXDC1 has been identified as a pleiotropic susceptibility locus, influencing traits such as lumbar spine bone mineral density and birth weight, and is preferentially expressed in the intestine, where it interacts with polyunsaturated fatty acids to regulate bone density and development (Song2022Identification). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chatterjee2023Severe).

## Structure


## Function
The PDXDC1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a vitamin B6-dependent decarboxylase, playing a crucial role in enzymatic processes that require pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor. This protein is involved in amino acid metabolism, where it facilitates decarboxylation reactions, contributing to cellular metabolic pathways and influencing organismal homeostasis (Song2022Identification). PDXDC1 is expressed in both osteoclasts and osteoblasts, cells that are integral to bone remodeling, suggesting its involvement in bone metabolism and health (Song2022Identification). The gene has been identified as a pleiotropic susceptibility locus associated with lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) and birth weight (BW), indicating its role in bone health and development (Song2022Identification).

PDXDC1 is preferentially expressed in the intestine and has been linked to the regulation of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are critical for fetal growth and bone metabolism (Song2022Identification). The protein's expression is modulated by these PUFAs, with elevated expression associated with higher BMD and a beneficial n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio (Song2022Identification). This suggests that PDXDC1 may interact with PUFAs to regulate bone density and birth weight, highlighting its significance in cell biology and organismal outcomes related to bone health and development (Song2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
PDXDC1 gene variations have been associated with several health conditions, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7200543-A in the PDXDC1 gene is linked to decreased expression of PDXDC1 and NPIPA1, which correlates with increased liver damage markers and lower bone mineral content (BMC) in risk allele carriers. This suggests that alterations in PDXDC1 expression may have clinical significance in terms of liver health and skeletal integrity (Chatterjee2023Severe).

In addition to liver-related conditions, PDXDC1 has been identified as a pleiotropic susceptibility locus associated with lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) and birth weight (BW). The gene's expression is influenced by omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), with a higher expression linked to increased BMD and a lower n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio. This indicates a protective role of PDXDC1 in bone health, potentially making it a therapeutic target for osteoporosis prevention (Song2022Identification).

Overall, PDXDC1's involvement in metabolic and bone health underscores its potential clinical significance, warranting further research into its molecular mechanisms and therapeutic applications.
