# ZC2HC1A

## Overview
ZC2HC1A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger C2HC-type containing 1A protein, which is characterized by its zinc finger domain, a structural motif that facilitates binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and is involved in various cellular processes, including immune response and cell proliferation. The zinc finger C2HC-type containing 1A protein is implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, due to its influence on transcription factor binding and chromatin activity (Zhu2019Development; Glinos2020Genomic). Additionally, ZC2HC1A has been identified as a pleiotropic gene, indicating its involvement in multiple phenotypic traits, particularly in autoimmune diseases and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Yu2024Shared).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The ZC2HC1A gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in gene expression and cellular processes. In the context of immune-mediated diseases, variants in the ZC2HC1A gene have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Specifically, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in high linkage disequilibrium with the index variant rs1021156 were found to disrupt transcription factor binding sites within the ZC2HC1A/IL7 locus. One variant, rs3808619, located in the promoter of ZC2HC1A, led to decreased IRF binding and increased STAT1 binding, suggesting a potential impact on chromatin activity and T-cell activation, which may influence the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases (Glinos2020Genomic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the ZC2HC1A gene is part of a nine-gene signature associated with poor prognosis in patients with HBV/HCV-related HCC. This gene signature, which includes ZC2HC1A, was found to be upregulated in cases with poor prognosis, indicating its potential clinical significance in predicting HCC outcomes (Zhu2019Development).

Additionally, ZC2HC1A has been identified as a significant pleiotropic gene in the context of autoimmune diseases and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), suggesting its involvement in shared genetic mechanisms between these conditions (Yu2024Shared).
