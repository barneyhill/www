# WDR55

## Overview
WDR55 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 55 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeat motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, often forming a beta-propeller structure that serves as a scaffold for complex assemblies. The WDR55 protein is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it plays a crucial role in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and processing, as well as in cell cycle regulation. It is involved in the assembly of the CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex through interactions with DNA DAMAGED BINDING PROTEIN1 (DDB1), mediated by its WDxR motif. The protein's function is essential for early development and organogenesis, with mutations leading to significant developmental defects across various species, including Arabidopsis, zebrafish, and medaka (Bjerkan2012Arabidopsis; Iwanami2008WDR55).

## Structure
The WDR55 protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeat motifs, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These motifs typically form a beta-propeller structure, consisting of four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets, which provide a scaffold for reversible multidomain complex assemblies (Bjerkan2012Arabidopsis). WDR55 contains a WDxR motif, a submotif of the DWD-box, which is associated with potential substrate receptors of the CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligases. This motif facilitates assembly with DDB1 and CUL4 proteins, indicating a role in ubiquitination processes (Bjerkan2012Arabidopsis).

The structured region of WDR55 is located in the N-terminal part of the protein, while the C-terminal regions are unstructured, allowing for flexible interactions with multiple partners (Bjerkan2012Arabidopsis). In Arabidopsis, WDR55 is expressed throughout the life cycle, with splice variants present in all tissues, suggesting functional diversity (Bjerkan2012Arabidopsis). The protein is conserved across eukaryotes, with the closest metazoan homolog found in Nematostella vectensis, indicating a conserved structural and functional role (Bjerkan2012Arabidopsis).

## Function
WDR55 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily within the nucleolus of cells. The WDR55 protein is enriched in the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus, a site crucial for early ribosome biosynthesis processes (Iwanami2008WDR55). It plays a significant role in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and processing, as its reduction leads to the accumulation of incompletely processed rRNA precursors, although mature rRNAs are still produced (Iwanami2008WDR55). This indicates that WDR55 is involved in the processing of rRNA intermediates.

WDR55 is also implicated in cell cycle regulation. Its depletion in NIH3T3 cells results in cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, which is associated with increased expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1, a gene regulated by p53 (Iwanami2008WDR55). This suggests that WDR55 may link rRNA production to cell cycle progression, potentially through the activation of the p53 pathway (Iwanami2008WDR55). The protein's proper localization in the nucleolus and cytoplasm is crucial for its function, and mutations in WDR55 can lead to developmental defects, highlighting its essential role in early development and organogenesis (Iwanami2008WDR55).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or deficiencies in the WDR55 gene can lead to significant developmental defects and diseases. In zebrafish, a WDR55-null mutant results in severe developmental abnormalities, including defects in thymus development, malformed pharyngeal arches, and small eyes and swim bladder, ultimately leading to lethality by 10-12 days post-fertilization (Iwanami2008WDR55). In mice, WDR55 deficiency causes developmental arrest before implantation, highlighting its critical role in early development (Iwanami2008WDR55). In medaka fish, a missense mutation in WDR55 leads to defective thymus development, affecting the accumulation of lymphoid cells in the thymus primordium (Iwanami2008WDR55).

In Arabidopsis, WDR55 is essential for both male and female gametogenesis, and mutations can cause defects in gametophytes, reducing the transfer of the mutation to progeny. Overexpression of WDR55 results in defects in pollen and female gametophyte development, indicating its role in gametogenesis (Bjerkan2012Arabidopsis). The gene is also crucial for embryo and endosperm development, with mutations leading to developmental arrest in seeds (Bjerkan2012Arabidopsis). These findings suggest that WDR55 is vital for normal development and that its malfunction can lead to developmental disorders.

## Interactions
WDR55 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In Arabidopsis, WDR55 interacts with DNA DAMAGED BINDING PROTEIN1 (DDB1), suggesting its involvement as a substrate receptor in the CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is facilitated by the WDxR motif present in WDR55, which is crucial for its assembly with DDB1 and CUL4 proteins (Bjerkan2012Arabidopsis). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays have demonstrated a strong interaction between WDR55 and DDB1A in plant cells, indicating a significant role in the nuclear domain (Bjerkan2012Arabidopsis).

WDR55 is also involved in nucleolar functions, particularly in rRNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. It is localized in the nucleolus and is essential for the processing of rRNA intermediates. In medaka, a mutation in WDR55 leads to its exclusion from the nucleolus, affecting rRNA processing and causing developmental defects (Iwanami2008WDR55). These interactions highlight WDR55's role in modulating nucleolar activities and its potential involvement in broader cellular regulatory mechanisms.
