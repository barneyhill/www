# PCSK7

## Overview
PCSK7, or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protease involved in the proteolytic processing of precursor proteins into their active forms. This enzyme is part of the proprotein convertase family, which plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including lipid metabolism, iron homeostasis, and inflammation. The PCSK7 protein is primarily active in the trans-Golgi network and is known for its involvement in the regulation of apolipoprotein A-5 and transferrin receptor 1, impacting triglyceride concentrations and iron metabolism, respectively (Furuhashi2022Circulating; VargasAlarcón2021The; Oexle2010Novel). Additionally, PCSK7 is implicated in the modulation of pathways related to hepatic lipogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Dongiovanni2019PCSK7). Variants in the PCSK7 gene have been associated with conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular diseases, underscoring its clinical relevance (VargasAlarcón2021The; Dongiovanni2019PCSK7).

## Structure
PCSK7 is a transmembrane protease that plays a role in various biological processes. The protein structure includes several domains: a pro-domain, a catalytic domain, a P-domain, and a C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is crucial for subcellular localization and intracellular trafficking and is divided into three subdomains: variable, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic (Parvaz2021Molecular). The cytoplasmic domain is essential for the protein's movement between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane and for entering endosomes, which is vital for its maximal activity (Parvaz2021Molecular).

The primary structure of PCSK7 includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, and a catalytic domain. The secondary structure features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which fold into a functional enzyme in the tertiary structure. PCSK7 may form homodimers or heterodimers, indicating a quaternary structure. Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation and phosphorylation (Seidah1996cDNA).

The protein also contains a 100-amino acid cytosolic tail, which includes Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites that may regulate its transit between cellular compartments (Seidah1996cDNA). The active-site residues are positioned similarly to those in other proprotein convertases, highlighting its evolutionary conservation (Seidah1996cDNA).

## Function
PCSK7, or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7, is a transmembrane protease involved in the proteolytic processing of precursor proteins into their active forms. It is ubiquitously expressed and primarily active in the trans-Golgi network, shuttling between the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network (Furuhashi2022Circulating). PCSK7 plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the regulation of apolipoprotein A-5 (apoA-5), which is associated with triglyceride concentrations (VargasAlarcón2021The). It is also involved in the activation of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is crucial for iron homeostasis (Oexle2010Novel).

PCSK7 is implicated in the modulation of various physiological pathways, including those related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. It influences the expression of genes involved in hepatic de novo lipogenesis and is associated with pathways related to inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Dongiovanni2019PCSK7). The enzyme's activity is linked to the processing of specific proteins, such as transferrin receptor-1, proSortilin, and apolipoprotein-F, which are related to lipid metabolism (Guillemot2014Is). PCSK7's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PCSK7 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions, primarily through their impact on lipid metabolism and inflammation. Variants such as rs236918 have been associated with increased triglyceride levels and hepatic inflammation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. This variant is also linked to higher levels of liver enzymes, indicating potential liver damage, and is associated with lobular inflammation in the liver (Dongiovanni2019PCSK7). In the context of cardiovascular health, specific polymorphisms in PCSK7, including rs508487, rs236911, and rs236918, have been associated with an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and variations in plasma HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels (VargasAlarcón2021The).

The rs236918 variant is also implicated in iron metabolism, as it is associated with higher circulating levels of human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1), which plays a role in iron homeostasis. This SNP has been linked to liver cirrhosis in hemochromatosis patients, highlighting its potential impact on liver health (Guillemot2013Implication). Additionally, PCSK7's role in processing transforming growth factor β1a (TGFβ1a) suggests its involvement in immune responses and developmental processes, with mutations potentially leading to developmental abnormalities (Turpeinen2013Proprotein).

## Interactions
PCSK7 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in multiple biological processes. One notable interaction is with a novel long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) within the PCSK7 locus. This lncRNA is predicted to bind specifically to the initial portion of the PCSK7 protein, particularly between amino acids 60-111, as supported by bioinformatic tools such as lncPro and catRAPID (Dongiovanni2019PCSK7). This interaction is associated with increased hepatic expression of the lncRNA and elevated PCSK7 protein levels, suggesting a gain-of-function effect (Dongiovanni2019PCSK7).

PCSK7 also interacts with adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) through a specific motif, EXEXXXL, in its cytosolic tail. This interaction is crucial for the trafficking and cleavage activity of PCSK7, facilitating its entry into early endosomes where it cleaves substrates like the human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) (Durand2020The). Mutations in this motif can significantly reduce the binding affinity between PCSK7 and AP-2, affecting its function (Durand2020The).

In zebrafish, PCSK7 is involved in the expression and proteolytic cleavage of the cytokine TGFβ1a, indicating its role in developmental processes and immune regulation (Turpeinen2013Proprotein).
