# ABCF2

## Overview
ABCF2 is a gene that encodes the ATP binding cassette subfamily F member 2, a cytosolic protein that belongs to the ABCF subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins. Unlike most ABC proteins, which are typically involved in transmembrane transport, ABCF2 lacks transmembrane domains and is primarily associated with ribosomal function and cellular stress responses. The protein plays a crucial role in translational regulation by interacting with ribosomes and the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), thereby influencing protein synthesis and stress response pathways. Additionally, ABCF2 is involved in the regulation of cell volume through its interaction with α-actinin-4 (ACTN4), impacting the activity of volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying (VSOR) anion channels. Clinically, ABCF2 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in ovarian cancer, where its overexpression is associated with chemoresistance and tumor progression (Ando‐Akatsuka2012Involvements; Tsuda2005Identification; Bao2017ABCF2).

## Structure
ABCF2 is a member of the ABCF subfamily, characterized by the presence of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) within a single peptide chain, lacking transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Dean2005EVOLUTION; Wang2021ATP‐binding). These NBDs, known as ABC1 and ABC2, are connected by a flexible linker and are essential for ATP hydrolysis (Unknownauthors2023DecipheringtheStructuralandFunctionalPropertiesofABCFATPases). The NBDs contain conserved Walker A and B motifs, which are crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and the LSGGQ/E signature sequence involved in γ phosphate sensing (Unknownauthors2023DecipheringtheStructuralandFunctionalPropertiesofABCFATPases; Fostier2020ABC‐F).

A unique feature of ABCF2 is the P-site tRNA Interaction Motif (PtIM), which forms an α-helical hairpin that interacts with tRNA in the ribosomal P site (Fostier2020ABC‐F). This motif is specific to ABC-F proteins and is absent in other ABC superfamily proteins. The protein also includes an arm motif in the α-helical subdomain of the first ABC domain, which is crucial for ribosome binding (Unknownauthors2023DecipheringtheStructuralandFunctionalPropertiesofABCFATPases).

ABCF2 is involved in ribosome protection and plays a role in translational regulation through ATP-dependent conformational modulation of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) in the ribosome (Unknownauthors2023DecipheringtheStructuralandFunctionalPropertiesofABCFATPases). The protein's structure and function are essential for its role in mediating cisplatin-induced drug resistance and tumor suppression at metastatic sites (Wang2021ATP‐binding).

## Function
ABCF2 (ATP binding cassette subfamily F member 2) is a cytosolic protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in stress response and cell protection. Unlike most ABC proteins, ABCF2 lacks transmembrane domains and is not involved in membrane transport. Instead, it is implicated in protein synthesis and cytoprotection. ABCF2 interacts with ribosomes and the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), suggesting a role in translation initiation and control. It is more transcribed upon eIF2a phosphorylation, indicating its involvement in stress response signaling and anti-apoptotic functions (Nougayrède2007Enteropathogenic).

ABCF2 also acts as a suppressor of the volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying (VSOR) anion channel activity, which is crucial for cell volume regulation. In human epithelial cells, ABCF2 interacts with α-actinin-4 (ACTN4), a nonmuscle actin-binding protein, to regulate VSOR activity. This interaction is enhanced under hypotonic conditions, suggesting a role in the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) process, which cells use to restore their volume after swelling (Ando‐Akatsuka2012Involvements). The NH2-terminal region of ABCF2 is necessary for its interaction with ACTN4, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis under osmotic stress (Ando‐Akatsuka2012Involvements).

## Clinical Significance
ABCF2 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of ovarian cancer. Overexpression and amplification of the ABCF2 gene have been associated with clear cell ovarian adenocarcinomas. Studies have shown that ABCF2 is significantly overexpressed in clear cell tumors compared to serous tumors, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of this cancer type (Tsuda2005Identification). The overexpression of ABCF2 is linked to chemoresistance, a characteristic feature of clear cell ovarian adenocarcinomas, indicating that ABCF2 may contribute to the resistance observed in these tumors (Tsuda2005Identification).

ABCF2 is also identified as a target gene of NRF2, a transcription factor involved in cellular defense mechanisms. This relationship contributes to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells. The presence of an antioxidant response element in the ABCF2 promoter, regulated by NRF2, suggests that ABCF2 expression is modulated by NRF2 levels, impacting drug resistance (Bao2017ABCF2). Alterations in ABCF2 expression, particularly its upregulation, have been observed in high-grade serous ovarian cancer tissues, further linking it to cancer progression and drug resistance (Bao2017ABCF2). These findings highlight the potential of ABCF2 as a therapeutic target in overcoming chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.

## Interactions
ABCF2 interacts with α-actinin-4 (ACTN4) in human epithelial cells, a relationship that is crucial for regulating cell volume and anion channels. This interaction is enhanced under hypotonic conditions, which cause cell swelling. The NH2-terminal region of ABCF2, containing the coiled-coil domain 1, is essential for binding to ACTN4. Pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation studies have confirmed this interaction, showing that ABCF2 co-precipitates with ACTN4 in both RIPA-soluble and -insoluble fractions, particularly under hypotonic conditions (Ando‐Akatsuka2012Involvements).

The actin cytoskeleton plays a significant role in facilitating the interaction between ABCF2 and ACTN4. Disruption of actin filaments with cytochalasin D significantly reduces their co-precipitation, indicating that an intact cytoskeleton is necessary for their binding (Ando‐Akatsuka2012Involvements).

ABCF2 is also implicated in the regulation of the volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying (VSOR) anion channel. It acts as a suppressor of VSOR activity, and its interaction with ACTN4 is suggested to prevent this suppression, thereby facilitating the regulatory volume decrease process (Ando‐Akatsuka2012Involvements).
