# DTD2

## Overview
DTD2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase 2, which is a critical component in the cellular machinery responsible for maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis. This enzyme functions as a proofreading entity, specifically targeting and hydrolyzing mischarged D-aminoacyl-tRNAs to prevent the erroneous incorporation of D-amino acids into proteins. Such activity is vital for ensuring that only the correct L-amino acids are incorporated, thereby safeguarding the accuracy of protein synthesis and preventing potential cellular toxicity (Bhatt2016Recent). D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase 2 is categorized as a deacylase enzyme and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a role in recycling D-aminoacyl-tRNA to D-amino acids and free tRNA molecules (Parker2024Novel). The enzyme's presence across various species, including humans, highlights its evolutionary importance and potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in addressing the toxicity associated with D-amino acids (Bhatt2016Recent).

## Function
DTD2 (D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase 2) plays a critical role in maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis by acting as a proofreading enzyme. It hydrolyzes mischarged D-aminoacyl-tRNAs, thereby preventing the incorporation of incorrect D-amino acids into proteins, which is essential for cellular survival and function (Bhatt2016Recent). This activity ensures that only the correct L-amino acids are incorporated into proteins, maintaining the accuracy of protein synthesis and preventing potential cellular toxicity (Bhatt2016Recent).

DTD2 is active in the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis occurs, and is involved in recycling D-aminoacyl-tRNA to D-amino acids and free tRNA molecules (Parker2024Novel). This function is crucial for the quality control of tRNA molecules during protein synthesis, ensuring that proteins are synthesized correctly and efficiently. The presence of DTD2 in various species, including humans, underscores its importance in cellular biology and its potential as a drug target due to its essential role in combating the toxicity of D-amino acids (Bhatt2016Recent). In more complex organisms, such as mice, DTD2 levels have been correlated with neurotransmitter levels, although this aspect has not been extensively studied (Parker2024Novel).
