# TPP2

## Overview
The TPP2 gene encodes the enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPP2), a serine peptidase that plays a crucial role in protein degradation within eukaryotic cells. TPP2 is involved in the removal of tripeptides from the N-terminus of longer peptides, contributing to protein turnover and homeostasis. This enzyme is particularly active under stress conditions, such as starvation and muscle wasting, and is implicated in tumor cell metabolism. Structurally, TPP2 forms large homooligomeric complexes that are essential for its function, with a self-compartmentalizing mechanism that protects cells from unwanted proteolysis. Beyond its proteolytic activity, TPP2 is involved in antigen processing for MHC Class I presentation and influences signal transduction pathways, including the regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation. Mutations in the TPP2 gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including immune system dysregulation and neurological disorders, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular and systemic health (Tomkinson2019Tripeptidylpeptidase; Wiemhoefer2015Tripeptidyl; Atallah2021Immune).

## Structure
Tripeptidyl peptidase 2 (TPP2) is a large protease enzyme with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of TPP2 consists of 1,249 amino acids, forming a subunit with a molecular weight of approximately 138 kDa (Tomkinson2019Tripeptidylpeptidase). The secondary structure includes an N-terminal subtilisin-like domain, a central domain mainly composed of β-strands, and a C-terminal domain that is primarily α-helical (Rockel2012Structure). 

The tertiary structure of TPP2 reveals a self-compartmentalizing enzyme with the active site buried inside a hollow strand, accessible only through narrow openings (Tomkinson2019Tripeptidylpeptidase). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of monomers into ring-shaped dimers, which further oligomerize into multimeric complexes forming spindle-like structures (Tomkinson2019Tripeptidylpeptidase). These structures are about 55 nm in length and 28 nm in width, consisting of 8-9 dimers per strand in mammalian TPP2 (Tomkinson2019Tripeptidylpeptidase).

TPP2 also features specific domains, such as the 'double-Glu' motif, which acts as a molecular ruler limiting substrate binding to tripeptides (Rockel2012Structure). The enzyme's structure includes a catalytic triad with residues Asp-44, His-264, and Ser-449, essential for its proteolytic activity (Tomkinson2019Tripeptidylpeptidase). The enzyme may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its complex formation and function (Rockel2012Structure).

## Function
Tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPP2) is a serine peptidase involved in various cellular processes, primarily functioning in protein degradation. It operates in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells, where it plays a significant role in general protein turnover alongside the proteasome. TPP2 removes tripeptides from the N-terminus of longer peptides through a 'molecular ruler mechanism', contributing to the maintenance of protein homeostasis (Tomkinson2019Tripeptidylpeptidase).

TPP2 is particularly important under stress conditions such as starvation, muscle wasting, and in tumor cells, where its activity is increased. It provides amino acids for new protein synthesis, which is crucial during these conditions (Tomkinson2019Tripeptidylpeptidase). The enzyme forms large homooligomeric complexes, which are essential for its function, and its evolution is linked to the development of a self-compartmentalizing mechanism to protect cells from unwanted proteolysis (Tomkinson2019Tripeptidylpeptidase).

In addition to its role in protein degradation, TPP2 is involved in antigen processing for MHC Class I presentation, where it trims longer peptide precursors. However, it is not necessary for the majority of MHC Class I antigen production (Tomkinson2019Tripeptidylpeptidase). TPP2 also influences signal transduction pathways, particularly by regulating the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2, which are involved in growth factor signaling and mitogenic stimuli (Wiemhoefer2015Tripeptidyl).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TPP2 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily involving immune system dysregulation and neurological disorders. Biallelic variants in TPP2 can lead to a pleiotropic disorder characterized by immune deficiency, autoimmune disease, and intellectual disability. Patients with TPP2 deficiency often present with developmental and speech delays, intellectual deficiency, recurrent infections, and mild lymphopenia. Autoimmune manifestations such as psoriasis and autoimmune cytopenias are also observed (Atallah2021Immune).

In adults, TPP2 deficiency can manifest as chronic non-infectious brain inflammation with demyelinating disease and calcifications, resembling multiple sclerosis but without developmental delay or intellectual deficiency (Atallah2021Immune). The deficiency may lead to autoimmunity through the activation of autoreactive T and B cells due to increased remnant epitopes (Atallah2021Immune).

TPP2 depletion in the central nervous system is linked to presenile dementia in female mice, caused by calcium and lipid dyshomeostasis, which induces autophagic degradation of CYP19A1. This condition is associated with estrogen deficiency and impaired neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, highlighting TPP2's role in maintaining neuronal health (Zhao2024Tripeptidyl). TPP2 deficiency is also associated with early-onset Evans syndrome, immunodeficiency, and premature immunosenescence (Stepensky2015Earlyonset).

## Interactions
Tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPP2) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. TPP2 forms a homo-oligomeric megastructure, which can disassemble into a monomeric state upon dephosphorylation, indicating that phosphorylation is crucial for its assembly (Floyd2021Systematic). TPP2 interacts with MYBBP1A and CDK2, forming a protein-protein interaction network that is important for cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and senescence (Nahálková2014TPPII). These interactions were confirmed using in situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) and co-immunoprecipitation assays in various cell lines (Nahálková2014TPPII).

TPP2 also interacts with components of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is central to regulating cell cycle, apoptosis, and cytoskeleton remodeling (Sompallae2008The). The enzyme's role in controlling ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation affects signal transduction downstream of growth factors and mitogenic stimuli, highlighting its importance in neuronal function (Wiemhoefer2015Tripeptidyl). These interactions suggest that TPP2 is a key player in various signaling pathways, impacting processes such as tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration.
