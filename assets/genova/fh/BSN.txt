# BSN

## Overview
The BSN gene encodes the bassoon presynaptic cytomatrix protein, a pivotal component of the presynaptic active zone in neurons. This protein is integral to the organization and function of synaptic terminals, where it plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle cycling. As a large scaffolding protein, bassoon is involved in the assembly and maintenance of the active zone, facilitating interactions with other presynaptic proteins through its structural domains, including zinc-finger and coiled-coil regions (Winter1999The; Dieck1998Bassoon). The protein's regulatory functions extend to modulating proteasome activity and autophagy, thereby maintaining synaptic protein homeostasis (MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon; HoffmannConaway2020Parkin). Mutations in the BSN gene have been associated with various neurological and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Yabe2017Mutations; Zhao2023Proteintruncating).

## Structure
The human BSN gene encodes the Bassoon protein, a large component of the presynaptic cytomatrix at active zones of nerve terminals. The protein is characterized by a long open reading frame coding for a 419-kDa protein, which includes two double zinc-finger domains and three coiled-coil regions. These domains suggest potential interactions with other proteins, such as the Rab3a effector protein Rim, which is also localized at presynaptic active zones (Winter1999The). The zinc-finger motifs are involved in protein-protein interactions and are similar to LIM domains, which are known for their role in such interactions (Dieck1998Bassoon). The coiled-coil domains are predicted to form superhelices that may facilitate interactions with other presynaptic proteins (Dieck1998Bassoon).

The protein also contains a polyglutamine stretch near the C-terminus, which is significantly reduced in humans compared to rodents (Winter1999The). This region is associated with neurodegenerative diseases when abnormally expanded in other proteins, although no length polymorphism was detected in the human population (Winter1999The). The presence of heptad repeats suggests potential phosphorylation sites for proline-directed protein kinases, indicating a regulatory role through post-translational modifications (Winter1999The).

## Function
The BSN gene encodes the bassoon presynaptic cytomatrix protein, which plays a critical role in the presynaptic terminal of neurons. Bassoon is involved in the assembly and maintenance of the active zone (AZ), a specialized area where neurotransmission occurs, and is essential for the organization and function of this region (Chen2021Identification). It regulates neurotransmission by managing the trafficking, docking, release, and recycling of synaptic vesicles, contributing to efficient synaptic transmission (Chen2021Identification).

Bassoon interacts with the proteasome subunit PSMB4, inhibiting proteasome activity and thereby regulating the degradation of presynaptic proteins. This interaction is crucial for maintaining synaptic function by controlling the turnover of proteins such as RIM1/2 and Munc13-1 (MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon). The protein also plays a role in autophagy, where it negatively regulates the ubiquitination of synaptic vesicle proteins, thus influencing their degradation through autophagy pathways (HoffmannConaway2020Parkin).

In the absence of bassoon, there is increased proteasome activity and enhanced autophagy, leading to the degradation of synaptic proteins and potential synaptic dysfunction. This regulation is vital for maintaining neuronal protein homeostasis and synaptic integrity (MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon; HoffmannConaway2020Parkin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BSN gene, which encodes the bassoon presynaptic cytomatrix protein, have been linked to several health conditions. Protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in BSN are associated with severe adult-onset obesity, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These variants significantly impact body mass index (BMI) and increase the risk of these conditions, with effects larger than those of well-established obesity genes like MC4R (Zhao2023Proteintruncating; Zhao2024Proteintruncating). BSN PTV carriers have a higher risk of obesity and related metabolic conditions, but these variants do not affect childhood adiposity (Zhao2023Proteintruncating).

BSN mutations have also been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. Rare missense mutations in BSN are associated with progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome, a condition characterized by cognitive decline and atypical symptoms such as forgetfulness and parkinsonism. These mutations may contribute to a novel tauopathy distinct from known dementia and parkinsonism syndromes (Chen2021Identification; Yabe2017Mutations). Additionally, BSN mutations have been linked to schizophrenia, with a specific mutation co-segregating in a family with multiple affected members, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Chen2021Identification).

## Interactions
The BSN gene encodes the bassoon presynaptic cytomatrix protein, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for synaptic function. Bassoon interacts with Atg5, an E3-like ligase essential for autophagy, through its coiled-coil 2 (CC2) region. This interaction is significant for presynaptic autophagy, as Bassoon can bind Atg5 and inhibit autophagy, suggesting a regulatory role in this catabolic pathway (Okerlund2017Bassoon). The CC2 region of Bassoon contains an Atg5-binding motif, and mutations in this region disrupt the interaction, highlighting its specificity and importance (Okerlund2017Bassoon).

Bassoon also interacts with the β subunit of the 20S core proteasome, PSMB4, inhibiting proteasome activity and leading to the accumulation of various substrates. This interaction is distinct from its role in autophagy and suggests a steric interference with the assembly of the 20S proteasome core (MontenegroVenegas2020Bassoon).

Additionally, Bassoon interacts with tau proteins, particularly high-molecular-weight tau species associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This interaction enhances tau-seeding activity and toxicity, suggesting a role in tau propagation and neurotoxicity (Martinez2022Bassoon).
