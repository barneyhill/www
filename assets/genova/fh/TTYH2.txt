# TTYH2

## Overview
TTYH2 is a gene that encodes the protein tweety family member 2, which is part of the tweety family of proteins. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein, featuring five transmembrane helices and an extended extracellular domain, and is primarily involved in chloride ion transport and cell volume regulation (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM; Li2021Structures). Although initially proposed to function as a calcium-dependent chloride channel, structural studies have raised questions about its role in ion conduction, suggesting alternative functions such as lipid interactions or integrin binding (Li2021Structures). TTYH2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and developmental signaling, and is associated with several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders (Nalamalapu2021The; Li2021Structures). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 and β-COP, further highlight its potential roles beyond ion channel activity (Nalamalapu2021The; He2008The).

## Structure
The TTYH2 protein is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes five transmembrane helices and an extended extracellular domain. The extracellular domain is organized into a four-helix bundle, which contributes to the stability of the dimeric structure and is potentially coordinated by Ca2+ ions (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM; Li2021Structures). The transmembrane domain (TMD) is tightly packed, lacking typical features of an anion conduction pore, which challenges its proposed role as a chloride channel (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM).

The TTYH2 protein forms different dimerization states depending on the presence of Ca2+. In the presence of Ca2+, TTYH2 forms homomeric cis-dimers, while in its absence, it can form trans-dimers or exist in a monomeric state (Li2021Structures). A notable structural feature is a large, conserved hydrophobic pocket within each TTYH2 protomer, which may interact with lipid-like molecules (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, as indicated by glycosyl moieties used in the structural modeling of TTYH2 (Sukalskaia2021CryoEM). The protein's structure suggests potential roles in lipid interactions or integrin binding, rather than ion conduction (Li2021Structures).

## Function
The TTYH2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the tweety family, which is involved in chloride ion transport and cell volume regulation. TTYH2 functions as a calcium-dependent chloride channel, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by responding to cell swelling through volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC) (Nalamalapu2021The). The protein is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, eventually trafficking to the plasma membrane, where it acts as a transmembrane chloride channel (Nalamalapu2021The).

Structurally, TTYH2 forms a side-by-side homodimer in the presence of calcium ions, with each protomer consisting of five transmembrane helices and an extracellular domain. This dimerization is crucial for its function and is dependent on calcium, which coordinates with electronegative residues at the dimer interface (Li2021Structures). Despite being considered an anion channel, structural studies suggest that TTYH2 may not form pore-forming subunits of anion channels, as no clear pathways for ion transport have been identified within TTYH2 protomers (Li2021Structures).

In healthy human cells, TTYH2 is implicated in processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and developmental signaling, although its precise physiological functions remain to be fully elucidated (Li2021Structures).

## Clinical Significance
TTYH2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, TTYH2 is associated with tumor growth and metastasis. It is upregulated in renal cell carcinoma, colon cancer, and osteosarcoma, where its knockdown impairs cell invasion and migration, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Nalamalapu2021The; He2008The). In contrast, TTYH2 is downregulated in breast cancer (Nalamalapu2021The).

TTYH2 expression is also altered in neurological disorders. It is upregulated in cerebral small vessel disease and downregulated in Pick disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (Nalamalapu2021The). Additionally, TTYH2 is involved in immune responses, with expression changes observed in conditions like ulcerative colitis and infections such as H1N1 and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Nalamalapu2021The).

Genome-wide association studies have linked an SNP in the intronic region of TTYH2 with systolic blood pressure levels, potentially impacting hypertension incidence (Nalamalapu2021The). These findings suggest that TTYH2 could serve as a potential biomarker for disease diagnosis or prognosis.

## Interactions
TTYH2, a member of the Tweety family of proteins, engages in several protein interactions that influence its cellular functions. One significant interaction is with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2. This interaction is mediated by specific motifs within TTYH2, including a proline-rich PY motif and SP motifs, which are crucial for its binding and ubiquitination by Nedd4-2. Mutations in these motifs, particularly the PY motif, significantly reduce the interaction and ubiquitination, affecting TTYH2's cellular localization and stability (He2008The).

TTYH2 also interacts with β-COP, a subunit of Coat Protein Complex I, which is involved in ER to Golgi transport. This interaction has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Nalamalapu2021The). Additionally, large-scale interactome studies suggest potential interactions between TTYH2 and various proteins, including CCND2, KAT2A, CDK2NB, and GRM1, although the precise nature of these interactions requires further investigation (Nalamalapu2021The). These interactions suggest that TTYH2 may play roles beyond ion channel activity, potentially influencing cellular signaling and transport processes.
