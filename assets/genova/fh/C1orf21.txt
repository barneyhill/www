# C1orf21

## Overview
C1orf21 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 21. This protein is currently categorized as uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms are not fully understood. However, emerging research suggests that it may play a role as an adapter protein or modulator within key signaling pathways, particularly those involved in cancer progression, such as the focal adhesion-PI3K-Akt-mTOR-signaling pathway (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The expression of C1orf21 has been linked to various cancer-related processes, including immune cell infiltration and chemotherapy response, highlighting its potential clinical significance as a biomarker or therapeutic target in oncology (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Clinical Significance
C1orf21 has been implicated in several cancer-related pathways, suggesting its potential clinical significance in oncology. The protein's subinteractome is enriched with the 'WP3932~focal adhesion-PI3K-Akt-mTOR-signaling pathway' term, which is crucial in connecting membrane receptors to the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell shape and motility. Aberrant activation of this pathway in cancer cells can lead to drug-resistant phenotypes, indicating that C1orf21 may function as an adapter protein or modulator within this signaling cascade, potentially affecting cancer progression and treatment outcomes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

The expression levels of C1orf21 have prognostic significance in certain cancer cohorts, including acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), and thymoma (THYM). It is associated with cancer pathways such as MAPK and proteoglycans in cancer, and its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration in tumors and responses to chemotherapy (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). While specific diseases directly linked to mutations in C1orf21 are not well-documented, its involvement in these pathways suggests a role in cancer-related processes, warranting further investigation into its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target.
