# RAB4B

## Overview
RAB4B is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein known as RAB4B. This protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular vesicular trafficking, particularly in the regulation of glucose transporter GLUT4 localization in adipocytes, which is crucial for glucose uptake in response to insulin. RAB4B is involved in retrograde trafficking from early endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, interacting with the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex to ensure proper protein sorting and recycling. It is expressed in various cell types, including adipocytes and immune cells, where it helps maintain metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Alterations in RAB4B expression have been linked to metabolic disorders, such as obesity and insulin resistance, as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Gilleron2018Rab4b; Kaddai2009Rab4b; Gilleron2024Golgiassociated; White2020Excess).

## Function
Rab4b is a small GTPase involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking, playing a crucial role in the regulation of glucose transporter GLUT4 localization in adipocytes. It is primarily associated with GLUT4 sequestration compartments, influencing GLUT4 trafficking between compartments and affecting glucose uptake in response to insulin (Kaddai2009Rab4b). Rab4b is also involved in retrograde trafficking from early endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), interacting with the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, particularly the VPS52 subunit. This interaction is essential for the proper sorting and recycling of proteins such as the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) and Sortilin, preventing their degradation and ensuring efficient lysosomal enzyme transport (Gilleron2024Golgiassociated).

In healthy human cells, Rab4b is expressed in both adipocytes and immune cells, where it regulates the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune cells in white adipose tissue. This regulation is crucial for maintaining insulin sensitivity and metabolic homeostasis (Gilleron2018Rab4b). Rab4b's activity is not dependent on its GTPase activity, as both wild-type and constitutively active forms enhance retrograde trafficking (Gilleron2024Golgiassociated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAB4B gene have been implicated in several metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. In the context of obesity and insulin resistance, decreased expression of Rab4b in T cells is associated with impaired white adipose tissue (WAT) function and insulin resistance. This is characterized by an imbalance between regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17 cells (Th17), leading to inflammation and unhealthy WAT expansion. Mice with Rab4b deficiency in T cells exhibit worsened insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, even on a normal diet, highlighting Rab4b's role in maintaining metabolic health (Gilleron2018Rab4b).

In the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, Rab4b is involved in axonal transport processes. In Huntington's disease, disruptions in Rab4b's axonal motility due to reduced huntingtin (HTT) protein lead to synaptic and behavioral dysfunctions. Excess Rab4b has been shown to rescue these dysfunctions, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for early intervention in Huntington's disease (White2020Excess).

Additionally, in familial colorectal cancer, alterations in the expression of MIA-RAB4B, a long non-coding RNA related to RAB4B, have been observed. This alteration may contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting the expression of oncogenes through miRNA interactions (Thean2017Chromosome).

## Interactions
Rab4b, a small GTPase, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in cellular trafficking processes. It interacts with VPS52, a component of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is essential for retrograde trafficking from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This interaction is necessary for the proper sorting and transport of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) from early endosomes to the TGN (Gilleron2024Golgiassociated).

Rab4b also interacts with Rabip4, a known effector of Rab4, which is involved in the regulation of endosomal functions. This interaction is part of a cooperative mechanism with Rab14, facilitating endosomal tethering and fusion processes (Yamamoto2010Functional).

In adipocytes, Rab4b is implicated in the intracellular retention and trafficking of GLUT4, a glucose transporter. Its role is distinct from other Rab proteins like Rab4a and Rab31, as it does not require coupling with Rabip4 for GLUT4 trafficking (Kaddai2009Rab4b). These interactions highlight Rab4b's critical role in maintaining proper protein trafficking and cellular homeostasis.
