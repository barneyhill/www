# SCGB1A1

## Overview
SCGB1A1 is a gene that encodes the protein secretoglobin family 1A member 1, also known as uteroglobin or Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP). This protein is a small, secreted member of the secretoglobin family, characterized by its ability to form a homodimer with a unique boomerang-shaped structure. SCGB1A1 is predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, particularly in club cells of the small airways, where it plays a vital role in maintaining lung homeostasis and modulating immune responses. The protein is involved in various biological functions, including the regulation of inflammation, detoxification processes, and protection against oxidative stress. It also contributes to lung tissue repair and regeneration by influencing the differentiation of alveolar cells. Alterations in SCGB1A1 expression have been linked to respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Xu2020Lung; Wang2024SCGB1A1; Zuo2020Dysregulation).

## Structure
The SCGB1A1 protein, also known as uteroglobin or Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP), is a small, secreted protein that forms a homodimer. Each monomer consists of a sequence of amino acids that fold into a boomerang-shaped structure, characterized by four alpha-helices (Jackson2011Update). Unlike other secretoglobins, the SCGB1A1 subunits lack a middle cysteine residue, which is a notable structural feature (Jackson2011Update).

The dimerization of SCGB1A1 occurs in an anti-parallel fashion, stabilized by covalent disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions. This dimerization creates an internal hydrophobic cavity at the interface between the two subunits, which serves as a binding site for hydrophobic ligands such as steroid hormones and inflammatory mediators (Jackson2011Update). Six residues, including Phe6 and Tyr21, are critical for maintaining the dimer interface and determining ligand specificity (Jackson2011Update).

SCGB1A1 is involved in various biological functions, including immunomodulation and tissue repair, and may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context (Jackson2011Update).

## Function
SCGB1A1, also known as secretoglobin family 1A member 1, is a protein primarily expressed in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, particularly in club cells of the small airways. It plays a crucial role in maintaining lung homeostasis and modulating immune responses. SCGB1A1 is involved in the regulation of inflammation by binding and sequestering inflammatory mediators, thereby inhibiting the activation of NF-κB, a key transcription factor in inflammatory pathways (Xu2020Lung).

In healthy human cells, SCGB1A1 contributes to the detoxification processes and protection against oxidative stress and environmental toxins. It is a major secretory product of club cells, which are known for their secretory functions and anti-inflammatory properties (Zuo2020Dysregulation). The protein also influences alveolar macrophage function, reducing their response to microbial stimuli by blunting cytokine and chemokine release, which helps mitigate cytokine surges in the lungs (Xu2020Lung).

SCGB1A1 is also implicated in the repair and regeneration of lung tissue. It has been shown that SCGB1A1-expressing cells can differentiate into alveolar type II and type I cells, contributing to the repair of alveolar damage following lung injury (Zheng2012Regeneration).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SCGB1A1 gene, which encodes the club cell secretory protein (CC16), have been linked to several respiratory diseases. In asthma, SCGB1A1 expression is significantly reduced, particularly following rhinovirus infection, which exacerbates asthma symptoms. This reduction is associated with decreased transcription factor FOXA2 activity, which is crucial for SCGB1A1 expression. The downregulation of SCGB1A1 in asthma is also influenced by Th2 cytokines like IL-4 and IL-13, contributing to increased airway hyperreactivity and inflammation (Zhu2019The).

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower levels of SCGB1A1 are correlated with more severe airflow obstruction. Genetic polymorphisms in the SCGB1A1 locus and epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, have been associated with reduced CC16 levels and increased COPD risk. Cigarette smoke exposure further decreases SCGB1A1 expression, leading to more severe lung damage and inflammation (LauchoContreras2016Club).

SCGB1A1 is also implicated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where higher expression levels are associated with improved survival outcomes. Its expression is lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a potential role in inhibiting cancer cell growth (Wang2024SCGB1A1).
