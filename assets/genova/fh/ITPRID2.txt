# ITPRID2

## Overview
The ITPRID2 gene encodes the protein ITPR interacting domain containing 2, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its interaction with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), which are crucial for calcium signaling pathways within cells. ITPR interacting domain containing 2 is implicated in modulating intracellular calcium release, thereby influencing numerous physiological and pathological processes. The gene's expression and the protein's function have been studied in the context of several diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, and lung adenocarcinoma, where alterations in its expression levels have been linked to disease progression and prognosis (Hill2022Alzheimer’s; Sheu2019Bioinformatic; Zhao2024Identification).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The ITPRID2 gene has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), ITPRID2 is notably downregulated in fibroblasts, which may contribute to the disease's progression by affecting fibroblast proliferation and survival (Sheu2019Bioinformatic). This downregulation is part of a broader dysregulation of genes associated with the extracellular matrix, which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IPF (Sheu2019Bioinformatic).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), ITPRID2 expression is inversely correlated with cognitive performance, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Higher expression levels of ITPRID2 are associated with lower cognitive performance, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for AD (Cao2023Plasma). This gene is also upregulated in AD, which may be linked to the disease's pathogenesis through mechanisms involving chronic inflammation and apoptosis (Hill2022Alzheimer’s).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ITPRID2 is part of a prognostic model based on hypoxia and mitochondrial-related gene signatures. Its expression levels differ significantly between normal and tumor samples, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and prognosis (Zhao2024Identification).
