# HABP2

## Overview
HABP2, or hyaluronan binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a serine protease known as plasma hyaluronan-binding protein (PHBP). This protein is primarily involved in extracellular matrix interactions and plays a significant role in processes such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and tissue remodeling. As a serine protease, PHBP is characterized by its ability to cleave peptide bonds in proteins, a function that is crucial for its involvement in the regulation of haemostasis and vascular biology. The protein's structure includes domains commonly found in proteins associated with coagulation, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, a kringle domain, and a serine protease domain, which facilitate its diverse biological activities (Sumiya1997Isolation). Through its interactions with hyaluronic acid and other macromolecules, HABP2 influences cell migration, angiogenesis, and vascular integrity, making it a key player in maintaining tissue homeostasis and responding to injury (Singleton2014Hyaluronan; HusseiniAkram2018Hyaluronan–binding).

## Structure
The human gene HABP2 encodes a serine protease known as plasma hyaluronan-binding protein (PHBP), which is involved in extracellular matrix interactions. The protein is a heterodimer composed of 50 and 25 kDa subunits linked by disulfide bonds, indicating its quaternary structure (Sumiya1997Isolation). The primary structure of PHBP includes a sequence of amino acids that form the backbone of the protein. The predicted structure of PHBP features three epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, a kringle domain, and a serine protease domain, which are common in proteins involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis (Sumiya1997Isolation).

The intron/exon organization of the HABP2 gene is similar to other serine protease genes, such as human coagulation factor XII, suggesting evolutionary conservation and functional similarities (Sumiya1997Isolation). The gene's structure implies that it may have evolved through exon shuffling, a process where exons encoding protein domains are exchanged between genes to create new structures and functions (Sumiya1997Isolation). The protein's activity is inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a common inhibitor of serine proteases, highlighting its functional role in proteolytic processes (Sumiya1997Isolation).

## Function
The HABP2 gene encodes a serine protease known as plasma hyaluronan-binding protein (PHBP), which is involved in several critical molecular processes. This protein is active in the extracellular space, where it plays a significant role in extracellular matrix remodeling and blood coagulation. It is involved in fibrinolysis by activating urokinase and factor VII, contributing to tissue repair and wound healing (Sumiya1997Isolation; Colombo2017Segregation).

HABP2 binds to hyaluronic acid, a glycosaminoglycan abundant in the extracellular matrix, influencing cell migration and angiogenesis. This interaction is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity and promoting tissue growth and repair (Singleton2014Hyaluronan; HusseiniAkram2018Hyaluronan–binding). The protein's activity is regulated by its interaction with high and low molecular weight hyaluronan, which can either enhance or disrupt endothelial cell barrier function, affecting processes like angiogenesis and tumor progression (Singleton2014Hyaluronan).

In the context of lung pathobiology, HABP2 is implicated in the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, with increased activity observed in conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Lennon2011Role). Its role in healthy human cells involves maintaining vascular and tissue homeostasis through its proteolytic activities.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HABP2 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, particularly non-medullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) and venous thromboembolism. The G534E variant of HABP2 was initially reported to be linked with familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC), suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and loss of tumor suppression. However, subsequent studies have not consistently confirmed this association, with some research indicating that the variant does not segregate with the disease and is present in both affected and unaffected individuals (Colombo2017Segregation; Sahasrabudhe2016The). The G534E variant is also common in the general population, further questioning its pathogenicity in NMTC (Weeks2016HABP2).

In addition to thyroid cancer, HABP2 mutations have been implicated in thromboembolic disorders due to the gene's role in coagulation and fibrinolysis (Kamani2022Genetic). Despite these associations, the exact role of HABP2 in these conditions remains controversial, with some studies failing to find a significant link between the G534E variant and NMTC or other diseases (Pinheiro2017HABP2; Alzahrani2016HABP2). Ethnic variations may influence the presence and impact of HABP2 mutations, suggesting a need for further investigation in diverse populations (Jiang2024Chromosomal).

## Interactions
HABP2, also known as hyaluronan binding protein 2, is a plasma-derived serine protease that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in haemostasis and vascular biology. It is known to bind to polyanionic macromolecules such as RNA and heparin, which are crucial for its autoactivation. The interaction with RNA is particularly important, as RNA acts as a cofactor for HABP2's activation, enhancing its ability to activate coagulation factors like Factor VII and generate urokinase (NAKAZAWA2005Extracellular). The binding of RNA to HABP2 is specific, with RNA serving as a template for its activation, while DNA does not have the same effect (NAKAZAWA2005Extracellular).

HABP2 also interacts with the extracellular matrix, where it can degrade matrix proteins and influence cell proliferation by interacting with growth factors (Altincicek2006A). The protein's interaction with heparin is characterized by a bell-shaped concentration-dependent activation curve, suggesting a template-dependent mechanism (Altincicek2006A). These interactions highlight HABP2's role in regulating haemostasis and vascular cell proliferation through its binding to nucleic acids and other macromolecules.
