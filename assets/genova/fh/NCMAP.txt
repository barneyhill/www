# NCMAP

## Overview
NCMAP, or non-compact myelin-associated protein, is a gene that encodes a membrane protein crucial for the formation and maintenance of myelin in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The protein is predominantly expressed by Schwann cells and is localized to specific regions of non-compact myelin, such as paranodes and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. This localization is indicative of its role in the structural organization and functional integrity of the myelin sheath, which is essential for efficient nerve signal transmission. NCMAP's expression is tightly regulated, as imbalances can inhibit myelination, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper nerve function (Ma2021Comparative; TasdemirYilmaz2020Diversity; Mapps2021Diversity).

## Function
NCMAP, also known as non-compact myelin-associated protein, is involved in the formation and maintenance of myelin, a critical component of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). It is a membrane protein expressed by Schwann cells and is localized to paranodes and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures of non-compact myelin (Ma2021Comparative; TasdemirYilmaz2020Diversity). NCMAP plays a role in myelin formation and can inhibit myelination when its expression levels are not properly regulated, either through overexpression or underexpression (Ma2021Comparative).

In the PNS, NCMAP is preferentially expressed in myelinating Schwann cells, making it a useful marker for identifying these cells (TasdemirYilmaz2020Diversity). Its expression is restricted to the peripheral nervous system, where it contributes to the structural integrity of the myelin sheath, facilitating efficient nerve signal transmission (Ma2021Comparative; Mapps2021Diversity). The protein's localization to specific regions of the myelin sheath, such as the paranodal regions flanking nodes of Ranvier, suggests its involvement in the organization and function of myelin, which is essential for rapid nerve impulse conduction (Mapps2021Diversity).
