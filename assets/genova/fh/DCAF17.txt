# DCAF17

## Overview
DCAF17 is a gene that encodes the DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 17, a nuclear transmembrane protein that functions as a substrate receptor within the DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. The DCAF17 protein is predominantly active in the nucleus and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cellular senescence and apoptosis. It is highly expressed in the testis, suggesting a significant role in testicular development and spermatogenesis. Mutations in the DCAF17 gene are linked to Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a range of clinical features, including hypogonadism, diabetes, and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its importance in endocrine and reproductive health (Zhou2021Case; Mistry2020Expression; Ali2018Deletion).

## Function
The DCAF17 gene encodes a nuclear transmembrane protein that functions as a substrate receptor for the DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is crucial in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This system regulates protein degradation, maintaining protein homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair (Zhou2021Case; Ali2018Deletion). DCAF17 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, cellular senescence, and apoptosis (Zhou2021Case).

In healthy human cells, the specific function of DCAF17 remains unclear, but it is hypothesized to play a role in maintaining normal cell processes by potentially affecting nucleolus function (Zhou2021Case). The gene is highly expressed in the testis, suggesting its significant role in testicular development and spermatogenesis (Mistry2020Expression). Mutations in DCAF17 have been linked to Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, which includes symptoms such as hypogonadism, diabetes, and intellectual disability, indicating its importance in endocrine and reproductive health (Zhou2021Case; Ali2018Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DCAF17 gene are primarily associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This syndrome is characterized by a range of clinical features including hypogonadism, alopecia, diabetes mellitus, intellectual disabilities, and neurological abnormalities such as dystonia and dysarthria (Agopiantz2014Endocrine; Wakim2024WoodhouseSakati). The most common mutation, c.436delC, leads to a frameshift and premature termination of the protein, disrupting its normal function and contributing to the pathogenesis of WSS (Kohil2023Genetic; Wakim2024WoodhouseSakati).

DCAF17 mutations can result in truncated, nonfunctional protein products, impairing nucleolar function and affecting cell cycle regulation, cellular senescence, and apoptosis (Zhou2021Case). These disruptions are believed to contribute to the multi-systemic manifestations of WSS, including endocrine abnormalities like diabetes and hypogonadism, as well as neurological symptoms (Agopiantz2014Endocrine; Zhou2021Case).

The syndrome has been documented in various regions, with a higher prevalence in areas with high rates of consanguinity, such as the Greater Middle East (Kohil2023Genetic). The phenotypic variability observed in WSS, even among affected family members, underscores the complexity of the disorder and the impact of DCAF17 mutations (Wakim2024WoodhouseSakati).

## Interactions
DCAF17, also known as DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 17, is involved in interactions with the DDB1-CUL4 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is crucial for recruiting substrates for ubiquitination, a process that targets proteins for proteasomal degradation. Mutations in the DCAF17 gene can lead to truncated proteins that lack necessary domains and motifs for efficient interaction with the DDB1-CUL4 complex, potentially disrupting cellular processes (Zhou2021Case; Kohil2023Genetic).

The DCAF17 protein is known to produce two main transcripts, alpha and beta isoforms, which localize to the nucleolus. Although their exact functions in the human cell cycle are not fully understood, the inefficient interaction of truncated DCAF17 proteins with other proteins could contribute to the pathology of Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome (Kohil2023Genetic).

While specific interactions of DCAF17 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available excerpts, the protein's role as a substrate receptor for the CRL4 complex suggests its involvement in various cellular processes, including testicular development and spermatogenesis (Mistry2020Expression). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise interactions and functions of DCAF17 in these contexts.
