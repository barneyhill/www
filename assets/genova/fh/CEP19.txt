# CEP19

## Overview
CEP19 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 19, a crucial component involved in the formation and function of primary cilia in human cells. This protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein and plays a significant role in ciliary trafficking, which is essential for the proper functioning of primary cilia. The protein forms a complex with RABL2B, a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), facilitating the entry of the intraflagellar transport B (IFT-B) complex into the primary cilium, a process vital for ciliary function (Yıldız2017Homozygous). Mutations in the CEP19 gene have been linked to ciliopathies, such as Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), characterized by a range of phenotypes including obesity, polydactyly, and retinal degeneration (Yıldız2017Homozygous). The protein's interactions with other centrosomal proteins, such as Talpid3, C2CD3, and OFD1, are critical for its localization and function, highlighting its importance in cellular processes like cell division and signaling (Wang2018A).

## Function
CEP19, or centrosomal protein 19, plays a critical role in the formation and function of primary cilia in human cells. It is involved in a molecular mechanism essential for ciliary trafficking, which is crucial for the proper function of primary cilia. CEP19 forms a stoichiometric complex with RABL2B, a highly conserved guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase). This complex is recruited to the centriole at the base of cilia, where RABL2B binds GTP and associates with the intraflagellar transport B (IFT-B) complex. This association facilitates the entry of the IFT-B complex into the primary cilium, a process vital for directed ciliary traffic (Yıldız2017Homozygous).

The activity of CEP19 is primarily located at the centrosome, where it contributes to cellular processes such as cell division and signaling pathways. These processes are important for organismal development and homeostasis. Mutations in CEP19, such as the truncation at Tyr65*, can disrupt the CEP19-RABL2B-IFT pathway, leading to ciliopathy-related features, including those seen in Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) (Yıldız2017Homozygous). The disruption of this pathway can result in phenotypes characteristic of ciliopathies, such as infertility, obesity, polydactyly, and retinal degeneration (Yıldız2017Homozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP19 gene have been implicated in Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), a ciliopathy characterized by genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability. A homozygous truncating mutation in CEP19 (c.194_195insA, p.Tyr65*) has been associated with BBS in a consanguineous family, where it was found alongside a homozygous missense mutation in the GLI1 gene, potentially exacerbating disease severity (Yıldız2017Homozygous). The clinical features of BBS linked to CEP19 mutations include polydactyly, rod-cone dystrophy, obesity, intellectual disability, renal malformation, dental anomalies, and developmental delay (Yıldız2017Homozygous).

CEP19 mutations have also been associated with morbid obesity. A homozygous truncating mutation (p.Arg82*) in CEP19 was previously linked to morbid obesity in a different family, although not all individuals with the homozygous CEP19 mutation in the studied family were obese (Yıldız2017Homozygous). The study suggests that the truncation of CEP19 may cause BBS only in epistasis with a mutation in another gene, following a triallelic model (Yıldız2017Homozygous). The CEP19 gene's role in the CEP19-RABL2B-IFT pathway is crucial for primary cilium formation, and its dysfunction can mimic a RABL2B knockout, leading to BBS (Yıldız2017Homozygous).

## Interactions
CEP19 is a centrosomal protein involved in the structural organization and function of centrioles and cilia. It is part of the CEP350/FOP/CEP19 module, which is crucial for intraflagellar transport (IFT) trafficking and ciliogenesis. CEP19 interacts with proteins such as Talpid3, C2CD3, and OFD1, which are essential for its proper localization to the centrosome. The localization of CEP19 is defective in Talpid3, C2CD3, and OFD1 knockout cell lines, indicating its interaction with these proteins. Specifically, residues 466-700 of Talpid3 are sufficient to restore proper localization of CEP19 in Talpid3 knockout cells, suggesting a direct or indirect interaction between Talpid3 and CEP19 (Wang2018A).

CEP19 is enriched at the mother centriole/basal body upon serum starvation and is involved in critical steps of centriole maturation, such as the removal of distal centriolar proteins and the acquisition of distal appendages. The Talpid3-OFD1-C2CD3 network, along with FOP and CEP350, plays a significant role in the recruitment of CEP19. C2CD3 is suggested to control the recruitment of OFD1, FOP, and CEP350, while Talpid3 may regulate CEP19 localization through OFD1 (Wang2018A).
