# RAI14

## Overview
RAI14, or retinoic acid induced 14, is a gene that encodes the retinoic acid induced protein 14, an actin-binding protein involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including macropinocytosis, cell migration, and the maintenance of cell junction integrity. It is particularly significant in immune response, spermatogenesis, and synaptic function. In immune cells, RAI14 interacts with the invariant chain and myosin II, facilitating antigen uptake and cell motility (Lobos2023Rai14). In the testis, it is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the ectoplasmic specialization, impacting spermatid polarity and adhesion (Qian2013Rai14). Additionally, in neurons, RAI14 stabilizes F-actin structures at dendritic spines, contributing to synaptic connectivity and cognitive functions (Kim2022Retinoic). The gene's expression is also implicated in the progression of various cancers, where it influences cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Gu2019Downregulation; Cui2022High).

## Function
RAI14, also known as retinoic acid induced protein 14, is an actin-binding protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics. It is involved in various cellular processes, including macropinocytosis, cell migration, and the maintenance of cell junction integrity. In antigen-presenting cells, RAI14 interacts with the invariant chain (Ii) and myosin II, coordinating macropinocytosis and cell motility. This interaction is crucial for the internalization of Major Histocompatibility Class II molecules (MHC II) and the regulation of cell migration, highlighting its role in immune response (Lobos2023Rai14).

RAI14 is also involved in the organization of actin filaments at the ectoplasmic specialization in the testis, where it maintains spermatid polarity and adhesion. Its knockdown leads to disorganized actin filaments and disrupted tight junctions, affecting the blood-testis barrier and spermatogenesis (Qian2013Rai14). In neurons, RAI14 localizes at the neck of dendritic spines, where it stabilizes F-actin structures, contributing to synaptic function and plasticity. This stabilization is essential for maintaining dendritic spine density and synaptic connectivity, which are crucial for cognitive functions and may influence stress-related behaviors (Kim2022Retinoic).

## Clinical Significance
RAI14 (retinoic acid induced 14) is implicated in the progression of several cancers, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, and melanoma. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RAI14 is significantly upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival and disease-free survival. Its expression correlates with immune cell markers, suggesting a role in immune recruitment (Cui2022High). RAI14 is also overexpressed in breast cancer tissues, where it promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, partly through the Akt/Cyclin D1 pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes (Gu2019Downregulation).

In gastric cancer, RAI14 is upregulated and linked to poor prognosis. Knockdown studies show that reducing RAI14 expression decreases cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promotes apoptosis by affecting the Akt signaling pathway (Chen2018Knockdown; Yan2021RAI14). RAI14 is also identified as a potential target for mRNA vaccine development due to its role in immune cell recruitment (Wei2022Bioinformatics).

In melanoma, RAI14 is targeted by miR-653-5p, and its depletion reduces tumor growth and affects EMT-related protein expression, indicating its role in melanoma progression (Liu2020Long).

## Interactions
RAI14, also known as retinoic acid induced protein 14, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been identified as a novel interactor of the invariant chain (Ii, CD74) in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), where it regulates macropinocytosis and cell migration. This interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, showing that RAI14 and Ii colocalize at the plasma membrane and during early endocytosis stages (Lobos2023Rai14).

RAI14 also interacts with myosin II, a motor protein involved in cell movement, suggesting a role in coordinating antigen uptake and cell motility. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of myosin II to the front of migrating cells, affecting the directionality and speed of cell migration (Lobos2023Rai14).

In the rat testis, RAI14 is an actin-binding protein that associates with actin and palladin, an actin cross-linking protein. It does not bind with other actin-binding proteins like Arp3, drebrin E, or Eps8. RAI14's interaction with palladin is significant for maintaining the structural integrity of the ectoplasmic specialization, a crucial component of the blood-testis barrier (Qian2013Rai14).
