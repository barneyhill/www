# EML5

## Overview
EML5, or Echinoderm Microtubule-Associated Protein-Like 5, is a gene that encodes a microtubule-associated protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. The protein, EMAP-like 5, is a member of the echinoderm microtubule-associating proteins (EMAPs) and EMAP-like proteins (EMLs or ELPs) family, characterized by its unique structural features, including 11 WD40 domain repeats and 3 hydrophobic EML protein motif (HELP) domains. These structural elements are crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions and microtubule regulation. EML5 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, particularly in regions such as the cerebellum and hippocampus, indicating its importance in neuronal function. Additionally, EML5 plays a significant role in spermatogenesis, particularly in microtubule polymerization and severing during sperm development. Mutations in the EML5 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including decreased fertility in bovines and potential implications in human cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Nogueira2022A; Fry2016EML; Wang2019Targeted).

## Structure
The EML5 protein is a member of the echinoderm microtubule-associating proteins (EMAPs) and EMAP-like proteins (EMLs or ELPs) family. It is characterized by the presence of 11 WD40 domain repeats and 3 hydrophobic EML protein motif (HELP) domains, which are predicted to form three TAPE domains. The WD40 repeats typically fold into a beta-propeller structure, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Nogueira2022A). EML5 is unique among EML proteins for lacking a calcium-binding site and contains an α-helical coiled-coil between the N-terminus and central regions, suggesting potential for homodimerization or heterodimerization with other EML proteins (Nogueira2022A).

The TAPE domain is a tandem atypical propeller structure conserved within EML family members, resembling the tandem β-propeller structure of actin-interacting protein 1 (AIP1) with an atypical blade (Nogueira2022A). EML5's structure is further defined by its lack of an N-terminal trimerization domain, which is present in other EML proteins like EML1-4, but it still contains three contiguous WD repeat domains (Fry2016EML). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its affinity for microtubules (Fry2016EML).

## Function
The EML5 gene encodes a microtubule-associated protein that plays a significant role in microtubule dynamics, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and maintaining cell shape (Nogueira2022A; Fry2016EML). EML5 is primarily expressed in the nervous system, with high levels in regions such as the cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb, indicating its importance in neuronal function (Nogueira2022A). 

Structurally, EML5 contains 11 WD40 domain repeats and 3 HELP domains, which are predicted to form three TAPE domains. These domains suggest that EML5 may homodimerize or form heterodimers with other EML family members, such as EML3 or EML4, to facilitate its function in microtubule regulation (Nogueira2022A; Fry2016EML). The WD40 domain is involved in coordinating multiprotein complex assemblies, which are essential for processes like signal transduction and cell cycle control (Nogueira2022A).

In the context of spermatogenesis, EML5 is involved in microtubule polymerization and severing during acrosomal vesicle assembly and manchette formation, which are critical for sperm development (Nogueira2022A). The protein's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular structural integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EML5 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In bovines, a non-synonymous point mutation, specifically the R1654W mutation within a WD40 domain repeat of EML5, has been linked to decreased sperm quality and fertility. This mutation affects protein interactions and stability, leading to abnormal sperm phenotypes such as piriform heads and ruffled acrosomes, which are difficult to detect with conventional microscopy (Nogueira2022A). The mutation's effects are more pronounced in homozygous individuals, suggesting that one functional copy of EML5 is sufficient for normal sperm development (Nogueira2022A).

In humans, EML5 mutations have been implicated in cancer. The R1654W mutation in bovines is near-orthologous to a human mutation associated with cancer, indicating potential broader implications of EML5 mutations in oncogenesis (Nogueira2022A). Additionally, EML5 has been identified as part of a gene cluster associated with carotid-intima media thickness (cIMT) and atherosclerotic events, suggesting a role in cardiovascular conditions (Wang2019Targeted). The involvement of EML5 in these conditions highlights its significance in both reproductive and cardiovascular health.
