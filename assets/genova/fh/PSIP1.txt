# PSIP1

## Overview
PC4 and SRSF1 interacting protein 1 (PSIP1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein known as LEDGF/p75, which plays a significant role in chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation. The PSIP1 protein is categorized as a chromatin-associated protein and is characterized by several structural domains, including a PWWP domain that facilitates chromatin binding through interaction with methylated histones. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, such as maintaining genome integrity, regulating alternative splicing, and promoting DNA repair. PSIP1 also interacts with HIV integrase, aiding in viral DNA integration into host genomes, which underscores its importance in both cellular function and disease processes (Llano2006Identification; Jayakumar2022PSIP1LEDGF). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its involvement in cancer progression and embryonic development, where alterations in PSIP1 expression or function can lead to disease (Singh2017PSIP1p75; Sutherland2006Disruption).

## Structure
The PSIP1 protein, also known as LEDGF/p75, is characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function in chromatin binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein contains a PWWP domain located at the N-terminus (residues 1-93), which is crucial for chromatin association. This domain features a five-stranded β-sheet core with two α-helices packed onto it, forming an aromatic cage composed of residues M15, Y18, W21, and F44. This aromatic cage is essential for recognizing methylated lysine residues, such as H3K36me3, in histones (Llano2006Identification; van2013Nucleosomal).

Adjacent to the PWWP domain is a charged region (CR1, residues 94-142), which, along with the PWWP domain, forms the main chromosome-binding domain. The AT-hook motifs, located at residues 178-198, bind to the minor groove of A+T-rich DNA, enhancing chromatin binding (Llano2006Identification).

PSIP1 also contains an integrase-binding domain (IBD), which interacts with HIV integrase, facilitating viral DNA integration into host genomes (Hare2009A). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its interaction with chromatin and other proteins (Llano2006Identification).

## Function
The PSIP1 gene, also known as PC4 and SRSF1 interacting protein 1, encodes a multifunctional chromatin-associated protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity in healthy human cells. PSIP1 is involved in reducing R-loops at transcription sites, which are RNA-DNA hybrid structures that can lead to genomic instability if not properly regulated. By interacting with R-loops, PSIP1 helps prevent transcriptional arrest and DNA damage, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Jayakumar2022PSIP1LEDGF).

PSIP1 is also involved in the regulation of alternative splicing. The p52 isoform of PSIP1 binds to methylated histone H3K36 and interacts with splicing factors such as SRSF1, influencing the inclusion or exclusion of alternative exons in specific mRNAs. This interaction is crucial for the chromatin association of splicing proteins and affects the alternative splicing of specific genes (Pradeepa2012Psip1Ledgf).

In addition to its role in splicing, PSIP1 promotes homologous recombination repair of DNA damage induced by R-loops, further contributing to genomic stability. It recruits DNA repair factors to transcription sites, facilitating efficient DNA repair processes (Jayakumar2022PSIP1LEDGF).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PSIP1 gene, which encodes the protein LEDGF/p75, have been implicated in various human diseases. In cancer, PSIP1 is associated with tumorigenicity, particularly in breast cancer, where it promotes the transcription of cell cycle genes. Elevated levels of PSIP1 mRNA are observed in aggressive subtypes such as basal-like or triple-negative breast cancer, correlating with reduced patient survival and increased tumor progression (Singh2017PSIP1p75). PSIP1 is also involved in MLL-rearranged leukemogenesis, where it is essential for the development of leukemia driven by MLL rearrangements. It recruits MLL-fusion proteins to target genes, which is crucial for the leukemogenic process (El2017LEDGFp75).

In embryonic development, knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of PSIP1 leads to perinatal mortality and skeletal abnormalities, suggesting its role in regulating Hox gene expression (Sutherland2006Disruption). The gene is also implicated in cardiac development, as its disruption, particularly in combination with Hdgfrp2 knockout, results in embryonic lethality due to cardiac defects (Wang2015Embryonic). These findings highlight the critical role of PSIP1 in both normal development and disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
PSIP1, also known as LEDGF/p75, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. The PSIP1 protein contains a PWWP domain that binds to methylated histone H3K36, facilitating its association with chromatin. This interaction is crucial for recruiting splicing factors and regulating alternative splicing (Pradeepa2012Psip1Ledgf; van2013Nucleosomal). PSIP1 interacts with several splicing-related proteins, including SR proteins, DEAD/H box helicases, and U5 snRNP proteins, which are involved in pre-mRNA processing (Pradeepa2012Psip1Ledgf).

PSIP1 also plays a role in DNA repair mechanisms by interacting with retinoblastoma binding protein 8 (RBBP8), promoting the repair of double-strand breaks through DNA-end resection (Qin2014Structure). In the context of HIV infection, PSIP1 interacts with HIV integrase, facilitating viral integration into the host genome. Targeted mutations in PSIP1, such as the D366N mutation, can disrupt this interaction, reducing HIV replication while maintaining interactions with other cellular partners like JPO2 and IWS1 (Lampi2019Targeted).

These interactions highlight PSIP1's multifaceted role in chromatin dynamics, splicing regulation, DNA repair, and viral integration, underscoring its importance in cellular function and disease processes.
