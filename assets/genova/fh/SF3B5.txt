# SF3B5

## Overview
The SF3B5 gene encodes the protein splicing factor 3b subunit 5, which is a critical component of the SF3B complex within the spliceosome. The spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex essential for pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells, a process that involves the removal of introns and the joining of exons to form mature mRNA. SF3B5 plays a structural role in the SF3B complex, contributing to the stability and proper assembly of the spliceosome by interacting with other subunits such as SF3B1, SF3B3, and PHF5A. This interaction is vital for the stabilization of U2 snRNA binding to the branch site of pre-mRNA, ensuring accurate splicing and gene expression (Cretu2024Molecular).

## Function
SF3B5 is a component of the SF3B complex, which is integral to the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. This process involves the precise removal of non-coding introns and the ligation of coding exons to produce mature mRNA, which is essential for proper gene expression and cellular function (Cretu2024Molecular). SF3B5, along with other subunits like SF3B1, SF3B3, and PHF5A, contributes to the structural stability of the SF3B core complex, facilitating the correct assembly and function of the spliceosome (Cretu2024Molecular).

In the SF3B complex, SF3B5 is involved in stabilizing the interaction between U2 snRNA and the branch site of pre-mRNA, which is crucial for accurate splicing (Cretu2024Molecular). The SF3B5 subunit is described as having a structural role, fitting into a cleft in the SF3B3 subunit, which suggests its importance in maintaining the integrity of the SF3B complex (Cretu2024Molecular). Although specific details about the function of SF3B5 in healthy human cells are limited, its involvement in the spliceosome indicates a critical role in RNA processing and gene regulation (Yazhini2021Rewards).

## Interactions
SF3B5 is a component of the SF3B complex, which is integral to the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. Within the SF3B complex, SF3B5 interacts tightly with the BPA domain of SF3B3, forming part of a structural cavity that accommodates SF3B5. This interaction is distinct from other ligands that typically interact with both the BPA and BPC domains of DDB1-like structures (Cretu2024Molecular). SF3B5 is also involved in the formation of a tight complex with SF3B1, SF3B3, and PHF5A, which is necessary for the binding of splicing modulators such as E7107. The cryo-EM structure of the SF3B complex reveals that SF3B1 encircles PHF5A, forming a channel where E7107 binds, although SF3B5's specific role in this interaction is not detailed (Finci2018The).

SF3B5's interactions within the SF3B complex are crucial for its function in splicing modulation. The complex, including SF3B5, displays high affinity for splicing modulators like pladienolide B, which exploit the conformational dynamics of the SF3B complex to influence splicing (Cretu2024Molecular).
