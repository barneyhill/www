# DOK1

## Overview
DOK1, or docking protein 1, is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic adaptor protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The DOK1 protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a proline- and tyrosine-rich C-terminal region. These domains facilitate its role as a negative regulator in signaling pathways, particularly those involved in cell proliferation, migration, and immune response (Friedrich2016Subcellular; Li2010Downstream). DOK1 interacts with several proteins, including kinases and scaffold proteins, to modulate cellular functions. It is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its activity and stability (Miah2014BRK). Alterations in DOK1 expression and function have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2019Docking; Siouda2014EpsteinBarr).

## Structure
DOK1 (docking protein 1) is characterized by a modular structure that includes an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a C-terminal region rich in proline and tyrosine residues (Friedrich2016Subcellular; Li2010Downstream). The PH domain is involved in membrane binding, while the PTB domain facilitates interactions with phosphotyrosine substrates, such as the RET tyrosine kinase (Murakami2002Role). The C-terminal region contains sites for interaction with SH3 domains and SRC kinase, and it includes a nuclear export signal (NES) that regulates its subcellular localization (Friedrich2016Subcellular).

DOK1 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably tyrosine phosphorylation, which influences its interactions and function. For instance, BRK (Breast Tumor Kinase) phosphorylates DOK1, targeting it for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (Miah2014BRK). Alternative translation initiation results in several DOK1 isoforms, including N-terminally truncated variants like p37-44 and smaller forms such as p19-22, which lack certain domains (Friedrich2016Subcellular). These structural features and modifications play a crucial role in DOK1's function as a negative regulator in various signaling pathways.

## Function
DOK1 (docking protein 1) is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that plays a significant role in regulating various cellular functions in healthy human cells. It is involved in down-regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, inhibiting cell proliferation and transformation, and promoting cell spreading and migration (Niu2006A). DOK1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, a process regulated by a nuclear export signal (NES) and phosphorylation. The nuclear export of DOK1 is mediated by the CRM1 nuclear export system, and its cytoplasmic localization is influenced by factors such as Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and IKKβ (Niu2006A).

DOK1 acts as a negative regulator in several signaling pathways, inhibiting cell proliferation and MAP kinase activity, and mediating apoptosis. It also plays positive roles in cell adhesion, spreading, and migration, with its functions modulated by phosphorylation of specific serine residues, which can influence cell proliferation and motility (Niu2006A). In immune cells, DOK1 acts as a negative regulator of signaling, particularly in immune receptors in lymphocytes and myeloid cells, helping to inhibit inflammation in vivo (Friedrich2016Subcellular). DOK1's role in healthy cells includes maintaining normal immune function and preventing aberrant cell proliferation (Li2019Docking).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DOK1 gene are implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer, DOK1 is often downregulated in tumor cells, which is associated with poor prognosis. This downregulation is linked to hypermethylation of the DOK1 promoter, particularly in Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-positive cases, where DOK1 expression is reduced in tumor cells but increased in tumor-adjacent stroma cells (Li2019Docking). The presence of DOK1 in stroma cells correlates with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its role in the tumor microenvironment contributes to cancer progression (Li2019Docking).

In colorectal cancer, truncated variants of DOK1 have been identified, which may contribute to cancer progression by disrupting its normal regulatory functions (Friedrich2016Subcellular). DOK1's interaction with transcription factors and signaling pathways, such as JAK-STAT and NFκB, is crucial for its role in inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis (Friedrich2016Subcellular).

EBV infection can lead to the downregulation of DOK1 through epigenetic mechanisms, such as increased DNA methylation, contributing to the development of EBV-associated cancers like Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Siouda2014EpsteinBarr).

## Interactions
DOK1 (docking protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the scaffold protein 14-3-3ζ, forming a complex that is crucial for integrin regulation. This interaction is characterized by a dissociation constant (Kd) of 294 μM and is driven by favorable enthalpic changes, suggesting that polar interactions stabilize the complex. The presence of 14-3-3ζ enhances the binding of DOK1 to phosphorylated integrin β3 cytoplasmic tails, increasing the binding affinity significantly (Chatterjee2018Interaction).

DOK1 also interacts with the RET tyrosine kinase, particularly in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) mutations. The interaction is stronger with the RET-MEN2B mutation compared to the wild-type RET, and it is dependent on the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of DOK1 (Murakami2002Role).

In the context of breast cancer, DOK1 is targeted by BRK (Breast Tumor Kinase) for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. BRK phosphorylates DOK1 at tyrosine 362, and this interaction is mediated through the SH3 and SH2 domains of BRK. The degradation of DOK1 by BRK is linked to increased cell proliferation and migration (Miah2014BRK).
