# RBBP5

## Overview
RBBP5 is a gene that encodes the RB binding protein 5, a critical subunit of the histone lysine methyltransferase complex. This protein is integral to the MLL/SET1 complex, which is responsible for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with active transcription. The protein is characterized by its WD40 repeat β-propeller structure, which facilitates interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a pivotal role in chromatin targeting and regulation of methyltransferase activity (Han2019The; Mittal2018The). RBBP5 is involved in various biological processes, including gene expression regulation during development and stress response, and has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Huang2024Loss; Kubra2024Epigenetic).

## Structure
RBBP5 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the MLL/SET1 histone methyltransferase complex, primarily involved in histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation. The protein contains a major structural domain known as the WD40 repeat β-propeller, which forms a canonical seven-bladed structure. This domain is characterized by a central axis filled with polar residues, creating an open solvent-filled channel that links the two faces of the propeller. The surface of the β-propeller is predominantly polar, with basic patches formed by arginine and lysine side-chains, suggesting potential nucleic acid binding sites (Mittal2018The).

The C-terminal region of RBBP5, particularly the CTD3 motif, is rich in basic residues and is important for nucleosome binding and methylation activity. This motif enhances the binding affinity of the MLL1 complex to nucleosomes, thereby increasing its methylation activity (Han2019The). The interaction between the WD40 propeller and the C-terminal regions of RBBP5 is crucial for the assembly and activity of the MLL1 complex, with hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions stabilizing this interaction (Han2019The).

RBBP5 is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and exists in several splice variant isoforms. These structural features and modifications contribute to its role in chromatin targeting and regulation of methyltransferase activity (Mittal2018The).

## Function
RBBP5 is a crucial component of the WRAD complex, which includes WDR5, Ash2L, and DPY30, and is essential for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a key epigenetic modification associated with active transcription (Mittal2018The; Zhang2015A). This methylation process is vital for regulating gene expression, including the expression of Hox genes during embryonic development and adipogenesis (Zhang2015A). RBBP5 interacts with Ash2L, and this interaction is critical for the stimulation of MLL1 methyltransferase activity, which maintains high levels of H3K4 trimethylation necessary for the transcription of certain genes (Zhang2015A).

RBBP5 also plays a significant role in proteostasis and hepatic metabolism, which are crucial for maintaining organismal health. It is involved in the regulation of the hepatic 12-hour ultradian oscillator, distinct from the circadian clock, through COMPASS-mediated histone methylation, specifically H3K4me3. This modification is important for the transcriptional activation of adaptive stress response genes (Kubra2024Epigenetic). In the liver, RBBP5 is essential for the transcriptional response to proteotoxic stress, influencing autophagy and the unfolded protein response (Kubra2024Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RBBP5 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Loss of function in RBBP5 is linked to a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by microcephaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability, short stature, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and dysmorphic facies. This disorder is caused by de novo heterozygous variants in RBBP5, including missense and truncating mutations, which affect regions intolerant to changes, leading to a decrease in neuron numbers and brain size (Huang2024Loss).

In prostate cancer, RBBP5 is implicated in tumorigenesis through its interaction with long non-coding RNA AC245100.4 and microRNA-145-5p. AC245100.4 acts as a molecular sponge for miR-145-5p, which targets RBBP5, thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration. Alterations in this axis contribute to prostate cancer progression, highlighting RBBP5's role in oncogenesis (Xie2020Long).

RBBP5 is also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer cells. It regulates the transcription of Snail, a key EMT factor, through histone modification. Knockdown of RBBP5 reduces Snail expression and EMT, suggesting its role in cancer metastasis (Li2016Role).

## Interactions
RBBP5 is a key component of the MLL/SET1 histone methyltransferase complex, which is involved in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4). It interacts with several proteins, including WDR5, ASH2L, and DPY30, forming a core complex essential for gene activation. RBBP5 and WDR5 are crucial for the stable association of the MLL1 C-terminal fragment, which contains the catalytic SET domain. These interactions are necessary for the structural integrity and enzymatic function of the MLL1 complex (Avdic2011Structural; Dou2006Regulation).

RBBP5 interacts with WDR5 through a specific region, forming a structural entity that is independent of the catalytic subunit. This interaction is stabilized by several hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, with key residues such as E374, V375, and D376 playing a significant role (Avdic2011Structural). The interaction between RBBP5 and ASH2L is also critical, with the SPRY domain of ASH2L binding to a specific region of RBBP5, facilitating the assembly and function of the MLL1 complex (Zhang2015A; Chen2012Structure). These interactions highlight the importance of RBBP5 in the regulation of histone methylation and gene expression.
