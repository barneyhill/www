# ZNF445

## Overview
ZNF445 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 445, a member of the KRAB-zinc finger protein (KZFP) family, which plays a pivotal role in genomic imprinting. The protein is characterized by its KRAB domain, SCAN domain, and 14 zinc finger domains, which facilitate its function in maintaining methylation imprints at imprinting-associated differentially methylated regions (iDMRs) post-fertilization (Kagami2021ZNF445:). ZNF445 is highly expressed in oocytes and during early embryonic development, where it interacts with the KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1) to ensure proper genomic imprinting, a process crucial for normal development (MonteagudoSánchez2020The). Pathogenic variants in ZNF445 have been linked to imprinting disorders such as Temple syndrome and multilocus imprinting disturbance (MLID), underscoring its clinical significance (Kagami2021ZNF445:).

## Function
ZNF445 is a KRAB-zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining postfertilization methylation imprints in healthy human cells. It is involved in the methylation maintenance of multiple imprinting-associated differentially methylated regions (iDMRs), similar to the function of ZFP57 (Kagami2021ZNF445:). ZNF445 consists of eight exons and encodes a protein with 1,031 amino acids, belonging to the KRAB-containing KZFP family. It carries a SCAN domain and 14 zinc finger domains, along with the KRAB domain (Kagami2021ZNF445:).

ZNF445 binds to multiple imprinting control regions (ICRs) within iDMRs and maintains methylation imprints by recruiting KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1), also known as TRIM28. This function is crucial for the proper regulation of genomic imprints, which are essential for normal development and cellular function (Kagami2021ZNF445:). ZNF445 is highly expressed in oocytes and during the first cleavage divisions, suggesting a role in early development (MonteagudoSánchez2020The). It interacts with the KAP1 corepressor complex, which is crucial for maintaining methylation at imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) during early embryonic development (MonteagudoSánchez2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF445 gene have been implicated in several imprinting disorders, most notably Temple syndrome and multilocus imprinting disturbance (MLID). A homozygous truncating variant in ZNF445 was identified in a patient with Temple syndrome, leading to a truncated protein missing two zinc finger domains. This mutation resulted in severe hypomethylation at the MEG3:TSS-DMR and moderate hypomethylation at other imprinting-associated differentially methylated regions (iDMRs) (Kagami2021ZNF445:). The pathogenicity of this variant is underscored by the fact that the heterozygous parents of the patient were clinically normal, indicating that the homozygous state is necessary for the disease phenotype (Kagami2021ZNF445:).

ZNF445 is also noted for its role in maintaining methylation imprints post-fertilization, and its deficiency cannot be compensated by other proteins like ZFP57, leading to imprinting disorders (MonteagudoSánchez2020The). The gene's high probability of being loss-of-function intolerant suggests that biallelic variants can lead to significant disease phenotypes, as no homozygous loss-of-function variants have been recorded in the gnomAD database (Kagami2021ZNF445:). The clinical significance of ZNF445 mutations is further highlighted by its potential involvement in other imprinting disorders, such as Silver-Russell syndrome (Bilo2023Molecular).

## Interactions
ZNF445 is a KRAB-zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in maintaining methylation at imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) during early human development. It interacts with the KAP1 corepressor complex, also known as TRIM28, to recruit it to imprinted loci, thereby maintaining methylation imprints. This interaction is crucial for the repression of certain genes, such as H19, as demonstrated in leukemic K562 cells where the TRIM28-K304Q mutation weakens the interaction with ZNF445, leading to derepression of H19 expression (MonteagudoSánchez2020The; Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

ZNF445 is also involved in binding to multiple imprinting control regions (ICRs) within iDMRs, particularly affecting the MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR, which is primarily associated with ZNF445 binding. This binding is essential for maintaining postfertilization methylation imprints, and pathogenic variants in ZNF445 can lead to multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLID) (Kagami2021ZNF445:).

High-resolution KZFP ChIP-seq maps have shown that ZNF445 binds to 13 different imprinted DMRs, with a significant overlap with those bound by ZFP57, suggesting a potential collaborative role in protecting imprinted regions during early development (MonteagudoSánchez2020The).
