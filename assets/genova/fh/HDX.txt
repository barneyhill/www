# HDX

## Overview
The HDX gene encodes the highly divergent homeobox protein, which is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the transcriptional activity of target genes. In particular, HDX has been implicated in the regulation of the EPAS1 gene, especially under hypoxic conditions, where it appears to act as a negative regulator by dissociating from the EPAS1 promoter, leading to increased transcriptional activity (Hamidian2018Promoterassociated). The expression of HDX is modulated by hypoxic conditions and is also influenced by MYCN status in neuroblastoma cells, suggesting a complex regulatory network that may have implications for cancer biology (Hamidian2018Promoterassociated).

## Interactions
The HDX protein, encoded by the highly divergent homeobox gene, is involved in interactions with the EPAS1 gene promoter in neuroblastoma cells. Under hypoxic conditions, HDX dissociates from the EPAS1 promoter, suggesting a regulatory role in EPAS1 expression. This dissociation is associated with a general opening of chromatin, which may facilitate increased transcription of EPAS1. The study identified two potential HDX binding motifs in the EPAS1 promoter region, indicating possible physical interactions with the DNA (Hamidian2018Promoterassociated).

HDX is proposed to act as a negative regulator of EPAS1 expression through a release-of-inhibition mechanism. This is supported by observations that HDX expression decreases under hypoxia while EPAS1 mRNA is induced. The study also noted a modest negative correlation between EPAS1 and HDX mRNA expression, suggesting a potential regulatory relationship. In neuroblastoma cells with high MYCN expression, HDX expression is also elevated, indicating that MYCN status may influence HDX's regulatory role (Hamidian2018Promoterassociated).
