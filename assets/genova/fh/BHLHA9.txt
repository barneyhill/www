# BHLHA9

## Overview
BHLHA9 is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, which is integral to the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in limb morphogenesis. The protein encoded by BHLHA9, known as basic helix-loop-helix family member a9, is characterized by its bHLH domain, which facilitates DNA binding and dimerization with other bHLH proteins, thereby influencing the transcriptional activation of target genes (Malik2014Mutations). This transcription factor plays a pivotal role in the formation of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and is crucial for proper limb development, as evidenced by its involvement in regulating key modulators such as Trp63 and Fgf8 (Kataoka2017Bhlha9). Mutations or duplications in the BHLHA9 gene are associated with congenital limb malformations, including split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM) and mesoaxial synostotic syndactyly with phalangeal reduction (MSSD), highlighting its clinical significance (Nagata2014Japanese; Malik2014Mutations).

## Structure
The BHLHA9 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, which is essential for its DNA-binding capability and dimerization with other bHLH proteins (Malik2014Mutations). The protein consists of 235 amino acids and includes a proline-rich carboxyl terminus, which may have functional significance (Malik2014Mutations). The bHLH domain facilitates the formation of homo- or heterodimers, which are crucial for the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in limb morphogenesis (Malik2014Mutations).

Mutations in the DNA-binding domain, specifically p.Asn71Asp, p.Arg73Pro, and p.Arg75Leu, disrupt the protein's ability to dimerize and bind DNA, leading to developmental abnormalities such as mesoaxial synostotic syndactyly with phalangeal reduction (MSSD) (Malik2014Mutations). These mutations affect the highly conserved DNA-binding region, highlighting its critical role in the protein's function (Malik2014Mutations).

The BHLHA9 protein interacts with other transcription factors, such as TCF3, TCF4, and TCF12, modulating transcriptional activation. Mutations in BHLHA9 significantly reduce the activation potential of these transcription factors, as demonstrated in luciferase reporter assays (Malik2014Mutations). The protein's molecular interactions and its role in limb development are similar to other bHLH proteins, although the exact molecular structure and choice of dimerization partners remain to be experimentally clarified (Malik2014Mutations).

## Function
The BHLHA9 gene encodes a transcription factor that is part of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, which plays a crucial role in limb development, particularly in the formation of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) during embryogenesis. This gene is involved in regulating the expression of key modulators of limb development, such as Trp63 and Fgf8, which are essential for maintaining the structure and function of the AER. BHLHA9 is expressed in the ectodermal region of the digit near the AER during early embryonic stages, indicating its role in proper limb morphogenesis (Kataoka2017Bhlha9).

In Bhlha9-knockout mice, abnormalities such as syndactyly and poliosis have been observed, suggesting that BHLHA9 is critical for normal limb development by regulating apoptosis in the interdigital regions. The gene's expression influences the proper separation of digits by modulating cell death in the interdigital webbing tissue, which is necessary for digit separation (Schatz2014Gene; Kataoka2017Bhlha9). BHLHA9's activity in the nucleus involves binding to specific DNA sequences to modulate transcription, thereby influencing the expression of genes critical for limb and digit formation (Schatz2014Gene).

## Clinical Significance
The BHLHA9 gene is clinically significant due to its association with split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM) and split-hand/foot malformation with long bone deficiency (SHFLD). These congenital limb dysgeneses are characterized by ectrodactyly, syndactyly, and monodactyly, resulting from duplications or triplications involving the BHLHA9 gene located at chromosome 17p13.3 (Nagata2014Japanese; Kataoka2017Bhlha9). The gene's overdosage is a strong susceptibility factor for these limb malformations, with triplications more frequently associated with SHFLD and Gollop-Wolfgang complex (GWC) (Nagata2014Japanese).

BHLHA9 duplications are linked to variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, meaning not all individuals with these genetic alterations exhibit clinical symptoms (Nagata2014Japanese). The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance, and there is a noted sex bias, with more affected males than females (Paththinige2019Split). The gene's role in limb development is further supported by knockout studies in mice, which show that Bhlha9 is crucial for proper limb formation, as its absence leads to syndactyly and poliosis (Kataoka2017Bhlha9).

## Interactions
BHLHA9, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is known to interact with several other proteins, particularly those involved in transcriptional regulation. In yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens using mouse embryo libraries, BHLHA9 was found to interact with transcription factors TCF3, TCF4, and TCF12. These interactions were confirmed through one-to-one Y2H assays, demonstrating strong interactions, especially with TCF proteins, as evidenced by growth at a stringency of 25 mM 3AT (Malik2014Mutations). BHLHA9 can also bind to human HAND2 and TWIST1 proteins, forming dimers that are crucial for its function (Malik2014Mutations).

The protein's ability to dimerize with itself and other bHLH E-box proteins, such as TCF3, TCF4, TCF12, TWIST1, and HAND2, is essential for regulating gene expression by binding to E-box-containing promoters (Malik2014Mutations). Mutations in BHLHA9, particularly those affecting its DNA-binding domain, disrupt these interactions, leading to a loss of regulatory potential and contributing to the development of mesoaxial synostotic syndactyly with phalangeal reduction (MSSD) (Malik2014Mutations). These mutations impair BHLHA9's functional interactions with TCF proteins, as demonstrated by luciferase assays showing that the presence of mutations abolishes the regulatory effect on gene expression (Malik2014Mutations).
