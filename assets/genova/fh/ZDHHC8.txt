# ZDHHC8

## Overview
ZDHHC8 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 8, which is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases. This enzyme is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through S-palmitoylation, a process that attaches palmitic acid to cysteine residues, thereby influencing protein localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC8 is predominantly expressed in the brain and plays a significant role in synaptic and neuronal functions, impacting cognitive processes and brain development (Greaves2011DHHC; Korycka2012Human). The protein is active in the Golgi apparatus and is known to interact with various synaptic proteins, affecting their palmitoylation and function. Alterations in the ZDHHC8 gene have been linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (Chen2004Case–control; Yang2018ZDHHC8).

## Function
ZDHHC8 encodes a palmitoyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through S-palmitoylation. This process involves the attachment of palmitic acid to cysteine residues, which is essential for regulating protein localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC8 is highly expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, eye, and lung, and is particularly important for brain development and neurotransmitter receptor function (Korycka2012Human).

In healthy human cells, ZDHHC8 is implicated in the regulation of trafficking and signaling pathways, especially those involved in synaptic and neuronal functions. It enhances the palmitoylation of proteins such as paralemmin-1, which is involved in spine formation, and acts as a palmitoyltransferase for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), affecting their distribution and function (Korycka2012Human). ZDHHC8 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences cognitive processes by affecting synaptic targeting and neuronal development (Greaves2011DHHC).

The gene's role in healthy cells may also involve cell cycle control, as it is implicated in the G2/M checkpoint, and its impairment increases susceptibility to ionizing radiation (Korycka2012Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZDHHC8 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, ZDHHC8 is located in the 22q11.2 microdeletion region, a known risk factor for the disorder. Variants in this gene, such as the SNP rs175174, have been associated with schizophrenia susceptibility, with studies showing that the G allele is more common in affected individuals (Faul2005ZDHHC8as; Chen2004Case–control). The gene's influence on cortical volume and synaptic connectivity may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, as ZDHHC8-deficient mice exhibit reduced dendritic spine density, which can be normalized by active ZDHHC8 protein (Liao2024The; Ota2013ZDHHC8).

In epilepsy, ZDHHC8 plays a critical role in modulating seizure susceptibility. Increased expression of ZDHHC8 has been observed in temporal lobe epilepsy patients and animal models, suggesting a link to seizure activity. Knockdown of ZDHHC8 has been shown to reduce seizure recurrence, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Yang2018ZDHHC8). The gene affects excitatory neurotransmission, particularly through AMPA receptor function, which contributes to hyperexcitability and seizure propagation (Yang2018ZDHHC8).

## Interactions
ZDHHC8 is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. It is known to palmitoylate PSD-95, a synaptic protein, which affects PSD-95's nitrosylation and plays a role in synaptic function and potentially in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases (Wu2021Protein). ZDHHC8 also interacts with PICK1, a synaptic protein, which is essential for cerebellar long-term depression induction, a process occurring in dendritic spines (Philippe2019Spatial).

ZDHHC8 forms a complex with the accessory protein GCP16, similar to its closely related enzyme ZDHHC5, suggesting shared regulatory interactions (Salaun2020Accessory). This interaction may influence the localization and function of ZDHHC8, as it is primarily localized to synaptic membranes in neurons, where it palmitoylates synaptic substrates such as cdc42 and PICK1, crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Philippe2019Spatial).

The enzyme is also implicated in the palmitoylation of other proteins involved in cellular functions, such as paralemmin-1, PSD95, eNOS, and ABCA1, which are associated with spine formation and cholesterol efflux (Korycka2012Human). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of ZDHHC8 in modulating protein function through palmitoylation.
