# ABCB11

## Overview
The ABCB11 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 11 (BSEP), a critical transmembrane protein involved in the transport of bile salts. BSEP is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to translocate substrates across cellular membranes. Specifically, BSEP is responsible for the ATP-dependent export of bile salts from hepatocytes into the bile canaliculi, a process essential for bile formation and the maintenance of bile acid homeostasis (Stieger2010The; Byrne2008Missense). The protein's structure includes two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains, forming a homodimeric quaternary structure that facilitates its function (Wang2020CryoEM; Liu2023Structural). Mutations in the ABCB11 gene can lead to liver disorders such as Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 2 (PFIC2) and Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 2 (BRIC2), highlighting its clinical significance (Strautnieks2008Severe; DavitSpraul2010ATP8B1).

## Structure
The ABCB11 protein, also known as the bile salt export pump (BSEP), is a full ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. It consists of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) within a single polypeptide chain, forming a homodimeric quaternary structure (Wang2020CryoEM; Liu2023Structural). Each TMD is composed of six transmembrane helices, with significant cytosolic extensions forming two diverged 'wings' at the hepatocellular side (Wang2020CryoEM). The NBDs exhibit a classic fold typical of ABC transporters, featuring an α-helical subdomain and a RecA-like ATPase core subdomain (Wang2020CryoEM).

The protein's structure includes conserved motifs such as the Walker A & B motifs and the ABC signature motif. However, the Walker B motif in NBD1 has a degenerated active site due to a methionine replacing the catalytic glutamate (Wang2020CryoEM). The extracellular loop between TM1 and TM2 contains conserved asparagine residues subject to glycosylation, which is important for ABCB11's trafficking and functionality (Wang2020CryoEM). The C-terminus includes a helical hairpin with an endocytic cargo motif necessary for post-Golgi trafficking (Wang2020CryoEM).

ABCB11 features two substrate-binding pockets within its TMDs, facilitating the transport of bile acids. These pockets are referred to as the inner membrane leaflet (IML) and outer membrane leaflet (OML) pockets, with specific residues playing critical roles in substrate binding (Wang2022Structures). The protein's structure is maintained by hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges, with key residues like Trp330 involved in binding the cholic acid moieties of taurocholate molecules (Wang2022Structures).

## Function
The ABCB11 gene encodes the bile salt export pump (BSEP), a crucial protein in the liver responsible for the ATP-dependent transport of bile salts across the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes into the bile canaliculi. This process is essential for bile formation and flow, which are critical for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins (Stieger2010The; Byrne2008Missense). BSEP is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily and operates against a steep concentration gradient, maintaining high bile salt concentrations in the canalicular bile compared to portal blood (Byrne2002The).

BSEP has a high affinity for primary bile salts such as taurocholate, glycochenodeoxycholate, and glycocholate, and its function is vital for preventing the accumulation of cytotoxic bile salts within hepatocytes (Byrne2002The; Kubitz2012The). The protein is localized exclusively in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, where it plays a key role in maintaining bile acid homeostasis and preventing cholestasis, a condition characterized by impaired bile flow (Byrne2008Missense; Kubitz2012The). BSEP's activity is regulated by various kinases and proteins, and its expression can be influenced by factors such as the FXR signaling pathway (Kubitz2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCB11 gene, which encodes the bile salt export pump (BSEP), are associated with several liver disorders, primarily Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 2 (PFIC2) and Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 2 (BRIC2). PFIC2 is characterized by severe cholestasis, early liver failure, and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, often requiring liver transplantation at a young age. Patients with PFIC2 typically exhibit low biliary bile acid concentration and negative BSEP canalicular staining (Strautnieks2008Severe; DavitSpraul2010ATP8B1). BRIC2, on the other hand, involves intermittent episodes of cholestasis without permanent liver damage, although some patients may develop permanent cholestasis later in life (van2004Benign).

Mutations in ABCB11 can lead to a range of clinical outcomes, from severe early-onset disease to milder, late-onset forms. The E297G and D482G mutations are among the most common and have been identified in both European and non-European families (Strautnieks2008Severe). Additionally, certain ABCB11 mutations can predispose individuals to cholestasis under specific conditions, such as during pregnancy or with certain medications (DavitSpraul2010ATP8B1).

## Interactions
ABCB11, also known as the bile salt export pump (BSEP), is involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in bile acid transport. BSEP interacts with radixin (RDX), a member of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family, which links membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton. This interaction was confirmed through multiple methods, including membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) assays, co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and in vitro pull-down assays (Przybylla2016Analysis). BSEP also interacts with bile acyl-CoA synthetase (BACS, SLC27A5), an enzyme involved in the re-conjugation of bile acids, suggesting a potential interaction site in pseudo-canalicular structures in differentiated HepaRG cells (Przybylla2016Analysis).

The study identified several proteins from the early secretory pathway that interact with BSEP, including the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex and the translocating chain-associated membrane protein 1 (TRAM1), which play roles in membrane protein translocation (Przybylla2016Analysis). Other identified interaction partners include Bap31 (BCAP31), receptor expression-enhancing proteins (REEP), and proteins involved in vesicular transport and sorting, such as IER3IP1 and RER1 (Przybylla2016Analysis). These interactions are essential for BSEP's trafficking, localization, and activity at the canalicular membrane (Przybylla2016Analysis).
