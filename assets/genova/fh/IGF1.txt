# IGF1

## Overview
The IGF1 gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a peptide hormone that plays a pivotal role in growth and development. IGF-1 is primarily synthesized in the liver and functions as a key mediator of growth hormone (GH) actions, exerting its effects through the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), a tyrosine kinase receptor. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival, by activating intracellular signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAP kinase (LeRoith2007Mechanisms; AlSamerria2021The). IGF-1 also has significant metabolic effects, enhancing glucose uptake and protein synthesis while inhibiting proteolysis, thereby contributing to its anabolic properties (LeRoith2007Mechanisms; AlSamerria2021The). The IGF1 gene is located on chromosome 12 and undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants that contribute to the functional diversity of IGF-1 (Filus2014Insulinlike). The protein's interactions with its receptor, integrins, and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) are crucial for modulating its biological activity and availability (Baxter2000Insulinlike; Lowman1998Molecular).

## Structure
The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a small peptide hormone composed of 70 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 7649 Da. Its primary structure includes an A and B chain connected by disulfide bonds, and a C peptide region with 12 amino acids, which is structurally similar to insulin (Filus2014Insulinlike; Laron2001Insulinlike). The secondary structure of IGF-1 involves alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its compact, globular tertiary structure. IGF-1 functions as a monomer, lacking a quaternary structure.

IGF-1 contains specific domains, such as the IGF-binding domain, which is crucial for its interaction with receptors and binding proteins. The C region between the B and A domains is important for receptor binding, and mutations in this region can significantly affect binding affinity (Adams2000Structure). IGF-1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are essential for its stability and function.

The IGF1 gene is located on chromosome 12 and consists of six exons. Transcription from two promoter sites and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA result in various transcript forms, contributing to the functional diversity of IGF-1 (Filus2014Insulinlike).

## Function
Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a polypeptide hormone that plays a critical role in growth and development by mediating the effects of growth hormone (GH) on various tissues. It is primarily produced by the liver in response to GH and acts through the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), a tyrosine kinase receptor, to initiate intracellular signaling pathways such as the PI3K/AKT and MAP kinase pathways. These pathways are essential for promoting cell growth, differentiation, and survival (LeRoith2007Mechanisms; AlSamerria2021The).

IGF1 is involved in numerous biological processes, including the regulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. It has insulin-like effects that enhance glucose uptake in muscle and fat tissues, reduce hepatic glucose production, and improve insulin sensitivity, contrasting with the insulin resistance typically induced by excess GH (LeRoith2007Mechanisms; AlSamerria2021The). IGF1 also stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits proteolysis in muscle, contributing to its anabolic effects (LeRoith2007Mechanisms).

In addition to its systemic endocrine functions, IGF1 acts in a paracrine and autocrine manner in various tissues, including cartilage, bone, and the central nervous system, where it supports tissue differentiation, growth, and regeneration (Filus2014Insulinlike; AlSamerria2021The). IGF1's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal growth and metabolic homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IGF1 gene can lead to a variety of growth and developmental disorders. Severe homozygous defects in IGF1 are associated with extreme pre- and post-natal growth failure, microcephaly, sensorineural deafness, and severe developmental delays. These conditions are consistent with observations in IGF-I deficient mice, highlighting IGF-I's role in intrauterine growth and brain development (Forbes2020Disorders). A homozygous partial deletion of the IGF-I gene can result in severe intrauterine growth retardation, postnatal growth failure, profound sensorineural deafness, and mental retardation, underscoring the critical role of IGF-I in fetal and postnatal growth (Woods1996Intrauterine).

Alterations in IGF1 expression levels are linked to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Low circulating levels of IGF-1 are associated with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, while normal to high levels correlate with reduced prevalence of these conditions (Aguirre2016Insulinlike). In cancer biology, high circulating IGF1 levels are associated with increased risks of breast and prostate cancers, as well as other non-hormone-dependent cancers like colon cancer (Bruchim2009Targeting). Elevated IGF1 levels may enhance cell proliferation and survival, facilitating carcinogenesis (Pollak2004Insulinlike).

## Interactions
IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) engages in several critical interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It primarily binds to the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), initiating signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK, which are crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Philippou2014The). IGF1 also interacts with integrins, particularly integrin αvβ3, forming a complex with IGF1R on the cell surface. This interaction is essential for IGF1 signaling, as it enhances IGF1R signaling and is necessary for the phosphorylation of IGF1R and downstream signaling events (Takada2017Crosstalk; Zheng1998Blocking).

IGF1's interaction with integrins is further supported by studies showing that blocking the ligand occupancy of integrin αvβ3 with echistatin inhibits IGF1-stimulated responses, such as protein and DNA synthesis, in vascular smooth muscle cells (Zheng1998Blocking). Additionally, IGF1 interacts with insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs), which modulate its activity by either inhibiting or potentiating its effects. These interactions are significant for regulating IGF1's availability and activity in biological systems (Baxter2000Insulinlike; Lowman1998Molecular). The complex interplay between IGF1, its receptor, integrins, and IGFBPs underscores its role in cellular growth and development.
