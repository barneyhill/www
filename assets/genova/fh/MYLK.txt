# MYLK

## Overview
The MYLK gene encodes the enzyme myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), a serine/threonine-specific kinase that plays a pivotal role in muscle contraction and various cellular processes. MLCK is responsible for phosphorylating the myosin regulatory light chain, a critical step in facilitating actomyosin interactions necessary for muscle contraction and cell motility (Kamm2001Dedicated; Herring2006Regulation). The enzyme is activated by calcium-bound calmodulin, which induces a conformational change allowing MLCK to phosphorylate its substrates (Kamm2001Dedicated; Hong2011Biochemistry). Beyond its role in muscle cells, MLCK is involved in nonmuscle cell functions such as cell migration, cytokinesis, and maintaining endothelial barrier function (Shen2010Myosin). The gene's expression and activity are finely regulated through alternative splicing, post-translational modifications, and interactions with various proteins, underscoring its importance in cellular dynamics and integrity (Khapchaev2016Myosin).

## Structure
The MYLK gene encodes myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which is involved in muscle contraction and cell motility. MLCK has a complex molecular structure with several distinct domains. It includes a kinase domain responsible for its enzymatic activity, a calmodulin-binding domain, and an actin-binding domain located at the N-terminus, which consists of three 28 amino acid repeats with DFRxxL motifs that interact with actin monomers (Khapchaev2016Myosin). The calmodulin-binding domain is crucial for MLCK's activation by Ca2+/calmodulin, and it is located in the 3' half of the cDNA (Guerriero1986Domain).

MLCK exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including long MLCK (L MLCK) and short MLCK (S MLCK), which differ in molecular weight and tissue-specific expression (Khapchaev2016Myosin). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, play significant roles in regulating MLCK's activity. Phosphorylation at specific sites can either inhibit or enhance MLCK activity, affecting its interaction with calmodulin and other proteins (Khapchaev2016Myosin). The protein's tertiary structure is suggested to be 'folded,' with interactions between its N and C terminal regions, although no crystal structure is available to confirm this (Khapchaev2016Myosin).

## Function
MYLK, or myosin light chain kinase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the regulation of muscle contraction and various cellular processes. It phosphorylates the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), which is essential for actomyosin interactions that drive muscle contraction and cell motility (Kamm2001Dedicated; Herring2006Regulation). In smooth muscle cells, this phosphorylation is necessary to initiate contraction by altering the orientation of myosin crossbridges, thereby activating myosin ATPase activity (Isotani2004Realtime; Zhang2010Myosin).

MYLK is activated by the binding of calcium-bound calmodulin, which induces a conformational change that allows it to phosphorylate its substrates (Kamm2001Dedicated; Hong2011Biochemistry). This enzyme is involved in various nonmuscle cell functions, including cell migration, cytokinesis, and changes in cell shape (Kamm2001Dedicated). In endothelial cells, MYLK regulates barrier function by influencing cell-cell junctions and paracellular permeability, which are critical for maintaining vascular integrity (Shen2010Myosin).

The activity of MYLK is finely regulated by a balance with myosin light chain phosphatase, and its function is modulated by various signaling pathways that affect calcium sensitivity and phosphorylation states (Tansey1994Ca(2+)dependent page 0 of 6; Kamm2001Dedicated page 1 of 2). This regulation is vital for maintaining proper muscle function and cellular dynamics in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYLK gene are associated with several significant clinical conditions. Pathogenic variants in MYLK, particularly missense mutations, are linked to aortic diseases, including thoracic aortic dissections and aneurysms. Individuals with these variants often experience aortic events at a median age of 48, with a high cumulative risk by age 84 (Wallace2019MYLK). The MYLK p.Tyr1575His variant is identified as pathogenic, despite minimal disruption in kinase activity, indicating that traditional functional assays may not always predict pathogenicity (Wallace2019MYLK).

MYLK gene polymorphisms also play a role in inflammatory lung diseases. Variants such as Pro21His, Ser147Pro, and Val261Ala are associated with increased risk and severity of conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe asthma. These polymorphisms affect the phosphorylation and function of the nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK), impacting endothelial cell barrier integrity and contributing to disease pathophysiology (Dudek2010Abl; Wang2018Myosin).

Additionally, MYLK gene expression and splicing alterations, influenced by mechanical stress and single nucleotide polymorphisms, are linked to vascular barrier disruption and inflammatory lung injuries, further implicating MYLK in conditions such as asthma and ARDS (Mascarenhas2017Mechanical).

## Interactions
The MYLK gene encodes myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which participates in various protein interactions crucial for cellular functions. MLCK interacts with actin, myosin, and calmodulin, forming a complex that regulates muscle contraction and cytoskeletal organization (Khapchaev2016Myosin). It also interacts with tubulin, linking actin and tubulin cytoskeleton structures (Khapchaev2016Myosin). 

MLCK's interaction with cortactin, an actin-binding protein, is significant in endothelial cells. This interaction is enhanced by phosphorylation through c-Src tyrosine kinase and is regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin (Khapchaev2016Myosin; Shen2015Structure–Function). The non-muscle MLCK (nmMLCK) isoform also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms affecting this binding (Shen2015Structure–Function).

MLCK interacts with supervillin, a scaffold membrane-bound protein, affecting cell spreading through myosin activation (Khapchaev2016Myosin). It also forms complexes with myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), modulating its activity (Khapchaev2016Myosin). 

Phosphorylation by c-Abl tyrosine kinase enhances MLCK's activity and its binding to cortactin, influencing endothelial barrier function (Dudek2010Abl). These interactions highlight MLCK's role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular motility.
