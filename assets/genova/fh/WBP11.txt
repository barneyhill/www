# WBP11

## Overview
WBP11 is a gene that encodes the WW domain binding protein 11, a critical component of the spliceosome involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is characterized by its interaction with WW domains, which are essential for protein-protein interactions, particularly within the spliceosome complex. WBP11 plays a significant role in the regulation of alternative splicing, influencing cellular differentiation and development. It acts as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle, primarily functioning within the nucleus to maintain normal mRNA processing. The protein's interactions with other splicing factors, such as PQBP1, and its involvement in stabilizing spliceosomal structures underscore its importance in RNA processing. Alterations in WBP11 expression or mutations can lead to various diseases, including ovarian cancer and congenital defects, highlighting its clinical significance (Wei2024The; Martin2020Heterozygous).

## Structure
WBP11 (WW domain binding protein 11) is a protein characterized by its interaction with WW domains, which are small protein modules involved in protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of WBP11 includes proline-rich regions, which are crucial for its binding to WW domains (Bedford2000A). These regions contain motifs rich in both proline and arginine residues, with sequences such as PPR, RPP, PRPR, RP, and RPR being common (Bedford2000A).

The secondary structure of WBP11 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, but it is known to interact with other proteins through its proline-rich motifs, suggesting a structure that facilitates such interactions. The tertiary structure of WBP11 is not described in detail, but its interaction with other proteins, such as PQBP1, indicates a functional conformation that supports these interactions (Mizuguchi2016Allosteric).

WBP11 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing as part of the spliceosome, indicating its role in complex protein assemblies, which may suggest a quaternary structure involving interactions with other spliceosomal components (Martin2020Heterozygous). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided.

## Function
WBP11 (WW domain binding protein 11) is a crucial component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing, which is essential for the removal of noncoding segments and the ligation of coding segments in precursor mRNA. This process is vital for the regulation of differential and alternative splicing, influencing cellular differentiation and development (Martin2020Heterozygous). WBP11 colocalizes with SC35 in nuclear speckles, which are sites of splicing assembly, storage, and regulation (Martin2020Heterozygous). It interacts with other splicing factors, such as PQBP1, and mutations in these factors can lead to diseases with overlapping phenotypes (Martin2020Heterozygous).

In healthy human cells, WBP11 acts as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle that regulates pre-mRNA splicing, maintaining normal mRNA processing (Tapia2010Y65C). It is involved in the activation of pre-mRNA splicing, a process essential for proper gene expression (Martin2020Heterozygous). WBP11's role in the spliceosome includes stabilizing the unique conformation of the U6 internal stem-loop during spliceosome activation, which is necessary for the correct order of RNA rearrangements (Townsend2020Mechanism). The protein's activity is primarily nuclear, reflecting its involvement in these critical cellular processes (Martin2020Heterozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the WBP11 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly ovarian cancer and congenital defects. In ovarian cancer, WBP11 is overexpressed and acts as an oncogenic splicing factor. Its high expression is associated with poor prognosis, as it promotes malignant behaviors in ovarian cancer cells by regulating the expression of MCM7, a gene involved in cell proliferation and genomic stability. The transcription factor FOXM1 activates WBP11 expression, linking it to cancer progression. Targeting WBP11 with antisense oligonucleotides has shown potential in reducing tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting its role as a therapeutic target (Wei2024The).

In terms of congenital defects, heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in WBP11 are associated with a range of anomalies, including vertebral, cardiac, esophageal, and renal malformations. These mutations are linked to conditions such as VACTERL association and Klippel-Feil syndrome. Mouse models with Wbp11 null alleles exhibit similar defects, supporting the gene's role in development. The phenotypic expression of these variants shows variability, with some individuals carrying the mutation without symptoms, indicating partial penetrance (Martin2020Heterozygous).

## Interactions
WBP11 (WW domain binding protein 11) is involved in several protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, playing a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing. It is a component of the spliceosome, specifically interacting with the PRP19 complex, which is crucial for the removal of noncoding introns from precursor mRNAs (Martin2020Heterozygous). WBP11 interacts with PQBP1, a splicing factor, and this interaction is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. Mutations in PQBP1, such as the Y65C missense mutation, disrupt its binding to WBP11, leading to decreased splicing efficiency (Sudol2012Molecular; Martin2020Heterozygous).

WBP11 also interacts with protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), inhibiting its activity during spliceosome activation. This interaction is part of WBP11's role in stabilizing the U6 ISL conformation within the spliceosome (Townsend2020Mechanism). Additionally, WBP11 binds to MCM7 pre-mRNA, promoting its alternative splicing by repressing intron retention, which is crucial for the expression of functional MCM7 protein in ovarian cancer cells (Wei2024The). These interactions highlight WBP11's multifaceted role in RNA processing and its potential impact on cellular functions and disease progression.
