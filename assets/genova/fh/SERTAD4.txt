# SERTAD4

## Overview
SERTAD4 is a gene that encodes the protein SERTA domain containing 4, which is a member of the SERTA domain protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of a conserved SERTA domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions. Unlike other members of its family, SERTAD4 does not exhibit intrinsic transcriptional activity. The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and is known to interact with I-mfa domain proteins, influencing their intracellular localization and potentially modulating their transcriptional activities. Despite these interactions, SERTAD4's specific role in transcriptional regulation remains less defined compared to other SERTA domain proteins, such as SEI-1 and SERTAD3 (Kusano2011Imfa).

## Structure


## Function


## Interactions
SERTAD4, a member of the SERTA domain protein family, is known to interact with I-mfa domain proteins. These interactions occur through the C-terminal I-mfa domains, which can affect the intracellular localization of I-mfa and lead to the repression of the intrinsic transcriptional activities of SERTA domain proteins. However, SERTAD4 itself does not exhibit intrinsic transcriptional activity, unlike other SERTA domain proteins such as SEI-1, SEI-2, and SERTAD3 (Kusano2011Imfa).

In experiments, SERTAD4 was efficiently precipitated with I-mfa, indicating a specific interaction through the I-mfa domain. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that SERTAD4 is primarily located in the nucleus, and I-mfa co-localizes with SERTAD4 in the nucleus when co-expressed. Despite this interaction, the overexpression of I-mfa does not affect the transcriptional activity of SERTAD4, suggesting that SERTAD4 does not have the same transcriptional regulatory role as other SERTA domain proteins (Kusano2011Imfa).

These interactions suggest a potential role for SERTAD4 in cellular processes involving protein complexes, although its specific functions in transcriptional regulation remain less defined compared to other SERTA domain proteins (Kusano2011Imfa).
