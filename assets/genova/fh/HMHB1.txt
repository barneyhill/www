# HMHB1

## Overview
The HMHB1 gene encodes the histocompatibility minor HB-1 protein, which is a minor histocompatibility antigen involved in immune system processes. This protein is particularly significant in the context of hematological malignancies, where it can be targeted by T-cell immunotherapy to mediate graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. Unlike major histocompatibility antigens, minor histocompatibility antigens like HB-1 can elicit immune responses without causing severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), making them valuable in therapeutic settings such as donor lymphocyte infusion for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (Bleakley2011Exploiting). The expression of HMHB1 is also implicated in other conditions, such as sickle cell disease and keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome, where its regulation may influence disease pathophysiology and treatment outcomes (Tinguely2023Transcriptomic; Taki2019Roles).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The HMHB1 gene, encoding the histocompatibility minor HB-1 antigen, plays a significant role in immune responses, particularly in the context of hematological malignancies. Alterations in the expression of HMHB1 have been observed in various clinical settings. In the context of leukemia, HMHB1 is recognized as a minor histocompatibility antigen that can be targeted by T-cell immunotherapy. This targeting is associated with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) relapse, highlighting its potential in mediating graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects without causing severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (Bleakley2011Exploiting).

In sickle cell disease (SCD), transcriptomic profiling has shown that HMHB1 expression is significantly downregulated in healthy controls and hydroxyurea-treated SCD samples, but upregulated in untreated SCD samples. This suggests that HMHB1 expression may be modulated by treatment and could play a role in the pathophysiology of SCD (Tinguely2023Transcriptomic).

Additionally, HMHB1 is among the genes downregulated in keratinocytes expressing mutant connexin26 in KID syndrome, indicating its involvement in immune response alterations in this condition (Taki2019Roles).
