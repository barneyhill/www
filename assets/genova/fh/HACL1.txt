# HACL1

## Overview
The HACL1 gene encodes the enzyme 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1, a crucial component of the peroxisomal α-oxidation pathway in mammals. This enzyme is categorized as a lyase and is responsible for the breakdown of specific fatty acids that are not amenable to β-oxidation due to structural constraints. It plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by cleaving CoA-esters of phytanic acid and 2-hydroxylated straight chain fatty acids, facilitating their conversion into forms that can be further processed. Notably, HACL1 is the only known peroxisomal enzyme in mammals that requires thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) as a cofactor, forming a tetrameric complex essential for its enzymatic activity (Khalil2022Tissue; Fraccascia2011Role). The gene's function is significant in the liver, where it influences the biosynthesis of odd-chain fatty acids and impacts lipid metabolism (Jenkins2017Peroxisomal). HACL1's role in metabolic pathways has clinical implications, particularly in relation to glycemic control and systemic inflammation, highlighting its potential involvement in conditions such as type 2 diabetes (Lee2022Phenomewide).

## Function
The HACL1 gene encodes the enzyme 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1, which is integral to the peroxisomal α-oxidation pathway in human cells. This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of certain fatty acids that cannot undergo β-oxidation due to structural features, such as a methyl group at position 3 or a hydroxy group at position 2. HACL1 specifically cleaves the CoA-esters of phytanic acid and 2-hydroxylated straight chain fatty acids into a (n-1) fatty aldehyde and formyl-CoA, facilitating the conversion of phytanic acid into pristanic acid, which can then be further processed through the β-oxidation pathway (Khalil2022Tissue; Fraccascia2011Role).

HACL1 is the only known peroxisomal enzyme in mammals that requires thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) as a cofactor. The enzyme forms a tetrameric complex and its activity is crucial for maintaining normal lipid metabolism. Mutations in the TPP-binding domain can abolish enzyme activity, highlighting the importance of TPP for its function, although TPP is not necessary for the enzyme's targeting to peroxisomes (Fraccascia2011Role).

In the liver, HACL1 plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of odd-chain fatty acids like heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), influencing circulating levels of these fatty acids and contributing to lipid metabolism (Jenkins2017Peroxisomal).

## Clinical Significance
HACL1 (2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1) is implicated in several metabolic and clinical conditions due to its role in peroxisomal fatty acid α-oxidation. Deficiencies in HACL1 can lead to the accumulation of phytanic and 2-hydroxyphytanic acids, as observed in Hacl1 knockout mice, which suggests a potential link to metabolic disorders related to fatty acid oxidation (Khalil2022Tissue). Despite these biochemical changes, Hacl1 knockout mice do not develop severe neurological diseases, possibly due to compensatory pathways such as ω-oxidation and the presence of an alternative lyase in the central nervous system (Khalil2022Tissue).

In humans, HACL1 has been associated with glycemic traits, particularly HbA1C levels, in a large-scale phenome-wide association study involving Taiwanese individuals. This suggests that HACL1 may play a role in lipid metabolism and glycemic control, potentially influencing the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (Lee2022Phenomewide). Additionally, HACL1 has been linked to C-reactive protein levels, a marker of chronic systemic inflammation, which is a key factor in type 2 diabetes (Lee2022Phenomewide). While no specific diseases have been directly linked to HACL1 mutations, its involvement in these metabolic pathways indicates its clinical significance.
