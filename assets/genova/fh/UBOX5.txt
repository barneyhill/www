# UBOX5

## Overview
UBOX5 is a gene in humans that encodes the protein U-box domain containing 5, which is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by the presence of a U-box domain, which is integral to its function in the ubiquitination process. Ubiquitination is a critical post-translational modification that marks proteins for degradation via the proteasome, thus playing a vital role in protein quality control and cellular homeostasis. U-box domain containing 5 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcription, RNA processing, signaling, cytoskeletal organization, DNA damage response, and lipid storage, by preventing the auto-ubiquitylation and degradation of specific proteins (Rossio2021Proteomics). The activity of this protein is essential for maintaining cellular stability and responding to environmental changes, underscoring its significance in cellular biology and potential implications for organismal health.

## Function
UBOX5 is a human gene encoding a protein with a U-box domain, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is involved in the ubiquitination process, a post-translational modification that tags proteins for degradation by the proteasome. UBOX5 plays a critical role in maintaining protein stability by preventing auto-ubiquitylation and degradation of certain proteins, including other ubiquitin ligases (Rossio2021Proteomics). The activity of UBOX5 is crucial for various cellular processes, such as transcription, RNA processing, signaling, cytoskeletal organization, DNA damage response, and lipid storage (Rossio2021Proteomics).

UBOX5 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to protein quality control and cellular stress responses. It facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, thereby regulating their stability and function. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes. The role of UBOX5 in these processes highlights its importance in cellular biology and its potential impact on organismal health. The regulation of UBOX5 and its substrates is likely conserved across species, as observed in studies using Xenopus extracts (Rossio2021Proteomics).
