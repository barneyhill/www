# UBC

## Overview
The UBC gene encodes the ubiquitin C protein, a pivotal component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is integral to protein degradation and cellular regulation. Ubiquitin C is a small, highly conserved protein that functions as a post-translational modifier, tagging proteins for degradation and thereby regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and stress responses (Bianchi2019A; Bianchi2015Dynamic). The UBC gene is particularly responsive to cellular stress, ensuring the maintenance of ubiquitin homeostasis under conditions such as oxidative stress and proteasome inhibition (Bianchi2015Dynamic; Bianchi2018Induction). Ubiquitin C is not functionally redundant with other ubiquitin genes, underscoring its unique role in cellular function and development (Bianchi2015Dynamic). The protein's interactions with various transcription factors and its involvement in the regulation of key proteins like β-Catenin highlight its significance in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing tumorigenesis (Piątkowska2024Ubiquitin).

## Structure
The UBC gene encodes the ubiquitin protein, which is a small, 76-amino acid protein involved in tagging proteins for degradation. The primary structure of ubiquitin consists of these 76 amino acids, forming a compact and highly conserved sequence. The secondary structure of ubiquitin includes an alpha helix and five beta strands, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of ubiquitin is characterized by a compact globular fold, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins and its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Ubiquitin can form polyubiquitin chains, representing its quaternary structure, which are crucial for signaling different cellular processes, including protein degradation and DNA repair (Bianchi2015Dynamic).

Common post-translational modifications of ubiquitin include phosphorylation and ubiquitination itself, which regulate its activity and interactions. These modifications are critical for the protein's role in various cellular stress responses and maintaining ubiquitin homeostasis (Bianchi2018Induction). The UBC gene is known to produce multiple transcript variants, which may lead to different isoforms of the ubiquitin protein, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (Bianchi2009A).

## Function
The UBC gene encodes a polyubiquitin precursor protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining ubiquitin homeostasis in human cells. Ubiquitin is a highly conserved protein involved in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for regulating protein turnover, cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and stress responses (Bianchi2019A; Bianchi2015Dynamic). UBC is particularly responsive to stress conditions, such as oxidative stress and proteasome inhibition, where it is upregulated to meet the increased demand for ubiquitin, ensuring the clearance of misfolded proteins and maintaining cellular survival (Bianchi2015Dynamic; Bianchi2018Induction).

Under basal conditions, UBC contributes significantly to the intracellular ubiquitin pool, supporting normal cell growth and development. Disruption of the UBC gene in mice results in embryonic lethality, highlighting its essential role in development and cellular function (Bianchi2015Dynamic). The UBC gene is not functionally redundant with other ubiquitin genes, as its disruption is not compensated by the upregulation of other ubiquitin genes, indicating its unique role in maintaining ubiquitin homeostasis (Bianchi2015Dynamic). UBC is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Bianchi2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the UBC gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In gastric cancer, UBC is upregulated in metastatic cell lines compared to primary cell lines, suggesting a role in cancer progression and metastasis (Scarpa2020The). The knockdown of UBC in primary gastric cancer cells leads to reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis, indicating its pro-survival role in these cells (Scarpa2020The). This suggests that UBC could serve as a potential therapeutic target in gastric adenocarcinoma, as its silencing affects apoptotic markers and reduces tumor proliferation (Scarpa2020The).

In mouse models, the UbC gene is essential for fetal liver development, cell-cycle progression, and stress tolerance. Disruption of UbC results in embryonic lethality due to impaired liver cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to stressors (Ryu2007The). UbC-deficient cells exhibit reduced growth rates, premature senescence, and increased apoptosis, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining cellular ubiquitin levels during stress (Ryu2007The). These findings underscore the importance of UBC in cellular stress responses and its potential implications in conditions where ubiquitin levels are disrupted (Ryu2007The).

## Interactions
The human ubiquitin C (UBC) gene is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its regulatory functions. The transcriptional regulation of the UBC gene involves complex interactions with transcription factors such as Sp1 and Sp3, which bind to multiple sites within the 5′-UTR intron, enhancing UBC gene expression. Sp1 plays a pivotal role by interacting with both upstream and intronic elements, while Sp3 can act as a transcriptional activator, potentially cooperating or competing with Sp1 depending on the context (Bianchi2009A).

The transcription factor YY1 also binds to active elements within the intron, contributing to the formation of DNA-protein complexes that are essential for transcriptional regulation (Bianchi2009A). Under stress conditions, the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is crucial for UBC upregulation, binding to distal heat shock elements (HSEs) on the UBC promoter to mediate transcriptional induction (Bianchi2018Induction).

UBC also plays a role in the ubiquitination process, particularly in the regulation of β-Catenin, by facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin molecules, which tags β-Catenin for proteasomal degradation. This interaction is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing tumorigenesis (Piątkowska2024Ubiquitin).
