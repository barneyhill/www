# PHF12

## Overview
PHF12 is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 12, a chromatin-associated protein involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. The protein is characterized by the presence of plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger domains, which facilitate interactions with histone proteins and other components of chromatin-modifying complexes. PHD finger protein 12 plays a critical role in maintaining nucleolar integrity and regulating ribosome biogenesis, processes essential for cellular proliferation and homeostasis. It is a component of the Sin3A repressive complex and interacts with histone deacetylases, influencing gene expression through histone modification. Alterations in PHF12 expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it contributes to tumorigenesis by modulating key signaling pathways (Graveline2017The; Wan2023Mechanism; Kong2024PHF12).

## Structure
PHF12 (PHD finger protein 12) is a protein characterized by the presence of plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger domains, which are involved in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation. The protein contains two PHD fingers, with PHD1 playing a crucial role in recognizing and binding the unmodified end of histone H3, facilitating the recruitment of the histone tail substrate to the enzyme (Wan2023Mechanism). The PHD2 domain, although atypical and unable to bind histone tails independently, stabilizes the interaction between SIN3B and HDAC by wedging between the SIN3B C-terminal domain and the HDAC (Wan2023Mechanism).

PHF12 also contains a second Sin3 interaction domain (SID2) that binds to the SIN3B PAH3 domain, essential for the assembly of the SIN3B complex (Wan2023Mechanism). The protein acts as a scaffolding subunit, contacting each core subunit domain and recruiting the H3 histone tail with its PHD1 (Wan2023Mechanism). The structure of PHF12 within the SIN3B complex includes a previously uncharacterized N-terminal helix (NTH) and a predicted SIN3 interacting domain (SID2) (Wan2023Mechanism). The PHF12 construct used in studies lacks the poorly conserved and unstructured C-terminus, ending at residue 502 (Wan2023Mechanism).

## Function
The PHF12 gene encodes the Pf1 protein, which plays a crucial role in maintaining nucleolar integrity and preventing premature cellular senescence in healthy human cells. Pf1 is a chromatin-associated protein that is part of a complex involving MRG15, Sin3B, and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), functioning as a transcriptional modulator (Graveline2017The). It is involved in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the splicing, covalent modifications, and maturation of pre-rRNA transcripts, which are essential for proper cellular function and proliferation (Graveline2017The).

Pf1 interacts with various proteins, including those in the Sin3-HDAC complex and the Rpd3S complex, and is associated with transcriptional regulation. It coordinates transcriptional and posttranscriptional steps of ribosomal biogenesis, contributing to nucleolar functions (Graveline2017The). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences multiple regulatory pathways in ribosome biogenesis and affects the nucleolar structure (Graveline2017The).

Inactivation of Pf1 leads to premature cellular senescence and nucleolar changes, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Graveline2017The). The Pf1 protein is essential for embryonic development, as its deficiency results in developmental defects and impaired cellular proliferation (Graveline2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PHF12 gene have been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PHF12 is significantly upregulated in NSCLC tumor tissues, and higher levels of PHF12 expression are associated with poorer clinical outcomes. The gene promotes tumorigenesis by interacting with HDAC1 and regulating the EGFR/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in NSCLC. Knockdown of PHF12 leads to reduced tumor growth, while its overexpression results in increased tumor size and weight, highlighting its oncogenic role in lung cancer progression (Kong2024PHF12).

In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), PHF12 is upregulated through the action of the lncRNA RP11-116G8.5, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA to sponge miR-3150b-3p. This interaction leads to increased PHF12 expression, promoting cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes critical for cancer metastasis (Li2021LncRNA).

PHF12 is also involved in maintaining nucleolar integrity and preventing premature cellular senescence. Its interaction with chromatin-associated complexes, including Sin3B and HDAC1, is essential for these functions. Disruption of PHF12 can lead to impaired ribosomal biogenesis and increased cellular senescence (Graveline2017The).

## Interactions
PHF12, also known as PHD finger protein 12, is involved in various protein interactions that influence gene expression and chromatin structure. It is a component of the Sin3A repressive complex and interacts with Sin3A via its N terminus, which contains two PHD domains. This interaction is crucial for the repression of target genes through histone deacetylation, particularly during neural crest epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (StroblMazzulla2012A). PHF12 also interacts with Snail2 indirectly through Sin3A, forming a repressive complex that epigenetically mediates EMT by recruiting Sin3A-HDAC to repress target genes (StroblMazzulla2012A).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PHF12 interacts with HDAC1, a histone deacetylase, to regulate the EGFR/AKT signaling pathway, promoting tumorigenesis. This interaction is part of a mechanism that influences both the transcriptional and protein levels of HDAC1, with PHF12 binding predominantly to the intron region of HDAC1 (Kong2024PHF12). PHF12's interaction with HDAC1 is significant in cancer progression, as it modulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Kong2024PHF12).
