# CENPN

## Overview
CENPN, or centromere protein N, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the centromere-kinetochore complex, playing a pivotal role in chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein, centromere protein N, is a component of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) and is involved in the assembly and function of the centromere by binding to CENP-A-containing nucleosomes. This interaction is crucial for marking kinetochore positions on chromosomes, thereby ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. CENPN is also involved in the recruitment and proper localization of other centromere proteins, contributing to the maintenance of centromeric chromatin and the deposition of newly synthesized CENP-A. The dynamic binding behavior of centromere protein N to kinetochores underscores its essential role in kinetochore assembly and function, which is vital for maintaining centromeric chromatin structure and ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis (Hellwig2011Dynamics; Carroll2009Centromere).

## Function
CENPN, or centromere protein N, is a crucial component of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) and plays a significant role in centromere assembly and function. It specifically binds to CENP-A-containing nucleosomes, which are essential for marking kinetochore positions on chromosomes, thereby facilitating accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Hellwig2011Dynamics; Carroll2009Centromere). CENPN's interaction with CENP-A is DNA sequence-independent, suggesting it recognizes an epigenetic mark that specifies centromere identity (Carroll2009Centromere).

CENPN is involved in the recruitment of other centromere proteins, such as CENP-H, CENP-I, and CENP-K, and is essential for the proper localization of these proteins to the centromere (Carroll2009Centromere). It also plays a role in the maintenance of centromeric chromatin and the deposition of newly synthesized CENP-A at centromeres, ensuring the propagation of centromeric chromatin during cell division (Hellwig2011Dynamics).

CENPN exhibits dynamic binding behavior to kinetochores, with rapid exchange during early cell cycle phases and stable association during later phases, indicating its role in kinetochore assembly and function (Hellwig2011Dynamics). This dynamic behavior is crucial for maintaining centromeric chromatin structure and ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis (Hellwig2011Dynamics).

## Clinical Significance
CENPN (centromere protein N) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), CENPN is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its overexpression promotes malignant behaviors such as increased glucose metabolism, cell proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis through the IRF2/CENP-N/AKT signaling axis (Qi2021The). Knockdown of CENPN in NPC cells has been shown to enhance radiosensitivity by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway, leading to increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Wu2023Enhancing).

CENPN is also overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), where it contributes to tumor growth by enhancing cell cycle progression. Knockdown of CENPN in OSCC cells results in cell cycle arrest and reduced proliferation, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Oka2019Centromere). These findings indicate that CENPN plays a critical role in the proliferation and survival of cancer cells, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancers where it is overexpressed. Targeting CENPN could improve treatment outcomes, particularly in cases where current therapies are less effective due to resistance or relapse (Wu2023Enhancing; Qi2021The).

## Interactions
CENPN (centromere protein N) is a key component of the centromere-kinetochore complex, interacting with several proteins and nucleic acids to ensure proper chromosome segregation during cell division. It is part of the CENP-LN complex, which serves as a central nexus connecting the entire Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN). CENPN interacts with CENPA, facilitating the recruitment of other protein complexes essential for kinetochore assembly. Specifically, the N-terminus of CENPN interacts directly with a loop within CENPA, aiding in its recruitment to the mitophagosome during interphase. The C-terminus of CENPN interacts with CENP-L and forms binding associations with CENP-C and the CENP-HIKM complex (Gui2023Clinical).

CENPN also plays a role in the regulation of the p53 signaling pathway in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It interacts with the MDM2 protein, a negative regulator of p53. Knockdown of CENPN results in decreased MDM2 levels and increased levels of p53 and its downstream target p21, suggesting that CENPN may regulate p53 activity through MDM2 (Xu2024CENPN). This interaction influences cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting CENPN's role in cancer progression (Xu2024CENPN).
