# CBLC

## Overview
The CBLC gene encodes the Cbl-c protein, a member of the Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which are pivotal in regulating protein degradation and signal transduction pathways. Cbl-c is distinct from other Cbl family members due to its unique structural features, including a tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, a linker, and a RING finger motif, which contribute to its specific functional roles in cellular processes (Takeshita2012Structural). The protein is involved in the intracellular processing and trafficking of vitamin B12, playing a critical role in the conversion of cobalamin derivatives into active cofactors essential for cellular metabolism (Mascarenhas2020The). Additionally, Cbl-c interacts with various proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinases, influencing pathways related to cell proliferation and differentiation, and has been implicated in DNA repair mechanisms (Frankum2015Complementary). These interactions highlight its potential role as a tumor suppressor and its relevance in therapeutic contexts, particularly in relation to sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Frankum2015Complementary).

## Structure
The CBLC gene encodes the Cbl-c protein, a member of the Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The protein is characterized by a tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, a linker, and a RING finger motif located in the amino-terminal region (Takeshita2012Structural). The TKB domain is composed of three interacting domains: a four-helix bundle (4H), an EF-hand domain, and a divergent Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, which together form an integrated phosphotyrosine-binding module (Takeshita2012Structural). The EF-hand domain contains a metal ion binding site occupied by a calcium ion (Takeshita2012Structural).

Cbl-c is distinct from other Cbl-family members as it lacks the extensive proline-rich sequence and ubiquitin-associated leucine zipper motif found in Cbl and Cbl-b. The TKB domain of Cbl-c shares only 50% identity with those of Cbl and Cbl-b, indicating structural and functional differences (Takeshita2012Structural). Structural studies have shown that the Cbl-c TKB domain exhibits restricted flexibility upon phosphopeptide binding, and mutations that increase this flexibility enhance its binding to target phosphoproteins (Takeshita2012Structural). The structural flexibility is influenced by specific residues such as Pro-265, which restricts the orientation of the SH2 domain (Takeshita2012Structural).

## Function
The CBLC gene encodes the CblC protein, which plays a crucial role in the intracellular processing and trafficking of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in human cells. CblC is involved in the early steps of the B12 trafficking pathway, where it catalyzes the removal of the upper axial ligand of cobalamin derivatives, forming intermediates that are converted into active cofactor derivatives, methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) (Mascarenhas2020The). These cofactors are essential for the function of enzymes such as methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which are critical for cellular metabolism (Hannibal2009Processing).

CblC exhibits multiple catalytic activities, including decyanation, dealkylation, denitration, and nitrite reductase activity, processing cobalamins with various upper ligands to a common cob(II)alamin intermediate (Mascarenhas2020The). This intermediate is then directed to the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial branches of the trafficking pathway, facilitating the synthesis of MeCbl and AdoCbl (Mascarenhas2020The). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular metabolism and preventing disorders related to cobalamin deficiency, such as homocystinuria and methylmalonic aciduria (Hannibal2009Processing). CblC is active in the cytoplasm and has been suggested to play a role in mitochondrial delivery of cobalamin cofactors (Gherasim2013The).

## Interactions
CBLC, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, LYN, CRK, SRC, and RET. Upon activation by epidermal growth factor (EGF), CBLC is recruited to EGFR, where it undergoes phosphorylation, leading to the attenuation of MAP kinase signaling. This interaction is crucial for regulating signal transduction pathways (Frankum2015Complementary).

CBLC also plays a role in the ubiquitylation and degradation of the oncoprotein RET, which is significant for controlling cellular proliferation and differentiation. It forms a complex with HIC5 and the heat shock protein HSP27, which is necessary for the ubiquitylation of NOX4, a protein involved in managing reactive oxygen species and stress-induced cellular responses (Frankum2015Complementary).

These interactions suggest that CBLC may have a role in DNA repair through homologous recombination and could be a candidate for a novel tumor suppressor. The interactions of CBLC with these proteins may contribute to the observed sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, although it remains to be determined if these known interactions are responsible for the phenotype or if another unidentified substrate is involved (Frankum2015Complementary).
