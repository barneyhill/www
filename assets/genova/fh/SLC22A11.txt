# SLC22A11

## Overview
SLC22A11 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 11, also known as organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4). This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 22, which is characterized by its role in the transport of organic anions across cell membranes. OAT4 is a transmembrane protein with 12 α-helical domains, facilitating its function in the renal reabsorption of various compounds, including uric acid and steroid sulfate conjugates (Koepsell2013The; Jacobsson2007Identification). It is primarily expressed in the kidney and placenta, where it plays a critical role in detoxification processes and the transport of endogenous and exogenous substances (Yee2021Emerging). Variations in the SLC22A11 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as hyperuricemia and gout, particularly in specific populations, highlighting its significance in human health (Flynn2013Association).

## Structure
The SLC22A11 gene encodes a protein that is part of the solute carrier family 22, specifically functioning as an organic anion transporter. The protein structure is characterized by 12 α-helical transmembrane domains, a common feature among SLC22 family members, which facilitates its role in transporting organic ions across cell membranes (Koepsell2013The; Jacobsson2007Identification). Between the first and second transmembrane domains, there is a large extracellular loop, which is glycosylated and contains conserved cysteines that may form disulfide bridges, potentially playing a role in oligomerization (Koepsell2013The; Volk2013OCTs). An intracellular loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinases, which are involved in the regulation of the protein's function (Volk2013OCTs).

The SLC22A11 protein is involved in the efflux transport across the blood-brain barrier and is expressed in tissues such as the kidney and placenta (Jacobsson2007Identification). Variants of the protein can arise from alternative splicing, which may affect its transport capabilities and function (Koepsell2013The).

## Function
SLC22A11, also known as OAT4, is a member of the human organic anion transporter subfamily within the SLC22 family. It is primarily expressed in the kidney, specifically localized to the apical membrane of the proximal tubule epithelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in renal reabsorption processes (Yee2021Emerging). SLC22A11 is involved in the transport of various compounds, including uric acid, glutamate, and steroid sulfate conjugates like estrone-3 sulfate (E3S), as well as other drugs and toxins (Tust2023SLC22A11).

In healthy human cells, SLC22A11 facilitates the efflux and reabsorption of uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresol sulfate (pCS) by inserting them into the plasma membrane, a mechanism distinct from other transporters like OAT1, which transport these toxins into the cytosol (Tust2023SLC22A11). This membrane insertion may have implications for cellular detoxification processes and the handling of these toxins, which are difficult to remove via dialysis and contribute to chronic kidney disease progression (Tust2023SLC22A11). Additionally, SLC22A11 is present in the human placenta, where it is involved in the removal of sulfated conjugates of steroids from the fetus (Yee2021Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC22A11 gene, which encodes the organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4), have significant clinical implications. Impaired function of OAT4 can lead to increased renal excretion of urate and drugs reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, potentially causing conditions such as hyperuricemia and affecting the clearance of certain medications like the loop diuretic torasemide (Koepsell2013The). In patients with gout, the use of torasemide should be avoided due to its potential to exacerbate hyperuricemia through OAT4-mediated urate reabsorption (Koepsell2013The).

Genetic variations in SLC22A11 have been associated with an increased risk of gout, particularly in Polynesian populations. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the gene have shown significant associations with gout, highlighting the ancestral-specific effects of these genetic variations (Flynn2013Association). The SNP rs17299124, for example, has been strongly associated with gout in less admixed Polynesian groups, suggesting it may influence the expression of nearby genes like SLC22A11 (Flynn2013Association). These findings underscore the importance of considering genetic background in the study of gout and related conditions.

## Interactions
The human gene SLC22A11 encodes the organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4), which is involved in the transport of various endogenous and exogenous organic anions. OAT4 interacts with scaffolding proteins PDZK1 and NHERF1. These interactions are crucial for promoting the surface expression of OAT4 in the plasma membrane, which may be involved in posttranscriptional regulation. The interaction with PDZK1 and NHERF1 is significant as it influences the functional activity of OAT4, affecting its role in reabsorption and secretion processes in the kidney and placenta (Koepsell2013The).

In addition to its interactions with scaffolding proteins, OAT4 is also involved in the transport of uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate. SLC22A11 inserts these toxins into the plasma membrane, a process that may have implications for membrane damage and microvesicle release. This transport mechanism is distinct from that of OAT1, which transports these toxins into the cytosol (Tust2023SLC22A11). These interactions and transport mechanisms highlight the complex role of SLC22A11 in renal physiology and its potential impact on conditions like chronic kidney disease.
