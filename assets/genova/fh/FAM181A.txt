# FAM181A

## Overview
FAM181A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 181 member A, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the nervous system. The FAM181A protein is characterized by its interaction with TEAD transcription factors, adopting an Ω-loop conformation that is crucial for its binding, although it lacks the LxxLF motif found in its paralog, FAM181B. This protein is primarily expressed in neural tissues and is implicated in neural development and function, interacting with components of the cytoskeleton and the Hippo signaling pathway, which is essential for organ size regulation and development (Marks2016Analysis; Bokhovchuk2019Identification). Despite its lower affinity for TEAD compared to other interactors like YAP and TAZ, FAM181A can form transient complexes with TEAD, suggesting a potential role in nervous system development (Bokhovchuk2019Identification). The gene's expression is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and has been associated with conditions such as asthma and colorectal cancer, although its precise function in these contexts remains to be fully elucidated (Wysocki2014Epigenome; Marks2016Analysis).

## Structure
The FAM181A protein is characterized by its interaction with TEAD transcription factors, adopting an Ω-loop conformation similar to that of the YAP protein upon binding. This structural feature is crucial for its interaction with TEAD, as it forms hydrophobic interactions with key residues in TEAD4 (Bokhovchuk2019Identification). The Ω-loop region in FAM181A includes Val190, which corresponds to Val84 in YAP, indicating a conserved structural motif important for binding affinity (Bokhovchuk2019Identification).

FAM181A lacks the LxxLF motif found in FAM181B, which affects its binding characteristics with TEAD (Bokhovchuk2019Identification). The protein is flexible and likely disordered in solution, as suggested by circular dichroism and in silico analysis, which may impact its binding efficiency (Bokhovchuk2019Identification).

In terms of secondary structure, FAM181A primarily presents an Ω-loop segment when interacting with TEADs, which contributes to moderate binding energies due to the entropy penalty associated with its flexibility (Zhang2021Computational). The protein is conserved across vertebrates, with a high degree of similarity to its paralog FAM181B, and both proteins localize predominantly to the nucleus (Marks2016Analysis).

## Function
FAM181A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neural development and function. In mice, Fam181a is primarily expressed in neural tissues and localizes to the nucleus in transiently transfected cells, with weak speckles in the cytoplasm, suggesting a role in neural development (Marks2016Analysis). The protein interacts with MAPRE1/EB1, a microtubule plus-end tracking protein, which is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics crucial for cellular processes such as meiosis and spermatid maturation (Carapito2017Validating).

FAM181A also interacts with TEAD transcription factors, which are part of the Hippo signaling pathway, a critical regulator of organ size and development. Although FAM181A has a lower affinity for TEAD compared to other interactors like YAP and TAZ, it can form transient complexes with TEAD under specific physiological conditions, potentially implicating it in nervous system development (Bokhovchuk2019Identification).

The gene's expression is linked to non-neuronal cell types of the nervous system, with decreasing levels during the differentiation of neural progenitors into neurons, indicating its involvement in early neural development stages (Marks2016Analysis). Despite these insights, the specific function of FAM181A in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
FAM181A has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through mutations, expression alterations, and changes in its interactions. Dysregulation of FAM181A expression has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and 9q34 deletion syndrome, suggesting its significant role in the nervous system (Marks2016Analysis). In the context of asthma, changes in CpG-methylation of the FAM181A locus have been associated with the disease, indicating a potential link between its expression and lung function (Marks2016Analysis). Specifically, decreased methylation of FAM181A has been observed in severe asthma patients, with increased expression noted in male subjects with the condition (Wysocki2014Epigenome). 

In colorectal cancer, FAM181A has been identified with mutations in adenocarcinoma samples, although its specific role in tumorigenesis remains unclear (Zhou2013Exome). The gene's interaction with TEAD transcription factors, part of the Hippo signaling pathway, suggests a potential involvement in cancer, as this pathway is crucial for regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis (Bokhovchuk2019Identification). Despite these associations, the exact function of FAM181A in these conditions is not fully understood, necessitating further research.

## Interactions
FAM181A, a human gene encoding a protein involved in cellular processes, has been identified as a new interactor with TEAD transcription factors, which are part of the Hippo signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for controlling organ size and development, and its deregulation is linked to cancer. FAM181A interacts with TEAD transcription factors through an Ω-loop conformation, similar to the interaction seen with YAP and TAZ, known co-regulators of TEAD. However, unlike FAM181B, FAM181A lacks the LxxLF motif, which is involved in the interaction between FAM181B and TEAD (Bokhovchuk2019Identification).

The interaction between FAM181A and TEAD is specific, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The Asp272Ala mutation in TEAD4 significantly reduces the binding affinity of FAM181A, indicating the specificity of this interaction (Bokhovchuk2019Identification). Despite having a lower affinity for TEAD compared to YAP and TAZ, FAM181A can still form stable complexes with TEAD in cellular environments, as shown in HEK293FT cells (Bokhovchuk2019Identification). These interactions suggest a potential role for FAM181A in nervous system development, although further in vivo studies are needed to fully understand its biological relevance (Bokhovchuk2019Identification).
