# MOSPD1

## Overview
MOSPD1 is a gene that encodes the protein motile sperm domain containing 1, which is primarily involved in the formation of membrane contact sites (MCS) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other organelles. This protein is classified as a type IIc membrane protein due to its transmembrane helices and is characterized by the presence of a motile sperm domain (MSD) that facilitates dynamic protein-protein interactions (Cabukusta2020Human; Thaler2011Mospd1). MOSPD1 plays a crucial role in interorganellar communication, impacting processes such as calcium storage, endosomal trafficking, and lipid transfer (Cabukusta2020Human). It is also involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, particularly influencing mesenchymal and osteoblastic pathways (Thaler2011Mospd1). The protein's interactions with FFNT motifs and its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) further underscore its importance in cellular function and development (James2021The; Thaler2011Mospd1). Additionally, alterations in MOSPD1 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Jiang2024Deciphering; Horie2021Identification).

## Structure
The MOSPD1 protein is characterized by the presence of a motile sperm domain (MSD) spanning amino acids 17 to 112, which is involved in dynamic protein-protein interactions (Thaler2011Mospd1). This domain is highly conserved across species, including humans, chimpanzees, and mice (Thaler2011Mospd1). The protein also contains two transmembrane helices located between amino acids 157 to 179 and 189 to 211, classifying it as a type IIc membrane protein (Cabukusta2020Human; Thaler2011Mospd1). 

A nuclear export sequence (NES) is present in the last small exon, specifically from amino acids 205 to 208, which includes four hydrophobic residues: Leucine, Isoleucine (Leucine in zebrafish), Threonine, and Methionine (Thaler2011Mospd1). This NES is crucial for the protein's localization, as its deletion results in the protein localizing primarily in the nucleus, suggesting a role in nuclear matrix formation and gene expression regulation (Thaler2011Mospd1). 

MOSPD1 is predominantly found in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, but its localization can change to the nucleus if the NES is removed (Thaler2011Mospd1). The protein's expression is regulated during differentiation in mesenchymal cells, with significant changes observed in osteoblastic and mesenchymal gene expression upon MOSPD1 knockdown (Thaler2011Mospd1).

## Function
MOSPD1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, particularly in the formation of membrane contact sites (MCS) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other organelles. These contact sites are crucial for interorganellar communication, which is essential for processes such as calcium storage, endosomal trafficking, and lipid transfer (Cabukusta2020Human). MOSPD1, along with MOSPD3, is characterized as an ER-localized tether protein that interacts with FFAT-related FFNT motifs, forming distinct ER-resident protein complexes (Cabukusta2020Human).

In addition to its role in membrane contact sites, MOSPD1 is involved in the regulation of mesenchymal versus epidermal cell differentiation. It is highly expressed in bone and preosteoblastic cells, where its expression is regulated by cell confluence and differentiation. Knockdown experiments in preosteoblastic cells have shown that reducing MOSPD1 expression leads to a down-regulation of osteoblast-specific genes, indicating its role in osteoblastic differentiation (Thaler2011Mospd1). MOSPD1 also influences the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by modulating the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal genes (Thaler2011Mospd1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MOSPD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer (BC). In CRC, MOSPD1 is identified as a novel target of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, with its expression significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared to non-tumorous tissues. This upregulation is associated with cancer progression, as MOSPD1 expression correlates with β-catenin accumulation, potentially contributing to cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Horie2022Motile; Horie2021Identification).

In breast cancer, MOSPD1 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues, correlating with poor clinical outcomes. High MOSPD1 expression is associated with adverse clinical features and poorer overall survival, making it an independent prognostic marker. The gene's expression influences immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression, suggesting a role in modulating the immune response in BC. Inhibiting MOSPD1 has been shown to reduce tumor growth and enhance sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 therapy, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Jiang2024Deciphering).

These findings highlight MOSPD1's role in cancer progression and its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
MOSPD1, a protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is involved in forming membrane contact sites (MCS) and interacts with proteins containing FFNT motifs, which are distinct from the classical FFAT motifs. MOSPD1, along with MOSPD3, forms a distinct protein complex separate from the VAPA/VAPB/MOSPD2 complex, and these interactions are mediated by their transmembrane regions (Cabukusta2020Human). MOSPD1 interacts with proteins such as CEP85, ANKLE2, ENTR1, and emerin, with the interaction between MOSPD3 and emerin predominantly occurring at the ER (Cabukusta2020Human; James2021The). These interactions are facilitated by the MSP domain of MOSPD1, which prefers FFNT motifs over FFAT motifs (Cabukusta2020Human; James2021The).

MOSPD1 also plays a role in the formation of MCS between the ER and mitochondria through its association with PTPIP51, contributing to interorganellar communication (James2021The). The protein's interactions are crucial for cellular processes such as the reformation of the nuclear envelope during mitosis, where MOSPD3 recruits proteins like ANKLE2 and emerin to facilitate nuclear envelope reassembly (Cabukusta2020Human).
