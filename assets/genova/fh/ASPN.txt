# ASPN

## Overview
Asporin (ASPN) is a gene that encodes the asporin protein, a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family, which plays a crucial role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of various tissues. The asporin protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which contribute to its structural stability and functional interactions with other ECM components. Asporin is involved in regulating cartilage metabolism and homeostasis by modulating the activity of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and interacting with type II collagen and aggrecan (González‐Huerta2015D14; Duval2011Asporin). It also plays a role in mineralization processes, such as those occurring during odontogenic differentiation. The gene's expression is tissue-specific, with notable presence in articular cartilage and absence in the central nervous system (Simkova2016Glycoprotein). Variations in the ASPN gene have been linked to several diseases, including osteoarthritis and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Taipale2017Functional; Basak2021Reciprocal).

## Structure
Asporin (ASPN) is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. The primary structure of ASPN includes a signal peptide and a core region with 12 LRRs, which are 20-29 amino acids long and consist of a highly conserved segment forming a parallel β-sheet, contributing to a super helix arrangement (Simkova2016Glycoprotein; Matsushima2021Sequence). The LRR domains are flanked by cysteine clusters at both the N- and C-termini, which form disulfide bonds that contribute to the stability of the LRR domain (Matsushima2023Structural; Matsushima2021Sequence).

ASPN is distinct from other proteoglycans due to its lack of multiple glycosylation regions, having only one N-glycosylation site at ASN 281 and a potential O-glycosylation site at Ser 54 (Simkova2016Glycoprotein). It features a polymorphic polyaspartate sequence at its N-terminal region, which is involved in calcium binding and regulation of hydroxyapatite formation (Matsushima2021Sequence). ASPN can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The protein's structure allows it to interact with various ligands, including collagens and growth factors, influencing its role in biological processes (Matsushima2023Structural).

## Function
Asporin (ASPN) is a protein encoded by the ASPN gene, belonging to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family, and plays a significant role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of various tissues. In healthy human cells, asporin is involved in cartilage metabolism and homeostasis by interacting with key ECM components such as type II collagen and aggrecan. It binds to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), a crucial factor in cartilage metabolism, and modulates its activity, which is essential for maintaining cartilage structure and function (González‐Huerta2015D14; Duval2011Asporin).

Asporin is expressed in several tissues, including articular cartilage, aorta, uterus, and heart, with moderate expression in the mammary gland and small intestine. It is not expressed in the central nervous system, spleen, and thymus (Simkova2016Glycoprotein). In the ECM, asporin inhibits collagen fibrillogenesis in a dose-dependent manner and competes with decorin for binding sites, which may regulate ECM development (Simkova2016Glycoprotein). Asporin's N-terminal polyaspartate domain binds calcium, contributing to collagen mineralization, and it is involved in the mineralization process during odontogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (Simkova2016Glycoprotein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ASPN gene are associated with several diseases, particularly those affecting the skeletal system and various cancers. In osteoarthritis (OA), ASPN variants, such as the D-repeat polymorphism, have been linked to increased susceptibility, with specific alleles being more prevalent in affected individuals (Taipale2017Functional; Mishra2019Identifying). The ASPN gene is also implicated in developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and acetabular dysplasia (AD), where certain alleles and copy number variations are associated with these conditions (Shi2011Association; Sekimoto2017Copy).

In cancer, ASPN overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in gastric and colorectal cancers, where it promotes tumor progression through interactions with the TGF-β signaling pathway, enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration (Basak2021Reciprocal; Li2019Cytoplasmic). ASPN is also involved in prostate cancer metastasis by regulating the tumor microenvironment and affecting mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation (Hughes2019Asporin). In endometriosis, ASPN expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in immune dysfunction (Wang2022ASPN). These findings highlight ASPN's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
Asporin (ASPN) is known to interact with several key proteins, influencing various biological processes. It binds directly to bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), inhibiting BMP-2-induced cytodifferentiation in periodontal ligament cells. This interaction suggests that ASPN acts as a negative regulator of BMP-2 signaling pathways, affecting mineralization processes (Yamada2007PLAP1Asporin). ASPN also interacts with BMP-4, restricting BMP-4-induced signaling and differentiation in mesenchymal stromal cells, with specific polymorphisms like the D14 variant significantly affecting this interaction (Hughes2019Asporin).

In the context of eye development, ASPN interacts with the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), forming a complex that is crucial for activating the IGF signaling pathway, which is essential for eye formation in Xenopus embryos (Luehders2015The). ASPN also antagonizes signaling pathways involving Nodal, BMP, and Wnt, reducing their activity and thereby influencing developmental processes (Luehders2015The).

In gastric cancer, ASPN interacts with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), potentially activating the canonical TGF-β pathway, which is associated with tumor progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Basak2021Reciprocal). These interactions highlight ASPN's role as a modulator of key signaling pathways in various physiological and pathological contexts.
