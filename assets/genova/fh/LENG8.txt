# LENG8

## Overview
LENG8 is a gene that encodes the protein leukocyte receptor cluster member 8, which is primarily involved in mRNA processing and mitochondrial function in human cells. The LENG8 protein is characterized by its distinct domains, including a topoisomerase II-associated protein region, a Holliday junction recognition protein-associated repeat domain, and an atypical SAC3-subtype of PCI domain, which is crucial for its nuclear localization (Zhao2021LENG8). As a component of the mRNA export machinery, LENG8 interacts with the TREX/THO complex and spliceosome, facilitating the export of mRNA, particularly those encoding mitochondrial proteins, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Zhao2021LENG8). This function is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and cellular energy metabolism. LENG8's role in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and highlights its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and renal conditions (Wang2024Identification; Eadon2021Clinical).

## Structure
The LENG8 protein in humans is composed of three distinct domains: the N-terminal topoisomerase II-associated protein (PAT1) region, a mid-HJURP (Holliday junction recognition protein)-associated repeat domain, and the C-terminal atypical SAC3-subtype of PCI domain (Zhao2021LENG8). The PCI domain is essential for the correct nuclear localization of LENG8, as its absence results in the protein being mislocalized to the cytosol. This domain is characterized by curved helical repeats that culminate in a globular winged helix (WH) subdomain, similar to those found in SAC3 and THP3 proteins (Zhao2021LENG8).

The amino acid sequence of the PCI domain in LENG8 shows a 71% similarity to that of THP3 across all eukaryotes, indicating a high degree of evolutionary conservation (Zhao2021LENG8). LENG8 is predominantly located in the cell nucleus, particularly in nucleosomes and nuclear speckles, and is involved in mRNA export processes (Zhao2021LENG8). The protein interacts with components of the TREX/THO complex and spliceosome, facilitating mRNA processing and export, especially for transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins (Zhao2021LENG8). The study does not provide specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The LENG8 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in mRNA processing and mitochondrial activity in human cells. LENG8 is involved in the nuclear export of mRNA to the cytoplasm, a process essential for proper cellular function. It forms a complex with PCID2, which is necessary for the export of mRNPs from the nucleus, preventing their aberrant accumulation (Zhao2021LENG8). LENG8 preferentially binds mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins, thereby maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. Its depletion leads to mitochondrial network disruption, increased mitochondrial depolarization, and impaired mitochondrial respiration, as evidenced by a reduced oxygen consumption rate (Zhao2021LENG8).

LENG8 interacts with components of the TREX/THO complex and spliceosome, facilitating multi-step pre-mRNA processing. It binds to specific RNA sequences, particularly those encoding proteins located in mitochondria, and is involved in mitochondrial membrane assembly and metabolism (Zhao2021LENG8). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function, highlighting its role in cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism (Zhao2021LENG8). In summary, LENG8 is essential for mRNA export and mitochondrial function, impacting cellular and organismal energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
LENG8 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and mutations. In idiopathic nodular glomerulosclerosis (ING), LENG8 is the most significantly down-regulated gene compared to reference samples, with a log2 fold change of -13.78. Although its function is uncharacterized, it has been associated with prognosis in renal cell carcinoma (Eadon2021Clinical). In prostate cancer, LENG8 is one of the top mutated genes in the TCGA-PRAD dataset, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression and metastasis (Wang2024Identification). 

In cervical cancer, LENG8 is located near HPV integration breakpoints, which may lead to genomic instability, although specific expression changes in LENG8 were not observed (Zhou2022Long-read). In pancreatic β-cells, LENG8 shows decreased methylation compared to other tissues, indicating a potential role in tissue-specific functions (Karaglani2022TissueSpecific). Despite these associations, the precise clinical implications of LENG8 mutations or expression changes remain unclear, necessitating further research to elucidate its role in disease.

## Interactions
LENG8 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, particularly in the context of mRNA processing. It has been shown to interact with components of the TREX/THO complex, including THOC1, THOC5, and THOC6, through RNA-dependent interactions. These interactions suggest a role for LENG8 in mRNA processing and export (Zhao2021LENG8). LENG8 also co-localizes with THOC1, ALYREF, and THOC5, further supporting its involvement in mRNA processing pathways (Zhao2021LENG8).

RNA immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (RIP-Seq) has demonstrated that LENG8 binds to a large number of transcripts, with a preference for mRNAs encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial functions. Notably, LENG8 and THOC1 bind with high confidence to VDAC1 and VDAC2 mRNAs, indicating a role in mRNA export related to mitochondrial activity (Zhao2021LENG8). The interactions of LENG8 with these mRNA processing factors highlight its function as a platform for multi-step pre-mRNA processing, distinct from the roles of other components like THOC1 (Zhao2021LENG8).
