# MAGEB18

## Overview
MAGEB18 is a gene that encodes the protein MAGE family member B18, which is part of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family. This family is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including the regulation of ubiquitination through interactions with E3 RING ubiquitin ligases, forming MAGE-RING ligases (MRLs). The MAGEB18 protein specifically interacts with the LNX1 protein, contributing to the ubiquitination process that is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Lee2017A). While MAGEB18 has been implicated in cancer, particularly in breast cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, its precise role and mechanisms remain under investigation (Zuo2019Xchromosome; Jia2019Prognostic). Further research is needed to elucidate its functions and potential as a biomarker in oncology (Lian2018Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
MAGEB18, a member of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family, has been implicated in various cancer types due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, high mRNA expression levels of MAGEB18 are associated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with luminal B and TP53-mutated breast cancer subtypes, suggesting a negative prognostic impact in these contexts (Jia2019Prognostic). Conversely, in mesenchymal stem-like breast cancer, MAGEB18 expression is linked to a better prognosis, indicating that its clinical significance may vary depending on the breast cancer subtype (Jia2019Prognostic).

The gene's expression is also associated with different breast cancer subtypes, including immunomodulatory and luminal androgen receptor subtypes, where it is moderately linked to worse RFS (Jia2019Prognostic). Despite these associations, the specific function of MAGEB18 in cancer remains largely unexplored, necessitating further research to understand its role fully (Jia2019Prognostic).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a SNP located near MAGEB18 showed a protective effect in females, suggesting potential gender-specific genetic susceptibility (Zuo2019Xchromosome). These findings highlight the complex role of MAGEB18 in cancer prognosis and its potential as a biomarker.

## Interactions
MAGEB18, a member of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family, is known to interact with E3 RING ubiquitin ligases to form MAGE-RING ligases (MRLs). These interactions enhance the ligase activity, specify novel substrates for ubiquitination, and alter subcellular locations. MAGEB18 specifically interacts with the LNX1 protein, forming the MAGE-B18-LNX1 complex. This interaction occurs via the MAGE homology domain (MHD) of MAGEB18, which binds to a basic region between the RING and first PDZ domain of LNX1 (Lee2017A).

The MAGEB18-LNX1 complex is part of the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for various cellular activities, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. These interactions can regulate the ubiquitination of proteins, potentially affecting tumorigenesis (Li2021Pathogenicity). Despite these known interactions, MAGEB18 is not well characterized in terms of its specific roles in cancer, and further research is needed to fully understand its functions and interactions in cellular processes (Lian2018Epigenetic).
