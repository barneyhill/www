# TRPM1

## Overview
The TRPM1 gene encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 1, a protein that functions as a nonselective cation channel. This protein is a member of the transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) subfamily and is characterized by its six transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in various physiological processes, including vision and pigmentation. TRPM1 is predominantly expressed in the retina and melanocytes, where it plays a critical role in the visual signaling pathway of ON-bipolar cells and is associated with melanin content, respectively. The protein's function is modulated through interactions with other proteins and G-protein subunits, which influence its channel activity. Clinically, mutations in the TRPM1 gene are linked to conditions such as autosomal-recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness and melanoma-associated retinopathy, underscoring its importance in both visual and pigmentation pathways (Koike2009TRPM1; Audo2009TRPM1; Brożyna2017TRPM1).

## Structure
The TRPM1 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) subfamily, characterized by its structure comprising six transmembrane domains and a large cytosolic domain. It forms nonselective cation channels permeable to Ca2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ (Jimenez2020TRPM; Koike2009TRPM1). The protein is composed of four six-transmembrane domain subunits, which can assemble into homomeric or heteromeric channels (Jimenez2020TRPM). The N-terminal region contains melastatin homology regions and a pre-S1 domain, which are involved in external stimuli sensing and channel assembly (Jimenez2020TRPM). The C-terminal domain (CTD) is involved in channel stability and subunit interactions, and it is directly inhibited by Gβγ subunits, suggesting regulation by GPCRs (Huang2020A).

TRPM1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with varying N-terminal lengths, such as 70+TRPM1, 92+TRPM1, and 109+TRPM1, which may influence its function (Oancea2009TRPM1). These isoforms are expressed in tissues like the retina, brain, and melanocytes, and are associated with melanin content (Oancea2009TRPM1). The TRPM1 gene also encodes a microRNA, miR-211, located between exons 6 and 7, which is co-expressed with TRPM1 (Jimenez2020TRPM).

## Function
TRPM1, a member of the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M, plays a significant role in various physiological processes, particularly in the visual and pigmentation systems. In the retina, TRPM1 is crucial for the function of ON-bipolar cells, where it acts as a nonselective cation channel involved in the mGluR6 signaling cascade. This channel is essential for the depolarizing response to light, facilitating the transmission of visual signals from photoreceptors to bipolar cells (Koike2009TRPM1; Martemyanov2017The). TRPM1 is localized to the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells, where it interacts with mGluR6 and other proteins to form a complex that is vital for proper visual signal processing (Schneider2015Properties).

In melanocytes, TRPM1 is associated with melanin content and pigmentation. It forms ion channels that are more permeable to Na+ than Ca2+, and its expression correlates with melanin concentration. A reduction in TRPM1 expression is linked to decreased melanin content, suggesting its role in melanin storage and release rather than production (Oancea2009TRPM1). TRPM1's intracellular localization, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggests it may also be involved in ER-related processes such as protein folding (Agosto2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRPM1 gene are primarily associated with autosomal-recessive complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB). This condition is characterized by a dysfunction in the ON bipolar cells of the retina, leading to impaired night vision. Patients with cCSNB exhibit a severely reduced rod b-wave amplitude in electroretinography (ERG) tests, indicative of ON bipolar cell dysfunction (Audo2009TRPM1). Various mutations in TRPM1, including missense, nonsense, and splice-site mutations, have been identified in individuals with cCSNB, disrupting normal signal transmission from photoreceptors to bipolar cells (Audo2009TRPM1).

In addition to its role in cCSNB, TRPM1 is implicated in melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR), a paraneoplastic syndrome linked to cutaneous malignant melanoma. In this condition, TRPM1 autoantibodies disrupt retinal function, leading to symptoms such as night blindness and reduced contrast sensitivity (Duvoisin2019TRPM1). TRPM1 expression is also a predictor of survival in melanoma patients, with its loss associated with worse outcomes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Brożyna2017TRPM1). In Appaloosa horses, TRPM1 downregulation is linked to both congenital stationary night blindness and coat color changes, highlighting its role in pigmentation and visual function (Bellone2008Differential).

## Interactions
TRPM1 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes crucial for its function in retinal ON-bipolar cells. It is part of a multi-protein complex involving nyctalopin, a small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan, which is essential for the correct localization of TRPM1. Nyctalopin directly interacts with TRPM1 and mGluR6, forming a complex that is vital for signal transduction in these cells (Schneider2015Properties; Cao2011TRPM1). 

TRPM1 also interacts with G-protein subunits, specifically Gαo and Gβγ, which modulate its channel activity. Gαo binds to both the N- and C-termini of TRPM1, while Gβγ interacts with the N-terminus. These interactions are crucial for the gating of TRPM1 channels, with Gβγ playing a role in closing the channel (Xu2016The). 

Additionally, TRPM1 is involved in complexes with GPR179, which helps localize RGS proteins to the dendritic tips, influencing the mGluR6 cascade's ability to gate TRPM1 channels (Schneider2015Properties). The interaction with LRIT3 is also significant, as LRIT3 facilitates the insertion of TRPM1 into the postsynaptic membrane, highlighting a transsynaptic mechanism (Hasan2019Presynaptic).
