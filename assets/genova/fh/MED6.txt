# MED6

## Overview
MED6 is a gene that encodes the protein Mediator complex subunit 6, a critical component of the eukaryotic transcription machinery. The protein is part of the head module of the Mediator complex, which is essential for the regulation of gene expression by facilitating the interaction between RNA polymerase II and various transcription factors. MED6 plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the pre-initiation complex, thereby promoting transcription initiation (Youn2016Regulation; Napoli2012Unraveling). The structural conservation of MED6 across species, from yeast to humans, underscores its fundamental role in transcriptional regulation (Myers1998The). As a subunit of the Mediator complex, MED6 is involved in various biological processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating transcriptional signals (Napoli2012Unraveling).

## Structure
The MED6 protein is a component of the human Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. The primary structure of MED6 consists of a sequence of amino acids that is conserved across species, as evidenced by sequence alignment with the yeast Med6 protein, highlighting regions of similarity and divergence (Rengachari2021Structure). The secondary structure of MED6 includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which are essential for its three-dimensional conformation (Rengachari2021Structure).

In terms of tertiary structure, MED6 forms part of the 'neck' region within the head module of the human Mediator complex, interacting with other subunits to maintain the structural integrity of the complex (Rengachari2021Structure). The quaternary structure involves its integration into the Mediator head module, where it interacts with RNA polymerase II and other transcription factors, facilitating transcription initiation (Rengachari2021Structure).

The structural conservation of MED6 from yeast to humans suggests a similar functional role in higher organisms, indicating its importance in the transcriptional machinery (Myers1998The). Specific post-translational modifications or splice variants of MED6 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
MED6 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, a critical component of the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery in eukaryotic cells. It is part of the head module of the Mediator complex, which is essential for the initiation of mRNA synthesis and cell viability. The head module, including MED6, interacts directly with RNA polymerase II, facilitating the assembly and stabilization of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) and promoting transcription initiation (Youn2016Regulation; Napoli2012Unraveling).

MED6 plays a role in maintaining the structure and function of the Mediator complex, which acts as an adaptor between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of gene expression, as it helps shift the transcription machinery between active and inactive states (Youn2016Regulation). The head module's integrity, to which MED6 contributes, is vital for the proper functioning of the entire Mediator complex, as its disruption can lead to the release of other modules from transcriptionally active promoters (Napoli2012Unraveling).

In healthy human cells, MED6, as part of the head module, is involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating transcriptional signals (Napoli2012Unraveling).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MED6 is a subunit of the human Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. Within the Mediator complex, MED6 is part of the Head module and engages in an extensive network of interactions with other subunits. It interacts with conserved subunits such as MED8, MED11, MED17, MED18, MED20, and MED22, forming a network similar to that observed in yeast. MED6 also interacts with MED19, which is located near the Head-Middle interface, highlighting its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the complex (Tsai2014Subunit).

In yeast, MED6 is essential for transcriptional activation and is part of the mediator-RNA polymerase II complex. A temperature-sensitive mutation in MED6 results in reduced association with the holo-polymerase complex, affecting transcriptional activation capabilities. This mutation does not disrupt the association of other mediator components, indicating a specific role for MED6 in transcriptional activation (Lee1997A). The mutation also affects the holo-polymerase's ability to stimulate basal transcription and respond to activator proteins, underscoring MED6's importance in transcriptional regulation (Lee1997A).
