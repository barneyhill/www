# VMO1

## Overview
The VMO1 gene encodes the vitelline membrane outer layer 1 homolog protein, which is primarily recognized for its role in ocular health. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its involvement in maintaining the stability of the tear film, a critical component for protecting the ocular surface. VMO1 achieves this by interacting with lysozyme C (LYSC), a major tear protein, in a manner that enhances tear film stability without imparting antibacterial properties (Wang2014Vitelline). The gene's expression and the protein's function have been implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including ocular surface health, cancer, respiratory conditions, and neurological disorders (Denisov2019Gene; Sirkis2023Singlecell; Koneva2018HPV; Chen2024Singlecell). Despite its diverse roles, the precise mechanisms by which VMO1 influences these conditions remain an active area of research.

## Function
The VMO1 (vitelline membrane outer layer 1 homolog) protein plays a significant role in maintaining tear film stability, which is crucial for ocular surface health. VMO1 interacts with lysozyme c (LYSC) in a dose-dependent manner, forming specific hydrogen bonds that do not involve the active center of LYSC. This interaction does not confer antibacterial properties to VMO1, as it does not inhibit bacterial growth in tests with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (Wang2014Vitelline).

VMO1 influences the wettability of hydrophobic surfaces, such as Teflon, by reducing the contact angle of tears, which indicates a reduction in surface tension. This property contributes to the stabilization of the tear film, as demonstrated by longer tear break-up times (TBUTs) and increased tear film retention in VMO1-treated eyes compared to controls in mouse models (Wang2014Vitelline). The presence of VMO1 in high concentrations in camel tears suggests its role in maintaining tear film stability in harsh environments, potentially due to its interaction with other tear proteins (Wang2014Vitelline). These findings highlight the importance of VMO1 in ocular surface health, particularly in conditions like dry eye, where tear protein alteration is common (Wang2014Vitelline).

## Clinical Significance
The VMO1 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and potential mutations. In the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), VMO1 is suggested as a novel driver for HPV-positive cases, indicating its potential role in cancer development (Koneva2018HPV). In bronchial lesions, specifically individual basal cell hyperplasia (iBCH), VMO1 is noted to be underexpressed compared to other bronchial lesions, suggesting a possible involvement in respiratory conditions (Denisov2019Gene).

In the realm of neurological disorders, VMO1 is identified as a marker gene in nonclassical monocytes, showing significant differential expression in familial tauopathy, which may indicate its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (Sirkis2023Singlecell). Additionally, VMO1 is associated with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) as a DUX4 target gene, which may suggest a role in muscular disorders (Chen2024Singlecell).

While these studies highlight the potential clinical significance of VMO1, specific details on the gene's mutations or direct clinical implications remain limited, necessitating further research to fully elucidate its role in these conditions.

## Interactions
The vitelline membrane outer layer 1 homolog (VMO1) protein is known to interact with lysozyme C (LYSC), a significant tear protein. This interaction has been demonstrated through various assays, including dot blot, His pull-down, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot techniques. These studies have shown that VMO1 binds to LYSC in a dose-dependent manner, with specific amino acids in VMO1 forming hydrogen bonds with LYSC. The binding energy conformation score for VMO1 and LYSC was significantly higher than for VMO1 with other proteins, indicating a strong interaction between these two proteins (Wang2014Vitelline).

In addition to its interaction with LYSC, VMO1 has been studied for its role in tear film stability. It has been shown to decrease the contact angle of tears on Teflon, indicating a reduction in surface tension, and to increase the stability of tear film in mice. This is evidenced by longer tear break-up times (TBUTs) and increased corneal fluorescein retention, suggesting that VMO1 contributes to tear film stability through its interactions with other tear proteins (Wang2014Vitelline).
