# ZNF423

## Overview
ZNF423 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 423, a multifunctional transcription factor characterized by its 30 C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains facilitate the protein's interaction with DNA and various transcription factors, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction pathways. Zinc finger protein 423 is involved in several biological processes, including olfactory gene regulation, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, and sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, which are essential for cellular differentiation and development (Mesuraca2015ZNF423; Hamilton2020ZNF423). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as SMAD proteins and the Notch1 intracellular domain, underscore its importance in neural development and adipocyte differentiation (Masserdotti2010ZFP423; Mesuraca2015ZNF423). ZNF423's clinical significance is highlighted by its involvement in various diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers, where its expression and mutations can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Casoni2017Zfp423/ZNF423; Liu2017Breast).

## Structure
ZNF423 is a zinc finger protein characterized by its 30 C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are organized into clusters that facilitate DNA binding and interactions with various transcription factors (Hamilton2020ZNF423). These zinc fingers are arranged in specific clusters, with ZF28-30 interacting with Early B-cell Factor (EBF) family factors, ZF14-19 and ZF9-13 binding Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling-dependent SMAD proteins, and ZF3-8 interacting with centrosomal protein CEP290 during DNA damage response (Casoni2017Zfp423/ZNF423; Hamilton2020ZNF423).

The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by zinc ions coordinating with cysteine and histidine residues, typical of C2H2 zinc finger motifs. A novel C4-like zinc finger motif, located between ZF25 and ZF26, is a conserved feature across ZNF423 homologs and resembles the treble clef fold group zinc fingers (Hamilton2020ZNF423). This motif is not commonly annotated by motif algorithms, indicating its unique structural role (Hamilton2020ZNF423).

ZNF423 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. The protein also exists in different splice variant isoforms, which may influence its role in various cellular processes (Hamilton2020ZNF423).

## Function
ZNF423, also known as Olf-1/Ebf1-associated zinc finger protein, is a nuclear protein characterized by its 30 Krüppel-like zinc finger motifs. It plays a significant role in various molecular processes, including transcriptional regulation and DNA binding. ZNF423 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of olfactory-specific genes by binding to OLF-1/EBF1, thereby inhibiting the formation of transcriptionally active EBF1 homodimers (Mesuraca2015ZNF423). 

In the context of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, ZNF423 forms complexes with SMAD1 and SMAD4, which activate BMP target genes. This interaction also induces SMAD6, creating a regulatory loop that modulates BMP signaling (Mesuraca2015ZNF423). ZNF423 is crucial for adipocyte progenitor differentiation by activating PPARγ genes, essential for preadipogenic factors, with its activity enhanced by BMP4 (Mesuraca2015ZNF423).

ZNF423 is also implicated in the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, where it is essential for the proper translocation of Smoothened to the primary cilium, a critical step for effective Shh signaling (Hong2016Zfp423). Additionally, ZNF423 interacts with the NOTCH1 intracellular domain to upregulate Hes5 expression, integrating BMP and Notch signaling pathways, which are vital for neural development (Masserdotti2010ZFP423).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ZNF423 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), aberrant expression of ZNF423 is associated with the progression from the chronic phase to blast crisis, particularly in B-cell lineages. This suggests that ZNF423 may contribute to the malignant transformation of BCR/ABL-positive cells, enhancing the aggressiveness of the disease (Miyazaki2009Enhanced).

ZNF423 is also linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy characterized by brain malformations. Mutations in ZNF423 can lead to cerebellar hypoplasia and other developmental defects due to its role in DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation in neuronal progenitors (Casoni2017Zfp423/ZNF423).

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), ZNF423 is abnormally up-regulated, leading to a block in B cell differentiation. This is associated with poor outcomes in ETV6-RUNX1-negative B precursor ALL patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Harder2013Aberrant).

Additionally, ZNF423 has been implicated in breast cancer chemoprevention. Variants in ZNF423 can influence the response to selective estrogen receptor modulators, affecting the expression of BRCA1 and potentially guiding individualized prevention strategies (Liu2017Breast).

## Interactions
ZNF423 is a multifunctional transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It is known to interact with Early B-cell Factor 1 (EBF1), where it inhibits EBF1's transcriptional activation of olfactory-specific genes by preventing the formation of transcriptionally active EBF1 homodimers. This interaction is mediated by the last three zinc fingers of ZNF423 and the HLH domain of EBF1 (Mesuraca2015ZNF423).

ZNF423 also forms complexes with SMAD1 and SMAD4 in response to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, activating BMP target genes and inducing SMAD6 transcription, which regulates BMP signaling (Mesuraca2015ZNF423). It interacts with the Notch1 intracellular domain, leading to the upregulation of Hes5, a regulator of neuronal differentiation (Harder2014ZNF423:).

In the context of neuroblastoma, ZNF423 acts as a co-activator of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoic X receptor (RXR) complex, influencing retinoic acid-induced differentiation (Bond2018ZNF423:). ZNF423 also interacts with Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) during the DNA damage response, highlighting its role in DNA repair processes (Hamilton2020ZNF423).
