# SORCS2

## Overview
SORCS2 is a gene that encodes the sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 2, a type I transmembrane receptor that is part of the VPS10p domain receptor family. This receptor plays a pivotal role in neuronal viability and function, particularly in the context of synaptic signaling and plasticity. The SorCS2 protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a large N-terminal β-propeller, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains, and a SorCS membrane proximal domain, facilitating its interactions with various ligands such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and proneurotrophins (Leloup2018Structural). Functionally, SORCS2 is involved in the intracellular sorting and trafficking of neurotrophic factors and synaptic proteins, influencing processes critical for learning and memory (Gospodinova2021Loss). Clinically, alterations in SORCS2 expression or function have been associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, schizophrenia, and Huntington's disease, underscoring its importance in maintaining neuronal health and preventing neurodegenerative processes (Olsen2021Altered; Salašová2021SorCS2).

## Structure
SORCS2 is a type I transmembrane receptor and part of the VPS10p domain receptor family, which plays a crucial role in neuronal viability and function. The molecular structure of the SorCS2 protein includes several distinct domains. It features a large N-terminal ten-bladed β-propeller, which serves as a ligand-binding platform, and two 10CC domains (10CC-a and 10CC-b) that interact with the bottom face of the β-propeller (Leloup2018Structural). Additionally, SorCS2 contains two polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains with an FN-III topology and a C-terminal membrane proximal domain termed SorCS membrane proximal (SoMP), which adopts a fold similar to an RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) (Leloup2018Structural).

The protein forms a cross-braced homodimer, with five out of six domains contributing to dimer formation, except for 10CC-a (Leloup2018Structural). The dimerization interface involves a significant buried surface area, facilitating interactions with nerve growth factor (NGF) and other ligands (Leloup2018Structural). SorCS2 exhibits structural plasticity, undergoing conformational changes upon ligand binding, which is crucial for its function in neuronal signaling (Leloup2018Structural). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its ligand interactions (Leloup2018Structural).

## Function
SORCS2 is a member of the VPS10p-domain receptor family, which plays a crucial role in intracellular sorting and trafficking of neurotrophic factors, transmembrane receptors, and synaptic proteins. In healthy human cells, SORCS2 is primarily expressed in neurons, where it is involved in neuronal signaling and synaptic function. It is located at the post-synaptic density of dendrites and within synaptic vesicles in the hippocampus, contributing to synaptic tagging and the maintenance of synaptic potentiation (Gospodinova2021Loss).

SORCS2 interacts with the BDNF receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkB, and the pro-BDNF receptor p75 NTR, implicating it in NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation and depression, which are critical for learning and memory processes (Gospodinova2021Loss). The protein also plays a role in the trafficking of NMDA receptor subunits to dendritic and synaptic surfaces, influencing synaptic plasticity and cognitive function (Gospodinova2021Loss).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, SORCS2 is involved in the intracellular transport of the glutamate and cysteine transporter EAAT3, providing protection from oxidative stress and epilepsy-induced cell death (Shkurnikov2019LAMA4Regulating). This function highlights its importance in maintaining neuronal health and preventing neurodegenerative processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SORCS2 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In the context of ADHD, SORCS2-deficient mice exhibit ADHD-like behaviors, such as hyperactivity and altered responses to dopaminergic drugs, suggesting that changes in SORCS2 expression could contribute to ADHD in humans (Olsen2021Altered). The gene is also associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as it plays a role in dopaminergic system regulation and synaptic plasticity (Olsen2021Altered).

In Huntington's disease, mutations in SORCS2 have been identified as potential genetic modifiers, exacerbating disease symptoms through impaired BDNF-TrkB signaling and disrupted synaptic activity (Salašová2021SorCS2). SORCS2 is also involved in epilepsy, where its loss leads to increased oxidative stress and neuronal damage, highlighting its protective role against epilepsy-induced pathology (Malik2019SorCS2).

Additionally, SORCS2 is linked to increased DNA double-strand breaks in neurons, which may affect genomic stability and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases (Gospodinova2021Loss). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SORCS2 in various disorders involving dopaminergic and glutamatergic dysregulation.

## Interactions
SORCS2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in neuronal signaling and development. It forms a complex with nerve growth factor (NGF), where it binds NGF dimers in a 2:4 stoichiometry, involving a cross-braced homodimer structure of the SorCS2 ectodomain. This interaction is crucial for synaptic plasticity and apoptotic signaling (Leloup2018Structural). SORCS2 also interacts with proneurotrophins like proNGF and proBDNF, sharing a common binding site on the β-propeller domain of SorCS2 (Leloup2018Structural).

SORCS2 is involved in a co-receptor-ligand-receptor model with p75NTR and proNGF, where proNGF induces separation between SorCS2 and p75NTR, triggering signaling pathways (Leloup2018Structural). It also binds progranulin (PGRN) with high affinity, which is essential for motor neuron development and axon outgrowth (Thomasen2023SorCS2).

In the context of synaptic function, SORCS2 interacts with TrkB and GluN2B, regulating neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. This interaction is particularly relevant in the progression of Huntington's disease, where SORCS2 modulates TrkB activation and GluN2B function (Salašová2021SorCS2).
