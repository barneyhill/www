# ALDH1L1

## Overview
The ALDH1L1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1, which is a key player in folate metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydrogenase and is involved in the conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and CO2, a critical step in the regulation of one-carbon units in cellular biosynthetic pathways (Krupenko2019The). ALDH1L1 is predominantly expressed in the liver and brain, where it contributes to nucleotide synthesis, energy metabolism, and the detoxification of formate (Sasaki2023Onecarbon; Krupenko2019The). The protein's structure is modular, comprising three functional domains that facilitate its enzymatic activity (Horita2017Modeling). ALDH1L1's interactions with other proteins, such as those involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, underscore its role in protein degradation and cellular homeostasis (Khan2018CHIP). Clinically, alterations in ALDH1L1 expression are linked to various diseases, including cancer and neural tube defects, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Wu2016Association; Chen2011Decreased).

## Structure
The ALDH1L1 protein is a complex enzyme involved in folate metabolism, characterized by a modular structure consisting of three distinct functional domains: the N-terminal formyltransferase domain, the intermediate acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain, and the C-terminal aldehyde dehydrogenase domain (Horita2017Modeling; Tsybovsky2022Structure). The N-terminal domain binds the folate substrate and is structurally similar to methionine-tRNA formyltransferase (Horita2017Modeling). The intermediate domain contains a 4′-phosphopantetheine (4-PP) prosthetic group, which acts as a flexible arm transferring intermediates between the catalytic domains (Horita2017Modeling; Tsybovsky2022Structure). The C-terminal domain is a structural and functional homolog of aldehyde dehydrogenases, containing critical catalytic residues, including Cys707 (Horita2017Modeling; Tsybovsky2022Structure).

The protein functions as a homotetramer, with each monomeric subunit having a modular organization (Horita2017Modeling). The tetrameric state is crucial for its catalytic function, allowing the intermediate domain to transfer formyl groups between catalytic domains of different protomers (Tsybovsky2022Structure). The structure is characterized by highly mobile N-terminal domains and large interfaces between the C-terminal and intermediate domains (Tsybovsky2022Structure). The protein's flexibility is essential for its function, facilitating the transport of substrates between domains (Horita2017Modeling).

## Function
The ALDH1L1 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in folate metabolism, specifically in the conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate (THF) and CO2. This reaction is NADP+-dependent and is essential for regulating the flow of one-carbon groups through biosynthetic pathways, impacting nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis, as well as methylation processes (Sharma2022SexSpecific; Krupenko2019The). ALDH1L1 is highly expressed in the liver, where it constitutes about 1% of the total cytosolic protein in hepatocytes, and is also present in the brain (Sasaki2023Onecarbon; Krupenko2019The).

In healthy cells, ALDH1L1 contributes to the regulation of nucleotide synthesis and energy metabolism, maintaining cellular homeostasis (Sasaki2023Onecarbon). It also plays a role in the formate degradation pathway, converting toxic formate to CO2, which is the only pathway in humans for metabolizing formate (Krupenko2019The). The enzyme's activity influences mitochondrial metabolism by affecting serine and glycine levels, and it is involved in the regulation of methylation-related metabolites, such as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) (Sasaki2023Onecarbon; Sharma2022SexSpecific). ALDH1L1's function as a folate depot and its regulatory role in folate and purine pools are crucial for cellular processes (Krupenko2019The).

## Clinical Significance
The ALDH1L1 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or mutations. In cancer, ALDH1L1 is frequently downregulated, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its reduced expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Krupenko2021Knockout; Chen2011Decreased). This downregulation is often linked to hypermethylation of the gene's promoter region, a common mechanism in several cancers, including breast cancer and liver cancer (Beniaminov2018Deep; Krupenko2019The). The loss of ALDH1L1 expression in cancer cells is thought to provide a metabolic advantage, promoting rapid proliferation and tumor growth (Krupenko2021Knockout).

In addition to cancer, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ALDH1L1 have been associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) in the Chinese Han population, suggesting a role in embryonic development (Wu2016Association). Certain SNPs in the gene are also linked to altered cancer risk and metabolic responses, highlighting the gene's significance in various pathological conditions (Krupenko2019The). The gene's involvement in folate metabolism further underscores its potential impact on diseases related to one-carbon metabolism pathways (Williams2014GenomeWide).

## Interactions
ALDH1L1, a folate-metabolizing enzyme, interacts with several proteins, particularly in the context of its ubiquitination and degradation. It is a target for proteasomal degradation, interacting with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, including eight subunits of the proteasome, four ubiquitin hydrolases, and the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CHIP (Khan2018CHIP). CHIP is identified as the E3 ligase responsible for the ubiquitination of ALDH1L1, facilitating its degradation. This interaction is crucial, as silencing CHIP halts ALDH1L1 degradation, while its overexpression promotes it (Khan2018CHIP).

HSP90 is another significant interacting protein, potentially acting as a scaffold to facilitate the interaction between ALDH1L1 and CHIP. This is supported by the co-purification of HSP90 with ALDH1L1 and CHIP (Khan2018CHIP). ALDH1L1 also interacts with phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, which are involved in the dephosphorylation of cofilin, a process that affects cell motility and actin dynamics (Oleinik2010ALDH1L1). These interactions highlight ALDH1L1's role in cellular processes such as protein degradation and actin cytoskeleton regulation. There is no mention of ALDH1L1 interacting with nucleic acids in the provided context.
