# TMCO1

## Overview
TMCO1 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 1 (TMCO1) protein, which is a critical component of cellular calcium homeostasis mechanisms. The TMCO1 protein is a transmembrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in the regulation of calcium ion (Ca2+) concentrations within the ER. It functions as a calcium leak channel, preventing the overfilling of ER calcium stores and maintaining cellular calcium balance through a Ca2+-load activated Ca2+ (CLAC) mechanism (BatchelorRegan2021From; Sun2018TMCO1). TMCO1 is part of the Oxa1 superfamily and plays a role in the biogenesis of multi-pass membrane proteins, acting as an insertase and intramembrane chaperone (McGilvray2021An). Mutations in the TMCO1 gene are linked to cerebro-facio-thoracic dysplasia, a rare genetic disorder, and have implications in other conditions such as primary open-angle glaucoma (BatchelorRegan2021From; Tender2018Cerebrofaciothoracic). The protein's ability to switch oligomeric states in response to calcium levels is essential for its function, highlighting its importance in cellular health and disease prevention (Zhang2021Expression).

## Structure
The TMCO1 protein is a transmembrane protein located primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in calcium homeostasis. It is composed of 188 amino acids and is highly conserved across species, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function (BatchelorRegan2021From; Zhang2021Expression). The protein's structure includes two or three transmembrane domains, with some studies suggesting a topology of two transmembrane domains and a hydrophobic segment, while others propose three transmembrane domains with a luminal N-terminus and a cytosolic-facing coiled coil (BatchelorRegan2021From; McGilvray2021An).

TMCO1 is part of the Oxa1 superfamily and is involved in the biogenesis of multi-pass membrane proteins, functioning as an insertase and intramembrane chaperone (McGilvray2021An). The protein can switch its oligomeric state in response to calcium concentration changes, existing as a dimer under resting conditions and forming a tetrameric channel when calcium is overloaded (Zhang2021Expression). The negative charge of the pore-lining residue D140 is crucial for calcium permeation, and mutations in this residue can disrupt its function (BatchelorRegan2021From). The TMCO1 protein is also associated with the ribosome-Sec61 complex, suggesting a role in co-translational processes at the ER membrane (McGilvray2021An).

## Function
The TMCO1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a calcium (Ca2+) leak channel located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis by preventing the overfilling of ER Ca2+ stores, which is essential for various cellular processes (BatchelorRegan2021From; Sun2018TMCO1). TMCO1 operates through a Ca2+-load activated Ca2+ (CLAC) mechanism, where increased ER Ca2+ concentrations trigger its oligomerization into homotetramers, facilitating Ca2+ leak to restore resting ER Ca2+ levels (BatchelorRegan2021From).

In healthy cells, TMCO1 plays a critical role in regulating Ca2+ signaling, which is vital for processes such as ER protein synthesis, membrane lipid biogenesis, and signaling pathways like store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) (BatchelorRegan2021From). TMCO1 is also involved in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function, where its deficiency can lead to ER stress, impaired lipid droplet formation, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Wang2019ER). Proper functioning of TMCO1 is essential for maintaining cellular health and preventing conditions such as ER stress, increased reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis (BatchelorRegan2021From).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMCO1 gene are associated with cerebro-facio-thoracic dysplasia (CFTD), also known as TMCO1 defect syndrome. This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by craniofacial dysmorphism, skeletal anomalies, and intellectual disability. Specific mutations, such as a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.139_140delAG/p.Ser47*) and a nonsense mutation (p.Arg87*), have been identified in various populations, including the Amish and Turkish families, leading to these clinical manifestations (BatchelorRegan2021From; Tender2018Cerebrofaciothoracic).

TMCO1 mutations can result in a complete loss of function, contributing to the pathophysiology of the syndrome. Clinical features include low anterior hairline, low-set ears, brachycephaly, and developmental delays. Additional symptoms may include epilepsy, vertebral anomalies, and behavioral problems (BatchelorRegan2021From). The gene has also been linked to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) through risk alleles, although these are not located in coding regions (BatchelorRegan2021From).

In some cases, TMCO1 mutations have been associated with broader neurodevelopmental impacts, including ventricle abnormalities and cerebellar defects, as observed in brain imaging studies (Ratnayake2022Brain). The TMCO1 protein's role in calcium homeostasis is crucial, and its dysfunction can lead to ER stress and related pathophysiological conditions (BatchelorRegan2021From).

## Interactions
TMCO1 is involved in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the transcription factor RUNX2 in osteoblasts, where it stabilizes RUNX2 by promoting its acetylation, thus protecting it from Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining RUNX2 stability and osteoblast function (Li2019TMCO1mediated).

TMCO1 also forms part of a ribosome-associated complex involved in the biogenesis of multi-pass membrane proteins. This complex includes components such as Sec61, TMEM147, CCDC47, and NOMO, which are organized around the ribosome exit tunnel. TMCO1, along with TMEM147, forms a lipid-filled cavity that facilitates the insertion of hydrophobic segments into the membrane, indicating its role in co-translational processes at the ER membrane (McGilvray2021An).

In breast cancer cells, TMCO1 interacts with nuclear transport proteins such as IPO7 and KPNB1, which are part of the nuclear import and export machinery. Although TMCO1 does not translocate to the nucleus, its interactions suggest a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport processes (Bong2024TMCO1).
