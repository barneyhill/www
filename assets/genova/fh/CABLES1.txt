# CABLES1

## Overview
CABLES1, or Cdk5 and Abl enzyme substrate 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis. The protein, categorized as an adaptor protein, interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, modulating their activity to influence cell growth and differentiation. Notably, CABLES1 enhances the phosphorylation of CDK5, which is essential for neural differentiation and neurite outgrowth, and stabilizes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/Cip1, acting as a tumor suppressor (Groeneweg2010cables1; Shi2014Cables1). The protein's interactions with p53 family proteins further underscore its role in apoptosis and genomic stability, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and development (Wang2010Cables1). CABLES1's involvement in various signaling pathways and its nuclear localization make it a pivotal component in cellular homeostasis and a significant factor in the pathogenesis of diseases, particularly cancer (Arnason2013Cables1is; Huang2017The).

## Structure


## Function
CABLES1, also known as Cdk5 and Abl enzyme substrate 1, is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. It interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) such as CDK2, CDK3, and CDK5, as well as non-receptor tyrosine kinases like Abl, to modulate their activity. In healthy human cells, CABLES1 enhances the phosphorylation of CDK5, which is important for neural differentiation and neurite outgrowth (Groeneweg2010cables1; Huang2017The). 

CABLES1 also stabilizes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/Cip1 by forming a complex that prevents its degradation, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor and regulating cell cycle progression (Shi2014Cables1; Pu2017Cables1). This stabilization occurs through a ubiquitin-independent pathway, highlighting its unique mechanism of action (Shi2014Cables1). 

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, CABLES1 interacts with p53 family proteins, including p63 and p73, to influence apoptosis and maintain genomic stability (Wang2010Cables1; Tsuji2002Differential). The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it is involved in various cellular processes that ensure normal cellular function and organismal development (Huang2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CABLES1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. CABLES1 is recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, and its inactivation is associated with increased tumor progression in colorectal cancer. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and epigenetic silencing through promoter methylation are common mechanisms leading to decreased CABLES1 expression in colorectal cancers, with 65% of primary cases showing reduced expression (Arnason2013Cables1is). 

In ovarian cancer, CABLES1 expression is frequently lost, and this loss is linked to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The gene's inactivation in ovarian cancer is often due to LOH and promoter methylation (Sakamoto2008Mechanisms). 

CABLES1 mutations have also been identified as a novel cause of Cushing's disease, particularly in cases involving corticotropinomas, a type of pituitary tumor. These mutations may lead to aggressive tumor growth and are associated with a distinct genetic pathway separate from other common mutations in corticotropinomas (HernándezRamírez2017Lossoffunction). 

Overall, the loss or alteration of CABLES1 function is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of several cancers and other diseases.

## Interactions
CABLES1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It binds to cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK2, CDK3, and CDK5, acting as a substrate and adaptor protein. This interaction influences the phosphorylation and activity of these kinases, affecting cell growth and neurite outgrowth (Shi2015Cables1; Yamochi2001ik3‐1Cables). CABLES1 also interacts with the 14-3-3 protein family, particularly the 14-3-3γ isoform. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, involving the T44 and T150 sites on CABLES1, and is crucial for modulating its tumor suppressor activity (Shi2015Cables1).

CABLES1 stabilizes the p21 protein by preventing its degradation through a ubiquitin-independent mechanism, involving competition with the proteasome subunit PSMA3 for binding to p21 (Shi2014Cables1). It also interacts with p53, p63, and p73, contributing to apoptosis induction and tumor suppression (Shi2015Cables1; Wang2010Cables1). These interactions highlight CABLES1's role in linking survival signaling to cell death pathways, emphasizing its importance in cancer biology.
