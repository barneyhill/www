# RABEPK

## Overview
RABEPK is a gene that encodes the Rab9 effector protein with kelch motifs, a protein integral to intracellular trafficking processes. This protein is categorized as an effector protein, which interacts with the small GTPase Rab9 to facilitate the transport of proteins between late endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The Rab9 effector protein with kelch motifs is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in lysosomal function and protein sorting, and plays a significant role in the balance between lysosome formation and exosomal release (Xin2017Secondary). Beyond its fundamental cellular roles, RABEPK has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its involvement in viral propagation and potential associations with disorders such as opioid use disorder and bipolar disorder with metabolic syndrome (Feng2022Identification; Kember2021Crossancestry).

## Structure


## Function
RABEPK, or Rab9 effector protein with kelch motifs, plays a crucial role in intracellular trafficking processes, particularly in the transport of proteins between the late endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. This protein is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper lysosomal function, impacting processes such as protein sorting and degradation (Xin2017Secondary). RABEPK is involved in endosome-to-trans-Golgi network transport, which is vital for lysosome formation. A deficiency in RABEPK can lead to reduced lysosome formation and increased exosomal release, indicating its role in balancing lysosome and exosome production (Xin2017Secondary).

In the context of neural plasticity, RABEPK is primarily localized in GFAP+ astrocytes, and its expression is modulated by exosomal treatments. For instance, miR-133b-enriched exosomes have been shown to decrease RABEPK levels in astrocytes under ischemic conditions, suggesting a mechanism by which these exosomes enhance neural recovery (Xin2017Secondary). Although the specific function of RABEPK in healthy human cells is not extensively detailed, its involvement in critical cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Nijboer2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The RABEPK gene has been implicated in several disorders due to its role in intracellular trafficking and its interactions with other cellular components. In the context of opioid use disorder (OUD), RABEPK has been identified as a novel genome-wide significant locus, suggesting that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene may contribute to the genetic signal associated with OUD (Kember2021Crossancestry). This association highlights the potential involvement of RABEPK in reward-related phenotypes and substance use disorders.

RABEPK has also been identified as a candidate gene with high diagnostic value for bipolar disorder with metabolic syndrome. Machine learning and bioinformatics analyses have shown that RABEPK, among other genes, could serve as a biomarker for this condition, with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis providing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71, indicating its potential as a diagnostic tool (Feng2022Identification; Shen2023Identification).

Additionally, RABEPK is involved in endosome-to-trans-Golgi network transport, which is crucial for lysosome formation. Alterations in its expression have been observed in studies focusing on neural plasticity and recovery post-stroke, where downregulation of RABEPK was associated with increased exosomal release from astrocytes, suggesting a role in conditions involving lysosomal dysfunction (Xin2017Secondary).

## Interactions
RABEPK, also known as Rab9 effector protein with kelch motifs, is involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly in the movement of late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). It interacts with Rab9, a small GTPase, facilitating the transport of cargo between these cellular compartments (Li2009A). RABEPK is also implicated in the assembly of viral particles for multiple viruses, including HIV, Marburg, Ebola, and measles viruses, suggesting its role in viral propagation (Li2009A).

In the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, RABEPK has been identified as a host factor necessary for the replication of both HCV and HIV. It is suggested to act before viral particle formation, potentially influencing the generation of the membranous web, a structure critical for viral replication (Li2009A). Additionally, RABEPK has been identified as a candidate interactor with the HCV core protein, indicating a potential role in the virus's lifecycle (Ngo2013Modulation).

RABEPK's involvement in lysosome formation and endosome-to-TGN transport is also noted in studies on stroke recovery, where its expression is downregulated by miR-133b-enriched exosomes, which may enhance neural recovery (Xin2017Secondary).
