# TLR3

## Overview
The TLR3 gene encodes the toll-like receptor 3 protein, a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system by recognizing viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This recognition is crucial for initiating antiviral responses, as TLR3 activation leads to the recruitment of adaptor proteins and the activation of transcription factors that drive the expression of antiviral and inflammatory genes (Chen2021Tolllike). Structurally, TLR3 is characterized by an ectodomain composed of leucine-rich repeats, which facilitate its dimerization and interaction with dsRNA (Liu2008Structural; Choe2005Crystal). The receptor's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which influence its ligand-binding capabilities (Choe2005Crystal). Clinically, mutations in the TLR3 gene have been associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections, including herpes simplex virus encephalitis and severe influenza, underscoring its critical role in immune defense (Guo2011Herpes; Lim2019Severe).

## Structure
The TLR3 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. Its ectodomain (ECD) is composed of 23 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) arranged in a horseshoe-shaped solenoid structure, which is stabilized by a tightly packed hydrophobic core (Liu2008Structural; Choe2005Crystal). The inner concave surface of the ECD is formed by parallel beta strands, while the outer convex surface features diverse secondary structures, including loops and alpha helices (Choe2005Crystal). 

TLR3's quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is crucial for its function. The dimerization is facilitated by interactions at the C-terminal domains of the ECD, which stabilize the dimer and are essential for downstream signaling (Liu2008Structural). The protein also forms multimeric complexes along double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), with electrostatic interactions playing a key role in this multimerization (Sakaniwa2023TLR3).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are prevalent in TLR3, with 15 potential N-linked glycosylation sites identified. These modifications are unevenly distributed, leaving one face of the protein glycosylation-free, which is proposed as a potential site for ligand binding and dimerization (Choe2005Crystal).

## Function
Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is a crucial component of the innate immune system, primarily involved in recognizing viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and initiating antiviral responses. Upon activation by dsRNA, TLR3 undergoes K63-linked poly-ubiquitination, which facilitates its distribution to endolysosomes where it senses viral dsRNA. This activation recruits the adaptor protein TRIF, essential for downstream signaling, involving key molecules such as TRAF3/6, TBK1, IKK-ε, RIP-1, and NAP1. These molecules activate transcription factors like IRF3/7, NF-κB, and AP-1, which mediate the expression of antiviral and inflammatory genes (Chen2021Tolllike).

In small airway epithelial cells, TLR3 activation by the ligand poly(I:C) leads to a significant inflammatory response characterized by the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-β. This response can be inhibited by a functional blocking anti-TLR3 antibody, indicating TLR3's involvement in the response (Ritter2005Characterization).

In the central nervous system, TLR3 activation in astrocytes triggers the production of neuroprotective mediators, suggesting a role in neuroprotection and repair mechanisms. This includes the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, contributing to an overall anti-inflammatory response (Bsibsi2006Toll‐like).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TLR3 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly those involving viral infections. TLR3 is crucial for recognizing double-stranded RNA, a common viral replication intermediate, and initiating an immune response. Deficiencies in TLR3 can lead to increased susceptibility to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE), a severe condition affecting the central nervous system. Studies have identified both autosomal dominant and recessive TLR3 deficiencies as genetic causes of HSE in children, characterized by impaired induction of interferons in fibroblasts (Zhang2007TLR3; Guo2011Herpes). Specific mutations, such as P554S and E746X, result in loss-of-function effects, leading to impaired immune responses and increased viral replication (Guo2011Herpes).

TLR3 mutations are also associated with severe influenza pneumonitis in children. Inherited TLR3 deficiencies, including the P680L variant, have been linked to increased susceptibility to influenza A virus-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (IAV-ARDS) (Lim2019Severe). These mutations affect the immune response in non-hematopoietic cells, such as fibroblasts and pulmonary epithelial cells, highlighting TLR3's role in cell-intrinsic immunity (Lim2019Severe). Additionally, TLR3 polymorphisms have been associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus, suggesting a broader impact on immune-related conditions (Assmann2014Polymorphisms).

## Interactions
TLR3 interacts with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to initiate immune signaling. The ectodomain of TLR3 binds dsRNA at two sites, facilitating the dimerization of TLR3, which is crucial for signaling. This interaction brings the cytoplasmic TIR domains into proximity, triggering downstream signaling pathways (Liu2008Structural). TLR3 forms a multimeric complex along dsRNA, with dimeric units aligning laterally, which enhances signal transduction. Electrostatic interactions at the dimer-dimer interface are essential for this multimerization (Sakaniwa2023TLR3).

TLR3 also interacts with the adaptor protein TRIF (TICAM-1), which is crucial for activating transcription factors such as NF-κB and IRF-3, leading to the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. TRIF interacts with TRAF proteins, including TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6, which are involved in polyubiquitination and subsequent signaling (Sasai2010Direct; Chen2021Tolllike). The interaction with TRIF is unique to TLR3 among TLRs, as it does not rely on MyD88 for signaling (Choe2005Crystal).

The glycosylation-free face of TLR3 is proposed to be the site for dsRNA binding, allowing TLR3 to form dimers and potentially higher-order oligomers, which are important for its signaling function (Choe2005Crystal).
