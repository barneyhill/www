# HSD17B12

## Overview
The HSD17B12 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 12, which is a crucial component of lipid and steroid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydrogenase and is involved in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids and the conversion of estrone to estradiol, a form of estrogen. It plays a significant role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, heart, and endocrine organs. The enzyme's activity is essential for processes such as inflammation mediation and estrogen biosynthesis, particularly in estrogen-sensitive tissues. Additionally, HSD17B12 is implicated in viral replication, particularly in hepatitis C virus, and is associated with metabolic disorders, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (LuuThe2006Characterization; Mohamed2020Verylongchain; Nagasaki200917βHydroxysteroid).

## Function
The HSD17B12 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 12, which plays a critical role in lipid metabolism and hormone regulation in healthy human cells. This enzyme is involved in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids, a process essential for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis. It converts palmitic acid to arachidonic acid, a precursor for eicosanoids, including prostaglandins like prostaglandin E2, which are important inflammatory mediators (Hachim2020An; Visus2011Identification).

HSD17B12 is also involved in the conversion of estrone to estradiol, a form of estrogen, highlighting its role in steroid metabolism. This activity is particularly significant in estrogen-sensitive tissues such as the ovary and mammary gland, where it contributes to estrogen biosynthesis (LuuThe2006Characterization).

The enzyme is highly expressed in organs related to lipid metabolism, including the liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle, as well as in endocrine-related organs like the pancreas and adrenal gland. This distribution suggests its involvement in regulating both lipid biosynthesis and steroid metabolism (Sakurai2006Systemic). HSD17B12's activity in the endoplasmic reticulum is crucial for its functions in these metabolic processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the HSD17B12 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In metabolic disorders, the gene plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, and its disruption can lead to significant metabolic imbalances. Studies using conditional knockout mice have shown that the absence of HSD17B12 results in severe weight loss, reduced fat stores, liver toxicity, and systemic inflammation, indicating its essential role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Heikelä2020Hydroxysteroid).

HSD17B12 has also been associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Research has identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene that may affect its expression, potentially influencing pancreatic β-cell function and contributing to diabetes pathogenesis (Hachim2020An).

In cancer, particularly breast and ovarian cancer, HSD17B12 expression has been linked to poor prognosis. In breast cancer, its expression correlates with adverse outcomes, and knockdown studies suggest it may regulate fatty acid synthesis, contributing to tumor progression (Nagasaki200917βHydroxysteroid). Although no high-penetrance mutations have been identified, the gene may still pose modest risks for cancer susceptibility (Plourde2009Analysis).

## Interactions
HSD17B12 is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its role in viral replication and lipid metabolism. During hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HSD17B12 redistributes to replication and assembly sites, where it physically interacts with the HCV core protein. This interaction is suggested to facilitate viral replication by co-localizing with viral replication and assembly sites, as indicated by its overlap with double-strand RNA (dsRNA) and core proteins (Mohamed2020Verylongchain). The protein is also involved in the biogenesis of HCV membranous webs, essential for viral genome replication and particle assembly, indicating its role as a specific viral core interactor (Mohamed2020Verylongchain).

HSD17B12 interacts with elongation of very-long-chain fatty acid elongase subtypes (ELOVL1-7) and very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase subtypes (HACD1-4) to facilitate the elongation of fatty acids, highlighting its role as a metabolic hub (Mohamed2020Verylongchain). These interactions are crucial for maintaining lipid droplets, which are necessary for HCV assembly and the replication of related flaviviruses (Mohamed2020Verylongchain). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in creating a lipid metabolic environment conducive to viral particle assembly.
