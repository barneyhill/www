# C12orf71

## Overview
C12orf71 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 12 open reading frame 71. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, as its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes remain largely undefined. Despite the limited understanding of its precise function, studies have suggested potential involvement in various cellular pathways and interactions, although these findings require further validation. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research, particularly in the context of their potential implications in human health and disease.
