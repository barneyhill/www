# SNX11

## Overview
SNX11, or sorting nexin 11, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the sorting nexin family, which is involved in intracellular trafficking and protein sorting. The protein encoded by SNX11 is characterized by the presence of a Phox (PX) domain, a structural motif that facilitates binding to phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol phosphates. SNX11 is part of the SNX10 subgroup, which is distinguished by smaller proteins that lack coiled-coil regions, a feature that sets them apart from other members of the sorting nexin family (TEASDALE2001A). The protein's PX domain has been structurally analyzed, revealing specific residues that contribute to its binding specificity and function (Teasdale2011Insights). SNX11 plays a role in cellular processes by interacting with specific phosphoinositides, although its precise biological functions and interactions remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure
SNX11 (sorting nexin 11) is a member of the sorting nexin family, characterized by the presence of a Phox (PX) domain, which is involved in phosphoinositide binding. The PX domain of SNX11 has been studied using X-ray crystallography, revealing specific amino acid residues involved in its structure, including R59, Y60, K85, and R100 (Teasdale2011Insights). The specificity of SNX11 is noted for PI(4,5)P2 in liposomes, although it can also bind PI3P. The binding pocket for phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) in SNX11 is occluded, which may influence its binding properties (Teasdale2011Insights).

SNX11 is part of the SNX10 subgroup, which includes smaller proteins that lack coiled-coil regions, unlike other SNX family members (TEASDALE2001A). The SNX-PX domain is a conserved region within the SNX family, predicted to form similar secondary structures across the family, with an α-helix at the N-terminus and a conserved Arg-Arg-Tyr-Xaa-Asp(Glu) motif (TEASDALE2001A). SNX11 does not contain putative transmembrane domains or signal peptides, and no coiled-coil domains are predicted in the SNX10 subgroup (TEASDALE2001A).
