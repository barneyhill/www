# SHPK

## Overview
SHPK is a gene that encodes the enzyme sedoheptulokinase, a kinase involved in the phosphorylation of sedoheptulose to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P), a critical step in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Wamelink2008Sedoheptulokinase; Nagy2013Sedoheptulose). This pathway is essential for various cellular processes, including nucleotide biosynthesis and the production of NADPH, which is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and metabolic homeostasis (Stincone2014The). Sedoheptulokinase is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in regulating carbohydrate metabolism by directing carbon flux between glycolysis and the PPP (Nagy2013Sedoheptulose). The enzyme's specificity for sedoheptulose underscores its precise function in cellular metabolism. Alterations in the SHPK gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as cystinosis and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Wamelink2008The; Franceschi2022Sedoheptulose).

## Function
Sedoheptulokinase (SHPK), encoded by the CARKL gene, plays a crucial role in the phosphorylation of sedoheptulose to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P), a key intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Wamelink2008Sedoheptulokinase; Nagy2013Sedoheptulose). This pathway is essential for cellular processes such as nucleotide biosynthesis and the generation of NADPH, which is vital for maintaining cellular redox balance and metabolic homeostasis (Stincone2014The).

SHPK activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism by facilitating the carbon flux between glycolysis and the PPP (Nagy2013Sedoheptulose). The enzyme's activity is specific to sedoheptulose, and it does not act on structural analogues, highlighting its precise role in cellular metabolism (Nagy2013Sedoheptulose).

In healthy human cells, SHPK is involved in bioenergetic reprogramming, which is crucial for processes such as tumor formation and immune cell activation (Nagy2013Sedoheptulose). The enzyme's function in the PPP also influences the production of ribose and NADPH, which are important for nucleotide synthesis and redox balance (Wamelink2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SHPK gene, which encodes sedoheptulokinase, have been linked to several clinical conditions. A significant 57 kb deletion affecting both the CTNS and SHPK genes is prevalent among cystinosis patients, particularly those of northern European descent. This deletion leads to sedoheptulokinase deficiency, resulting in elevated urinary concentrations of sedoheptulose and erythritol. Patients with this deletion often suffer from the severe infantile nephropathic form of cystinosis, although the clinical phenotype can vary (Wamelink2011Elevated; Wamelink2008The).

SHPK expression levels have also been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). High SHPK mRNA expression in GBM is associated with increased tumor proliferation and worse patient prognosis. SHPK overexpression correlates with enhanced cell viability and proliferation in GBM cell lines, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Mutations in genes such as IDH1 and EGFR show different associations with SHPK expression levels, indicating that SHPK interactions may influence GBM progression (Franceschi2022Sedoheptulose).

SHPK deficiency is rare, with only a few reported cases. These cases are characterized by symptoms such as neonatal cholestasis, hypoglycemia, and anemia, as well as congenital arthrogryposis multiplex and dysmorphic facies (Shayota2020Untargeted).
