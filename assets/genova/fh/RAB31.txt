# RAB31

## Overview
RAB31 is a gene that encodes a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, which are part of the Ras superfamily. The protein product, RAB31, is involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. As a small GTPase, RAB31 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular organization and function by facilitating the sorting and transport of proteins and lipids within the cell (Kotzsch2018RAB31; Bhuin2014Rab). The protein's activity is modulated by interactions with various regulatory proteins, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins, which control its cycling between active and inactive states (Kotzsch2018RAB31). RAB31 is also implicated in the regulation of exosome biogenesis and has been associated with several cancers, where its altered expression levels contribute to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Chen2023Rab31; Grismayer2012Rab31).

## Structure
The RAB31 protein is a member of the Rab protein family, which is part of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. It consists of 194 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 21.6 kDa (Kotzsch2018RAB31). The primary structure of RAB31 includes a hypervariable C-terminal region, which contains two invariant cysteine residues that undergo post-translational modification through geranylgeranylation. This modification is crucial for its proper subcellular localization, primarily in the trans-Golgi network (Kotzsch2018RAB31).

The secondary and tertiary structures of RAB31 feature a typical GTPase fold, which includes a six-stranded β-sheet core flanked by five α-helices. This structure is common among Rab proteins and is essential for their function in guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (Bhuin2014Rab; Kotzsch2018RAB31). The binding site for guanine nucleotides and Mg2+ is conserved, facilitating the protein's role in vesicle trafficking (Kotzsch2018RAB31).

RAB31 does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. However, it interacts with various proteins, such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which regulate its activity and localization within the cell (Kajiho2011Characterization).

## Function
RAB31, a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. It is involved in both anterograde and retrograde membrane traffic, contributing to the sorting and transport of proteins and lipids within the cell, which is essential for maintaining cellular organization and function (Kotzsch2018RAB31; Bhuin2014Rab). RAB31 interacts with OCRL-1, a phosphatase that regulates signaling molecules crucial for Golgi/TGN structure and trafficking, facilitating the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) from the TGN to endosomes (Rodriguez‐Gabin2009Interaction).

RAB31 also plays a significant role in the regulation of exosome biogenesis. It directs the localization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) and prevents their degradation in lysosomes, allowing for the secretion of EGFR as exosomes. This process involves the recruitment of TBC1D2B to inactivate RAB7, suppressing the fusion of MVEs with lysosomes (Wei2020RAB31). RAB31's activity is regulated by various factors, including guanine exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which control its cycling between inactive and active states (Kotzsch2018RAB31).

## Clinical Significance
RAB31, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), high RAB31 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to increased metastasis and resistance to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. This is mediated through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway involving Twist1, Stat3, and MUC-1 (Chen2023Rab31). In breast cancer, RAB31 overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive cases. It enhances cell proliferation while reducing adhesion and invasion, contributing to tumor progression (Banworth2017Consequences; Grismayer2012Rab31).

RAB31 is also overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where it serves as a prognostic biomarker. Its expression is positively correlated with SRPX2, and both are linked to poor survival outcomes (Li2019SRPX2). In colon cancer, RAB31 is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts, promoting cancer progression through the HGF-MET signaling pathway (Yang2020Increased). These findings suggest that RAB31 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could be a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Rab31, a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate intracellular trafficking. It interacts with Rab escort proteins (REPs), guanine exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), and GDI displacement factors (GDFs) to control its activity between inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) states (Kotzsch2018RAB31). Rab31 forms complexes with OCRL-1 in oligodendrocytes, independent of its conformational state, involving specific binding sites on OCRL-1 (Rodriguez‐Gabin2009Interaction). This interaction is crucial for the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to endosomes (Rodriguez‐Gabin2009Interaction).

Rab31 also interacts with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in pancreatic β-cells, modulating β-cell apoptosis through the pAKT/BCL2 pathway (Bai2022Rab31). In macrophages, Rab31 recruits the signaling adaptor APPL2 during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, enhancing the process through PI3K/AKT signaling (Yeo2015Rab31). Additionally, Rab31 is involved in the trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and interacts with flotillin proteins to facilitate EGFR entry into multivesicular endosomes (Wei2020RAB31).
