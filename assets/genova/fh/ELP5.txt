# ELP5

## Overview
The ELP5 gene encodes the protein elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 5, which is a vital component of the Elongator complex, a multi-subunit assembly involved in tRNA modification. This protein is part of the ELP456 subcomplex, which functions as a hexameric RecA-like ATPase, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and functional stability of the Elongator complex by linking ELP3 to ELP4. This connection is essential for the complex's role in the wobble U34 tRNA modification cascade, which is necessary for accurate mRNA translation and protein synthesis. ELP5's activity is significant in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular processes such as stress response and organismal development, with implications for neurological function (Xu2019Genomewide).

## Function
The ELP5 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the Elongator complex, which is crucial for the modification of tRNA molecules. This complex is composed of two subcomplexes: ELP123, which has acetyltransferase activity, and ELP456, which functions as a hexameric RecA-like ATPase. ELP5 is part of the ELP456 subcomplex and plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the entire Elongator complex by connecting ELP3 to ELP4, thereby uniting the ELP123 and ELP456 subcomplexes. This connection is essential for the complex's function in the wobble U34 tRNA modification cascade, which is necessary for accurate mRNA translation (Xu2019Genomewide).

ELP5's ATPase activity is crucial for presenting a tRNA-binding site, facilitating the modification process. The modification involves the formation of 5-carbamoylmethyluridine (cm5U) to 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm5U) and finally mcm5s2U, which are required for proper codon decoding (Xu2019Genomewide). ELP5 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular processes like protein synthesis and stress response, impacting organismal development and neurological function (Xu2019Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ELP5 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of gallbladder cancer (GBC). ELP5 is a core subunit of the elongator complex, which is crucial for maintaining its integrity and stability. In GBC, hypermethylation of the ELP5 promoter, mediated by DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A, leads to transcriptional repression of ELP5. This repression is associated with resistance to gemcitabine, a common chemotherapeutic agent used in GBC treatment (Xu2021Epigenetic). The loss of ELP5 expression impairs the translation of p53, a key protein involved in apoptosis, thereby reducing the effectiveness of gemcitabine therapy (Xu2019Genomewide).

The study suggests that ELP5 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation is linked to poor therapeutic responses and survival outcomes in GBC patients (Xu2021Epigenetic). Reactivating ELP5 expression through demethylating agents like decitabine (DAC) can restore the function of the elongator complex and sensitize GBC cells to gemcitabine, offering a potential therapeutic strategy (Xu2021Epigenetic). These findings highlight the critical role of ELP5 in modulating drug sensitivity and its potential as a biomarker for predicting chemotherapy response in gallbladder cancer (Xu2019Genomewide).

## Interactions
ELP5 is a subunit of the Elongator complex, which is composed of two subcomplexes: ELP123 and ELP456. ELP5 is part of the ELP456 subcomplex and plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the Elongator complex by directly connecting ELP3 to ELP4, thereby uniting the ELP123 and ELP456 subcomplexes (Xu2019Genomewide). Immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated that ELP5 interacts with ELP3 and ELP4, and its depletion leads to the accelerated degradation of these proteins, disrupting the Elongator complex's integrity (Xu2019Genomewide).

ELP5 is involved in the wobble U34 tRNA modification, which is crucial for the translation of certain proteins, including hnRNPQ. This protein acts as an IRES trans-acting factor (ITAF) for P53, and ELP5's role in tRNA modification is essential for the proper translation of hnRNPQ and subsequent P53 expression (Xu2019Genomewide). The interaction of ELP5 with hnRNPQ through its role in tRNA modification is critical for modulating P53 translation and apoptosis in response to gemcitabine treatment (Xu2019Genomewide). These interactions highlight ELP5's significant role in the Elongator complex and its impact on cellular processes related to mRNA translation and cancer drug sensitivity.
