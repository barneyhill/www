# TADA1

## Overview
TADA1 is a gene that encodes the protein transcriptional adaptor 1, which is a critical component of the human SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex. This complex plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation by modifying chromatin structure, thereby influencing gene expression. The TADA1 protein is integral to the structural integrity of the SAGA complex, contributing to its core module through histone-fold domain pairs that form a distorted pseudooctamer structure. This architectural feature is conserved across species, as evidenced by similarities between human and yeast SAGA complexes (Timmers2021SAGA; Herbst2021Structure). The evolutionary development of the SAGA complex, including TADA1, underscores its importance in the diversification of transcriptional regulation mechanisms in complex organisms (Timmers2021SAGA).
