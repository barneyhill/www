# DPP7

## Overview
DPP7 is a gene that encodes the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 7, a serine protease involved in various physiological processes. The protein, also known as quiescent cell proline dipeptidase (QPP), is characterized by its unique structural features, including a classical catalytic alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and a cap domain specific to the S28 protease family. DPP7 is ubiquitously expressed and plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating peptide levels within cells. It is particularly important for the vitality of lymphocytes and fibroblasts, as its inhibition can lead to apoptosis. Clinically, DPP7 has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in colorectal cancer, with its expression levels correlating with cancer progression and treatment response (Ma2023DPP7; Bezerra2012Structures; Zhang2023Integrated).

## Structure
The human DPP7 protein, also known as quiescent cell proline dipeptidase (QPP), is a serine protease with a unique molecular structure. It consists of two main domains: a classical catalytic alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and a cap domain with an alpha-helical fold specific to the S28 protease family, known as the SKS domain (Bezerra2012Structures). The catalytic triad of DPP7 includes Ser162, Asp418, and His443, located deep within the cleft between these domains (Bezerra2012Structures).

DPP7 forms a functional homodimer, potentially through a leucine zipper motif, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Bezerra2012Structures). The protein's structure is stabilized by four disulfide bonds and glycosylation at specific asparagine residues, such as Asn50 and Asn315, which are essential for maintaining its conformation and stability (Bezerra2012Structures).

The SKS domain of DPP7 is a rare structural element formed by 11 alpha helices and two strands interconnected by loops, contributing to the protein's architectural diversity (Bezerra2012Structures). The protein's scaffold is formed by an eight-stranded beta-sheet, and the active site is accessed via a narrow tunnel (Bezerra2012Structures).

## Function
Dipeptidyl peptidase 7 (DPP7) is an enzyme encoded by the human gene DPP7, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. DPP7 is a proline-specific dipeptidyl peptidase that is ubiquitously expressed and localized to intracellular vesicles. It operates optimally at a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0, which is conducive to its activity within the cytoplasm (Bezerra2012Structures).

DPP7 is essential for the vitality of lymphocytes and fibroblasts, as its inhibition can lead to apoptosis. This enzyme is involved in the cleavage of neuropeptides such as casomorphin and bradykinin in the brain, contributing to the regulation of peptide levels within cells (Bezerra2012Structures). By maintaining intracellular peptide levels, DPP7 helps regulate immune cell function and homeostasis, thereby playing a role in preventing hyperinsulinemia and maintaining glucose homeostasis (Bezerra2012Structures).

Structurally, DPP7 features a classical catalytic alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and a cap with an alpha-helical fold specific to the S28 protease family. Its catalytic triad, consisting of Ser162, Asp418, and His443, is located deep inside the protein, accessible via a narrow tunnel, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Bezerra2012Structures).

## Clinical Significance
DPP7 (dipeptidyl peptidase 7) has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in colorectal cancer (CRC). Its expression is notably upregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with advanced cancer stages and poorer overall survival rates. High DPP7 expression is associated with advanced pathological staging, lymphatic invasion, and reduced survival outcomes, making it a potential independent prognostic marker for CRC (Ma2023DPP7; Zhang2023Integrated).

In addition to its role in CRC, DPP7 expression levels have been linked to drug efficacy. Studies have shown a negative correlation between DPP7 expression and the effectiveness of certain cancer drugs, suggesting that higher DPP7 expression may influence drug sensitivity in CRC treatment (Zhang2023Integrated).

DPP7 also plays a role in immune response regulation. Its expression correlates with specific immune cell types and immune checkpoint genes, indicating potential involvement in modulating the immune landscape in cancer (Ma2023DPP7). In breast cancer, DPP7 is involved in cell cycle-related pathways, which may impact cancer progression (Choy2021Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DPP7 in cancer prognosis and treatment response.
