# CCDC102B

## Overview
The CCDC102B gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 102B protein, which plays a significant role in centrosome cohesion and linker assembly in human cells. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and is involved in forming fibers between centrosomes, contributing to the centrosome linker complex. CCDC102B is recruited to the centrosome by proteins such as Rootletin and interacts with other centrosome linker proteins, including C-Nap1 and LRRC45, to maintain centrosome cohesion during interphase. Additionally, CCDC102B is implicated in breast cancer metastasis through its role in activating the NF-κB pathway and is associated with myopic maculopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in disease progression (Xia2018CCDC102B; Hosoda2018CCDC102B; Si2022Stabilization).

## Structure
The CCDC102B protein is composed of 513 amino acids and features several coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. Specifically, CCDC102B is predicted to have a short coiled-coil domain at its N-terminus and two longer coiled-coil domains located in the middle region and at the C-terminus (Xia2018CCDC102B). These coiled-coil domains are typically involved in forming alpha-helical structures that can promote dimerization or the formation of higher-order oligomers.

The protein contains seven putative KFERQ-like motifs at its N-terminus, which are indicative of substrates for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) (Si2022Stabilization). These motifs are recognized by HSPA8, which recruits proteins to the lysosome, and LAMP2A, a CMA receptor that mediates the translocation of substrates into the lysosomal lumen for degradation (Si2022Stabilization).

Post-translational modifications of CCDC102B include phosphorylation, which is regulated by the kinase Nek2A during mitosis. This phosphorylation is crucial for the removal of CCDC102B from the centrosome (Xia2018CCDC102B). The protein's interactions with other centrosome linker proteins, such as C-Nap1, Rootletin, and LRRC45, are essential for its recruitment to the centrosome (Xia2018CCDC102B).

## Function
The CCDC102B gene encodes a protein involved in centrosome cohesion and linker assembly in human cells. The CCDC102B protein is localized at the proximal ends of centrioles and forms fibers between centrosomes, suggesting its role in the centrosome linker complex (Xia2018CCDC102B). It co-localizes with other centrosome linker proteins such as Rootletin, LRRC45, and Cep68, forming an interdigitating network that maintains centrosome cohesion during interphase (Xia2018CCDC102B). The N-terminus of CCDC102B is crucial for its centrosome localization, while the C-terminal region assists in forming globular aggregates (Xia2018CCDC102B).

CCDC102B is recruited to the centrosome primarily by Rootletin and interacts with proteins such as C-Nap1 and LRRC45, which are essential for its localization and function (Xia2018CCDC102B). The protein does not form filaments through self-assembly but is recruited to the filaments of Rootletin, aiding in their formation (Xia2018CCDC102B). During mitosis, CCDC102B is phosphorylated by the kinase Nek2A, leading to its dissociation from the centrosome, a process that triggers centrosome separation and bipolar spindle formation (Xia2018CCDC102B). This regulatory mechanism highlights its critical role in cell cycle progression and centrosome dynamics.

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC102B gene has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, increased expression of CCDC102B is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including reduced recurrence-free survival and overall survival. High levels of CCDC102B expression correlate with lymph node metastasis and are particularly significant in HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes. The gene's overexpression promotes breast cancer metastasis by activating the NF-κB pathway, which is facilitated through its interaction with RACK1, a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling (Si2022Stabilization).

In the context of high myopia, CCDC102B is associated with the development of myopic maculopathy, a condition that can lead to low vision and blindness. A genome-wide association study identified a significant link between the CCDC102B gene and myopic maculopathy, particularly in East Asian populations. The gene's role in this condition is thought to involve the weakening of cell integrity and adhesion in the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid, contributing to tissue atrophy (Hosoda2018CCDC102B). These findings suggest that CCDC102B may serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in both breast cancer and myopic maculopathy.

## Interactions
CCDC102B is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in centrosome cohesion and breast cancer metastasis. It interacts with C-Nap1, which recruits CCDC102B to the centrosome, and provides docking sites for Rootletin and LRRC45, essential for centrosome linker assembly (Xia2018CCDC102B). CCDC102B physically associates with Rootletin and LRRC45, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays, although the interaction with LRRC45 is relatively weak and cell-type sensitive (Xia2018CCDC102B). CCDC102B also interacts with the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), which is involved in the lysosomal degradation of CCDC102B through the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of CCDC102B and its role in activating the NF-kB pathway, which is linked to breast cancer metastasis (Si2022Stabilization). The interaction between CCDC102B and RACK1 is mediated by specific regions within both proteins, including the third coiled-coil structure of CCDC102B and the #5 WD40 domain of RACK1 (Si2022Stabilization). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CCDC102B in cellular processes and disease progression.
