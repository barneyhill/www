# SYNE2

## Overview
The SYNE2 gene encodes the protein spectrin repeat containing nuclear envelope protein 2, commonly known as nesprin-2, which is a member of the spectrin repeat family. Nesprin-2 is a KASH domain protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural organization of the cell by linking the nuclear envelope to the cytoskeleton. This connection is crucial for maintaining nuclear architecture, positioning, and the mechanical properties of cells. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including nuclear positioning, cell migration, and cellular signaling, and is essential for neurogenesis and synapse formation. Nesprin-2 interacts with other proteins to form the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, which is vital for nuclear-cytoskeletal coupling. Mutations in the SYNE2 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, including muscular dystrophies, neurodevelopmental disorders, and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in human health and disease (Haque2010Mammalian; Han2016EGFR; Young2021Biallelic).

## Structure
The SYNE2 gene encodes nesprin-2, a large protein that is part of the spectrin repeat family and plays a crucial role in connecting the nuclear envelope to the cytoskeleton. Nesprin-2 is characterized by a variable number of spectrin repeats, which are integral to its structure, and a C-terminal KASH domain that anchors it to the nuclear membrane (Paulus2024An; Young2021Biallelic). The protein's structure includes an N-terminal actin-binding domain composed of two calponin homology domains, which link the nucleus to F-actin, and a central rod domain containing spectrin repeats that mediate protein-protein interactions (Paulus2024An).

Nesprin-2 has several isoforms due to alternative transcription and splicing, with the largest isoform being the nesprin-2 giant, approximately 800 kDa in size (Paulus2024An; Young2021Biallelic). This giant isoform is involved in various cellular functions, including nuclear architecture and cell migration (Young2021Biallelic). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Li2021Syne2bNesprin2).

Mutations in the SYNE2 gene, particularly in the spectrin repeat domains, can lead to significant phenotypes, including intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (Young2021Biallelic). These mutations can affect the protein's stability and folding, impacting its function in cellular processes (Young2021Biallelic).

## Function
The SYNE2 gene encodes the nesprin-2 protein, which is a critical component of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex. This complex spans the nuclear envelope and plays a vital role in linking the cytoskeleton to the nuclear interior, thereby maintaining nuclear architecture and positioning (Young2021Biallelic). Nesprin-2 is involved in various cellular functions, including nuclear positioning, directed cell migration, and cellular signaling. It is essential for processes such as neurogenesis, neuronal migration, axon termination, and synapse formation (Young2021Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, nesprin-2 is crucial for maintaining the stability of the nuclear envelope and influences the mechanical properties of cells. It interacts with other nesprin proteins, such as nesprin-1 and nesprin-3, to mediate these processes (Young2021Biallelic). The protein's structure includes an N-terminal actin-binding domain and a spectrin repeat-containing segment, which are important for its function in the outer nuclear membrane (Young2021Biallelic). Proper expression and function of SYNE2 are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical properties of the nucleus, which are important for normal cellular function and response to mechanical stress (Liu2019Atrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYNE2 gene, which encodes the nesprin-2 protein, are associated with several clinical conditions. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy type 5 (EDMD5) is linked to heterozygous mutations in SYNE2, leading to skeletal muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. Patients with these mutations often exhibit muscle pain, gait deficits, and elevated creatine kinase levels, although cardiac symptoms may not always be present (Paulus2024An; Lee2020A). 

Biallelic missense mutations in SYNE2 are associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These mutations result in a significant reduction in the expression of the nesprin-2 giant protein, affecting protein stability and potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders (Young2021Biallelic). 

In cancer biology, alterations in SYNE2 expression have been observed in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SYNE2 mRNA expression is down-regulated in HCC, and specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene are associated with poor overall survival in patients with HBV-related HCC (Han2016EGFR). 

These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of SYNE2 mutations and alterations, impacting both muscular and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
SYNE2, also known as Nesprin-2, is a KASH domain protein that plays a crucial role in connecting the nuclear envelope to the cytoskeleton. It interacts with various proteins, forming complexes essential for cellular processes such as nuclear migration and ciliogenesis. SYNE2 interacts with pericentrin (Pcnt) at the basal body complex of the connecting cilium in photoreceptor cells, which is vital for ciliogenesis and nuclear migration (Falk2018Functional). This interaction is crucial for the proper positioning of the centrosome and the nucleus, impacting retinal development and function (Falk2018Functional).

In neuronal cells, SYNE2 interacts with the dynein/dynactin complex and kinesin motors, facilitating nuclear movement during interkinetic nuclear migration and radial neuronal migration (Zhang2009SUN12). These interactions are essential for coupling the centrosome to the nucleus, which is critical for brain development and function (Zhang2009SUN12).

SYNE2 also forms part of the LINC complex, interacting with SUN-domain proteins SUN1 and SUN2, as well as emerin and lamin A/C, which are important for maintaining nuclear integrity and positioning (Haque2010Mammalian). These interactions are implicated in various diseases, including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia (Lee2019Association).
