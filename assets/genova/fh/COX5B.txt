# COX5B

## Overview
COX5B is a gene that encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B, a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is a matrix-facing subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reduction of oxygen to water, a critical step in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. Unlike other subunits, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B lacks a transmembrane domain and is involved in the regulation and stabilization of COX activity and respiratory supercomplexes. It plays a significant role in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis by modulating COX activity through interactions with other proteins, such as the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (Čunátová2020Role). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Hu2017Identification; Gao2017High).

## Function
COX5B encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This enzyme is crucial for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. COX5B is a matrix-facing component of the COX enzyme and lacks a transmembrane domain. It plays a significant role in the assembly and activity of the COX enzyme in healthy human cells. Knockdown studies in macrophage lines have shown that reducing COX5B levels leads to decreased COX activity and membrane potential, while increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, indicating its importance in maintaining normal COX function and cellular energy metabolism (Čunátová2020Role).

COX5B interacts with the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, which inhibits COX activity, suggesting a regulatory role in cellular energy processes (Čunátová2020Role). Although COX5B is not essential for the catalytic function of COX, it modulates enzyme activity and is involved in the regulation and stabilization of COX activity and the respiratory supercomplexes (Čunátová2020Role). COX5B is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis (Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the COX5B gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer and glioma. In breast cancer, COX5B is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with larger tumor size and poor disease-free survival, especially in Luminal A and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes (de2023Mutations; Gao2017High). Knockdown of COX5B in breast cancer cell lines leads to reduced cell proliferation, increased cellular senescence, and apoptosis, suggesting that COX5B may contribute to cancer progression by maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (Gao2015Loss).

In glioma, COX5B is also upregulated and has been identified as a potential biomarker for high-grade glioma, with its expression correlating with clinical stage and lymph node status (Hu2017Identification). The gene's role in cancer is further supported by its interactions with pro-apoptotic genes and its involvement in pathways related to apoptosis and oxidative phosphorylation, which are critical in cancer development (Čunátová2020Role; de2023Mutations). These findings suggest that COX5B could be a target for therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting its expression to improve patient outcomes.

## Interactions
COX5B, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), is involved in several interactions crucial for its function. In human cells, COX5B is a matrix-facing subunit that lacks a transmembrane domain. It plays a significant role in the assembly of the COX complex. Knockdown studies in the RAW 264.7 macrophage line have shown that COX5B is essential for maintaining COX activity and membrane potential, as its reduction leads to decreased COX activity and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This suggests that COX5B is important for the proper assembly and function of the COX complex (Čunátová2020Role).

COX5B also interacts with the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, which is known to inhibit COX activity. This interaction indicates a regulatory role for COX5B in modulating COX activity through protein-protein interactions (Čunátová2020Role).

In yeast, COX5B is expressed under hypoxic conditions and is regulated by transcriptional repressors such as Rox1p and Ord1p, which bind to the COX5B promoter to control its expression. This regulation is part of a mechanism to optimize ATP production while minimizing ROS generation (Barrientos2009Suppression).
