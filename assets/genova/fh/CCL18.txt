# CCL18

## Overview
CCL18, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 18, is a gene that encodes a chemokine protein involved in immune regulation and inflammatory processes. The CCL18 protein is predominantly expressed in the lung and lymphoid tissues, where it plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses and maintaining homeostasis. As a chemokine, CCL18 is categorized as a signaling protein that influences the migration and activation of various immune cells, including T cells and dendritic cells. It acts as a competitive antagonist to certain chemokine receptors, such as CCR3, and is involved in the regulation of inflammation by binding to glycosaminoglycans on cell surfaces. This binding capability allows CCL18 to modulate chemokine gradients and cell recruitment, thereby influencing immune cell behavior and tissue inflammation (Chenivesse2018CCL18). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, cystic fibrosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Krohn2013The; Hector2014The; Sonia2023Genetic).

## Structure


## Function
CCL18, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 18, is a chemokine primarily expressed in the lung and lymphoid tissues, playing a significant role in immune regulation. In healthy human cells, CCL18 is involved in the modulation of tissue inflammation and immune homeostasis. It exhibits chemotactic activity, attracting naive T cells, Th2 cells, and regulatory T cells, although its chemotactic response is not very robust (Chenivesse2018CCL18). CCL18 acts as a competitive antagonist of CCR3 and can inhibit responses mediated by other chemokine receptors, contributing to its role in dampening inflammation (Chenivesse2018CCL18).

CCL18 influences immunity by stimulating immune cells directly, leading to the differentiation of monocytes into semi-mature dendritic cells and the polarization of memory CD4+ T cells into regulatory T cells. These regulatory effects are crucial for maintaining tolerance and suppressing inflammation, particularly in the lung (Chenivesse2018CCL18). The chemokine also modulates tissue inflammation by inhibiting cell recruitment through binding to glycosaminoglycans, displacing other chemokines from the endothelial surface (Chenivesse2018CCL18). CCL18's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining immune balance and preventing excessive inflammatory responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL18 gene are associated with various diseases, particularly those involving chronic inflammation and cancer. In breast cancer, elevated levels of CCL18 are linked to a worse prognosis. CCL18 functions as an immunosuppressive cytokine, promoting tumor growth and metastasis by triggering the epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the PI3K/Akt/GSK3/Snail signaling pathway. It also reduces the expression of miR98 and miR27b, facilitating angiogenesis, adherence, and migration of cancer cells (Sonia2023Genetic).

In cystic fibrosis, CCL18 levels are significantly increased in patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, correlating with the severity of pulmonary obstruction. This suggests that CCL18 could serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for cystic fibrosis (Hector2014The).

CCL18 is also implicated in Gaucher disease, where its elevated plasma levels serve as a biomarker for disease monitoring, especially in patients lacking chitotriosidase due to genetic mutations. It reflects the total body burden of Gaucher cells and is useful for tracking therapeutic efficacy (van2006Limitations).

In rheumatoid arthritis, CCL18 is abundant in synovial fluid and may play a role in inflammatory processes, potentially interacting with proteins that modulate its activity (Krohn2013The).

## Interactions
CCL18 interacts with various proteins and receptors, playing a significant role in immune modulation and cancer progression. It binds to chemokine receptors such as CCR3, CCR6, and CCR8, as well as the G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1) and PITPNM3, which is considered its predominant receptor (Cardoso2021The; Aravind2021A). The interaction with PITPNM3 is particularly important in cancer, where it activates signaling pathways like NF-kB, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and RAS/MAPK, promoting cancer cell growth and migration (Cardoso2021The).

CCL18 also forms complexes with tick chemokine-binding proteins Evasin-1 and Evasin-4, confirmed through surface plasmon resonance and size-exclusion chromatography, indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry (Krohn2013The). These interactions inhibit the binding of CCL18 to the CCR3 receptor, with Evasin-4 showing a stronger interaction (Krohn2013The).

In addition to protein interactions, CCL18 binds strongly to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on cell surfaces, which is crucial for its activity. This binding allows CCL18 to displace other chemokines from GAGs, affecting chemokine gradients and cell migration (Korbecki2020CCL18). The interaction with GAGs is mediated by specific basic residue clusters in CCL18's structure (Krohn2013The).
