# CYTH4

## Overview
CYTH4 is a gene that encodes the protein cytohesin 4, a member of the cytohesin family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). These proteins are integral to cellular processes, particularly in the activation of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family GTPases, which are involved in cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and signaling pathways (Wang2024Integrated). Cytohesin 4 is characterized by its domain architecture, including a Sec7 domain crucial for ARF GTPase exchange and a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain for membrane targeting (malaby2014integrated). The protein is predominantly expressed in blood leukocytes and the central nervous system, indicating specialized roles in immune response and neural function (Rezazadeh2015A; malaby2014integrated). CYTH4's involvement in various cellular interactions and signaling pathways underscores its potential significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as neuropsychiatric disorders and cancers (Wang2024Integrated; Rezazadeh2015A).

## Structure
Cytohesin 4 (CYTH4) is a member of the cytohesin family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) characterized by a specific domain architecture. The protein includes an N-terminal Heptad Repeat (HR) coiled-coil domain, a catalytic Sec7 domain, a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal helix (CtH) with a polybasic region (pbr) (malaby2014integrated). The HR domain is involved in dimerization and interaction with other proteins, which may contribute to membrane localization and complex formation. The Sec7 domain is crucial for Arf GTPase exchange, while the PH domain is involved in membrane targeting, with specificity for phosphoinositides like PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (malaby2014integrated).

Cytohesin-4 is expressed almost exclusively in blood leukocytes and exists in a diglycine splice variant form, suggesting specialized signaling roles in different cell types (malaby2014integrated). The protein's autoregulatory mechanisms involve intramolecular interactions that can be modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, or effector binding (malaby2014integrated). These modifications can relieve autoinhibition and promote membrane recruitment, similar to other GEFs like Sos and Vav1 (malaby2014integrated).

## Function
CYTH4, or cytohesin 4, is a member of the cytohesin family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that activate ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family GTPases. These proteins are involved in essential cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and cell signaling (Wang2024Integrated). CYTH4 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it plays a role in actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, and migration (Herlemann2018Inhibition).

In healthy human cells, CYTH4 is widely expressed in the brain, cerebellum, and spinal cord, suggesting a role in the central nervous system (Rezazadeh2015A). Although the specific function of CYTH4 in healthy cells is not fully understood, it is known to interact with several proteins involved in protein sorting and membrane trafficking, such as UNC50, SLC25A3, and XPO1 (Rezazadeh2015A). These interactions indicate that CYTH4 may be involved in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways and membrane dynamics, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function. The evolutionary trend and functional implications of the GTTT-repeat in the CYTH4 gene core promoter also suggest a potential role in psychiatric disorders, although this is more related to disease states than normal function (Rezazadeh2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CYTH4 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and hematological disorders. In schizophrenia, a primate-specific GTTT-repeat in the core promoter of CYTH4 has been associated with the disease. Novel alleles with 10 and 11 repeats were identified, with the 11-repeat allele being exclusive to schizophrenia patients, suggesting a potential "disease-only" genotype (Khademi2017Support). In bipolar disorder, the 6-repeat allele of this GTTT-repeat is linked to type I bipolar disorder, while longer alleles appear protective against the condition (Rezazadeh2015A).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CYTH4 is significantly upregulated, and high expression levels are associated with poor overall survival and event-free survival. This suggests CYTH4 as a potential prognostic biomarker in AML, with its expression levels providing insights into patient outcomes and treatment strategies (Wang2024Integrated). In ovarian cancer, CYTH4 is upregulated in metastatic tissues and is associated with worse survival outcomes. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and immune regulation, indicating a role in the tumor microenvironment (Zhang2020Clinical).
