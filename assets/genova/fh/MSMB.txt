# MSMB

## Overview
The MSMB gene encodes microseminoprotein beta, a small, cysteine-rich protein primarily secreted by the prostate gland and found abundantly in seminal plasma. This protein, also known as PSP94 or β-inhibin, is a member of the immunoglobulin binding factor family and is characterized by a rich beta-sheet structure, which suggests a role in binding activities and local immunity (Kamada1998βMicroseminoproteinprostatic; Ghasriani2006Solution). While its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated, MSMB is implicated in modulating immune responses and influencing reproductive functions. It is also involved in interactions with various proteins, including those related to prostate cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Whitaker2009The). Variants in the MSMB gene, such as the SNP rs10993994, have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and male infertility, underscoring its clinical significance (Whitaker2010The; Wu2013Association).

## Structure
The MSMB (microseminoprotein beta) protein is characterized by a rich beta-sheet structure, with a molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which is highly variable between species, although ten cysteine residues are conserved (Ghasriani2006Solution). The secondary structure of MSMB includes a four-stranded beta-sheet arranged in a Greek key motif in the N-terminal domain, and two two-stranded beta-sheets in the C-terminal domain (Ghasriani2006Solution). These domains are connected by a peptide backbone and a disulfide bond, contributing to the protein's stability (Ghasriani2006Solution).

The tertiary structure of MSMB is a compact, globular form stabilized by disulfide bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Ghasriani2006Solution). The quaternary structure involves the potential formation of dimers, as MSMB can exist as a homodimer in solution (Coste2021Three‐dimensional). The protein's surface is characterized by a negatively charged region, which may play a role in species-specific binding partner recognition (Ghasriani2006Solution). These structural features are crucial for understanding the biological function of MSMB, particularly its interactions with other proteins.

## Function
The MSMB gene encodes β-microseminoprotein, a protein primarily secreted by the prostate and found abundantly in seminal plasma. This protein, also known as PSP94 or β-inhibin, is involved in various molecular processes, including modulating immune responses and potentially influencing reproductive functions. Although initially thought to suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion, this activity was later questioned, and the exact biological role of MSMB remains unclear (Kamada1998βMicroseminoproteinprostatic; Ulvsbäck1989Molecular).

MSMB is characterized by a highly charged and cysteine-rich structure, which suggests a role in binding activities, particularly under reducing conditions. It is a member of the immunoglobulin binding factor family, indicating a potential function in local immunity by interacting with immunoglobulins (Kamada1998βMicroseminoproteinprostatic). The protein is not exclusive to the prostate, as transcripts have been detected in respiratory tissues and the gastric mucosa, suggesting broader physiological roles (Ulvsbäck1989Molecular).

In terms of cellular activity, MSMB is active in the extracellular space, where it may influence cell signaling pathways. Its presence in blood and gastric juice implies a systemic role beyond the male reproductive system, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its functions (Ulvsbäck1989Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The MSMB gene, encoding microseminoprotein beta, is clinically significant due to its association with prostate cancer and male infertility. Variants in the MSMB gene, particularly the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10993994, have been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer. This SNP is located in the promoter region of MSMB and is associated with decreased expression of the MSMB protein, PSP94, in both normal and malignant prostate tissues (Pomerantz2010Analysis; Whitaker2010The). The reduced expression of MSMB is thought to contribute to tumorigenesis by altering transcription factor binding and reducing promoter activity (Whitaker2010The).

In prostate cancer, MSMB expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to benign tissues, and this loss of expression may be an early event in cancer development (Whitaker2010The). The rs10993994 variant is also associated with idiopathic infertility, particularly azoospermia, where it results in lower MSMB expression levels (Wu2013Association). The T allele of this variant is linked to a higher risk of spermatogenic failure, suggesting a role for MSMB in male fertility (Wu2013Association). These findings highlight the potential of MSMB as a biomarker for prostate cancer risk and diagnosis.

## Interactions
MSMB (microseminoprotein beta) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of prostate cancer. It interacts with cell surface receptors such as the 37 kDa laminin receptor precursor (37LRP), which is implicated in tumor metastasis. The peptide PCK3145, derived from MSMB, can inhibit MMP9 secretion and promote CD44 shedding, indicating a role in modulating cell adhesion and migration processes (Whitaker2009The).

MSMB also binds to proteins in serum, such as the MSMB-binding protein (PSPBP or CRISP-9), which may regulate its bioavailability. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which MSMB's activity is modulated in the bloodstream (Whitaker2009The). Additionally, CRISP-3, another member of the cysteine-rich secretory protein family, binds to MSMB, indicating a common binding motif among these proteins (Whitaker2009The).

These interactions highlight MSMB's potential role in regulating prostate cancer progression and its utility as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis. The protein's ability to interact with various receptors and binding proteins underscores its significance in cellular signaling and tumor biology (Whitaker2009The).
