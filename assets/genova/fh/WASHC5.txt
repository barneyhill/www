# WASHC5

## Overview
The WASHC5 gene encodes the protein strumpellin, a vital component of the WASH complex, which is involved in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. Strumpellin is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating intracellular trafficking. The WASH complex, which includes strumpellin, is essential for the formation of actin filaments on endosomes, thereby influencing the recycling of membrane proteins and maintaining endosomal morphology (Derivery2009The). Mutations in WASHC5 have been linked to various neurodegenerative and developmental disorders, such as Spastic Paraplegia 8 (SPG8) and Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome 1 (RTSC1), highlighting its clinical significance (Clemen2021N471D; Song2018Expression). The protein's interactions with other components of the WASH complex and its involvement in actin dynamics underscore its critical role in cellular processes and organismal health (Alekhina2017Cellular; Jia2010WASH).

## Structure
The WASHC5 gene encodes the protein strumpellin, a core component of the WASH complex, which is involved in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. Strumpellin is composed of 1,159 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 134 kDa (Clemen2021N471D; Song2018Expression). The protein can be divided into three main parts based on its predicted secondary structure: an N-terminal domain (residues 1-240), a central domain containing five spectrin-like repeats (residues 241-791), and a C-terminal domain (Lee2020Hereditary; Song2018Expression).

The central domain's spectrin-like repeats are crucial for protein-protein interactions within the WASH complex (Clemen2021N471D). These repeats are composed of three α-helices each, contributing to the protein's structural stability and function (Lee2020Hereditary). The WASH complex, including strumpellin, forms a pentameric assembly with other proteins such as WASHC1, FAM21, CCDC53, and SWIP, highlighting its quaternary structure (Song2018Expression).

Mutations in WASHC5, such as the N471D mutation, are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia type SPG8, affecting the protein's function in the endolysosomal system (Clemen2021N471D; Song2018Expression). The protein's structure and function are also influenced by splice variants, which can lead to structural and functional diversity (Gao2023Case).

## Function
WASHC5, also known as WASH complex subunit 5, is a critical component of the WASH complex, which plays a significant role in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting in human cells. This complex is involved in the formation of actin filaments on endosomes, facilitating the fission of transport intermediates and the recycling of membrane proteins, such as transferrin, to the plasma membrane (Derivery2009The). The WASH complex activates the Arp2/3 complex, promoting the nucleation of branched actin networks on endosomal membranes, which is essential for maintaining endosome morphology and dynamics (Derivery2009The).

WASHC5 is also involved in coordinating the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, which is crucial for the formation and fission of membrane tubules (Derivery2009The). The protein's activity is necessary for efficient intracellular trafficking and endosomal sorting, processes that are vital for cellular homeostasis and proper cell signaling (Jia2010WASH; Rottner2010WASH). The WASH complex's function in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function, with implications for organismal health and disease prevention.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WASHC5 gene, which encodes the strumpellin protein, are associated with several neurodegenerative and developmental disorders. One notable condition linked to WASHC5 mutations is Spastic Paraplegia 8 (SPG8), an autosomal dominant form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). SPG8 is characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs due to upper motor neuron degeneration. The N471D mutation in WASHC5 is specifically implicated in SPG8, leading to symptoms such as upper limb ataxia, muscle wasting, and urinary bladder-control problems in some patients (Clemen2021N471D; Song2018Expression).

A novel splice variant (c.712-2A>G) in WASHC5 has also been identified in a patient with spastic paraplegia, resulting in aberrant mRNA splicing and altered protein structure. This variant is associated with phenotypic variability in SPG8, including asymmetric spasticity and other unique symptoms (Gao2023Case).

In addition to SPG8, WASHC5 mutations are linked to Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome 1 (RTSC1), a developmental disorder with craniofacial, cerebellar, and cardiac abnormalities (Clemen2021N471D). These findings underscore the clinical significance of WASHC5 in neurodegenerative and developmental pathologies.

## Interactions
WASHC5, also known as strumpellin, is a component of the WASH complex, which plays a crucial role in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. It interacts with several proteins within this complex, including FAM21, SWIP, and CCDC53, forming the SHRC (Strumpellin and HSP-related complex) (Alekhina2017Cellular; Jia2010WASH). This complex is structurally similar to the WAVE regulatory complex and is involved in regulating actin dynamics through interactions with the Arp2/3 complex (Rottner2010WASH; Derivery2009The).

WASHC5 also interacts with caveolin-1 (CAV1), a key component of caveolae, inhibiting its lysosomal degradation and playing a role in integrin recycling and cell adhesion (Lee2020Hereditary). The interaction between WASHC5 and CAV1 is crucial for maintaining CAV1 and integrin protein levels, linking WASHC5 mutations to impaired cell adhesion (Lee2020Hereditary).

In addition, WASHC5 is associated with VCP (TERA), a protein implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, although the N471D mutation in WASHC5 does not alter the abundance of VCP or other binding partners (Clemen2021N471D). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of WASHC5 in cellular processes related to actin dynamics and protein quality control.
