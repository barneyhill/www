# ZNF563

## Overview
ZNF563 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 563, a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are often involved in binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, and they play critical roles in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and cell differentiation. The specific functions and interactions of zinc finger protein 563 remain to be fully elucidated, but like other zinc finger proteins, it is likely involved in the regulation of gene expression and may participate in complex cellular pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
