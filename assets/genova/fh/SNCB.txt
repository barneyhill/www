# SNCB

## Overview
The SNCB gene encodes the protein beta-synuclein, a member of the synuclein family, which is predominantly expressed in the brain and plays a crucial role in synaptic function and neuronal plasticity. Beta-synuclein is characterized as a presynaptic protein that modulates neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle trafficking, thereby maintaining synaptic integrity (GámezValero2018Alternative). Unlike its homolog alpha-synuclein, beta-synuclein is non-amyloidogenic due to structural differences, including the absence of an 11 amino acid stretch in its central region, which contributes to its anti-aggregant properties (GámezValero2018Alternative; Beyer2011Alpha). This protein is involved in the regulation of nerve terminal function and has been shown to inhibit the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, thus playing a protective role against neurodegenerative processes (Beyer2011Alpha). Mutations in the SNCB gene have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Fujita2010A; Fujita2012Possible).

## Structure
The SNCB gene encodes the protein beta-synuclein, which is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a role in synaptic function. Beta-synuclein is a 134 amino acid protein with a structure that includes an N-terminal lysine-rich amphipathic alpha-helix domain, a central hydrophobic non-amyloid beta component (NAC) domain, and a C-terminal acidic region (Xiao2023Intragenic). The N-terminal region shares 90% homology with alpha-synuclein, but beta-synuclein lacks an 11 amino acid stretch in the central region, which contributes to its non-amyloidogenic properties (GámezValero2018Alternative; Beyer2011Alpha). This deletion, along with a higher number of proline residues, increases its α-helical propensity and stabilizes its intrinsically disordered state, inhibiting oligomerization (GámezValero2018Alternative).

Beta-synuclein does not spontaneously undergo phase separation under tested conditions, unlike alpha-synuclein, and it is less prone to fibrillation at physiological pH (Jain2018Comparative; Li2024βsynuclein). The protein can form oligomers, indicating a quaternary structure, and has splice variant isoforms that may affect its function (Xiao2023Intragenic). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation and ubiquitination (Xiao2023Intragenic).

## Function
Beta-synuclein (SNCB) is a presynaptic protein primarily expressed in neural tissue, where it plays a significant role in synaptic function and neuronal plasticity. It is involved in modulating neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle trafficking, contributing to the maintenance of synaptic integrity (GámezValero2018Alternative). SNCB acts as a natural anti-aggregant to alpha-synuclein (SNCA), inhibiting its aggregation and reducing its toxicity. This is due to structural differences, particularly in the central region and C-terminal of the protein, which contribute to its anti-amyloidogenic properties (GámezValero2018Alternative).

In healthy human cells, beta-synuclein can compensate for the absence of alpha-synuclein, as observed in double knockout mice, which do not show significant synaptic alterations. This suggests that beta-synuclein is crucial for maintaining synaptic function, particularly in the absence of alpha-synuclein (GámezValero2018Alternative). Beta-synuclein is also involved in the long-term regulation and maintenance of nerve terminal function, although it is not essential for neurotransmitter release (GámezValero2018Alternative). The protein's ability to inhibit alpha-synuclein aggregation and maintain proteasomal activity is vital for normal neuronal function and preventing neurodegenerative processes (Beyer2011Alpha).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SNCB gene, which encodes β-synuclein, have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, particularly dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The P123H mutation in β-synuclein is associated with familial DLB and is known to cause neurodegeneration when expressed in transgenic mouse models. This mutation leads to a toxic gain of function, converting β-synuclein from a neuroprotective to a neurotoxic molecule, which can exacerbate α-synuclein pathology by promoting its aggregation (Fujita2010A; Fujita2012Possible).

The V70M mutation in β-synuclein has also been linked to rare cases of DLB. Both P123H and V70M mutations can lead to increased β-synuclein inclusion formation and may enhance α-synuclein-associated neurodegeneration, particularly when co-expressed with α-synuclein (GámezValero2018Alternative; Tenreiro2015Yeast).

Alterations in β-synuclein expression levels or its interactions with α-synuclein can influence the progression of synucleinopathies. β-synuclein generally inhibits α-synuclein aggregation, but mutations can disrupt this protective role, contributing to neurodegenerative processes (Hashimoto2004An).

## Interactions
Beta-synuclein (SNCB) is known for its interactions with other synuclein family members, particularly alpha-synuclein (AS). SNCB can act as a chaperone for AS, inhibiting its fibrillation in a concentration-dependent manner. A 1:4 molar ratio of alpha to beta-synuclein significantly reduces AS fibrillation, highlighting the inhibitory role of SNCB (Jain2018Comparative). The interactions between alpha- and beta-synuclein are characterized by weak binding affinities, as revealed by techniques such as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (Jain2018Comparative). Despite the weak binding, SNCB effectively inhibits AS fibril formation, aggregation, and neurotoxicity through direct interaction (GámezValero2018Alternative).

SNCB also interacts with gamma-synuclein, showing stronger interactions compared to those with alpha-synuclein. This interaction is significant in the context of synuclein-related pathologies, as SNCB can inhibit the fibrillation of gamma-synuclein as well (Jain2018Comparative). The presence of SNCB alters the fibril morphologies of alpha-synuclein, resulting in shorter, clumped fibrils compared to alpha-synuclein alone (Jain2018Comparative). These interactions are crucial for understanding the role of SNCB in neurodegenerative diseases and its potential therapeutic implications.
