# THBS3

## Overview
THBS3 is a gene that encodes the protein thrombospondin 3, a member of the thrombospondin family of matricellular glycoproteins. Thrombospondin 3 is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein involved in cell-matrix interactions, playing a significant role in processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. It is particularly noted for its involvement in angiogenesis and tissue repair, as well as its regulatory effects on integrin trafficking, which influence membrane stability and cellular communication (Carlson2008Thrombospondins:; Schips2019Thrombospondin3). The protein's unique EGD motif distinguishes it from other thrombospondins and is crucial for its function in modulating integrin activity, impacting both cardiovascular health and disease progression in conditions such as osteosarcoma and osteoarthritis (Yan2024The; Schips2019Thrombospondin3).

## Structure
Thrombospondin-3 (THBS3) is a member of the thrombospondin family, which are matricellular glycoproteins involved in cell-matrix interactions. THBS3 is part of Group B thrombospondins, which form pentamers and are characterized by the presence of additional epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (Carlson2008Thrombospondins:). The protein structure includes a signature domain with EGF-like repeats and a unique insertion in the calcium-binding wire, which may influence its structural properties (Carlson2008Thrombospondins:).

THBS3 contains a conserved EGD motif, which is distinct from the RGD/KGD motifs found in other thrombospondins. This motif plays a role in negatively regulating integrin trafficking, affecting membrane stability and turnover (Schips2019Thrombospondin3). The EGD motif's impact on integrin trafficking is significant, as mutating it to RGD reverses its inhibitory effect (Schips2019Thrombospondin3).

THBS3 is known for its role in promoting sarcolemmal destabilization by reducing integrin function, which can exacerbate cardiac disease-induced decompensation (Schips2019Thrombospondin3). The protein's involvement in integrin trafficking and membrane stability highlights its unique function within the thrombospondin family (Schips2019Thrombospondin3).

## Function
Thrombospondin 3 (THBS3) is a member of the thrombospondin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins that play a crucial role in cell-matrix interactions. In healthy human cells, THBS3 is involved in regulating cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, which are essential for normal tissue development and repair processes (DallaTorre2006Effects). THBS3 contributes to the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix, facilitating cell communication and maintaining tissue architecture (DallaTorre2006Effects).

THBS3 is particularly important in angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, which is critical for supplying nutrients and oxygen to tissues and for wound healing (DallaTorre2006Effects). The protein's involvement in inflammation suggests it may play a role in the body's response to injury or infection, modulating immune cell activity and tissue repair processes (DallaTorre2006Effects).

In the context of cardiac function, THBS3 is known to promote sarcolemmal destabilization by reducing integrin function, which can lead to membrane instability. This activity is significant in the heart, where integrins are crucial for maintaining cell membrane integrity (AuguściakDuma2021mRNA). The protein's interactions with integrins influence cell adhesion and membrane stability, impacting cardiovascular health (AuguściakDuma2021mRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the THBS3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cardiac and musculoskeletal conditions. In the context of cardiac health, increased expression of THBS3 is associated with exacerbated cardiac pathology, including injury-induced cardiomyopathy. THBS3 overexpression in cardiomyocytes leads to sarcolemmal destabilization by reducing integrin membrane residence, which contributes to increased cardiac hypertrophy, ventricular remodeling, and fibrosis following cardiac stress or injury (Schips2019Thrombospondin3). Conversely, low THBS3 expression in peripheral blood is linked to an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for this condition (Chen2022Correlation).

In osteosarcoma, high levels of THBS3 expression are significantly associated with metastasis at diagnosis, indicating a role in tumor progression and poor survival outcomes (DallaTorre2006Effects). In osteoarthritis, THBS3 is upregulated in cartilage tissue, where it promotes cartilage degradation and vascularization, contributing to disease progression through the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway (Yan2024The). These findings highlight the diverse roles of THBS3 in disease pathogenesis across different tissues.

## Interactions
Thrombospondin-3 (THBS3) is known to interact with integrins, which are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling. THBS3 expression increases after cardiac injury, leading to reduced sarcolemmal residence of integrin subunits, destabilizing the membrane, and exacerbating cardiac disease (Schips2019Thrombospondin3). This interaction is mediated by an EGD motif in THBS3, which inhibits integrin membrane trafficking, contrasting with the RGD/KGD motifs found in other thrombospondins like THBS4 and THBS5 (Schips2019Thrombospondin3). Overexpression of THBS3 reduces the exit of α5 integrin from the Golgi, while THBS4 enhances it (Schips2019Thrombospondin3).

THBS3 also interacts with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones and transcriptional targets such as ATF6α, BiP, and CRT, suggesting a role in the ER stress response (Schips2019Thrombospondin3). It is found within the β1D integrin vesicular fraction, indicating a direct interaction with integrins (Schips2019Thrombospondin3). The EGD domain of THBS3 is crucial for its inhibitory function on integrins, and mutating it to an RGD sequence enhances integrin trafficking (Schips2019Thrombospondin3). These interactions highlight THBS3's role in integrin regulation and its impact on cardiac pathology through membrane instability.
