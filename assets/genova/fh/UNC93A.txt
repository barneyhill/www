# UNC93A

## Overview
UNC93A is a gene located on chromosome 6q27 that encodes the unc-93 homolog A protein, which is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of proteins. This protein is characterized by its 12 potential transmembrane helices and is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to membrane localization and signaling (Ceder2017The). The unc-93 homolog A protein is expressed in multiple human tissues, including the testis, small intestine, and spleen, and is associated with the cell membrane, suggesting roles in cellular signaling or transport (Liu2002The). Although its precise function in humans remains to be fully elucidated, UNC93A is phylogenetically related to solute carriers and is implicated in protein trafficking, nutrient sensing, and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ceder2017The). The gene's expression is responsive to nutrient availability, indicating potential involvement in regulating ion transport and cellular membrane potential (Ceder2020CG4928).

## Structure
The UNC93A protein is characterized by a molecular structure that includes 12 potential transmembrane helices, a feature common in Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) proteins (Ceder2017The). The secondary and tertiary structures of human UNC93A have been modeled, revealing a globular protein with helices packed to form a pore, similar to other putative solute carrier proteins (Ceder2017The). The protein is predicted to have a shorter N-terminus and C-terminus compared to its related protein, UNC93B1 (Ceder2017The). 

UNC93A is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 6q27, consisting of 8 exons, and is expressed in various tissues (Liu2002The). The protein has a predicted molecular weight of 50 kDa, although in vivo studies suggest it may be approximately 60 kDa due to potential post-translational modifications (Liu2002The). There are three known isoforms of UNC93A in humans, with one N-linked glycosylation site (Ceder2017The). Two splice variants have been identified, one containing all 8 exons and another missing exon 4 (Liu2002The). The protein localizes to the membrane when expressed as a GFP fusion protein (Liu2002The).

## Function
The UNC93A gene encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, particularly related to membrane localization and potential signaling roles. In healthy human cells, UNC93A is expressed in multiple tissues, including the testis, small intestine, colon, spleen, prostate, and ovary, and is localized to the membrane, suggesting a role in cellular signaling or transport (Liu2002The). The protein is predicted to have seven transmembrane domains, indicating its association with the cell membrane and potential involvement in membrane-related functions (Liu2002The).

UNC93A is phylogenetically related to solute carriers of the major facilitator superfamily and is suggested to be involved in protein trafficking and nutrient sensing, particularly in response to amino acid deprivation and starvation (Ceder2017The). The gene's expression is responsive to nutrient availability, which may indicate a role in regulating ion transport and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ceder2017The). Although its exact function in humans is not fully elucidated, UNC93A's expression pattern and membrane association suggest it may play a role in processes involving membrane proteins, potentially influencing ion flows and cellular membrane potential (Ceder2020CG4928).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UNC93A gene have been implicated in various neurological and metabolic disorders. In a study of a Peruvian family with a history of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, a specific mutation in UNC93A (V409I) was identified. This mutation affects the protein's interaction with the cell membrane, reducing its capacity for ion exchange and ligand interaction, which may contribute to neurological disorders by impacting brain homeostasis (Alvarez2023Cooccurring). The study also found that co-occurring mutations in UNC93A and WDR27 genes affect the neurovascular unit of the brain, potentially leading to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis by disrupting autophagy and metabolic pathways crucial for amyloid-beta clearance (Alvarez2023Cooccurring).

UNC93A expression is also responsive to nutrient availability, with changes observed during amino acid deprivation and starvation in mice. This suggests a potential link to metabolic conditions, as alterations in UNC93A expression may influence cellular metabolism and stress responses (Ceder2017The). While direct associations with specific diseases are not fully established, the gene's expression pattern and response to nutrient changes indicate a possible role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease (Ceder2017The).

## Interactions
UNC93A is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It acts as a regulatory subunit for TASK 1 channels in C. elegans and potentially interacts with human KCNK family potassium transporters, specifically KCNK3 and KCNK9. This interaction was demonstrated through co-localization studies in SH-SY5Y cells using immunocytochemistry and proximity ligation assays, suggesting a role in modulating these channels (Ceder2020CG4928). 

In the context of neurological disorders, UNC93A has been implicated in interactions affecting brain homeostasis. A variant of UNC93A, V409I, was found to alter the protein's interaction with the cell membrane, impacting ion exchange and ligand interactions, which may contribute to neurological conditions (Alvarez2023Cooccurring). 

UNC93A is also suggested to be involved in the trafficking or retention of TASK 1 channels to the plasma membrane, indicating a regulatory role rather than direct transport activity (Ceder2020CG4928). These interactions highlight UNC93A's potential involvement in maintaining ion homeostasis and its broader implications in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
