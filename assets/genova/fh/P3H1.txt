# P3H1

## Overview
The P3H1 gene encodes the enzyme prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1, which is a member of the 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase superfamily. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of collagen, specifically through the hydroxylation of proline residues, which is crucial for the stability and proper folding of collagen triple helices (Chang2009Prolyl; Hudson2013Collagen). Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 functions as part of a ternary complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB), also known as cyclophilin B, within the endoplasmic reticulum. This complex is essential for collagen processing and the maintenance of connective tissue integrity (Wu2019Characterization). Mutations in the P3H1 gene are linked to osteogenesis imperfecta type VIII, a severe connective tissue disorder characterized by brittle bones and increased fracture susceptibility (Mikhail2023Milder).

## Structure
The P3H1 protein, also known as prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1, is a crucial component of the P3H1/CRTAP/PPIB ternary complex involved in collagen processing. The primary structure of P3H1 includes a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, with specific domains contributing to its function. The protein contains a carboxyl-terminal dioxygenase domain responsible for its enzymatic activity, specifically hydroxylating proline residues in collagen (Wu2019Characterization). This domain is part of the 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase superfamily and features a 'jelly roll' motif with double-stranded β-sheets that coordinate Fe2+ ions, essential for its oxidation activity (Li2024The).

The secondary structure of P3H1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) connected by a long N-C linker helix (Li2024The). The NTD contains four-cysteine (CXXXC) repeats, which may function as a disulfide isomerase in the endoplasmic reticulum (Wu2019Characterization).

In terms of quaternary structure, P3H1 forms a ternary complex with CRTAP and PPIB, exhibiting a 1:1:1 stoichiometry and a total molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons (Li2024The). The complex features an 'X'-shaped base formed by CRTAP and the NTD of P3H1, with PPIB and the CTD of P3H1 positioned on top (Li2024The). The protein's quaternary structure is essential for its role in collagen processing, with P3H1 identified as the core prolyl 3-hydroxylase (Li2024The).

## Function
Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of collagen within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. It is part of the collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex, which includes cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and cyclophilin B (CyPB). This complex is responsible for the 3-hydroxylation of proline residues, specifically the Pro986 residue on the α1(I) and α1(II) collagen chains, a modification essential for the stability and proper folding of collagen triple helices (Chang2009Prolyl; Hudson2013Collagen).

P3H1 functions as both an enzyme and a chaperone, preventing premature aggregation of collagen chains during protein synthesis. It is retained in the ER by its KDEL sequence, which also helps retain CRTAP, indicating its role in maintaining the stability of the collagen modification complex (Chang2009Prolyl). The mutual stabilization of P3H1 and CRTAP is crucial for the proper function of the complex, as the absence of either protein leads to severe osteogenesis imperfecta, characterized by brittle bones (Chang2009Prolyl; Marini2007Components). P3H1's activity is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues, ensuring proper collagen assembly and stability (Hudson2013Collagen).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the P3H1 gene are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type VIII, a severe hereditary connective tissue disorder characterized by brittle bones and increased fracture susceptibility. This condition is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in P3H1, which lead to reduced or absent P3H1 mRNA levels, resulting in severe skeletal anomalies and sometimes neonatal lethality (Mikhail2023Milder). The P3H1 gene encodes prolyl-3-hydroxylase-1, an enzyme crucial for the post-translational modification of collagen type I chains. The absence of functional P3H1 leads to overmodification of collagen chains, contributing to structural abnormalities seen in OI type VIII (Kantaputra2023A).

Specific mutations, such as the homozygous missense mutation c.2141A>G (p.Lys714Arg) and the intronic variant leading to aberrant splicing, have been identified in patients of Karen descent, suggesting a founder effect in this population (Kantaputra2021A; Kantaputra2023A). These mutations result in clinical manifestations including generalized osteopenia, short stature, and multiple fractures (Kantaputra2023A). Additionally, dental anomalies such as hypodontia and single-rooted molars have been reported in patients with P3H1 mutations, marking the first time such dental anomalies have been associated with this gene (Kantaputra2021A).

## Interactions
Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) is a key component of a ternary complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, interacting with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB), also known as cyclophilin B. This complex is essential for the prolyl 3-hydroxylation and proper folding of procollagens. The KDEL sequence in P3H1 is crucial for retaining the complex within the endoplasmic reticulum; its absence results in the secretion of P3H1 and CRTAP, highlighting their interdependent relationship (Wu2019Characterization).

P3H1 and CRTAP are mutually stabilizing, with the absence of one leading to the degradation or secretion of the other. This mutual stabilization is critical for maintaining the integrity of the collagen modification complex (Chang2009Prolyl). The N-terminal domain of P3H1, containing a four-cysteine repeat, is important for its interaction with CRTAP and is suggested to function as a disulfide isomerase, playing a significant role in stabilizing the complex (Wu2019Characterization).

PPIB interacts with the P3H1/CRTAP complex, with its binding surface largely covered by these proteins, although its substrate-binding site remains accessible, allowing it to retain its prolyl cis-trans isomerase function (Wu2019Characterization).
