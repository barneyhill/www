# OR2L3

## Overview
The OR2L3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily L member 3, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules and is a subset of the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are characterized by their seven transmembrane domain structure. Olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR2L3, play a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. The OR2L3 gene is located on chromosome 1 and is one of many olfactory receptor genes that contribute to the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception in humans (Qiu2020aarFDC).
