# CYP7A1

## Overview
CYP7A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. This enzyme is integral to the liver's metabolic processes, specifically catalyzing the conversion of cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol, which is the initial and rate-limiting step in the classical pathway of bile acid synthesis (Tempel2014Structural; Chiang2020Up). As a monooxygenase, cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase plays a pivotal role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and facilitating the digestion and absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins (Chiang2020Up). The enzyme's activity is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms involving nuclear receptors and feedback from bile acids, ensuring metabolic balance and preventing the accumulation of toxic intermediates (Chiang2020Up). Mutations and polymorphisms in the CYP7A1 gene can lead to significant clinical implications, including hypercholesterolemia and increased risk of coronary artery disease, underscoring its importance in cardiovascular health (Iwanicki2019The; Pullinger2002Human).

## Structure
The human gene CYP7A1 encodes a protein that is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, characterized by a typical P450-fold. This structure includes a conserved core of helices D, E, I, and L surrounding the heme prosthetic group, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Tempel2014Structural). The protein's active site is buried within the protein core, with a preformed cavity above the heme connected to the surface through a channel, facilitating substrate access (Tempel2014Structural).

CYP7A1's secondary structure is composed of alpha-helices, including a notable kink in the I helix that disrupts the G helix, forming a separate G'' helix (Tempel2014Structural). The B'-helix is approximately perpendicular to the heme plane and contains polar residues like Thr104 and Ser105, which are involved in substrate recognition (Tempel2014Structural). The protein does not typically form quaternary structures, functioning as a monomer.

The enzyme's active site includes key residues such as Asn288, which interacts with the steroid 3β-hydroxyl group, and Trp283, which acts as a lid to maintain cholesterol near the heme (Mast2005Cholesterol). These structural features contribute to the enzyme's substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency.

## Function
The CYP7A1 gene encodes cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, a crucial enzyme in the liver responsible for the conversion of cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol, the first and rate-limiting step in the classical pathway of bile acid synthesis (Tempel2014Structural; Chiang2020Up). This enzyme is located in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and is substrate-specific, only metabolizing cholesterol (Chiang2020Up). The conversion of cholesterol to bile acids is essential for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and facilitating the digestion and absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins (Tempel2014Structural; Chiang2020Up).

CYP7A1 activity is tightly regulated by various factors, including nuclear receptors and feedback mechanisms involving bile acids, which help maintain cholesterol balance and prevent the accumulation of toxic intermediates (Chiang2020Up). The enzyme's regulation is also influenced by signaling pathways activated by factors such as FGF19 and cytokines like TNFα, which can inhibit its expression (Chiang2020Up). In healthy human cells, CYP7A1 plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, and its proper function is crucial for metabolic health (Chiang2020Up).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYP7A1 gene, which encodes cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, are associated with several clinical conditions. A specific homozygous deletion mutation, 1302-1303delTT, results in a frameshift (L413fsX414) that leads to a loss of enzyme function. This mutation is linked to a hypercholesterolemic phenotype, characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol levels, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and premature gallstone disease. Individuals with this mutation exhibit elevated hepatic cholesterol content and deficient bile acid excretion, leading to resistance to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly used to lower LDL cholesterol levels (Pullinger2002Human).

CYP7A1 polymorphisms also influence lipid metabolism and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. The rs3808607 variant is associated with altered serum cholesterol and LDL levels, while the rs11786580 variant is linked to increased myocardial infarction risk, particularly in male patients (Iwanicki2019The). The -204A > C polymorphism affects serum lipid levels, with the AC genotype associated with higher triglyceride levels and the CC genotype linked to higher total cholesterol and LDL-C levels (Cai2014Relationship). These genetic variations highlight the role of CYP7A1 in cholesterol homeostasis and its impact on cardiovascular health.

## Interactions
CYP7A1 interacts with several transcription factors and complexes that regulate its expression. Prox1, a transcription factor, plays a significant role in repressing CYP7A1 transcription by recruiting the LSD1/NuRD complex to its promoter. This complex includes LSD1, HDAC2, RbAp46, MBD3, and MTA2. Prox1 directly interacts with LSD1, facilitating the recruitment of the entire complex, which leads to the demethylation of H3K4me2 and reduced transcriptional activity of CYP7A1 (Ouyang2013Prox1). Knockdown of Prox1 results in decreased occupancy of LSD1 and HDAC2 on the CYP7A1 promoter, increased H3K4 methylation, and elevated CYP7A1 transcription (Ouyang2013Prox1).

HNF4 and COUP-TFII are other transcription factors that interact with the CYP7A1 promoter. HNF4 binds to a conserved DR1 element, while COUP-TFII binds to adjacent sequences. These factors synergistically activate CYP7A1 transcription through protein-protein interactions, despite overlapping binding sites (Stroup2000HNF4). COUP-TFII variants can modulate this interaction, with COUP-TFII-V1 enhancing and COUP-TFII-V2 inhibiting CYP7A1 transcription by affecting the binding of HNF4α and COUP-TFII-V1 to the promoter (Yamazaki2013The).
