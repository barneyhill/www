# DTX2

## Overview
DTX2, or deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Deltex family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of protein turnover and signaling pathways through its ubiquitin ligase activity. DTX2 is characterized by a conserved three-domain structure, including a WWE domain, a proline-rich region, and a RING-H2 domain, which are essential for its interactions and functions in cellular processes (Wang2021Functions; Scalia2023The). The protein is involved in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, DNA damage response, and various developmental processes such as myogenesis and neurogenesis (Wang2021Functions; Scalia2023The). Clinically, DTX2 has been implicated in several cancers, including glioma and colorectal cancer, where its expression is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2024DTX2; Scalia2023The).

## Structure
The human DTX2 protein is part of the Deltex family of ubiquitin E3 ligases and is characterized by a conserved three-domain structure. The N-terminal region of DTX2 contains a tandem WWE domain, which is involved in binding to the ankyrin repeat sequences of the Notch receptor, playing a crucial role in Notch signaling regulation (Wang2021Functions; Scalia2023The). Following the WWE domain, DTX2 has a proline-rich region, which is a constitutive component of DTX domain-II. This region is involved in NOTCH regulation, although it lacks the SH3 motif found in other DTX proteins, suggesting differences in cellular functions (Scalia2023The).

The C-terminal region of DTX2 contains a RING-H2 domain, responsible for its E3 ligase activity, characterized by a novel circular fold with eight conserved cysteine and histidine residues (Wang2021Functions). DTX2 also has a Deltex C-terminal (DTC) domain, which is crucial for binding PARylated substrate proteins and facilitating their ubiquitination (Wang2021Functions).

DTX2 has two major isoforms: a full-length variant and a shorter variant, differing by a proline-rich motif in Domain-II (Scalia2023The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its role in proliferative dysfunctions such as cancer (Scalia2023The).

## Function
DTX2 (deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 2) is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily through its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, where it facilitates the ubiquitination of target proteins, a process essential for protein turnover and regulation of signaling pathways (Scalia2023The). DTX2 is particularly involved in the ubiquitination process at DNA damage sites, where it interacts with PAR polymerase 1 (PARP1) to promote PAR chain formation on target proteins, including itself. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination of PARylated substrate proteins, which is mediated by the RING domain of DTX2 (Wang2021Functions).

DTX2 also plays a significant role in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, which is vital for cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The protein contains a WWE domain that binds to the ankyrin repeats of the Notch receptor, suggesting its involvement in modulating Notch signaling (Scalia2023The). In addition, DTX2 is implicated in myogenesis and neurogenesis, indicating its importance in developmental processes (Scalia2023The). The protein's activity in these pathways underscores its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
The DTX2 gene has been implicated in various cancers, including glioma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer, due to its role as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. In glioma, DTX2 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Silencing DTX2 in glioma cells suppresses these oncogenic activities and induces apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2024DTX2). DTX2 interacts with the helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), a tumor suppressor, and downregulates its expression through ubiquitination, further contributing to glioma progression (Li2024DTX2).

In colorectal cancer, DTX2 expression is linked to post-surgical relapse and poor outcomes, promoting migration and invasion through AKT activation (Scalia2023The). DTX2's involvement in cancer is also highlighted by its interaction with NOTCH1 and its role in inhibiting Wnt signaling, which are pathways known for their roles in oncogenesis (Scalia2023The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DTX2 in cancer development and its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
DTX2, a member of the Deltex family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. DTX2 has been shown to physically interact with NOTCH1, a key component of the Notch signaling pathway, and inhibit Wnt signaling (Scalia2023The). This interaction is facilitated by the WWE domains of DTX2, which are known for binding to NOTCH ankyrin repeats (Scalia2023The).

In hepatocarcinoma cellular models, DTX2 interacts with the DNA-binding protein RFX6, affecting its own gene transcription and increasing NOTCH1 gene expression (Scalia2023The). DTX2 also interacts with the helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF) in glioma cells, promoting glioma development by inducing HLTF ubiquitination and decreasing its protein levels. This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies (Li2024DTX2).

DTX2 is involved in the DNA damage response, where it binds to poly-ADP-ribosylated (PAR) proteins through its WWE domains. This interaction is crucial for its role in ubiquitination processes and DNA repair pathways, as demonstrated by its presence at double-strand break sites (Kang2022Proteomewide).
