# CDSN

## Overview
The CDSN gene encodes the protein corneodesmosin, which is integral to the structural integrity and function of the skin barrier. Corneodesmosin is a glycoprotein predominantly expressed in the epidermis, where it plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion by being incorporated into desmosomes and corneodesmosomes. These structures are essential for the cohesion of keratinocytes, particularly in the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin. The protein is characterized by its high serine and glycine content, forming structural motifs that facilitate intermolecular adhesion, akin to a Velcro mechanism. Corneodesmosin undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are vital for its function. Mutations in the CDSN gene are linked to several skin disorders, such as peeling skin disease and hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp, highlighting its clinical significance in dermatology (van2019Mutations; Oji2010Loss; Jonca2010Corneodesmosin:).

## Structure
Corneodesmosin (CDSN) is a protein characterized by a high content of serine and glycine, particularly at its termini, forming structural motifs known as 'glycine loops' (Jonca2010Corneodesmosin:). These loops are believed to mediate intermolecular adhesion, functioning similarly to a Velcro mechanism, which is crucial for skin homeostasis (Jonca2010Corneodesmosin:). The primary structure of CDSN includes a 529-amino acid sequence with an N-terminal signal peptide and one putative N-glycosylation site, indicating that the protein is secreted and glycosylated (Jonca2010Corneodesmosin:). 

CDSN undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, with the oligosaccharide moiety comprising approximately 10% of the protein mass (Jonca2010Corneodesmosin:). The protein is also a basic phosphoprotein, suggesting phosphorylation as another modification (Jonca2010Corneodesmosin:). 

In terms of quaternary structure, CDSN can form stable homooligomers, and its N-terminal glycine loop domain is essential for its adhesive properties (Jonca2010Corneodesmosin:). The protein is covalently linked to the cornified envelope by disulfide bonds and other covalent links, although the exact nature of these links and the molecular partners involved remain unknown (Jonca2010Corneodesmosin:).

## Function
Corneodesmosin (CDSN) is a protein crucial for maintaining the integrity of the skin barrier. It is primarily expressed in the epidermis, where it plays a significant role in cell-cell adhesion through its incorporation into desmosomes and corneodesmosomes. These structures are essential for the cohesion of keratinocytes in the upper layers of the skin, particularly in the stratum corneum (Oji2010Loss; Jonca2010Corneodesmosin:).

CDSN is synthesized by keratinocytes in the middle epidermis and secreted into the extracellular space, where it associates with the desmosome core and the cornified cell envelope. This association is vital for the structural integrity and function of the skin barrier (Oji2010Loss). The protein's adhesive properties are largely attributed to its N-terminal glycine-rich domain, which facilitates intermolecular adhesion necessary for skin homeostasis (Jonca2010Corneodesmosin:).

In healthy human cells, CDSN contributes to the maintenance of skin integrity by preventing increased transepidermal water loss and the penetration of external substances. Its degradation by enzymes such as kallikrein 5 and 7 is necessary for the natural process of desquamation, allowing for the shedding of corneocytes and the renewal of the skin surface (Oji2010Loss; Jonca2010Corneodesmosin:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDSN gene, which encodes the protein corneodesmosin, are associated with several skin disorders. Peeling skin disease (PSD) is a rare genodermatosis caused by biallelic mutations in CDSN, leading to superficial exfoliation and a severe skin barrier defect. This condition is characterized by pruritus, atopy, and ichthyosiform erythroderma, with symptoms often exacerbated by seasonal variations and frequent Staphylococcus aureus superinfections (van2019Mutations; Oji2010Loss). 

Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp (HSS) is another condition linked to CDSN mutations. It is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive hair loss, resulting from monoallelic mutations in the gene. These mutations lead to toxic effects on hair follicles, causing hair loss without affecting the skin (van2019Mutations; Davalos2005A).

CDSN mutations are also implicated in inflammatory peeling skin syndrome (PSS), particularly the inflammatory type B, where a frameshift mutation leads to a truncated protein or mRNA decay, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Israeli2011Inflammatory). Additionally, a synonymous SNP in CDSN has been associated with increased mRNA stability and psoriasis susceptibility, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this chronic skin disorder (Capon2004A).

## Interactions
Corneodesmosin (CDSN) is a protein primarily involved in the stabilization of desmosomes, which are critical for maintaining the integrity of the epidermal barrier. CDSN is known to localize to the cornified cell envelope and plays a role in keratinocyte maturation (Ran2019Genetics). Although CDSN has been associated with psoriasis, its individual genetic effects are challenging to distinguish due to strong linkage with the HLA-C*06:02 allele (Ran2019Genetics).

The study by Bergboer et al. explored potential interactions between CDSN and late cornified envelope (LCE) proteins in the context of psoriasis. Despite partial colocalization of LCE2 and CDSN in both normal and psoriatic skin, no direct interactions were found between LCE proteins and CDSN variants using co-expression and GST pull-down assays (Bergboer2014Analysis). This suggests that while CDSN and LCE proteins are both present in the stratum corneum, their interaction may not be direct.

CDSN is also involved in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, sharing exon-intron organization with PSORS1C2 and C6ORF15, indicating a possible evolutionary relationship (Abbas2017Phylogenetic). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving CDSN remain to be fully elucidated.
