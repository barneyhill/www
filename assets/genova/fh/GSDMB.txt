# GSDMB

## Overview
GSDMB, or gasdermin B, is a gene that encodes a member of the gasdermin family of proteins, which are involved in the regulation of cell death and inflammation. The protein gasdermin B, produced by the GSDMB gene, is characterized by its ability to form pores in cellular membranes, a function that is crucial for its role in pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation (Colomo2023Structural). Gasdermin B is predominantly expressed in epithelial and lymphoid tissues and is involved in host defense mechanisms, including bactericidal activity and the regulation of immune responses (Jiang2023Precise). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that exhibit distinct structural and functional properties, influencing processes such as cell proliferation and transcriptional regulation (Jiang2023Precise; Colomo2023Structural). Clinically, GSDMB is significant due to its association with various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions, where its expression levels and genetic polymorphisms can impact disease progression and treatment outcomes (HerguetaRedondo2014GasderminB; Chao2017Gene).

## Structure
The GSDMB protein is characterized by a two-domain architecture, consisting of an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) connected by a flexible linker region (Yin2023Insights; Colomo2023Structural). The NTD features a central bent nine-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that packs against five α-helices, while the CTD is composed of a cluster of α-helices (Yin2023Insights). The NTD is responsible for the protein's pore-forming activity, which is crucial for its role in pyroptosis (Colomo2023Structural). 

GSDMB is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct structural and functional properties. Isoform-3 includes the full-length sequence, while isoform-1 lacks exon 6, and isoform-4 lacks exon 7 (Colomo2023Structural). The presence or absence of specific exons, such as exon 6, significantly influences the protein's pyroptotic capacity and structural integrity (Colomo2023Structural). 

The protein's structure is stabilized by interactions between the NTD and CTD, with the β1-β2 loop playing a key role in tethering these domains (Yin2023Insights). The linker region between the NTD and CTD exhibits heterogeneity, contributing to the protein's functional diversity (Colomo2023Structural).

## Function
GSDMB (gasdermin B) is involved in various cellular processes, primarily related to cell death and inflammation. In healthy human cells, GSDMB is expressed predominantly in epithelial tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract and airway epithelium, as well as in lymphoid tissues (Jiang2023Precise). It plays a role in host defense mechanisms by exhibiting bactericidal activity, binding to bacterial membrane cardiolipin, and potentially inducing pyroptosis to eliminate pathogen replication niches (Jiang2023Precise).

GSDMB is also implicated in cellular maintenance and proliferation. It is expressed in proliferating cells within the basal cell layer of the esophagus and the isthmus/neck of the stomach, suggesting a role in maintaining the stem cell population in these tissues (Saeki2008Distinctive). The protein's activity is modulated by its isoforms, which have distinct roles. For instance, GSDMB iso1 acts as a transcription activator in bronchial epithelial cells, influencing genes like TGFβ and MMP9, although it does not mediate pyroptosis in these cells (Jiang2023Precise).

GSDMB's function is also regulated by its ability to form pores in cellular membranes, a process influenced by the structural integrity of its N-terminal domain (Kong2023Alternative). This pore-forming activity is crucial for its role in pyroptosis, although some isoforms may act as dominant-negative regulators, inhibiting the cytotoxic activity of other isoforms (Kong2023Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
The GSDMB gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases, particularly cancer and inflammatory conditions. In breast cancer, GSDMB overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, including reduced survival and increased metastasis. The GSDMB-2 isoform, in particular, is significantly upregulated in breast carcinomas and promotes tumorigenic and metastatic behaviors through mechanisms involving Rac-1 and Cdc-42 activation (HerguetaRedondo2014GasderminB). In HER2-positive breast cancer, GSDMB is frequently co-amplified with the ERBB2 gene, correlating with poor clinical outcomes and resistance to trastuzumab therapy (HerguetaRedondo2016Gasdermin).

GSDMB is also implicated in inflammatory diseases. Polymorphisms in the GSDMB gene are linked to increased risks of asthma and inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These polymorphisms can alter the protein's structure and function, affecting cell barrier integrity and immune responses (Chao2017Gene). The R299:S306 SNP variant is associated with these inflammatory conditions, potentially impacting sulfatide transport and epithelial cell barrier function (Chao2017Gene).

## Interactions
GSDMB (gasdermin B) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the STAT3 protein, promoting bladder cancer cell proliferation and glycolysis. This interaction involves GSDMB binding to STAT3, which modulates glucose metabolism by up-regulating the expression of HK2 through STAT3 activation. The phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr 705 is crucial in this process, and GSDMB influences this phosphorylation (He2021USP24GSDMB).

GSDMB also interacts with the bacterial effector protein IpaH7.8 from Shigella flexneri. IpaH7.8 targets GSDMB for degradation by binding to its N-terminal domain (NTD) through the LRR domain of IpaH7.8. This interaction is specific to human GSDMB and involves ubiquitination, leading to proteasomal degradation (Yin2023Insights).

In the context of non-canonical pyroptosis, GSDMB interacts with caspase-4, enhancing its activity. This interaction promotes the cleavage of GSDMD, although GSDMB does not directly interact with GSDMD (Chen2018GSDMB).

GSDMB is also cleaved by granzyme A (GZMA), which generates pyroptotic N-terminal domains, facilitating immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Colomo2023Structural).
