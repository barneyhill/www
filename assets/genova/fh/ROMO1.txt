# ROMO1

## Overview
ROMO1, or reactive oxygen species modulator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is integral to mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis. The ROMO1 protein is a transmembrane protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions as a non-selective cation channel. This channel activity is crucial for modulating the mitochondrial membrane potential and permeability, thereby influencing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining redox balance within the cell (Richter2024Investigating; Tsoneva2023ROMO1). ROMO1 is also a component of the TIM23 complex, playing a vital role in the import of mitochondrial proteins, such as the YME1L protease, which is essential for mitochondrial morphology and function (Richter2018ROMO1; Richter2024Investigating). The protein's involvement in ROS regulation and mitochondrial dynamics underscores its significance in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and metabolic diseases (Kim2017Reactive; Amini2019Reactive).

## Structure
ROMO1 is a protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, characterized by its structural features that include two transmembrane domains (TMDs) connected by a basic loop. Each TMD contains an alpha helix, with TMD1 featuring a hydrophobic alpha helix and TMD2 composed of polar amino acids such as K58, T59, Q62, S63, T66, and T69 (Tsoneva2023ROMO1). The amphipathic nature of these TMDs allows ROMO1 to function as a non-selective cation channel, similar to viroporins, which can alter the membrane potential and permeability of mitochondrial membranes (Tsoneva2023ROMO1).

ROMO1 forms homo-oligomers in the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating the creation of nonselective cation channels in cells (Tsoneva2023ROMO1). This oligomerization is crucial for its channel function, which has been observed in vitro (Richter2024Investigating). ROMO1 shares homology with the yeast protein Mgr2, possessing the first two transmembrane domains of the Tim17 family, although it lacks the C-terminal targeting sequence present in Mgr2 (Richter2024Investigating). ROMO1 also contains two conserved cysteine residues in metazoans, which are absent in yeast, suggesting a unique structural feature in higher organisms (Richter2024Investigating).

## Function
ROMO1 (reactive oxygen species modulator 1) is a crucial component of the human mitochondrial presequence translocase, specifically the TIM23 complex, which is involved in the import of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane. ROMO1 is essential for the import of the YME1L protease, a process that is dependent on the unique characteristics of YME1L's mitochondrial targeting sequence (Richter2018ROMO1; Richter2024Investigating). The absence of ROMO1 leads to reduced levels of YME1L, which in turn affects the processing of OPA1, a protein vital for maintaining mitochondrial inner membrane structure and cristae morphology (Richter2024Investigating).

ROMO1 is also implicated in the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Its depletion can lead to increased ROS levels and aberrant mitochondrial inner membrane structure, suggesting a role in maintaining redox homeostasis (Richter2018ROMO1; Richter2024Investigating). ROMO1's function in healthy human cells involves maintaining mitochondrial structure and function through its impact on OPA1 processing and protease regulation, which is crucial for cellular health and homeostasis (Richter2018ROMO1; Richter2024Investigating).

## Clinical Significance
ROMO1 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In cancer, ROMO1 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and increased invasiveness in colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Kim2017Reactive; Lee2017Reactive; Tsoneva2023ROMO1). High ROMO1 levels are associated with chemotherapy resistance and cancer recurrence, particularly in NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (Lee2017Reactive). Genetic polymorphisms in the ROMO1 gene, such as rs6060566, are associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer (Wu2014Association).

Beyond cancer, ROMO1 is linked to diabetic complications, including diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy, due to its role in tissue damage and fibrosis (Amini2019Reactive). In cardiovascular diseases, ROMO1 expression is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, contributing to conditions like hypercholesterolemia and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) (Amini2019Reactive). ROMO1's involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis resistance further underscores its clinical significance in disease progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Amini2019Reactive).

## Interactions
ROMO1 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial dynamics and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. It interacts with the TNF-α-induced signaling complex II, which includes proteins such as RIP1, TRADD, TRAF2, FADD, and pro-caspase-8. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminus of ROMO1, which is essential for transmitting the TNF-α signal to the mitochondria, leading to ROS production and apoptosis (Kim2010TNFαinduced).

ROMO1 also forms a complex with Bcl-X L, a protein involved in stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential. This interaction results in a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, contributing to ROS production. The binding of ROMO1 to Bcl-X L is enhanced upon TNF-α stimulation, while Bax is released from Bcl-X L, indicating a dynamic regulatory mechanism in apoptosis (Kim2010TNFαinduced).

In the context of mitochondrial protein import, ROMO1 is a component of the TIM23 complex, interacting with proteins such as TIM21 and TIM50. It plays a role in the import of the protease YME1L and affects the assembly of COX4I-1 into the MITRAC complex, highlighting its involvement in mitochondrial protein import and inner membrane morphology (Richter2024Investigating).
