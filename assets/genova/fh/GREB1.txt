# GREB1

## Overview
The GREB1 gene encodes the growth regulating estrogen receptor binding 1 protein, which is a critical coactivator involved in the regulation of estrogen-responsive genes. This protein plays a pivotal role in hormone-responsive tissues, such as breast and prostate, by stabilizing estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and facilitating its transcriptional activity. GREB1 is involved in various cellular processes, including glycosylation, where it uniquely contributes to the stability and function of ERα through O-GlcNAcylation. The protein's dynamic localization, shifting between the cytoplasm and nucleus in response to estrogen, underscores its regulatory functions in gene expression. GREB1's interactions with other proteins, such as p300, CBP, and Smad2/3, further highlight its involvement in modulating signaling pathways, which are crucial in the context of hormone-related cancers and other proliferative diseases (Mohammed2013Endogenous; Huynh2024GREB1; Matsumoto2019GREB1).

## Structure


## Function
The GREB1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of estrogen-responsive genes, particularly in hormone-responsive tissues such as breast and prostate. GREB1 functions as a coactivator for the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), facilitating transcriptional activation by stabilizing ERα protein levels. This stabilization is crucial for the transcriptional activation of downstream target genes and cellular proliferation (Huynh2024GREB1). The GREB1 protein is involved in a positive feedback loop with ERα and XBP1, enhancing ERα signaling and promoting cellular proliferation (Huynh2024GREB1).

GREB1 is also implicated in glycosylation processes, specifically O-GlcNAcylation, which is distinct from the typical glycosylation mediated by OGT. This activity is essential for the stability and function of ERα, as GREB1 can glycosylate ERα at specific sites, contributing to its role in cellular proliferation and cancer (Huynh2024GREB1). The protein's localization is dynamic, shifting from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and chromatin in response to estrogen treatment, which may influence its function in gene regulation (Huynh2024GREB1). GREB1's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on organismal outcomes related to growth and development.

## Clinical Significance
The GREB1 gene is implicated in several cancers, including breast, prostate, hepatoblastoma, and colorectal cancer. In breast cancer, GREB1 is overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors and is associated with better disease-free survival in patients treated with tamoxifen, a common endocrine therapy. Its expression levels can serve as an independent predictor of treatment response, potentially more reliable than traditional markers like ER or PgR (Liu2012GREB1). In prostate cancer, GREB1 enhances androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, contributing to disease progression and antiandrogen resistance (Lee2019GREB1).

In hepatoblastoma, a rare liver cancer, GREB1 expression is regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling and promotes tumorigenesis by inhibiting TGFβ signaling. This suggests its potential as a therapeutic target, with antisense oligonucleotides targeting GREB1 showing promise in suppressing tumor formation (Matsumoto2019GREB1). In colorectal cancer, GREB1 expression is associated with increased tumor proliferation and poor survival outcomes, particularly in tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation (Kochi2020Oncogenic). These findings highlight GREB1's role in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
GREB1 (growth regulating estrogen receptor binding 1) is involved in several key interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in hormone-related cancers. In breast cancer, GREB1 acts as a coactivator of the estrogen receptor (ER), stabilizing ER protein levels and facilitating ER-mediated transcription. It interacts with coactivators such as p300 and CBP, stabilizing their interaction with ER at specific binding regions, which is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of estrogen-responsive genes (Mohammed2013Endogenous). GREB1's interaction with ER is also observed in vivo, as it parallels ER-DNA interactions in breast cancer models (Mohammed2013Endogenous).

In prostate cancer, GREB1 enhances androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity by promoting AR DNA binding and recruiting the EP300/CBP complex to AR target genes. This interaction is crucial for maintaining high AR output and contributes to antiandrogen resistance (Lee2019GREB1).

In hepatoblastoma, GREB1 interacts with Smad2/3 in the nucleus, inhibiting TGFβ signaling and promoting cell proliferation. This interaction is specific to the MH2 domain of Smad2, highlighting GREB1's role in modulating signaling pathways independently of traditional hormone signaling (Matsumoto2019GREB1).
