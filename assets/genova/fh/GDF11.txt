# GDF11

## Overview
Growth Differentiation Factor 11 (GDF11) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, which is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and development. The GDF11 protein, also known as a cytokine, plays a crucial role in the development and regeneration of tissues such as muscle, nervous system, and erythroid cells. It functions by binding to specific activin receptors, initiating signaling pathways that influence gene expression and cellular responses (Walker2016Biochemistry; Rochette2020AntiAging). GDF11 has garnered significant interest for its potential anti-aging properties, as studies have suggested its involvement in reversing age-related decline in muscle and cardiac function (Fife2018Relationship). However, its role in aging and disease remains complex and context-dependent, with varying effects observed in different tissues and conditions (Frohlich2021GDF11; SimoniNieves2019GDF11).

## Structure
GDF11, a member of the TGFβ superfamily, is synthesized as a precursor protein with an N-terminal prodomain and a C-terminal mature signaling domain. The prodomain is cleaved by furin proteases, but often remains non-covalently bound, forming a latent complex that requires further activation by tolloid metalloproteinases (Walker2016Biochemistry; Gipson2020Structural). The mature GDF11 protein forms a disulfide-linked dimer, adopting a propeller-shaped structure typical of TGFβ family members (Walker2016Biochemistry).

The primary structure of GDF11 includes specific residues that contribute to its activity, such as Q62 and G100, which are involved in stabilizing the dimer interface and enhancing receptor interactions (Walker2017Structural). The secondary structure involves beta-sheets and alpha-helices, stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are characteristic of the cystine-knot motif found in TGFβ proteins (Gipson2020Structural).

In its quaternary structure, GDF11 forms a homodimer, which is crucial for its biological activity. The protein's interaction with antagonists like follistatin 288 (FS288) involves occlusion of receptor binding sites, affecting its signaling capabilities (Walker2017Structural). The structural flexibility, particularly in the wrist helix, may correlate with its biological activity and potency differences compared to closely related proteins like GDF8 (Walker2017Structural).

## Function
Growth Differentiation Factor 11 (GDF11) is a member of the TGF-β superfamily and plays a significant role in various cellular and molecular processes. It is involved in cell differentiation and proliferation, particularly influencing the growth and development of tissues such as the skin, heart, skeletal muscle, and nervous system (Rochette2020AntiAging). GDF11 functions by binding to activin receptor II (ActRII) and recruiting activin receptor I (ActRI), which activates the Smad signaling pathways crucial for intracellular messaging (Rochette2020AntiAging).

In muscle tissue, GDF11 enhances the regenerative capacity of satellite cells, which are essential for muscle repair and regeneration (Rochette2015Growth). It also influences muscle mass regulation through myostatin and activin receptors, affecting muscle atrophy and hypertrophy (Khavinson2016GDF11). In the nervous system, GDF11 is involved in neurogenesis, particularly in the developing olfactory epithelium, spinal cord, and retina, where it regulates the timing and progression of neurogenesis (Walker2016Biochemistry).

GDF11 also plays a role in erythropoiesis by controlling the late-stage maturation of erythroid precursors through the GDF11-ActRIIB-Smad2/3-dependent signaling pathway (Rochette2015Growth). Its expression is high in young adult organs and declines with age, suggesting its involvement in age-related physiological functions (Rochette2020AntiAging).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GDF11 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer biology, GDF11 exhibits context-dependent roles, acting as a tumor suppressor in some cancers and a promoter in others. For instance, in pancreatic cancer, GDF11 is downregulated in cancerous tissue, and higher expression levels are associated with better survival rates, suggesting a tumor suppressive role. Conversely, in colorectal cancer, GDF11 expression is higher in cancerous tissue and correlates with poor prognosis, indicating a potential tumor-promoting role (SimoniNieves2019GDF11).

GDF11 also plays a role in metabolic regulation, particularly in the pancreas and lipid metabolism. It has been associated with the regulation of thyroid-stimulating hormone and shown to decrease lipid content in certain cell lines by repressing adipogenic genes, suggesting a role in lipid homeostasis (SimoniNieves2019GDF11). In liver cancer cells, GDF11 impacts lipid accumulation through ALK5-dependent signaling, promoting survival of hepatic cancer cells through lipid influx, despite its tumor-suppressive function by inhibiting cell proliferation (Frohlich2021GDF11).

In the context of aging, GDF11 has been proposed as a rejuvenating factor, with studies indicating that increased levels in aged mice can reverse age-related impairments in muscle and cardiac function (Fife2018Relationship). However, its role as an age-dependent hormone remains controversial, with conflicting reports on its levels in circulation with age (Walker2016Biochemistry).

## Interactions
GDF11 interacts with several proteins to regulate its signaling pathways. It binds to activin receptors type II A or B (ActRIIA, ActRIIB) to initiate signaling, which involves the recruitment and transphosphorylation of type I serine/threonine kinase receptors, specifically ALK4, ALK5, or ALK7. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of SMAD proteins, including SMAD2 and SMAD3, which then form a complex with SMAD4 to regulate gene expression (Walker2016Biochemistry; SimoniNieves2019GDF11).

GDF11 also interacts with extracellular matrix components such as LTBP3 and perlecan, which may influence its activation (Walker2016Biochemistry). It is regulated by extracellular antagonists like follistatin, follistatin-like 3 (FSTL3), decorin, and growth/differentiation factor-associated serum proteins 1 and 2 (GASP1 and GASP2), which inhibit its interaction with receptors (Walker2016Biochemistry).

Structurally, GDF11 forms a complex with follistatin 288 (FS288), which occludes its receptor binding sites, thereby modulating its activity. This interaction is characterized by unique structural features that differentiate it from GDF8, another member of the TGF-beta family (Walker2017Structural).
