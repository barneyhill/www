# FANCF

## Overview
FANCF is a gene that encodes the FA complementation group F protein, a crucial component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex involved in DNA repair. The FA complementation group F protein functions as an adaptor protein within the complex, stabilizing interactions among other FA proteins, such as FANCC, FANCE, and FANCG, which are essential for the DNA damage response pathway. This pathway is critical for repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks, thereby maintaining genomic stability and preventing chromosomal instability. The protein's structural integrity and interactions are vital for the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key step in the FA-BRCA pathway, which facilitates DNA repair processes. Mutations or epigenetic alterations in the FANCF gene can lead to various clinical conditions, including Fanconi anemia and certain cancers, underscoring its significance in genomic maintenance and cellular homeostasis (Narayan2004Promoter; Farrell2024Deep; Bogliolo2015Fanconi).

## Structure
The FANCF protein is a component of the Fanconi anemia core complex (FAcc), which plays a crucial role in DNA repair. Structurally, FANCF is characterized by a single helical-repeat domain, which is a common motif in proteins involved in complex assembly and stability (Farrell2024Deep). The modeling of FANCF within the FAcc was achieved using a combination of deep learning and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), which allowed for the accurate placement of FANCF in the 'bottom lobe' of the complex alongside other proteins such as FANCB, FANCL, FANCE, FANCG, and FAAP100 (Farrell2024Deep).

The modeling process involved using trRosetta to predict inter-residue distances and orientations, which were then refined using RosettaCM with PDB entry 2iqc (chain A) as a template (Farrell2024Deep). This approach facilitated the generation of a converged structure with typical root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.d.s) of 2-4 Å, indicating a reliable model of the protein's tertiary structure (Farrell2024Deep).

FANCF is part of the CEF subcomplex within the FA core complex, which includes FANCC and FANCE, highlighting its role in the quaternary structure of the complex (Ishiai2021Regulation). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its function in the DNA repair pathway.

## Function
The FANCF gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex, which plays a vital role in the FA-BRCA DNA damage response pathway. This pathway is essential for maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks, which are particularly challenging to repair and can lead to chromosomal instability if not properly addressed (Narayan2004Promoter; Bogliolo2015Fanconi). In healthy human cells, FANCF, along with other FA proteins, forms a multisubunit nuclear complex that facilitates the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein. This modification is crucial for the interaction of FANCD2 with BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are key players in DNA repair processes (GarciaHiguera2001Interaction; Wang2006Promoter).

FANCF acts as an adaptor protein, stabilizing the FA complex by interacting with other FA proteins, such as FANCC, FANCE, FANCA, and FANCG, through its N-terminal and C-terminal regions (Zhao2013RNAimediated). This stabilization is necessary for the proper functioning of the FA pathway, ensuring effective DNA repair and cell cycle progression, thereby preventing tumorigenesis and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Jacquemont2007The; Dong2015Update). FANCF is active in the nucleus, where it participates in the DNA damage response, contributing to the maintenance of genomic integrity (Zhao2013RNAimediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FANCF gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is crucial for DNA repair. FANCF mutations account for approximately 2% of FA cases, a genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital anomalies, and increased cancer risk. Patients with biallelic FANCF mutations exhibit phenotypic variability, ranging from severe congenital malformations to hematological abnormalities (Tryon2016Phenotypic; Nicchia2015Clinical).

In ovarian cancer, FANCF promoter hypermethylation is a significant factor, leading to reduced gene expression and disruption of the FA-BRCA pathway, which is essential for DNA repair. This epigenetic alteration is observed in a subset of ovarian tumors and is associated with decreased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents used in chemotherapy (Lim2008Promoter; Wang2006Promoter). FANCF methylation has also been implicated in cervical cancer, contributing to chromosomal instability and resistance to DNA cross-linking agents (Narayan2004Promoter).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), loss of heterozygosity in the FANCF region suggests its role in cancer progression, potentially affecting patient response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Türke2017Loss). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FANCF in various cancers and its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
The FANCF gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex, which is involved in DNA repair processes. FANCF primarily interacts with FANCG, a relationship confirmed through yeast two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation methods. This interaction is significant, as FANCG may act as a physical bridge, facilitating the assembly of other FA proteins into the core complex (Medhurst2001Direct; Gordon2003Fanconi). The carboxyl-terminal region of FANCF is particularly important for its interaction with FANCG, and mutations in FANCG, such as Leu71Pro, can disrupt this interaction (Gordon2003Fanconi).

FANCF does not directly interact with other FA proteins like FANCA, FANCC, or FANCE, although these interactions might be indirect or dependent on posttranslational modifications not present in yeast cells (Medhurst2001Direct). FANCF is part of a larger nuclear complex that includes FANCA, FANCC, FANCE, and FANCG, which is necessary for the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a critical step in the FA pathway (Kaddar2012Fanconi; Gordon2003Fanconi). These interactions underscore FANCF's role in maintaining genomic stability through its participation in the FA protein network.
