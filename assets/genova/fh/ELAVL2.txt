# ELAVL2

## Overview
ELAVL2 is a gene that encodes the ELAV-like RNA binding protein 2, a member of the ELAV/Hu family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and plays a pivotal role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. ELAVL2 is primarily involved in mRNA stabilization by binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs, which is crucial for processes such as neuronal development and spermatogenesis. The protein is highly expressed in neurons and spermatogonia, where it influences pathways related to neurodevelopmental disorders and reproductive health. ELAVL2's interactions with other RNA-binding proteins and its involvement in alternative splicing underscore its significance in maintaining cellular function and development (Berto2016ELAVL2regulated; Yang2021RNA‐binding).

## Structure
ELAVL2, a member of the ELAV/Hu family of RNA-binding proteins, is characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a hinge region. The RRMs, specifically RRM1 and RRM2, are known to preferentially bind AU-rich elements in the 3ʹ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA, playing a crucial role in mRNA stabilization and regulation (Mulligan2023The). The third RRM, RRM3, is involved in transcript stability and contributes to the protein's ability to form multimeric complexes, enhancing RNA-binding affinity through homodimerization (Mulligan2023The).

The hinge region between RRM2 and RRM3 contains nuclear export and localization signals, facilitating the shuttling of RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Mulligan2023The). ELAVL2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that can affect its RNA-binding capacity. In bees, for example, alternative splicing of the ELAVL2 gene can produce up to 40 different isoforms, with certain exons contributing to enhanced RNA-binding through structural modifications (Ustaoglu2021Dynamically).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence ELAVL2's function and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the available literature (Ustaoglu2021Dynamically).

## Function
The ELAVL2 gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells. ELAVL2 is involved in stabilizing mRNAs by binding to AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions, thereby enhancing their translation. This function is particularly significant in neurons and spermatogonia, where ELAVL2 is highly expressed (Redmon2022Sequence; Yang2021RNA‐binding).

In the testis, ELAVL2 is enriched in spermatogonia and is essential for regulating their proliferation and apoptosis. It promotes cell proliferation by activating the ERK and AKT signaling pathways and inhibits apoptosis, thus maintaining the balance necessary for normal spermatogenesis (Yang2021RNA‐binding). ELAVL2 interacts with DAZL, another RNA-binding protein, to enhance the expression of target genes crucial for spermatogonial stem cell proliferation and survival (Yang2021RNA‐binding).

In neurons, ELAVL2 is involved in transcriptional and splicing networks that are critical for brain development and function. It regulates pathways associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, by influencing synaptic function and neuronal excitability (Berto2016ELAVL2regulated). ELAVL2's role in alternative splicing and mRNA stabilization is vital for maintaining normal neuronal and synaptic function (Berto2016ELAVL2regulated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ELAVL2 gene have been implicated in several neurological and reproductive disorders. In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, ELAVL2 is considered a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability. Loss-of-function variants in ELAVL2 have been identified in large cohort studies, suggesting its significant role in these conditions (Mulligan2023The). The gene is involved in transcriptional and splicing networks that are crucial for neurodevelopment, and its dysregulation may impact pathways related to ASD (Berto2016ELAVL2regulated).

In reproductive health, the absence of ELAVL2 in females leads to defective formation of primordial follicles, resulting in infertility due to lower yields of meiotically matured oocytes. In males, ELAVL2 is essential for spermatogenesis, and its reduced expression is associated with non-obstructive azoospermia, a severe cause of male infertility (Mulligan2023The).

In oncology, particularly glioblastoma (GBM), ELAVL2 is frequently deleted, and its loss is associated with aggressive mesenchymal transition, contributing to poor prognosis. High ELAVL2 expression correlates with better survival outcomes, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor in GBM (Kim2024ELAVL2).

## Interactions
ELAVL2, also known as HuB, is an RNA-binding protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to directly interact with DAZL, a regulator of spermatogenesis, in both human and mouse spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments and is independent of RNA, suggesting a stable protein-protein interaction (Yang2021RNA‐binding).

In the context of neurodevelopment, ELAVL2 interacts with other RNA-binding proteins such as RBFOX1 and FMR1. These interactions are significant during fetal cortical development, where ELAVL2 acts as a major hub in a network of RNA-binding proteins, influencing alternative splicing and transcriptional regulation (Berto2016ELAVL2regulated).

ELAVL2 also interacts with ZFP36L2, which binds to AU-rich elements in the 3' UTR of ELAVL2 mRNA, leading to its downregulation. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism where ZFP36L2 and ELAVL2 may co-regulate gene expression, with ELAVL2 stabilizing mRNAs by binding to GAAA motifs in their 3' UTRs (Redmon2022Sequence).
