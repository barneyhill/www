# HUS1B

## Overview
HUS1B is a gene that encodes the protein HUS1 checkpoint clamp component B, which is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. This protein is a part of the 9-1-1 complex, a heterotrimeric ring structure that plays a crucial role in DNA damage checkpoint signaling. The 9-1-1 complex is recruited to sites of DNA damage and is essential for the activation of the ATR kinase, which in turn phosphorylates various substrates to halt the cell cycle and facilitate DNA repair. HUS1B, as a component of this complex, is integral to maintaining genomic stability and preventing the propagation of DNA errors. The protein is categorized as a checkpoint protein due to its role in the DNA damage response pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC).
