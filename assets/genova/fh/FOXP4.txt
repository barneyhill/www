# FOXP4

## Overview
FOXP4 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box P4 protein, a member of the FOX transcription factor family. This protein is characterized by a conserved forkhead box domain, which is essential for its role as a transcriptional repressor. FOXP4 is involved in regulating gene expression across various tissues, including the brain, heart, and lungs, and plays a significant role in neurodevelopmental processes. The protein can form both homodimers and heterodimers with other FOXP family members, such as FOXP1 and FOXP2, which influences its regulatory functions. Mutations in the FOXP4 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in normal biological function and development (Snijders2021Heterozygous; Co2020FOXP).

## Structure
The FOXP4 protein is a member of the FOX transcription factor family, characterized by a highly conserved forkhead box domain, which is crucial for its DNA-binding function. This domain includes a recognition helix and a hinge loop region, where several pathogenic missense variants have been identified (Snijders2021Heterozygous). The forkhead domain folds into a winged helix motif composed of five helices, three β sheets, and two wings, contributing to its DNA-binding capabilities (Villalobos2021Human).

FOXP4 shares structural similarities with other members of the FoxP subfamily, such as FOXP1 and FOXP2, which include additional domains like a trans repressor domain (TRD), a zinc finger domain (ZFD), and a leucine zipper domain (LZD) (Villalobos2021Human). These domains are involved in the protein's regulatory functions and interactions with other transcription factors (Estruch2018Proteomic).

The protein's structure has been modeled using homology modeling tools, based on the FOXP1 template, due to the lack of an available three-dimensional structure for FOXP4 (Snijders2021Heterozygous). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of FOXP4 are not provided, the protein is known to form dimers, a common feature among FoxP proteins (Villalobos2021Human).

## Function
FOXP4 is a transcriptional repressor protein that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and testis, and is active during different stages of development (Snijders2021Heterozygous). The protein contains a forkhead box DNA-binding domain, which is crucial for its function, as it mediates sequence-specific interactions with DNA, allowing it to regulate the expression of downstream target genes (Snijders2021Heterozygous). 

FOXP4 is primarily localized in the nucleus, consistent with its role in gene regulation (Snijders2021Heterozygous). It can form homodimers and heterodimers with other FOXP proteins, such as FOXP1 and FOXP2, which may influence its regulatory functions (Sin2014Transcriptional). These interactions are mediated by a conserved leucine zipper motif, although missense variants do not affect dimerization (Snijders2021Heterozygous). 

In the brain, FOXP4 is involved in neurodevelopmental processes, with its expression peaking prenatally, suggesting roles in neuronal development and maintenance (Co2020FOXP). The protein's activity in transcriptional repression is demonstrated by its ability to significantly repress reporter gene expression in luciferase assays (Snijders2021Heterozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FOXP4 gene are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by speech and language delays, short stature, macrocephaly, and multiple congenital abnormalities, including congenital diaphragmatic hernia and cervical vertebral abnormalities. These conditions are linked to heterozygous variants in FOXP4, which disrupt the gene's transcriptional repressor activity, leading to loss-of-function effects (Snijders2021Heterozygous). The study identified several missense variants in the DNA-binding domain of FOXP4, which resulted in aberrant subcellular localization and impaired transcriptional repression capabilities. A frameshift variant was also identified, likely causing FOXP4 haploinsufficiency due to nonsense-mediated decay (Snijders2021Heterozygous).

The FOXP4 gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, and lungs, during different developmental stages, indicating its broad role in development. The gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variations suggests that both missense and truncating variants can be pathogenic, potentially leading to developmental disorders (Snijders2021Heterozygous). While FOXP4's role in neurodevelopmental disorders is becoming clearer, further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance and potential involvement in other conditions.

## Interactions
FOXP4 is known to participate in various physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It can form both homodimers and heterodimers with other FOXP family members, such as FOXP1 and FOXP2. These interactions are crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays and Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assays (Sin2014Transcriptional; Estruch2018Proteomic).

FOXP4 also interacts with several transcription factors, including NR2F1, NR2F2, SATB1, SATB2, SOX5, YY1, and ZMYM2, which are associated with neurodevelopmental processes. These interactions suggest a cooperative role in regulating neural gene expression (Estruch2018Proteomic). The ability of FOXP4 to bind to the VLDLR promoter, a target of FOXP2, indicates that it shares target genes with other FOXP proteins, further highlighting its role in transcriptional regulation (Mendoza2017ProteinProtein).

Mutations in FOXP4 that affect its dimerization capacity or transcriptional repression activity can lead to developmental disorders, emphasizing the importance of its interactions for normal biological function (Snijders2021Heterozygous).
