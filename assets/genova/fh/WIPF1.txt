# WIPF1

## Overview
WIPF1, or WAS/WASL interacting protein family member 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and function. The protein, also referred to as WIP, is categorized as an actin-binding protein and is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, which allows it to interact with various binding partners to adopt more structured conformations. WIP plays a pivotal role in stabilizing filamentous actin (F-actin) and interacts with key proteins such as the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and neural WASP (N-WASP), which are essential for actin assembly and cellular processes like adhesion and motility. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are significant in various cellular functions and have been implicated in the progression of certain cancers, making WIPF1 a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Ramesh2014Binding; Pan2018WIPF1; Sokolik2020The).

## Structure
The WIPF1 protein, also known as the WAS/WASL interacting protein family member 1, is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, lacking a stable three-dimensional structure but adopting more rigid conformations upon interaction with binding partners (Sokolik2020The). The protein is divided into several key domains: the N-terminal actin-binding domain, the central proline-rich domain, and the C-terminal WASp-binding domain (Sokolik2020The).

The N-terminal domain contains actin-binding motifs (ABMs) that belong to the WH2 family, with specific regions showing helical and β-strand propensities, which are crucial for actin interaction (Elazari‐Shalom2015New). The central proline-rich domain facilitates interactions with SH3 domains of various proteins, playing a role in cellular processes like invadopodium formation and intracellular vesicle trafficking (Sokolik2020The). The C-terminal domain binds to the EVH1 domain of WASp/N-WASp and includes a phosphorylation site for protein kinase C θ (PKCθ), which is important for WASp activation and degradation (Sokolik2020The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are significant for the function and interaction of WIPF1, particularly in the regulation of its binding with WASp (Sokolik2020The). The presence of splice variants may lead to different isoforms with distinct functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
The WIPF1 gene encodes the WASP-interacting protein (WIP), which plays a critical role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a structure essential for various cellular functions such as adhesion, motility, and cytokinesis. WIP binds to and stabilizes filamentous actin (F-actin), preventing its depolymerization and maintaining the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton (Ramesh2014Binding). It interacts with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and its homologue N-WASP, which are key activators of the Arp2/3 complex, a major initiator of actin assembly. WIP acts as a physiological inhibitor of WASP/N-WASP-mediated actin assembly and is crucial for the stability of WASP in T cells, protecting it from degradation by calpain and the proteasome (de2007WIP).

WIP is also involved in the regulation of focal adhesion assembly and cell adhesion, influencing the activity of the myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-serum response factor (SRF) complex, which regulates the transcription of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton integrity (Ramesh2014Binding). In fibroblasts, WIP is essential for the nuclear localization of MRTF-A, which is necessary for proper focal adhesion assembly and stress fiber formation (Ramesh2014Binding).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WIPF1 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and gastric cancer (GC). In PDAC, WIPF1 is overexpressed and is associated with poor survival outcomes. It antagonizes the tumor suppressive effects of microRNAs miR-141 and miR-200c, which are often epigenetically silenced in PDAC, leading to increased WIPF1 expression. This overexpression promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis, contributing to the aggressive nature of PDAC (Pan2018WIPF1). 

In gastric cancer, WIPF1 expression is upregulated by the long noncoding RNA HCG18, which suppresses miR-141-3p. This interaction enhances the malignant phenotypes of GC cells by activating the WIPF1/YAP/TAZ axis, which is involved in cell proliferation and invasion. The upregulation of WIPF1 in GC is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene in this context (Liu2020Long).

Overall, the dysregulation of WIPF1 expression and its interactions with specific microRNAs and signaling pathways play a significant role in the progression and poor prognosis of certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Pan2018WIPF1; Liu2020Long).

## Interactions
WIPF1, also known as WAS/WASL interacting protein family member 1, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics. It interacts directly with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and neural WASP (N-WASP), forming a complex that is crucial for their activity and stability. This interaction protects WASP from degradation and is essential for its recruitment to specific subcellular locations (García2012WIP:). WIPF1 also binds to filamentous actin (F-actin), stabilizing it and preventing depolymerization, which is mediated by a specific sequence in the WASP homology 2 (WH2) domain of WIPF1 (Ramesh2014Binding).

WIPF1 interacts with several other proteins, including cortactin, Nck, CrkL, and profilin, which are involved in actin regulation (García2012WIP:). It also plays a role in the regulation of the myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-serum response factor (SRF) complex, influencing the nuclear localization of MRTF-A and SRF, which are crucial for focal adhesion assembly (Ramesh2014Binding). Additionally, WIPF1 is involved in the ETS1/WIPF1/RhoA signaling axis, where it interacts with RhoA, regulating its stability and activity in pulmonary arterial hypertension (Song2021LncRNA).
