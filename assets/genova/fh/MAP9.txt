# MAP9

## Overview
MAP9, or microtubule-associated protein 9, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, crucial for cell division and intracellular transport. The protein, also referred to as ASAP, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes domains that facilitate interaction with microtubules, and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, particularly around the mitotic spindle apparatus (Venoux2008Gene). MAP9 is a substrate of the mitotic kinase Aurora-A, and its phosphorylation is essential for spindle assembly and mitotic progression (Venoux2007ASAP). The protein is expressed in tissues rich in microtubules, such as the brain and testis, suggesting roles in neuronal differentiation and spermatogenesis (Venoux2008Gene). MAP9's evolutionary conservation across vertebrates underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Venoux2008Gene).

## Structure
The human MAP9 gene encodes a microtubule-associated protein known as ASAP, which is approximately 110 kDa in size and expressed as a 2.6 Kb transcript. The protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes several domains and motifs essential for its function. The C-terminal part of MAP9 contains MAP, MIT-like, and THY domains, which are indicative of microtubule interaction, while the N-terminal part is more divergent (Venoux2008Gene). The protein is composed of about 42% alpha helical structures and contains two main coiled-coil regions between amino acids 297-327 and 477-628 (Venoux2008Gene).

MAP9 is rich in charged amino acids, such as glutamic acid (Glu) and lysine (Lys), and contains motifs like KEE, EKKE, and EKKDK(E/D)K. The C-terminal end shows weak sequence similarity to the acidic microtubule-binding region SS2 of MAP1A (Venoux2008Gene). The protein also contains three nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the C-terminal domain, corresponding to amino acids 483-501, 508-524 (bipartite NLS), and 621-624 (monopartite NLS) (Venoux2008Gene).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, with specific sites such as S625 being crucial for spindle formation and mitosis (Venoux2008Gene). The protein's structure and modifications suggest a role in DNA damage response and microtubule dynamics.

## Function
MAP9, also known as microtubule-associated protein 9, plays a crucial role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which are essential for proper cell division and intracellular transport. It is particularly involved in the formation and function of the mitotic spindle, a structure necessary for chromosome segregation during mitosis (Venoux2008Gene). MAP9 is a substrate of the mitotic kinase Aurora-A, and its phosphorylation at serine 625 is critical for spindle assembly and mitotic progression (Venoux2007ASAP). The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, especially around the mitotic spindle apparatus, where it stabilizes microtubules and ensures proper chromosome alignment (Venoux2008Gene).

MAP9 is expressed strongly in the brain and testis, tissues rich in microtubules, and is associated with both the mitotic spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules (Venoux2008Gene). Its expression in neurons suggests a role in neuronal differentiation and development, while in the testis, it may be involved in spermatogenesis (Venoux2008Gene). The evolutionary conservation of MAP9 across vertebrates underscores its essential function in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Venoux2008Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the MAP9 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and retinal degeneration. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MAP9 is frequently silenced, with 68% of primary CRC tissues showing down-regulation compared to adjacent normal tissues. This silencing is associated with chromosomal instability, a hallmark of many solid tumors, and contributes to tumorigenesis and poor survival outcomes in CRC patients (Wang2020MAP9). MAP9 loss leads to chromosomal instability by affecting spindle microtubule stability, resulting in aneuploidy and increased tumor incidence (Wang2020MAP9).

In liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MAP9 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is often silenced due to promoter hypermethylation, which correlates with poor prognosis and increased tumor recurrence. MAP9 downregulation in HCC is linked to enhanced cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, promoting tumor growth (Zhang2020Microtubule).

In the context of retinal degeneration, MAP9 mutations exacerbate the effects of RPGRIP1 mutations, leading to more severe retinal degeneration in canines. This suggests a role for MAP9 as a modifier gene in retinal diseases (Takahashi2023Molecular; Forman2016Canine).

## Interactions
MAP9 (microtubule associated protein 9) is involved in several critical interactions that influence cell division and cytoskeletal stability. It is closely associated with the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) in the pericentriolar matrix, which is essential for the stability and formation of K-fibres, microtubule bundles involved in chromosome movement during mitosis (Wang2020MAP9). MAP9 also interacts with the N-terminus of p53 in response to DNA damage, promoting p53 stabilization by interfering with the MDM2-p53 complex formation and suppressing MDM2-mediated ubiquitination. This interaction facilitates p300-mediated acetylation of p53, highlighting MAP9's role in DNA damage response (Xiao2021Expression).

MAP9 is a substrate of the mitotic kinase Aurora-A, and its phosphorylation is necessary for proper spindle assembly and mitotic progression (Venoux2008Gene). In zebrafish, MAP9 interacts with the microtubule network, being crucial for the organization of the bipolar mitotic spindle and mitotic progression (Fontenille2014Microtubuleassociated). These interactions underscore MAP9's role in maintaining spindle stability and proper chromosome alignment during mitosis, as well as its involvement in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation.
