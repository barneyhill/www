this gene is a bZIP transcription factor which can bind as a homodimer to certain DNA regulatory regions. It can also form heterodimers with the related protein CEBP-delta. The encoded protein may be essential for terminal differentiation and functional maturation of committed granulocyte progenitor cells. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Specific Granule Deficiency, a rare congenital disorder. Multiple variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of only one has been determined.
