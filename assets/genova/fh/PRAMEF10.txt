# PRAMEF10

## Overview
PRAMEF10 is a gene that encodes the protein PRAME family member 10, which is part of the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) gene family. This family is known for its role in cancer biology, particularly as cancer-testis antigens (CTAs), which are typically expressed in the testis and various tumors. The PRAMEF10 protein is implicated in oncogenesis, with its expression being associated with several types of cancer, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer liver metastases. The gene's mutations and expression patterns suggest potential utility as a prognostic marker, although the precise biological functions and clinical implications of PRAMEF10 remain under investigation (Heczko2023Prognostic; Deng2019Identification; Kern2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The PRAMEF10 gene, a member of the PRAME gene family, is associated with various clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. Mutations in PRAMEF10 have been identified in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), with a specific splice donor variant (c.866+2T>C) detected in 2.6% of the study cohort. This mutation type can potentially affect gene expression or function, although the study did not directly link these mutations to specific clinical outcomes (Deng2019Identification).

PRAMEF10 is also noted for its expression in tumors, suggesting a role in oncogenesis. The gene is part of the cancer-testis antigen (CTA) group, which is predominantly expressed in the testis and various tumors, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker for cancer patients (Kern2021The). While the clinical significance of PRAMEF10 mutations or expression changes is not fully elucidated, its classification as a CTA and its expression in tumors suggest that alterations in PRAMEF10 could impact cancer prognosis or treatment strategies (Kern2021The).

In colorectal cancer liver metastases, PRAMEF10 is mentioned as having a high rate of variants with predicted high functional effects, although specific clinical implications are not detailed (Heczko2023Prognostic).
