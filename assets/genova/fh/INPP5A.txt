# INPP5A

## Overview
INPP5A is a gene that encodes the enzyme inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase A, a phosphatase involved in the regulation of phosphoinositide signaling pathways. This enzyme is crucial for the hydrolysis of inositol phosphates, such as Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, which play significant roles in intracellular calcium signaling, particularly in neuronal cells (Yang2015Deletion). INPP5A is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, with high levels in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it is essential for maintaining normal cellular function and survival (Yang2015Deletion). The protein's activity is modulated by interactions with various cellular proteins, including adaptor protein 14.3.3 and Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II, which influence its enzymatic function (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide). Disruptions in INPP5A expression or function have been linked to several pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancers, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Yang2015Deletion; Sekulic2010Loss).

## Function
INPP5A encodes a phosphatase involved in the regulation of phosphoinositide signaling pathways, specifically targeting inositol phosphates such as Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. This enzyme plays a critical role in the breakdown of these molecules, which is essential for controlling intracellular calcium release, a key process in neuronal signaling (Yang2015Deletion). INPP5A is highly expressed in the cerebellum, particularly in Purkinje cells, where it maintains normal phosphatase activity and is crucial for the survival and function of these cells (Yang2015Deletion). The enzyme's activity is vital for the proper functioning of calcium signaling pathways, which are important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal neurological function (Yang2015Deletion).

In healthy cells, INPP5A is localized to the dendrites of Purkinje cells, indicating its role in normal dendritic function (Yang2015Deletion). The gene's expression is primarily restricted to the central nervous system, underscoring its importance in neuronal health. Disruptions in INPP5A activity can lead to cerebellar degeneration and ataxia, highlighting its essential role in maintaining cerebellar structure and function (Yang2015Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the INPP5A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the INPP5A gene is frequently deleted, with studies showing its deletion in 24% of invasive SCC tumors. This loss is considered an early event in SCC development, suggesting that INPP5A may function as a tumor suppressor, and its deletion contributes to cancer progression (Sekulic2010Loss).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, INPP5A is highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, and its deletion in mice leads to ataxia and cerebellar degeneration. This suggests a critical role in maintaining cerebellar function, with its loss resulting in significant motor deficits and neurodegeneration (Yang2015Deletion). In spinocerebellar ataxias type 17 (SCA17), reduced INPP5A levels are linked to Purkinje cell degeneration, indicating its involvement in the selective neuropathology of this condition (Liu2020Cerebellumenriched).

Alterations in INPP5A have also been associated with psychiatric disorders. A microduplication in the INPP5A gene has been linked to childhood-onset schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of these conditions (Fernandez2021A).

## Interactions
INPP5A, or inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase A, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular signaling pathways. In the context of spinocerebellar ataxias type 17 (SCA17), INPP5A expression is regulated by the transcription factor SP1. Mutant TATA-binding protein (TBP) in SCA17 can bind to SP1, reducing its binding efficiency to the Inpp5a promoter and impairing SP1's ability to activate Inpp5a transcription. This interaction is significant as it leads to decreased INPP5A levels, contributing to Purkinje cell degeneration (Liu2020Cerebellumenriched).

In GNAQ and GNA11-mutant uveal melanomas, INPP5A interacts with the signaling pathways regulated by these oncoproteins. The depletion of INPP5A in these mutant cells results in the accumulation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which activates IP3 receptors and increases cytosolic calcium levels, leading to cell death. This suggests that INPP5A plays a crucial role in modulating calcium signaling in these cancer cells (Elbatsh2024INPP5A).

INPP5A's activity is also regulated by its interaction with the adaptor protein 14.3.3 and Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II, which modulate its enzymatic function in vitro (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide). These interactions highlight the diverse regulatory mechanisms involving INPP5A in different cellular contexts.
