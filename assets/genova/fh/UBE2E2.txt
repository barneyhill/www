# UBE2E2

## Overview
UBE2E2 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E2, a member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family involved in the ubiquitination process. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of proteins, which is essential for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction. UBE2E2 is categorized as a Class II E2 enzyme, characterized by a conserved catalytic domain and N-terminal intrinsically disordered extensions that may regulate its activity and extend its functionality (Uversky2013The). The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as cell cycle progression and DNA repair (Wijk2009The). UBE2E2's interactions with specific E3 ligases, such as Wwp1, Rbx2, and Ube3a, underscore its unique role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, contributing to the maintenance of protein homeostasis (Kar2012Human). The gene has been implicated in various diseases, including type 2 diabetes and ovarian cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Hong2023UBE2E2; Yamauchi2010A).

## Structure
UBE2E2 is a human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that features a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is approximately 150 amino acids in length. This domain is crucial for its enzymatic activity in the ubiquitination process (Sheng2012A). The protein also possesses N-terminal intrinsically disordered (ID) extensions of varying lengths, which, despite lacking a defined structure, play significant roles in modulating the protein's functionality (Uversky2013The).

The tertiary structure of UBE2E2, like other E2 enzymes, includes a canonical E2 fold characterized by a four-stranded, anti-parallel curled β-sheet surrounded by α-helical segments. This structure is highly conserved among E2 proteins, with an average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2Å, indicating a high degree of structural similarity despite low sequence identity (Sheng2012A). The conserved areas include the catalytic cleft and the E3 binding region, which are essential for its function in ubiquitin transfer (Sheng2012A).

UBE2E2 is part of a net positively charged cluster of E2 enzymes, which influences its electrostatic interactions and activity (Sheng2012A). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. However, specific details on quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
UBE2E2 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitination process, a post-translational modification essential for protein degradation, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction. This enzyme is involved in transferring activated ubiquitin from E1 enzymes to E3 ligases, which then facilitate the attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins, marking them for degradation by the proteasome (Sheng2012A). UBE2E2 is part of the Class II E2 enzymes, characterized by a conserved catalytic domain and N-terminal intrinsically disordered extensions that may regulate the enzyme's activity and extend its functionality (Uversky2013The).

UBE2E2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and signal transduction. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein turnover (Wijk2009The). The specificity of E2-E3 interactions, including those involving UBE2E2, is vital for determining the type of ubiquitin chains formed, which have distinct biological outcomes (Sheng2012A). UBE2E2's ability to conjugate both ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, such as ISG15, highlights its role in diverse cellular pathways (Wijk2009The).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2E2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In the context of type 2 diabetes, a genome-wide association study identified UBE2E2 as a susceptibility locus specifically in the Japanese population, suggesting a population-specific genetic predisposition (Yamauchi2010A). However, similar associations were not observed in European populations, highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in research (Yamauchi2010A).

In ovarian cancer, UBE2E2 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis by enhancing Snail-mediated signaling and Nrf2-mediated antioxidant activity. UBE2E2 increases p62 accumulation, which stabilizes Snail protein by inhibiting its ubiquitination, thus promoting cancer cell migration and invasion (Hong2023UBE2E2). Silencing UBE2E2 in ovarian cancer cell lines reduces cell proliferation and migration, indicating its role in tumor progression (Hong2023UBE2E2).

UBE2E2 polymorphisms have also been studied in relation to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but no significant associations were found in the Polish population, suggesting that UBE2E2 may not be a major risk factor for GDM in this group (Ustianowski2022PPARG).

## Interactions
UBE2E2 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that interacts with various E3 ligases, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination process. Despite its high sequence similarity to other E2 proteins like UBE2E1, UBE2E2 exhibits distinct interaction profiles with E3 ligases. UBE2E2 specifically interacts with E3 ligases such as Wwp1, Rbx2, and Ube3a, which are involved in different cellular pathways (Kar2012Human). The specificity of these interactions is influenced by slight variations in the amino acid sequence of UBE2E2, particularly in loop L1, which affects binding affinities (Kar2012Human).

Structural studies have shown that UBE2E2 is part of a net positive charged cluster, which may influence its interaction with E3 ligases (Sheng2012A). The electrostatic potential of UBE2E2 has been analyzed to understand its surface charge characteristics, which are important for its interactions with E3 ligases (Sheng2012A). Despite its structural similarity to other E2 enzymes, UBE2E2 has a unique interaction pattern, suggesting that it plays a specific role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (van2009A). These interactions are essential for the correct ubiquitination of target proteins, highlighting the importance of UBE2E2 in maintaining protein homeostasis.
