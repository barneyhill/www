# CCT8

## Overview
CCT8 is a gene that encodes the protein chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 8, which is a critical component of the eukaryotic type II chaperonin complex, also known as the TRiC/CCT complex. This complex is essential for the proper folding of a significant portion of the eukaryotic proteome, including key cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are vital for maintaining cellular structure and function (Noormohammadi2016Somatic; Oftedal2020The). The CCT8 protein is characterized by its unique GDGTN motif at the ATP-binding site, distinguishing it from other subunits and suggesting a specialized role in ATP binding (Kalisman2013The). CCT8 is involved in various cellular processes, including the maintenance of proteostasis, cellular response to protein misfolding, and the regulation of pluripotency in stem cells (Noormohammadi2016Somatic). Additionally, CCT8 has been implicated in cancer progression, serving as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target due to its role in protein folding and cellular interactions (Wu2023CCT8; Liu2021Exploring).

## Structure
The CCT8 protein, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), plays a crucial role in protein folding within eukaryotic cells. Structurally, CCT8 is part of a double-ring complex, with each ring composed of eight distinct subunits, including CCT1 to CCT8 (Machida2012Reconstitution). Each subunit, including CCT8, contains three domains: the equatorial domain (E domain) with ATP binding regions, the apical domain (A domain) involved in substrate binding, and the intermediate domain (I domain) connecting the E and A domains (Araki2023Molecular).

CCT8 is characterized by a GDGTN motif at its ATP-binding site, which differs from the more common GDGTT motif found in other subunits, suggesting a unique role in ATP binding but not hydrolysis (Kalisman2013The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-terminal processing such as methionine excision and acetylation (Collier2021Native). CCT8 is also noted for its stability within the complex, which may reflect its role in the assembly process (Collier2021Native). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of CCT8 with other subunits to form the functional CCT complex, essential for the folding of cytoskeletal proteins like actin and tubulin (Kalisman2013The).

## Function
CCT8, or chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 8, is a crucial component of the eukaryotic type II chaperonin complex, known as the TRiC/CCT complex. This complex is essential for the folding of approximately 10% of the eukaryotic proteome, including key cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are vital for maintaining cellular structure and function (Noormohammadi2016Somatic; Oftedal2020The). CCT8 plays a significant role in maintaining proteostasis, which is critical for cell viability and function. It is involved in the assembly of the TRiC/CCT complex, acting as a potential activator that enhances the complex's assembly without altering the total protein levels of other subunits like CCT1 (Noormohammadi2016Somatic).

In human pluripotent stem cells, CCT8 is highly expressed and is intrinsic to maintaining their undifferentiated state and self-renewal capabilities. The expression of CCT8 and other CCT subunits decreases during differentiation, which correlates with a decline in pluripotency (Noormohammadi2016Somatic). CCT8 is also implicated in the cellular response to protein misfolding, as its overexpression can protect against proteotoxic stress and extend the lifespan of model organisms like C. elegans (Noormohammadi2016Somatic). In T cells, CCT8 is essential for proper maturation, selection, and function, impacting processes such as actin filament formation and the unfolded protein response (Oftedal2020The).

## Clinical Significance
CCT8, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in protein folding and cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high CCT8 expression is linked to poor clinical prognosis, larger tumor size, and higher histologic grade. Alterations in CCT8 expression, including mutations and copy number changes, are associated with cancer progression and poor survival outcomes in HCC patients (Liu2021Exploring; Li2021Prognostic).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), CCT8 is overexpressed in metastatic tissues and is associated with lymph node metastasis and poor survival rates. Knockdown of CCT8 in ESCC cells reduces migration and invasion, indicating its role in cancer cell motility (Yang2018Chaperonincontaining).

CCT8 is also implicated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where its high expression correlates with poor overall survival and increased tumor metastasis. CCT8 promotes cancer progression by activating AKT signaling, which enhances cell migration and metastasis (Wu2023CCT8).

These findings suggest that CCT8 is a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
CCT8, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT or TRiC), is involved in various protein interactions essential for cellular processes. It plays a significant role in the folding and assembly of proteins, particularly within the mTOR complex. CCT8 interacts with mLST8, a component of the mTOR complex, positioning it between the CCT rings and interacting through the N-and C-termini of the CCT subunits (Cuéllar2019Structural). This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the mTOR complex, with CCT8 contributing to the asymmetric ATP-binding and substrate folding mechanism of CCT (Cuéllar2019Structural).

CCT8 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 in the context of colorectal cancer. It inhibits the nuclear entry of wild-type p53, thereby antagonizing its anti-tumor effects. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, showing that CCT8 binds to p53 in the cytoplasm (Liao2021CCT8).

Additionally, CCT8 is part of a broader interactome involving various proteins, including actin and tubulin, which are critical for cytoskeletal functions. These interactions are facilitated by the CCT complex's role in protein folding and cellular processes (Narayanan2016The; Dekker2008The).
