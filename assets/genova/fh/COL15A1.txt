# COL15A1

## Overview
The COL15A1 gene encodes the collagen type XV alpha 1 chain, a non-fibrillar collagen that plays a significant role in the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This protein is categorized as a proteoglycan/collagen hybrid due to its unique structure, which includes glycosaminoglycan chains such as chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate (Bretaud2020Collagen). Collagen type XV is primarily associated with basement membranes and is involved in various physiological processes, including the maturation and myelination of peripheral nerves and the maintenance of micro-vessel integrity in the cardiovascular system (Bretaud2020Collagen). The widespread expression of COL15A1 across different cell types underscores its importance in maintaining the ECM's structural framework and facilitating cellular interactions (Bretaud2020Collagen). Additionally, alterations in COL15A1 expression have been linked to pathological conditions such as cancer and glaucoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Wiggs2013Variations; MartínezNieto2021Deletion).

## Structure
The COL15A1 gene encodes the alpha 1 chain of type XV collagen, a non-fibrillar collagen associated with basement membranes. The primary structure of the protein consists of 1388 amino acids, including a 25-residue signal peptide, a 530-residue N-terminal noncollagenous domain (NC1), a 577-residue collagenous sequence with nine triple helical domains interrupted by non-collagenous regions, and a 256-residue C-terminal noncollagenous domain (NC10) (Hägg1998Complete; Kivirikko1994Primary). The NC1 domain contains a tandem repeat structure and shows homology to the rat cartilage proteoglycan core protein (Muragaki1994The).

The secondary structure includes multiple triple helical domains characterized by the (Gly-X-Y) triplet sequence, which are interspersed with non-triple helical regions (Bretaud2020Collagen). The tertiary structure features a trimerization domain within the NC1 domain, crucial for the assembly of the triple helix (Bretaud2020Collagen). The quaternary structure of collagen XV is a homotrimer, consisting of three identical alpha 1 chains (Bretaud2020Collagen).

Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation and glycosaminoglycan attachment, with potential sites identified within the collagenous sequence (Kivirikko1994Primary). The protein also carries chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate chains, contributing to its function as a proteoglycan/collagen hybrid (Bretaud2020Collagen).

## Function
Collagen XV, encoded by the COL15A1 gene, is a non-fibrillar collagen associated with basement membranes and plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in healthy human cells (Bretaud2020Collagen). It is expressed by various cell types, including connective tissue cells, muscle cells, osteoblasts, adipocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and neuronal cells, indicating its widespread distribution across tissues (Bretaud2020Collagen). Collagen XV serves as a structural link between cells and the underlying connective tissue, contributing to the maintenance of a porous network essential for the diffusion of extracellular signaling molecules (Bretaud2020Collagen).

In the peripheral nervous system, collagen XV is involved in the maturation and myelination of peripheral nerves, providing structural support to Schwann cells and facilitating the organization of C-fibers and axon segregation (Bretaud2020Collagen). It also plays a significant role in the cardiovascular system, where it maintains the integrity of micro-vessels in skeletal muscles and the heart (Bretaud2020Collagen). The presence of glycosaminoglycan chains in collagen XV contributes to the regulation of signaling pathways and the structural organization of the ECM, influencing processes such as axon growth and angiogenesis (Bretaud2020Collagen).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the COL15A1 gene, which encodes collagen type XV alpha 1 chain, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Although no specific human disorder is currently associated with mutations in the COL15A1 gene, its role as a modifier in several conditions has been identified. Variants in COL15A1 have been linked to the age of onset of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The R163H variant, in particular, is associated with an earlier onset of the disease, suggesting that COL15A1 variants may influence the susceptibility of the optic nerve to degeneration (Wiggs2013Variations).

In cancer, alterations in COL15A1 expression have been observed in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In breast cancer, the loss of collagen XV from the ductal basement membrane is associated with tumor progression, potentially leading to a fragile structure that promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis (MartínezNieto2021Deletion). In HCC, increased expression of collagen XV is noted in tumoral regions, contributing to the capillarization process, a characteristic feature of the disease (Kimura2015Human). These findings suggest that COL15A1 plays a role in tumor suppression and vascular changes in cancer.

## Interactions
COL15A1, encoding the collagen type XV alpha 1 chain, is involved in various interactions within the extracellular matrix (ECM). It plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the ECM and is associated with the organization of the fibrillar collagenous matrix. In the context of cancer, COL15A1 interacts with the laminin subunit a1, which is known to regulate mammary epithelial cell polarity by integrating signals from the collagenous matrix through laminin to luminal epithelial cells (MartínezNieto2021Deletion). This interaction is important for maintaining the proper architecture of the ECM and supporting E-cadherin stabilization and epithelial polarization.

COL15A1 is also involved in the tumor microenvironment, where it stabilizes tumor vessels and promotes the organization of a fibrotic tumor stroma (MartínezNieto2021Deletion). It is expressed by myoepithelial and endothelial cells in mammary tumors and is lost from the ductal basement membrane during cancer progression, indicating its role in ECM remodeling and tumor growth regulation (MartínezNieto2021Deletion). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of COL15A1 in both normal tissue maintenance and cancer progression, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and tissue organization.
