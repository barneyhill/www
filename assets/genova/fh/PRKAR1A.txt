# PRKAR1A

## Overview
The PRKAR1A gene encodes the protein kinase cAMP-dependent type I regulatory subunit alpha (RIα), a crucial component of the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit within the PKA holoenzyme, which is a tetrameric complex composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. Upon binding of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the regulatory subunits release the catalytic subunits, thereby activating PKA and enabling it to phosphorylate various target proteins involved in critical cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and differentiation (Horvath2010Mutations; Meoli2008Protein). The PRKAR1A gene is highly conserved across species, reflecting its essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating PKA activity (Horvath2010Mutations). Mutations in PRKAR1A are linked to Carney Complex, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple neoplasias, underscoring the gene's significance in tumor suppression and cellular signaling (Salpea2014Carney; Horvath2010Mutations).

## Structure
The PRKAR1A gene encodes the regulatory subunit type I alpha (RIα) of protein kinase A (PKA), which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling. The RIα protein is composed of 384 amino acids and includes several key domains: a dimerization/docking domain at the amino-terminal, a PKA inhibitor site, and two tandem cAMP-binding domains at the carboxyl terminus, known as cAMP:A and cAMP:B (Horvath2010Mutations). The primary structure of RIα consists of a sequence of amino acids that form these functional domains. 

The secondary structure of RIα includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of its compact tertiary structure. This tertiary structure is essential for binding cAMP, a critical function of the protein. The quaternary structure involves dimerization and interaction with the catalytic subunits of PKA, which is vital for its regulatory role (Horvath2010Mutations).

Mutations in PRKAR1A can lead to various structural changes, such as the deletion of sequences corresponding to exon 6, which affects the cAMP-binding domain and alters protein interactions and localization (Meoli2008Protein). These mutations can result in different isoforms with distinct functions, impacting the protein's role in cellular processes (Horvath2010Mutations).

## Function
The PRKAR1A gene encodes the regulatory subunit type 1-alpha (RIα) of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), a key mediator of cAMP effects in eukaryotic cells (Horvath2010Mutations). In its inactive state, PKA is a tetramer composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. When cAMP levels increase, it binds to the regulatory subunits, causing the tetramer to dissociate and release active catalytic subunits. These catalytic subunits phosphorylate various cellular targets, influencing processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation (Horvath2010Mutations).

The RIα protein contains a dimerization domain, a PKA inhibitor site, and two cAMP binding domains, which are crucial for its regulatory function (Horvath2010Mutations). It can localize to specific cellular compartments and bind to A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs), highlighting its role in spatially organizing PKA activity within the cell (Horvath2010Mutations). The PRKAR1A gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its importance in regulating PKA activity and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Horvath2010Mutations). This regulation is vital for normal cellular function and organismal development, impacting various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRKAR1A gene are primarily associated with Carney Complex (CNC), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple neoplasias, including cardiac myxomas, skin lesions, and various endocrine tumors such as primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) and growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumors (Rodriguez2011Genetic; Horvath2010Mutations). These mutations often lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, resulting in haploinsufficiency and increased cAMP signaling, which contributes to tumorigenesis (Salpea2014Carney; Horvath2010Mutations).

PRKAR1A mutations can also result in altered protein forms due to amino acid substitutions or in-frame genetic alterations, which escape nonsense-mediated decay and lead to increased PKA activity (Horvath2010Mutations; Meoli2008Protein). This dysregulation of PKA activity is linked to enhanced MAPK signaling and increased cell proliferation, further contributing to the development of CNC and PPNAD (RobinsonWhite2006PRKAR1AMutations; Salpea2014Carney).

In some cases, large deletions in the PRKAR1A gene have been identified, leading to decreased mRNA expression and contributing to the clinical manifestations of CNC, such as lentigines and cardiac myxomas (Horvath2008Large). The gene's role as a tumor suppressor is underscored by the frequent loss of heterozygosity observed in tumors from CNC patients (Rodriguez2011Genetic).

## Interactions
PRKAR1A, the regulatory subunit type 1-alpha of protein kinase A (PKA), participates in various protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. It interacts with the catalytic subunit of PKA, forming a holoenzyme complex that is essential for regulating PKA activity. Mutations in PRKAR1A, such as the R1aD6 mutation, can disrupt this interaction, leading to increased PKA activity and altered cellular localization (Meoli2008Protein).

PRKAR1A also forms complexes with other proteins, such as A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which help localize PKA to specific cellular compartments (Horvath2010Mutations). The interaction with AKAPs is crucial for the spatial and temporal regulation of PKA signaling. Additionally, PRKAR1A can interact with cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb, potentially influencing energy metabolism independently of PKA catalytic subunits (Bossis2004Minireview:).

In the context of left atrial myxoma, PRKAR1A expression is regulated by KIF1C, which binds to its promoter region. This interaction affects the transcriptional regulation of PRKAR1A and subsequently influences PKA pathway activation, impacting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Zhou2023Crosstalk). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PRKAR1A in cellular signaling and its potential involvement in tumorigenesis.
