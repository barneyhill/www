# CTBP2

## Overview
CTBP2, or C-terminal binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a transcriptional co-repressor protein involved in various cellular processes, including gene regulation, metabolism, and development. The CTBP2 protein is characterized by its role as a transcriptional co-repressor, interacting with multiple transcription factors and forming complexes that modulate gene expression. It contains a D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (D2-HDH) domain, which is crucial for its function as a metabolite sensor, particularly in the liver, where it regulates glucose and lipid homeostasis. CTBP2 is also implicated in the regulation of lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis, maintaining metabolic balance. The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as transcription factors and components of the NuRD complex, underscore its significance in cellular regulation. Clinically, CTBP2 is associated with various diseases, including cancer, cardiac development disorders, and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Chen2021The; Sekiya2021The; Bergman2006Role).

## Structure
CTBP2, or C-terminal binding protein 2, is a transcriptional co-repressor with a complex molecular structure. The protein is composed of 445 amino acids and includes a unique N-terminal domain that is crucial for its nuclear localization. This domain contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within amino acids 4-14, which directs the protein to the nucleus (Bergman2006Role). The N-terminal domain also facilitates heterodimerization with CtBP1, aiding in its nuclear recruitment (Bergman2006Role).

CTBP2 contains a D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (D2-HDH) domain, which binds NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H as a coenzyme, playing a critical role in its function (Bellesis2018Assembly). The protein forms a tetrameric structure, described as a dimer of dimers, with significant interactions at the dimer interface stabilized by NADH binding (Jecrois2021CryoEM). Key residues such as Arg190, Leu221, Ser128, and Ala129 are involved in stabilizing the tetramer through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (Jecrois2021CryoEM).

CTBP2 also undergoes post-translational modifications, including acetylation, which is necessary for its nuclear localization (Bergman2006Role). The protein has a retina-specific splice variant called RIBEYE, generated through alternative promoter usage and splicing (Bergman2006Role).

## Function
CTBP2 (C-terminal binding protein 2) functions as a transcriptional corepressor involved in regulating hepatic glucose and lipid homeostasis. It acts as a metabolite sensor in the liver, responding to changes in cellular redox states and fatty acyl-CoA levels. CTBP2 forms a complex with the transcription factor FoxO1 to suppress gluconeogenic transcriptional programs, a process influenced by the presence of NADH and fatty acyl-CoAs. NADH stabilizes the CTBP2/FoxO1 complex, enhancing its corepressor activity, while fatty acyl-CoAs disrupt this interaction, allowing CTBP2 to sense and respond to metabolic changes (Sekiya2021The).

CTBP2 is also involved in the regulation of lipogenesis through its interaction with Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1 (SREBP1), indirectly influencing lipid metabolism. The protein's activity is modulated by its ability to form dimers, a process affected by the binding of metabolites like NADH and fatty acyl-CoAs to its Rossmann fold domain (Sekiya2021The). In healthy cells, CTBP2 helps maintain a balance between gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, crucial for energy balance and metabolic health (Sekiya2021The). CTBP2's proper function is essential for maintaining metabolic flexibility and preventing obesity-induced metabolic diseases (Sekiya2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CTBP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and cardiac development disorders. In cancer, CTBP2 is known to promote cell migration and invasion by transcriptionally activating the Tiam1 gene, which is crucial for cancer metastasis. This activation is mediated through interactions with transcription factors like KLF8, and the process is linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a key step in cancer progression (Paliwal2012CtBP2). CTBP2 also influences cancer cell behavior by interacting with tumor suppressors such as PTEN, affecting pathways like PI3K, which are involved in cell proliferation and migration (Chen2021The).

In cardiac development, CTBP2 plays a critical role, and its deficiency can lead to significant morphological defects. Mutations such as CTBP2 p.K8X result in the loss of functional domains, leading to defects in cardiac morphology, including pericardial dilation and blocked heart tube development in mice (Xing2023Novel). Additionally, CTBP2 mutations have been identified in patients with pulmonary atresia, suggesting a potential pathogenic role in this condition (Xing2023Novel).

CTBP2 is also involved in inflammatory diseases, where it regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes, contributing to conditions like acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Chen2021The).

## Interactions
CTBP2 (C-terminal binding protein 2) is a transcriptional co-repressor that interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in gene regulation. It interacts with transcription factors such as Ikaros and TRPS1 through the PIDLS motif, which is crucial for its recruitment to these factors (Quinlan2006Role). CTBP2 also binds to E2F7, a member of the E2F family, through a PLDLS-like motif, which is essential for repressing E2F1 transcription and inhibiting cell proliferation (Zhao2014CtBP2).

CTBP2 is involved in the NuRD complex, interacting specifically with the p66-beta subunit, a connection that requires its N-terminal domain (Zhao2014CtBP2). This interaction is unique to CTBP2 and is not observed with its homolog, CTBP1 (Zhao2014CtBP2). Additionally, CTBP2 interacts with cyclin H/cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CCNH/CDK7), which stabilizes CTBP2 by protecting it from proteasomal degradation (Wang2013Interaction).

CTBP2 also forms complexes with proteins like ZEB and zfh-1, which are transcriptional repressors. These interactions are mediated by a PLDLS sequence in the repressor domain of ZEB and zfh-1, highlighting the importance of this motif in CTBP2's role as a corepressor (Postigo1999ZEB).
