# MAN2C1

## Overview
The MAN2C1 gene encodes the enzyme mannosidase alpha class 2C member 1, a cytosolic α-mannosidase that plays a pivotal role in the catabolism of free oligosaccharides within cells. This enzyme is integral to the degradation of N-linked glycans, which are processed through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. MAN2C1 hydrolyzes specific mannose residues, facilitating the conversion of oligosaccharides into structures that are further degraded in lysosomes. Beyond its enzymatic functions, MAN2C1 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, influencing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and contributing to tumorigenesis in certain cancers, such as prostate and breast cancer. The gene's expression and activity are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper glycoprotein processing, with implications for both normal cellular function and disease states (He2011αMannosidase; Paciotti2014Accumulation; Wang2013Dual).

## Function
The MAN2C1 gene encodes the enzyme cytosolic α-mannosidase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of free oligosaccharides (fOS) in cells. This enzyme is involved in the degradation process of N-linked glycans, which are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and undergo quality control to ensure proper folding. Misfolded glycoproteins are retrotranslocated to the cytosol for degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process. During this process, free oligosaccharides are released and trimmed by MAN2C1, which hydrolyzes α-1,2-, α-1,3-, and α-1,6-linked mannose residues, converting them into Man 5 GlcNAc structures. These structures are then transferred to lysosomes for complete degradation (Paciotti2014Accumulation; Bernon2010Overexpression).

MAN2C1 is essential for maintaining efficient protein N-glycosylation, as it regulates the levels of free mannose in the cytosol, which in turn affects glucose metabolism and the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) necessary for glycosylation (Bernon2010Overexpression). The enzyme's activity is crucial for proper glycoprotein processing, preventing the accumulation of oligosaccharides and associated cellular damage (Paciotti2014Accumulation). In healthy human cells, MAN2C1 also plays a role in apoptotic signaling, with its down-regulation leading to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (Wang2013Dual).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAN2C1 gene have been implicated in various cancer-related processes. In prostate cancer, MAN2C1 promotes tumorigenesis by inhibiting the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, leading to enhanced activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. This interaction results in increased tumor growth and progression, as demonstrated in studies where MAN2C1 knockdown reduced tumor formation, an effect that was reversed by PTEN knockdown (He2011αMannosidase). MAN2C1 is also associated with breast cancer, where its overexpression correlates with increased AKT activation and cancer progression. It has been identified as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for distinguishing between cancerous and benign breast tissues (Fujita2020Rapid).

In addition to its role in cancer, MAN2C1 deficiency in mice leads to the accumulation of free oligosaccharides in various tissues, causing significant histopathological changes, particularly in the central nervous system, liver, and intestine. This accumulation is linked to tissue damage and metabolic disturbances, suggesting that MAN2C1 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis (Paciotti2014Accumulation).

## Interactions
MAN2C1, or mannosidase alpha class 2C member 1, is known to interact with the PTEN protein, a tumor suppressor involved in regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. MAN2C1 binds to PTEN and inhibits its PIP3 phosphatase activity, which is crucial for PTEN's role in antagonizing the PI3K/AKT pathway. This interaction has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in prostate cancer cells by enhancing AKT activation and cell survival (He2011αMannosidase). The interaction between MAN2C1 and PTEN is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies in various cell lines, including DU145, MCF7, and NIH3T3 cells (He2011αMannosidase).

Specific domains within MAN2C1, particularly the C-terminal 236 residues (C-MAN236), are crucial for binding to PTEN. This binding affects PTEN's regulatory role in cell survival and proliferation (He2011αMannosidase). MAN2C1's interaction with PTEN is significant in PTEN-positive prostate cancers, where it correlates with increased AKT activation, indicating a potential mechanism by which MAN2C1 contributes to cancer progression (He2011αMannosidase). These interactions suggest that MAN2C1 plays a role in modulating PTEN function, impacting cellular processes related to cancer development.
