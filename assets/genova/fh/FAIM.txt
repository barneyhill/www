# FAIM

## Overview
The FAIM gene encodes the Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule, a protein that plays a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis, particularly in response to Fas receptor activation. FAIM is characterized by its unique structural features, including a compact non-interleaved seven-stranded β-sandwich structure, and exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, such as FAIM-S and FAIM-L, which have distinct expression patterns and functional roles (Coccia2017Identification; Huo2019FAIM:). The protein is not homologous to small heat shock proteins, despite some structural similarities, and is involved in various cellular processes, including neuronal differentiation, immune cell regulation, and stress response (Kaku2022Small; Huo2009Genetic). FAIM's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in diseases such as multiple myeloma, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, where alterations in its expression or function can impact disease progression and patient outcomes (Huo2019FAIM:; Huo2016Loss).

## Structure
FAIM (Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule) is a protein with a unique primary structure, lacking significant sequence homology with known proteins (Huo2019FAIM:). It exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including FAIM-S, FAIM-L, FAIM-S_2a, and FAIM-L_2a, which differ in their expression patterns and functional roles (Coccia2017Identification).

Structurally, FAIM features a rare compact non-interleaved seven-stranded β-sandwich structure with an anti-parallel β-sheet in the C-terminal region and a highly disordered N-terminal region (Kaku2019FAIM; Kaku2022Small). The N-terminal and C-terminal regions can fold independently, forming distinct domains. The C-terminal domain (CTD) shares topological features with the 'up-and-down barrel' motif found in fatty acid binding proteins but is too small to accommodate a fatty acid residue (Huo2019FAIM:). The N-terminal domain (NTD) exists as a dimer, while the CTD is a monomer, and they can interact with each other, which is crucial for FAIM's anti-apoptotic activity (Huo2019FAIM:).

FAIM has a significant underrepresentation of cysteine residues, which may help prevent unwanted crosslinking under oxidative conditions, allowing it to resist denaturation and perform its function in preventing protein aggregation (Kaku2019FAIM). Despite structural similarities to small heat shock proteins, FAIM is not homologous to them (Kaku2022Small).

## Function
The Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule (FAIM) is a protein that plays a crucial role in inhibiting apoptosis, particularly in response to Fas receptor activation. FAIM exists in two main isoforms: FAIM-S, which is ubiquitously expressed, and FAIM-L, which is primarily found in neuronal tissues. FAIM-S is involved in promoting neurite outgrowth through the activation of NF-kB and Ras-ERK signaling pathways, contributing to neuronal differentiation and survival (Coccia2017Identification; Huo2009Genetic). FAIM-L, on the other hand, acts as an endogenous antagonist of death receptors, such as Fas and TNFα, by inhibiting the activation of caspase-8, thereby protecting neurons from apoptosis (Segura2007The).

In immune cells, FAIM modulates apoptosis by regulating c-FLIP expression and controlling the association of caspase-8 with Fas, setting a threshold for Fas activation to prevent accidental cell death (Huo2009Genetic). FAIM also plays a role in cellular defense against stress-induced damage by preventing the accumulation of stress-induced protein aggregates, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and viability under conditions of heat and oxidative stress (Kaku2020FAIM).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the FAIM gene have been implicated in various diseases. In multiple myeloma (MM), FAIM expression is upregulated, contributing to the survival of MM cells by enhancing the expression of the transcription factor IRF4. This creates a feedback loop that promotes cell survival, and FAIM knockdown in MM cells reduces survival and decreases levels of critical proteins like Blimp-1 and Mcl-1. Clinically, higher FAIM expression in MM patients correlates with poorer survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker (Huo2019FAIM:).

FAIM also plays a role in metabolic disorders. FAIM-deficient mice develop obesity and hepatosteatosis, conditions resembling human metabolic syndrome. This is linked to impaired insulin signaling and increased lipogenesis, suggesting that FAIM deficiency leads to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction (Huo2016Loss).

In neurodegenerative diseases, FAIM, particularly its long form (FAIM L), is crucial for neuronal survival. Reduced levels of FAIM L have been observed in conditions like Alzheimer's disease, indicating its potential involvement in neurodegeneration (Coccia2017Identification; Segura2007The).

## Interactions
FAIM (Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule) interacts with several proteins to modulate apoptosis and other cellular processes. The FAIM-L isoform directly associates with the Fas receptor, preventing the activation of caspase-8, which is crucial for its role in antagonizing Fas-induced apoptosis (Huo2019FAIM:). FAIM-L also interacts with the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), specifically binding to the baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR)2 domain of XIAP. This interaction inhibits XIAP auto-ubiquitination, maintaining its stability and protecting cells from apoptosis (Huo2019FAIM:; Moubarak2013FAIML). FAIM-L's interaction with XIAP is mediated through the N-terminal IAP-Binding Motif (IBM) of FAIM-L, which starts with an alanine (Moubarak2013FAIML).

FAIM-S, another isoform, is involved in promoting neurite outgrowth through interactions with TrkA and p75 neurotrophin receptors in a ligand-dependent manner (Huo2019FAIM:). FAIM-S also interacts with small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) like HSP27, preventing protein aggregation during cellular stress. This interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, showing that FAIM-S and HSP27 have an additive effect in preventing β-amyloid fibrillization (Kaku2022Small). FAIM is recruited to complexes containing ubiquitinated proteins under stress conditions, suggesting a role in managing protein aggregates (Kaku2020FAIM).
