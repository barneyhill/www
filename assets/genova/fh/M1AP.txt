# M1AP

## Overview
M1AP, or meiosis 1 associated protein, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the process of spermatogenesis, particularly during meiosis in male germ cells. The protein encoded by M1AP is involved in the progression of meiosis by interacting with the ZZS complex proteins, including SHOC1, TEX11, and SPO16, which are essential for DNA class I crossover formation. This protein is predominantly expressed in the testis, specifically in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, and plays a significant role in chromosomal segregation and meiotic progression. Although M1AP is not indispensable, as some germ cells can progress to the haploid stage without it, its presence enhances the efficiency of meiotic processes. Mutations in the M1AP gene are linked to male infertility, particularly non-obstructive azoospermia, due to impaired spermatogenesis and meiotic arrest (Rotte2024Genotypespecific; Wyrwoll2020Biallelic).

## Function
M1AP (meiosis 1 associated protein) plays a critical role in the process of spermatogenesis, particularly during meiosis in male germ cells. It is involved in the progression of meiosis by interacting with the ZZS complex proteins SHOC1, TEX11, and SPO16, which are essential for DNA class I crossover formation during meiosis (Rotte2024Genotypespecific). M1AP is expressed in male germ cells during the late stages of spermatogenesis and is crucial for proper chromosomal segregation and meiotic progression (Rotte2024Genotypespecific; Wyrwoll2020Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, M1AP is highly expressed in the testis, particularly in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, with weaker expression in secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids (Tu2020An). This expression pattern suggests that M1AP is involved in the normal development and function of sperm cells, particularly in the mitochondrial sheath and flagellar midpiece, which are crucial for sperm motility and fertility (Tu2020An). The protein's role as a functional enhancer in the ZZS network underscores its importance in facilitating proper meiotic progression, although it is not essential, as some germ cells can still progress to the haploid stage even in its absence (Rotte2024Genotypespecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the M1AP gene are clinically significant as they are frequently associated with male infertility, particularly non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). NOA is characterized by the absence of sperm in the ejaculate due to impaired spermatogenesis, often resulting from meiotic arrest. Studies have identified biallelic mutations in M1AP, such as the homozygous frameshift variant c.676dup, which leads to a truncated protein and is prevalent in European populations, likely due to a founder mutation (Wyrwoll2019Biallelic; Wyrwoll2020Biallelic). These mutations cause severe spermatogenic failure, with affected individuals often exhibiting complete meiotic arrest (Wyrwoll2020Biallelic).

M1AP interacts with proteins involved in meiotic recombination, such as SHOC1, TEX11, and SPO16, which are crucial for DNA crossover formation. Deficiencies in M1AP can lead to metaphase I arrest and reduced crossover events, contributing to infertility (Rotte2024Genotypespecific). While M1AP is essential for proper meiotic progression, some germ cells can still progress to the haploid stage in its absence, indicating a reduced but functional interaction with the ZZS complex proteins (Rotte2024Genotypespecific). These findings underscore the importance of M1AP in male fertility and suggest its inclusion in diagnostic assessments for infertile men.
