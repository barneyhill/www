# PSKH2

## Overview
PSKH2 (protein serine kinase H2) is a gene that encodes a pseudokinase, which is a member of the human kinome. Despite being classified as a pseudokinase due to a modification in its catalytic motif, PSKH2 retains structural features that suggest it may still possess catalytic activity or play a regulatory role in cellular signaling pathways (Shrestha2020Cataloguing). The protein encoded by PSKH2 is implicated in the regulation of Factor V activity and is associated with neutrophil biology, indicating its involvement in coagulation and inflammatory processes (Gendre2024A). Additionally, PSKH2 has been linked to various cancers, including clear cell renal carcinoma, highlighting its potential significance in oncogenesis and as a therapeutic target (Bailey2015Going; Reiterer2014Day).

## Function
PSKH2 (protein serine kinase H2) is a pseudokinase that is part of the human kinome, closely related to the canonical kinase PSKH1. Despite being classified as a pseudokinase due to a single amino acid change in the HRD motif to HRN, which typically abolishes catalytic activity, PSKH2 may still have catalytic potential and specific regulatory roles in human cells (Shrestha2020Cataloguing). It shares several conserved features with PSKH1, such as a Gly-rich loop and magnesium-binding residues, suggesting it might adopt an 'active-like' conformation (Shrestha2020Cataloguing).

PSKH2 is involved in the genetic regulation of Factor V (FV) activity, with a significant signal observed at the PSKH2 locus affecting FV plasma levels (Gendre2024A). It is also associated with neutrophil biology and interacts with loci involved in smoking biology, indicating a potential role in neutrophil-related processes (Gendre2024A). The exact function of PSKH2 in healthy human cells remains largely unstudied, but it is suggested to have noncatalytic functions and may act as a regulatory protein in cellular signaling pathways (Reiterer2014Day; Shrestha2020Cataloguing).

## Clinical Significance
PSKH2 (protein serine kinase H2) has been implicated in various human diseases, particularly cancer. Mutations in PSKH2 are associated with clear cell renal carcinoma, with the G312D mutation being specifically noted for its potential link to this disease (Reiterer2014Day). The gene is overexpressed or somatically mutated in multiple cancers, suggesting its role in oncogenesis (Reiterer2014Day). PSKH2 has a mutation rate of 0.61, which is strongly linked to renal carcinoma, indicating its significance as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Bailey2015Going).

In addition to its role in cancer, PSKH2 has been identified as a novel player in the genetic regulation of Factor V (FV) plasma levels, which are crucial in the coagulation cascade. A significant association was found between the PSKH2 locus and the variance of FV plasma levels, although not with the mean levels, suggesting its involvement in the variability of FV activity (Gendre2024A). The lead variant rs75463553 at the PSKH2 locus is associated with DNA methylation and neutrophil count, correlating with F5 expression in inflammatory disorders (Gendre2024A). These findings highlight the gene's potential role in coagulation and inflammatory processes.
