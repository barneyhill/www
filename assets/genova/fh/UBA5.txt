# UBA5

## Overview
UBA5 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 5, a noncanonical E1 enzyme involved in the activation of ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1). This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the ufmylation pathway, a post-translational modification process analogous to ubiquitination, which is essential for various cellular functions, including protein degradation, cellular trafficking, and stress response. UBA5 is characterized by its unique structural features, including a smaller size compared to other E1 enzymes and the presence of a distinct adenylation domain. The protein functions as a homodimer, with its activity being concentration-dependent, and it contains a specialized interaction motif known as the LC3-interacting region/UFM1-interacting motif (LIR/UFIM), crucial for binding UFM1 and LC3/GABARAP proteins. Mutations in the UBA5 gene are linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein stability (Habisov2016Structural; Bacik2010Crystal; Chen2024Patient).

## Structure
UBA5 is a noncanonical E1 enzyme involved in the activation of ubiquitin-like proteins, specifically UFM1. The protein is expressed in humans as two isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the longer variant having additional N-terminal residues that enhance its affinity for ATP and increase the rate of UFM1 activation (Lv2019UFM1Activating; Bacik2010Crystal). Structurally, UBA5 is smaller than other E1 enzymes, lacking the first and second catalytic cysteine half-domains (FCCH and SCCH) and consisting mainly of an adenylation domain followed by a short C-terminal domain (Bacik2010Crystal).

The adenylation domain of UBA5 features an eight-stranded β-sheet surrounded by seven α-helices, similar to other E1 and E1-like enzymes, and includes a zinc-binding site coordinated by four cysteines (Bacik2010Crystal). The catalytic cysteine (Cys 250) is located within this domain, differing from other E1 enzymes where it is typically within the SCCH domain (Bacik2010Crystal).

UBA5 functions as a homodimer, with its quaternary structure being concentration-dependent, forming monomers at low concentrations and dimers at higher concentrations (Fuchs2021Structure). The dimerization is essential for its function, particularly in the trans-binding mechanism for UFM1 activation (Oweis2016Trans).

## Function
UBA5 (ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 5) is a crucial E1 enzyme involved in the ufmylation pathway, a post-translational modification process similar to ubiquitination. UBA5 activates ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) by forming a high-energy thioester bond, facilitating its transfer to the E2 enzyme UFC1, and subsequently to target proteins (Habisov2016Structural; Bacik2010Crystal). This process is essential for various cellular functions, including protein degradation, cellular trafficking, and response to cellular stress (Bacik2010Crystal).

UBA5 contains a unique interaction motif, the LC3-interacting region/UFM1-interacting motif (LIR/UFIM), which is critical for binding UFM1 and LC3/GABARAP proteins. This motif is necessary for UBA5's full biological activity and the effective transfer of UFM1 onto UFC1 and downstream substrates (Habisov2016Structural). The interaction with LC3/GABARAP proteins suggests a role in autophagy-related processes, as these proteins are associated with autophagic membranes and play roles in autophagosome expansion and cargo targeting (Habisov2016Structural).

In healthy human cells, UBA5 operates primarily in the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to protein homeostasis and cellular regulation. Its activity is indispensable for processes such as erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, with deficiencies leading to severe anemia and embryonic lethality in mice (Habisov2016Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UBA5 gene are associated with a range of severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 44 (DEE44), West syndrome, and other forms of epileptic encephalopathy. These conditions are characterized by developmental delays, epilepsy, microcephaly, movement disorders, and severe neurodevelopmental delay (Daida2018Biallelic; Chen2024Patient; Low2019Hemizygous). UBA5 mutations often result in loss of function, disrupting the ufmylation pathway, which is crucial for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and protein stability (Chen2024Patient; Pan2023Allelic).

Patients with UBA5 mutations frequently exhibit compound heterozygous variants, where one allele may be a mild loss-of-function variant and the other a severe one, leading to the manifestation of disease symptoms (Pan2023Allelic). The p.A371T variant, a common missense mutation, retains some functional activity and is present in the general population, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to enhance its activity (Chen2024Patient). Research using patient-derived models has identified defects in neurodevelopment, particularly affecting GABAergic interneuron differentiation, which contributes to the clinical features of these disorders (Chen2024Patient).

## Interactions
UBA5 interacts with several proteins through a unique motif known as the LIR/UFIM motif, which is crucial for its binding to ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) such as UFM1 and members of the LC3/GABARAP family. This motif is located at the C terminus of UBA5 and includes key residues like Trp-341, Ile-343, Leu-345, and Val-346, which are essential for its interactions (Habisov2016Structural). UBA5 preferentially interacts with the GABARAP subfamily over LC3 proteins, with GABARAPL2 showing the highest affinity (Habisov2016Structural; Huber2019An).

The interaction with UFM1 is characterized by nonpolar interactions, with Trp-341 playing a significant role in stabilizing the interaction (Habisov2016Structural). UBA5 also forms complexes with UFC1, facilitating the transfer of UFM1 in the ufmylation pathway. This interaction involves a unique sequence outside the adenylation domain of UBA5, which compensates for structural deficiencies in UFC1 (Kumar2021Structural).

Mutations in the LIR/UFIM motif significantly reduce UBA5's ability to interact with both UFM1 and LC3/GABARAP proteins, highlighting the motif's importance in UBA5's function (Habisov2016Structural).
