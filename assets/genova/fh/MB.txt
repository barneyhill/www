# MB

## Overview
The MB gene encodes myoglobin, a cytoplasmic hemoprotein that plays a pivotal role in oxygen transport and storage within muscle tissues, particularly in cardiomyocytes and oxidative skeletal muscle fibers. Myoglobin is a small, monomeric protein characterized by its globular structure, primarily composed of alpha helices, and contains a heme prosthetic group essential for its function. As a member of the globin family, myoglobin facilitates the diffusion of oxygen from the sarcolemma to the mitochondria, thereby supporting cellular respiration and energy production in muscle tissues. It also acts as a scavenger of nitric oxide, contributing to the regulation of oxygen delivery and utilization. Mutations in the MB gene can lead to myoglobinopathy, a condition marked by muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene and its encoded protein (Garry2007Molecular; Olivé2019Myoglobinopathy).

## Structure
Myoglobin (MB) is a globular protein primarily composed of alpha helices, forming a compact tertiary structure. The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain, lacking quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. The secondary structure of myoglobin is characterized by eight alpha helices that create a hydrophobic pocket, which houses the heme prosthetic group essential for oxygen binding (Frauenfelder2001The; Di2017Molecular). 

The heme group is centrally located and plays a critical role in the protein's function, with the iron atom serving as the active center for binding diatomic molecules like oxygen (Frauenfelder2001The). Key amino acids, such as His-93 and His-64, are crucial for the structural integrity and function of myoglobin, facilitating interactions with the heme group (Frauenfelder2001The).

Myoglobin contains internal cavities that are integral to its function, allowing for the binding and orientation of small molecules (Tilton1984Cavities). These cavities are not structural defects but are essential for the protein's role as a miniature chemical reactor (Frauenfelder2001The). Common post-translational modifications of myoglobin include phosphorylation and acetylation, which can influence its function and stability.

## Function
Myoglobin (MB) is a cytoplasmic hemoprotein predominantly found in cardiomyocytes and oxidative skeletal muscle fibers, where it plays a crucial role in oxygen transport and storage within striated muscles. It is a small, monomeric protein composed of 153 amino acids, featuring a heme prosthetic group essential for binding ligands such as oxygen, nitric oxide (NO), and carbon monoxide (CO) (Garry2007Molecular). Myoglobin facilitates the diffusion of oxygen from the sarcolemma to the mitochondria, maintaining a steady state of low sarcoplasmic oxygen pressure, which is vital for sustained muscle contraction (Wittenberg2003Myoglobin).

Myoglobin's oxygen-binding pattern is hyperbolic, allowing it to efficiently release oxygen in low oxygen tension environments, thus supporting cellular respiration and energy production in muscle tissues (Garry2007Molecular). It also acts as a scavenger of NO, converting it to nitrate, which helps regulate NO levels and, consequently, the rate of oxygen delivery and utilization in cells (Wittenberg2003Myoglobin). Myoglobin's role extends to protecting cardiac function from oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased vulnerability to oxidative challenges in myoglobin-deficient mice (Flögel2004Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MB gene, which encodes myoglobin, are associated with a condition known as myoglobinopathy. This is an adult-onset autosomal dominant myopathy characterized by sarcoplasmic inclusions in muscle tissue. The specific mutation c.292C>T (p.His98Tyr) in the MB gene has been identified in multiple families and is linked to this disorder. The mutation affects myoglobin's oxygen binding and increases the tendency for heme loss, leading to elevated levels of intracellular superoxide and oxidative stress. This contributes to the formation of lipid and protein aggregates in muscle tissue, resulting in muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, and, in some cases, cardiomyopathy (Olivé2019Myoglobinopathy).

Alterations in MB expression have also been implicated in cancer. In glioblastoma multiforme, MB expression correlates with hypoxia markers and tumor grade, suggesting a role in tumor aggressiveness. MB expression is modulated by low oxygen tensions, common in aggressive cancers, and may contribute to a more aggressive cancer phenotype (Elsherbiny2021Expression). In mammary carcinoma models, MB expression reduces tumor hypoxia and metastasis, indicating a protective role against cancer progression (Galluzzo2009Prevention; Aboouf2023Endogenous).
