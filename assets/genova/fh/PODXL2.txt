# PODXL2

## Overview
PODXL2 is a gene that encodes the protein podocalyxin-like 2, which is a member of the CD34 family of sialomucins. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. Podocalyxin-like 2 is known for its role in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, where it influences pathways related to cell motility and immune response. The protein interacts with intracellular partners through its PDZ domain-binding motif, impacting signaling pathways such as PI3K and GPCR. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cancer stem cell properties and promoting metastasis, highlighting the potential of PODXL2 as a therapeutic target in oncology (Soejima2021ITGB6Knockout; Lin2020PODXL2).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PODXL2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma and breast cancer. In cholangiocarcinoma, the knockout of integrin β6 (ITGB6) leads to a significant reduction in PODXL2 expression, which is associated with decreased cell migration and invasion. This suggests that PODXL2 may play a role in the aggressive characteristics of this cancer type, and its expression is correlated with clinical features such as localization, differentiation, and invasiveness (Soejima2021ITGB6Knockout).

In breast cancer, PODXL2 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. High levels of PODXL2 are associated with increased metastatic events and poor disease-free survival. The gene is involved in cell cycle regulation, chemoresistance, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to tumor metastasis through the Rac1/Akt signaling pathway. Silencing PODXL2 in breast cancer cell lines reduces cell proliferation and migration, indicating its role in cancer progression (Lin2020PODXL2).

These findings suggest that PODXL2 could serve as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment, given its involvement in tumor progression and metastasis. Further research is needed to fully understand its role and potential as a biomarker in various cancers.

## Interactions
PODXL2, a member of the CD34 family of proteins, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its role in cancer progression. It shares a PDZ domain-binding motif with PODXL, which allows it to interact with intracellular proteins such as ezrin and NHERF1/2. These interactions are significant as they influence signaling pathways like PI3K and GPCR, which are crucial for cellular processes such as motility and immune response (Lin2020PODXL2).

In breast cancer, PODXL2 is associated with several proteins related to cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics. These include SLC9A3R1 (NHERF1), SELL, EZR, AKT1, RAC1, PXN, POU5F1 (Oct-4), Nanog, SOX2, and ALDH1A1. Many of these proteins are involved in maintaining CSC properties and promoting metastasis, suggesting that PODXL2 plays an oncogenic role through the Rac1/AKT pathway (Lin2020PODXL2).

In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), PODXL2 is colocalized with integrin β6, indicating a potential interaction. The knockout of ITGB6, which encodes integrin β6, leads to a significant decrease in PODXL2 expression, suggesting that integrin β6 may regulate PODXL2 expression and influence cell migration and invasion (Soejima2021ITGB6Knockout).
