# IFRD1

## Overview
The IFRD1 gene encodes the protein interferon-related developmental regulator 1, which is a multifunctional transcriptional co-regulator involved in various cellular processes, including muscle differentiation, adipogenesis, and osteoblastogenesis. As a transcriptional co-regulator, IFRD1 interacts with key signaling pathways and proteins, such as MyoD in muscle cells and Smad proteins in osteoblasts, to modulate gene expression and cellular differentiation (Onishi2017The; Micheli2011PC4Tis7IFRD1). IFRD1 also plays a role in inflammatory responses by interacting with NF-κB and histone deacetylases, influencing immune signaling and gene expression (Iezaki2016Transcriptional; Mann2023Bromodomaincontaining). Clinically, alterations in IFRD1 expression and mutations have been linked to diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes, cystic fibrosis, and colon cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lewis2017Increased; Liu2015Mutated; Blanchard2011Reduced).

## Function
The IFRD1 gene, also known as TIS7, encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation. In skeletal muscle cells, IFRD1 functions as a coactivator of MyoD, enhancing the transcriptional activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), which is crucial for muscle differentiation and regeneration. Up-regulation of IFRD1 in adult muscle promotes injury-induced regeneration by facilitating myogenesis, while its silencing delays cell cycle exit and differentiation, an effect dependent on MyoD (Micheli2011PC4Tis7IFRD1).

IFRD1 also plays a significant role in adipogenesis, the process by which multipotent stem cells are converted into adipocytes. It negatively affects Wnt signaling, a pathway that inhibits adipocyte differentiation, thereby promoting adipogenesis. In IFRD1 knockout mice, there is an upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional activity, leading to reduced adipocyte differentiation (Vietor2023The).

In osteoblastogenesis, IFRD1 is upregulated by BMP-2 and acts as a negative regulator of BMP-2-dependent osteoblast differentiation and maturation. This regulation is mediated through the Smad pathway, where IFRD1 modulates the expression of osteoblast marker genes (Onishi2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IFRD1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the IFRD1 gene is frequently mutated, with the C133R mutation occurring in 30% of samples. This mutation is associated with the regulation of gene activity in proliferation and differentiation pathways, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of MDS through haploinsufficiency or mutation-related loss of genetic functions (Liu2015Mutated).

In cystic fibrosis (CF), reduced expression of the IFRD1 protein has been observed in airway epithelial cells with the F508del-CFTR mutation. This reduction is linked to increased inflammatory markers, suggesting that IFRD1 may modulate inflammation in CF (Blanchard2011Reduced). Although IFRD1 variants were initially considered as potential modifiers of CF lung disease severity, subsequent studies did not find significant associations (Weiler2013Genetic).

In colon cancer, increased expression of IFRD1 is associated with reduced patient survival, particularly in right-sided colon cancers, which generally have a worse prognosis. IFRD1's role as a transcriptional co-regulator may influence cancer cell metabolism and tumor aggressiveness, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Lewis2017Increased).

## Interactions
IFRD1 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in modulating transcriptional regulation and inflammatory responses. It forms a complex with the NF-κB subunit p65 in the nucleus of bone marrow macrophages, enhancing NF-κB/NFATc1 signaling, which is crucial for osteoclastogenesis. This interaction is selective to the nucleus and is demonstrated by an oligonucleotide pulldown assay using the consensus NF-κB binding sequence (Iezaki2016Transcriptional).

IFRD1 is associated with histone deacetylases (HDACs), particularly HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC4, to modulate the acetylation status of NF-κB/RelA. This interaction affects the acetylation of specific lysine residues on p65, influencing NF-κB activity and immune responses (Mann2023Bromodomaincontaining; Tummers2015The). In the context of HPV infection, IFRD1 forms a bridge between RelA and HDACs, leading to the deacetylation of RelA at lysine 310, which suppresses pro-inflammatory gene expression (Tummers2015The).

In osteoblasts, IFRD1 interacts with Smad proteins, particularly Smad1 and Smad4, in response to BMP-2 stimulation. This interaction involves binding to the IFRD1 promoter, indicating a role in regulating osteoblast differentiation (Onishi2017The). These interactions highlight IFRD1's role as a transcriptional co-regulator in various cellular contexts.
