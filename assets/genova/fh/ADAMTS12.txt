# ADAMTS12

## Overview
ADAMTS12 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 12, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family. This protein is a secreted zinc-dependent metalloproteinase involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, playing a crucial role in tissue remodeling and cellular interactions. The protein is characterized by a complex multi-domain structure, including a metalloproteinase domain, disintegrin-like domain, and multiple thrombospondin type-1 repeat motifs, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins (Bai2008Regulation; Takeda2016ADAM). ADAMTS12 is implicated in various physiological processes, such as chondrogenesis and placental development, and is associated with pathological conditions including cancer, arthritis, and neurological disorders (Beristain2011Regulated; Mohamedi2021ADAMTS12:; Liu2009Thea).

## Structure
ADAMTS12 is a metalloproteinase characterized by a complex multi-domain structure. It includes a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a thrombospondin type-1 repeat (TSR) motif, a cysteine-rich domain, and a spacer domain (Takeda2016ADAM). The protein also features several non-catalytic ancillary domains, such as a disintegrin domain, a thrombospondin domain, a cysteine-rich domain, a spacer-1 domain, three thrombospondin motifs, a spacer-2 domain, and a C-terminal four thrombospondin motifs (Bai2008Regulation). These domains are crucial for regulating the subcellular localization and enzymatic activities of ADAMTS-12 (Bai2008Regulation).

The cysteine-rich domain is essential for binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell surface appearance (Bai2008Regulation). The C-terminal four thrombospondin motifs are important for substrate capture and mediation of chondrogenesis (Bai2008Regulation). The protein's enzymatic activity involves the cleavage of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), with the four C-terminal TSP-1-like repeats being necessary for binding to COMP (Liu2006ADAMTS12).

ADAMTS12 contains potential N-glycosylation and mucin-type O-glycosylation sites, which likely contribute to the slightly higher molecular masses of recombinant enzymes compared to predictions (Bai2008Regulation). The presence of these post-translational modifications suggests a role in the protein's stability and function. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of ADAMTS12 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ADAMTS12 is a member of the ADAMTS family, which are secreted zinc-dependent proteases involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. In healthy human cells, ADAMTS12 plays a significant role in modulating cell-ECM interactions and cell invasion. It is expressed in human trophoblastic cells, particularly in the first trimester placenta, where it facilitates the invasion of extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), a process crucial for placental development (Beristain2011Regulated). ADAMTS12 enhances cell attachment to ECM substrates such as collagen II, collagen IV, and vitronectin, and up-regulates integrins like av and avb3, which are associated with increased cell invasion and signaling activity (Beristain2011Regulated).

In cartilage, ADAMTS12 is involved in chondrogenesis, where it is expressed in proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytes. It can inhibit chondrocyte differentiation during hypertrophy, suggesting a complex role in cartilage development and endochondral bone formation (Liu2009Thea). ADAMTS12 also participates in the degradation of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a key ECM component, which is important for maintaining cartilage integrity (Liu2009Thea). These activities highlight its involvement in tissue remodeling and cellular adhesion processes.

## Clinical Significance
The ADAMTS12 gene is implicated in various diseases due to its role in tissue remodeling and inflammation. In cancer, ADAMTS12 exhibits a dual role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and a promoter of tumorigenesis, depending on the context. It is epigenetically silenced in tumor cells, suggesting a loss of its protective role, but is activated in stromal cells, where it may help control cancer progression (MoncadaPazos2009TheADAMTS12metalloprotease). In breast cancer, ADAMTS12 interacts with fibulin-2, potentially reducing tumorigenic properties (Mohamedi2021ADAMTS12:).

ADAMTS12 is also associated with arthritis, particularly osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where it contributes to cartilage degradation. Its expression is upregulated in arthritic tissues, and it is involved in the degradation of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a process exacerbated by inflammatory cytokines (Liu2009Thea).

In neurological disorders, genetic variations in ADAMTS12 have been linked to conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and pediatric stroke, indicating its potential role in mental health disorders (Mohamedi2021ADAMTS12:). These associations highlight the gene's clinical significance across a range of pathological conditions.

## Interactions
ADAMTS12 interacts with several proteins, playing significant roles in various biological processes. It associates with cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) by binding to its EGF-like domain. This interaction is mediated by the four C-terminal TSP1-like repeats of ADAMTS12, which are necessary and sufficient for binding to COMP. The interaction has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, indicating a specific and selective association (Liu2006ADAMTS12).

ADAMTS12 also interacts with the granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP), which binds directly to ADAMTS12 and inhibits its ability to degrade COMP. This interaction involves the four C-terminal thrombospondin motifs of ADAMTS12 and is significant in the context of arthritis, as it suggests a protective role of GEP against cartilage degradation (Guo2010Granulin‐epithelin).

In inflammatory arthritis, ADAMTS12 interacts with connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), cleaving it and thereby modulating its pro-inflammatory effects. This interaction is crucial for ADAMTS12's protective role against inflammation, as its deficiency leads to enhanced CTGF-mediated inflammatory responses (Wei2018Role).
