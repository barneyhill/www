# OLFM4

## Overview
OLFM4, or olfactomedin 4, is a gene that encodes a glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, apoptosis, and immune response regulation. The protein, also known as olfactomedin 4, is characterized by its olfactomedin domain and is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow. It plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis and modulating neutrophil function (Grover2010Stem; Liu2010Olfactomedina). OLFM4 interacts with several cell surface proteins, influencing cell-cell adhesion and migration, and is implicated in cancer progression by affecting cell morphology and adhesion (Guette2014Olfactomedin‐4; Grover2010Stem). Additionally, OLFM4 is involved in immune regulation, particularly in modulating host defense mechanisms against infections through pathways such as NF-kB (Grover2010Stem). Its expression and regulation have significant clinical implications, particularly in various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or promoter, depending on the context (Li2019Olfactomedina; Oh2011Genomic).

## Structure
The OLFM4 protein is a glycoprotein encoded by the OLFM4 gene, consisting of 510 amino acids and translating from a 2,861 bp mRNA (Guette2014Olfactomedin‐4; Grover2010Stem). The primary structure includes a signal peptide at the N-terminus, which directs the protein to the secretory pathway (Clemmensen2011Olfactomedin). The protein features a coil-coil domain at the N-terminal and an olfactomedin domain at the C-terminal, which is approximately 250 amino acids long (Grover2010Stem; Liu2010Olfactomedin).

The secondary structure of OLFM4 is characterized by a predominantly α-helical N-terminal and a β-sheet C-terminal (Grover2010Stem). The tertiary structure is stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds formed by five cysteine residues at positions 83, 85, 226, 246, and 437, which are crucial for secretion and polymerization (Guette2014Olfactomedin‐4; Grover2010Stem).

OLFM4 often exists in a high molecular weight polymeric form, indicating a quaternary structure, and is known to form multimers (Guette2014Olfactomedin‐4; Grover2010Stem). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation at six potential sites, contributing to its molecular weight of approximately 72 kDa when glycosylated (Guette2014Olfactomedin‐4).

## Function
Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) is a glycoprotein involved in several critical cellular processes, including cell adhesion, apoptosis, and immune response regulation. It is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow, where it plays a significant role in maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis and modulating neutrophil function (Grover2010Stem; Liu2010Olfactomedina).

OLFM4 is known to interact with cell surface proteins such as lectins and cadherins, facilitating cell-cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is crucial for cytoskeleton organization and may impact cancer progression by altering cell morphology and reducing cell adhesion and migration (Guette2014Olfactomedin‐4; Grover2010Stem). The protein is also involved in cell cycle regulation, promoting the transition from the S-phase to the G2/M phase, which is essential for cell proliferation (Grover2010Stem).

In terms of immune function, OLFM4 is thought to influence host defense mechanisms against infections through the activation of NF-kB mediated by NOD1 and NOD2 pathways (Grover2010Stem). It also plays a role in apoptosis regulation by interacting with GRIM-19, a protein that facilitates apoptosis, suggesting OLFM4's involvement in cell death regulation (Guette2014Olfactomedin‐4; Grover2010Stem).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in OLFM4 expression have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, OLFM4 downregulation is associated with tumor progression, higher Gleason scores, and lower recurrence-free survival. This downregulation is linked to hypermethylation of the OLFM4 promoter, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism affecting its expression (Li2019Olfactomedina). In colon cancer, OLFM4 acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and its deletion leads to increased tumorigenesis in Apc Min/+ mice, indicating its role in suppressing tumor formation (Liu2016Olfactomedin).

In gastric cancer, OLFM4 is upregulated and associated with tumor growth, functioning as an antiapoptotic protein. Its expression is regulated by miR-486, which acts as a tumor suppressor by reducing OLFM4 levels (Oh2011Genomic). In pancreatic cancer, high OLFM4 expression correlates with chemoresistance and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Ohkuma2020High).

In triple-negative breast cancer, low OLFM4 expression is linked to poor clinical outcomes, including metastasis and lower survival rates, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Xiong2017The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of OLFM4 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
OLFM4 (olfactomedin 4) is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence its biological functions. It interacts with cathepsin C, a cysteine protease, inhibiting its activity both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction modulates neutrophil activity and enhances bacterial killing by regulating protease activities (Liu2012Olfactomedin). OLFM4 also binds to cadherins, which are involved in cell-cell adhesion, through its olfactomedin domain. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cell adhesion properties (Guette2014Olfactomedin‐4; Liu2006The).

In the context of immune response, OLFM4 interacts with NOD1 and NOD2, inhibiting their mediated NF-κB activation and cytokine production, which plays a role in down-regulating innate immunity against infections like Helicobacter pylori (Liu2010Olfactomedin). Additionally, OLFM4 interacts with Frizzled-7 and Frizzled-10 receptors, suggesting a role in negatively regulating the Wnt signaling pathway by competing with Wnt ligands for receptor binding (Liu2016Olfactomedin). These interactions highlight OLFM4's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including immune regulation and cell adhesion.
