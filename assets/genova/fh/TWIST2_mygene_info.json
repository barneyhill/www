helix-loop-helix type transcription factor and shares similarity with Twist. This protein may inhibit osteoblast maturation and maintain cells in a preosteoblast phenotype during osteoblast development. This gene may be upregulated in certain cancers. Mutations in this gene cause focal facial dermal dysplasia 3, Setleis type. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found.
