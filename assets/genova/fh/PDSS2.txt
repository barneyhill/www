# PDSS2

## Overview
PDSS2, or prenyl (decaprenyl) diphosphate synthase subunit 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The protein encoded by PDSS2 is a part of the polyprenyl transferase family and functions as a subunit of the enzyme complex responsible for the elongation of the isoprenoid side chain of CoQ10. This process is essential for CoQ10's role as an electron carrier and antioxidant, which is vital for cellular energy production and protection against oxidative stress (Lu2012Cerebellar; Yen2020Characterization). PDSS2 is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it interacts with other COQ proteins to maintain CoQ10 levels and ensure proper mitochondrial function (Yen2020Characterization). Mutations in the PDSS2 gene have been linked to various mitochondrial and renal disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Saiki2008Coenzyme; Iványi2017Diffuse).

## Structure


## Function
PDSS2 (decaprenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 2) is a crucial component in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a vital molecule in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. PDSS2 catalyzes the elongation of the prenyl side chain of CoQ10, which is essential for its function as an electron carrier and antioxidant (Yen2020Characterization). This process is critical for maintaining cellular energy production and protecting cells from oxidative damage by scavenging free radicals (Lu2012Cerebellar).

PDSS2 is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it forms part of a heterotetrameric protein complex with other COQ proteins, such as PDSS1 and COQ3, to stabilize CoQ10 levels and ensure proper mitochondrial function (Yen2020Characterization). The protein's activity is essential for the stability of other COQ proteins, and its suppression can lead to decreased CoQ10 levels, affecting cellular energy production (Yen2020Characterization).

In healthy human cells, PDSS2 plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism. It supports the electron transport chain by facilitating the transfer of electrons from Complex I or II to Complex III, which is crucial for ATP production and overall cellular energy homeostasis (Lu2012Cerebellar).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PDSS2 gene are associated with several mitochondrial and renal diseases. PDSS2 mutations can lead to primary Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This deficiency is linked to conditions such as diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS) and collapsing glomerulopathy, which are associated with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure (Saiki2008Coenzyme; Iványi2017Diffuse). In particular, PDSS2 mutations have been identified in patients with Leigh syndrome and nephrotic syndrome, highlighting the gene's role in podocyte diseases (Iványi2017Diffuse).

PDSS2 is also implicated in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a common cause of nephrotic syndrome. A specific PDSS2 haplotype is significantly associated with an increased risk of FSGS in European Americans, suggesting a genetic susceptibility to this condition (Gasser2013Focal).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PDSS2 downregulation is linked to decreased CoQ10 levels and altered glucose metabolism, promoting tumor growth. This deficiency leads to increased glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial respiration, contributing to cancer development and progression (Li2018PDSS2Deficiency). PDSS2 deficiency in HCC is associated with poorer survival rates, making it a potential prognostic factor (Li2018PDSS2Deficiency).

## Interactions
PDSS2 (decaprenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 2) is involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 and participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function. PDSS2 forms a heterotetramer with PDSS1, which is essential for the synthesis of polyprenyl diphosphate, a precursor in coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis (Saiki2008Coenzyme). This interaction is significant for maintaining the stability and function of the enzyme complex involved in coenzyme Q10 production (Saiki2008Coenzyme).

In human cells, PDSS2 is part of larger protein complexes within the mitochondria, interacting with several COQ proteins, including COQ3, COQ4, COQ6, and COQ7. These interactions are important for the stability of the protein complexes and the maintenance of coenzyme Q10 levels (Yen2020Characterization). PDSS2's role in these complexes suggests it may form heterotetrameric proteins with PDSS1, contributing to the stability and function of the mitochondrial protein complexes (Yen2020Characterization).

Knockdown studies have shown that reducing PDSS2 levels leads to decreased stability of other COQ proteins, indicating its role in maintaining the integrity of the coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway (Yen2020Characterization). These interactions highlight the critical role of PDSS2 in mitochondrial bioenergetics and coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis.
