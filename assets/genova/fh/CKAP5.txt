# CKAP5

## Overview
CKAP5, or cytoskeleton-associated protein 5, is a gene that encodes a microtubule-associated protein known as chTOG, which is a member of the XMAP215 protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, particularly during cell division processes such as mitosis. CKAP5 is characterized by its multiple HEAT repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its function in stabilizing microtubules and assembling the mitotic spindle. The protein is involved in critical cellular processes, including microtubule nucleation and stabilization, by interacting with other proteins such as TACC3 and clathrin, forming complexes that are vital for proper chromosome segregation. CKAP5's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which modulate its interactions and functions. Due to its significant role in cell cycle progression and stability, CKAP5 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it is considered a potential therapeutic target (Thakur2014The; Pudelko2024Investigation).

## Structure
The human protein CKAP5, also known as chTOG, is a member of the XMAP215 protein family and plays a crucial role in organizing the cytoskeleton, particularly during mitosis. The primary structure of CKAP5 includes multiple HEAT repeat domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. The secondary structure is predominantly composed of α-helices, as indicated by solution NMR assignments of its C-terminal domain (Rostkova2018Solution).

The C-terminal domain of CKAP5, spanning residues 1517-1957, contains two distinct domains: a cryptic TOG domain (TOG6) and a smaller helical domain. This region is essential for binding to the TACC domain in TACC3, forming a ternary complex with clathrin that is crucial for k-fibre assembly during mitosis (Rostkova2018Solution; Hood2013Coordination). The interaction between CKAP5 and TACC3 is independent of Aurora-A kinase, which instead acts as a recruitment factor (Thakur2014The).

CKAP5 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions. These modifications are important for its function in stabilizing microtubules and facilitating mitotic spindle assembly (Thakur2014The). The protein's ability to form complexes with other proteins suggests a quaternary structure, which is vital for its role in microtubule dynamics (Hood2013Coordination).

## Function
CKAP5, also known as cytoskeleton-associated protein 5, plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics within healthy human cells. It is involved in both interphase and mitotic microtubules by directly binding to the plus end and promoting the incorporation of tubulin dimers, which is essential for microtubule growth (Pudelko2024Investigation). During mitosis, CKAP5, in conjunction with TACC3 and clathrin, stabilizes microtubules at the kinetochore, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and preventing chromosomal instability (Pudelko2024Investigation). CKAP5 also cooperates with the g-tubulin ring complex during de novo microtubule nucleation at the centrosome, which is the main organizing unit for microtubules in the cell. This interaction is crucial for the establishment of the mitotic spindle, a structure necessary for accurate cell division (Pudelko2024Investigation).

In addition to its role in microtubule stabilization, CKAP5 is involved in the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle by controlling the de-polymerization process and centrosomal microtubule assembly. These processes are essential for spindle formation and the interaction between microtubules and the cell cortex, which is crucial for directional cell movement (Polo2017Evaluating). CKAP5's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, particularly around the centrosomes and spindle apparatus, contributing to cell cycle progression and stability (Polo2017Evaluating).

## Clinical Significance
CKAP5, also known as cytoskeleton-associated protein 5, plays a significant role in cancer progression due to its involvement in microtubule stabilization and spindle assembly. Alterations in CKAP5 expression are linked to various cancers, including glioma, where it interacts with ARHGEF16 to promote cell migration and proliferation. This interaction is crucial for glioma progression, suggesting that CKAP5 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in glioma treatment (Huang2018GLI2).

In cardiovascular diseases, CKAP5 is influenced by intronic miRNAs, which affect its expression and associated targets. The gene is part of the TOG/XMAP215 family and is involved in pathways such as Ras signaling, which is significant in cardiovascular conditions (Zhu2019Three).

CKAP5 is also implicated in colorectal cancer, where its partial depletion can suppress increased microtubule assembly rates, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target to reduce cancer cell migration and invasion (Pudelko2024Investigation).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, CKAP5 is identified as essential for the G2-M phase transition of the cell cycle, highlighting its importance in cancer cell survival and as a target for therapeutic development (Chai2020Translational).

## Interactions
CKAP5, also known as chTOG, is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a significant role in microtubule dynamics and spindle assembly during mitosis. It interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, forming complexes crucial for cellular processes. CKAP5 is part of a multiprotein complex with TACC3 and clathrin, which is essential for stabilizing microtubule bundles that attach to kinetochores. This interaction is mediated through the TOG6 domain of CKAP5, which binds to the TACC3-clathrin complex, although CKAP5 itself is not essential for microtubule binding (Ryan2020Defining; Pudelko2024Investigation).

CKAP5 also interacts with the g-tubulin ring complex (g-TuRC) during microtubule nucleation at the centrosome, with its C-terminal domain binding to g-tubulin and its N-terminal TOG domains binding free a/b-tubulin heterodimers (Pudelko2024Investigation). In the context of liver cancer cells, CKAP5 is identified as a key hub gene interacting with circadian genes and other cancer-related genes, linking it to the circadian network (Polo2017Evaluating).

Additionally, CKAP5 has been shown to interact with the nucleoprotein of influenza A virus, suggesting a role in viral component trafficking during infection (Generous2014Identification). In breast cancer cells, CKAP5 is part of a regulatory axis involving circPDSS1 and miR-320c, influencing cell proliferation and migration (Liu2022CircPDSS1).
