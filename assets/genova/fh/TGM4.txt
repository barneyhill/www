# TGM4

## Overview
The TGM4 gene encodes the enzyme transglutaminase 4 (TGase-4), which is a member of the transglutaminase family of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the prostate gland and plays a crucial role in male reproductive physiology. TGase-4 is involved in the formation of the copulatory plug, a structure that aids in successful fertilization by retaining seminal fluid within the female reproductive tract. The enzyme achieves this through its ability to catalyze protein crosslinking, forming N-ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-bridges between proteins. In addition to its reproductive functions, TGase-4 is implicated in prostate cancer progression, where it interacts with proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and integrin-β1, thereby influencing cancer cell invasiveness (Jiang2013Prostate). The expression of TGM4 is regulated by androgen and retinoic acid receptors, highlighting its role in androgen-dependent processes (Savoca2019Search).

## Structure
The TGM4 gene encodes a protein known as human prostate-specific transglutaminase (hTGp), which is approximately 77 kDa in size and consists of 684 amino acids (Dubbink1999An; DUBBINK1996Tissuespecific). The primary structure of hTGp includes an active-site sequence GQCWVF, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity, and several potential N-glycosylation sites, although glycosylation at these sites has not been confirmed (Dubbink1999An; DUBBINK1996Tissuespecific). The protein lacks a typical glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor due to the absence of a hydrophobic C-terminal sequence (Dubbink1999An).

The secondary and tertiary structures of hTGp are not detailed in the available context, but the protein shares structural similarities with other transglutaminases, particularly in the catalytic core domain (Dubbink1999An). The protein is highly glycosylated and shares homology in amino acid sequence and catalytic mechanism with other transglutaminase isoenzymes (Cho2010Monoclonal).

The expression of TGM4 is androgen-regulated, and the gene is specifically expressed in the prostate, suggesting a role in prostate-specific functions (Dubbink1999An; DUBBINK1996Tissuespecific). The context does not provide information on quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
Transglutaminase 4 (TGM4) is an enzyme primarily expressed in the prostate gland, where it plays a significant role in male fertility and reproductive processes. TGM4 is involved in the formation of the copulatory plug, a structure that is crucial for successful fertilization by retaining seminal fluid within the female reproductive tract. This function is achieved through the enzyme's ability to catalyze protein crosslinking, specifically forming N-ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-bridges between lysine and glutamine residues of donor and acceptor proteins (Savoca2019Search; Anamthathmakula2020Mechanism).

In humans, TGM4 is a secretory protein expressed in the luminal epithelial cells of the prostate and released into the seminal fluid in response to androgen stimulation. It incorporates seminal proteins into sperm cell surfaces, which may help suppress sperm antigenicity in the female genital tract (Savoca2019Search). The enzyme's activity is associated with the regulation of seminal plasma, which is rich in polyamines like spermidine and spermine, potentially influencing seminal clot formation during ejaculation (Savoca2019Search). TGM4's expression is regulated by the retinoic acid receptor gamma (RAR-G) and the androgen receptor (AR) (Savoca2019Search).

## Clinical Significance
Transglutaminase 4 (TGM4) is primarily expressed in the prostate gland and has been implicated in several clinical conditions. In rodents, TGM4 is essential for fertility due to its role in forming the copulatory plug, and knockout mice exhibit reduced fertility due to defects in this process and altered seminal fluid viscosity (Lorand2018Transglutaminase). In humans, TGM4 has been identified as a male-specific prostate autoantigen in autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1, potentially contributing to subfertility (Lorand2018Transglutaminase).

TGM4 is also associated with prostate cancer progression. It is implicated in the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process that enhances the migratory and invasive capabilities of epithelial cells, similar to the effects observed with transglutaminase 2 (TG2) (Lorand2018Transglutaminase). Despite its involvement in these conditions, TGM4 is under less purifying selection compared to other transglutaminases, suggesting that its genomic changes are more tolerated (Thangaraju2017Genomic).

Loss-of-function variants of TGM4 have been identified, with the highest allele frequency among transglutaminases, indicating a potential role in genetic studies related to its function and associated conditions (Thangaraju2017Genomic). However, no specific inherited diseases linked to TGM4 mutations are documented in the OMIM database (Thangaraju2017Genomic).

## Interactions
Transglutaminase 4 (TGase-4), encoded by the TGM4 gene, is known to interact with several proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration, particularly in the context of prostate cancer. TGase-4 has been shown to co-precipitate and co-localize with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, indicating its interaction with these focal adhesion complex proteins. These interactions suggest that TGase-4 plays a role in enhancing cell-matrix adhesion and cellular migration, which are critical processes in cancer progression (Jiang2013Prostate).

The protein also interacts with integrin-β1, a component of the extracellular matrix adhesion machinery. The association of TGase-4 with integrin-β1 is crucial for its role in cell adhesion, as demonstrated by the dependency of TGase-4-mediated adhesion on integrin function (Jiang2013Prostate). Immunoprecipitation studies have further confirmed that TGase-4 can be precipitated with FAK and paxillin, suggesting that FAK activation is a key downstream event in TGase-4-mediated cell-matrix adhesion (Jiang2013Prostate).

These interactions highlight the potential of TGase-4 as a significant regulator of cell adhesion and migration, contributing to the invasive properties of prostate cancer cells (ABLIN2017Prostate).
