# LMAN1L

## Overview
The LMAN1L gene encodes the protein lectin, mannose binding 1 like, which is a member of the family of lectins known for their ability to bind specific carbohydrate moieties. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including glycoprotein trafficking and quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum. LMAN1L is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in the secretory pathway by facilitating the transport of glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Its function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein folding, which is critical for normal cellular operations and development. Dysregulation or mutations in the LMAN1L gene may have implications in certain diseases, although the full extent of its clinical significance is still under investigation.
