# TMEM266

## Overview
TMEM266 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 266, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. TMEM266 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, including its potential role as a diagnostic marker in gastric cancer and its association with epigenetic regulation in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (Xie2023Identification; Huang2022Oncogenic). Additionally, TMEM266 has been linked to reproductive disorders in cattle and identified in a novel fusion gene related to mental retardation (Kim2020FGviewer:; Guarini2019Genetics). Despite these associations, the gene's broader implications in human health and disease require further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM266 has been identified as a potential diagnostic gene in gastric cancer, where it is down-regulated in tumor tissues. Despite its initial identification as a candidate, its diagnostic efficacy was found to be limited due to low area under the curve (AUC) values in validation sets, indicating poor predictive accuracy (Xie2023Identification). In the context of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), TMEM266 expression is negatively correlated with H3K27me3 abundances, suggesting that it may be epigenetically regulated by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (Huang2022Oncogenic).

In cattle, TMEM266 has been associated with reproductive disorders, specifically retained placenta, through genome-wide association studies, although its role in specific biological pathways remains unclear (Guarini2019Genetics). Additionally, a novel fusion gene involving TMEM266, CELF6-TMEM266, was identified in a study on 15q24 microdeletion associated with mental retardation, though the specific clinical implications of this fusion are not detailed (Kim2020FGviewer:). Despite these associations, there is no direct evidence linking TMEM266 mutations or expression alterations to specific human diseases or conditions beyond these contexts. Further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance.
