# OR13C7

## Overview
The OR13C7 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily C member 7, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in detecting odor molecules. Olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR13C7, play a crucial role in the sense of smell by initiating a neuronal response upon binding specific odorants. The OR13C7 gene is part of a large gene family responsible for the diversity of olfactory receptors, which allows for the detection of a wide range of odorant molecules. The protein's structure and function are essential for the transduction of olfactory signals, contributing to the perception of smell.
