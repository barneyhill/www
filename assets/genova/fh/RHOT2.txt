# RHOT2

## Overview
The RHOT2 gene encodes the mitochondrial Rho GTPase protein known as Miro2, which is integral to mitochondrial dynamics and cellular energy distribution. Miro2 is categorized as a mitochondrial Rho GTPase and is embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in the transport of mitochondria along the cytoskeleton, facilitating their movement within cells (Nahacka2022Miro). This protein is characterized by two GTPase domains and two calcium-binding EF-hand motifs, which are essential for its function as a calcium sensor, influencing mitochondrial transport and mitophagy (Nahacka2022Miro; Safiulina2019Mitochondrial). Miro2 interacts with motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein, acting as an adaptor that links mitochondria to the cytoskeleton, thereby playing a significant role in mitochondrial trafficking and positioning within the cell (Nahacka2022Miro; Panchal2021Miro). The RHOT2 gene and its encoded protein are implicated in various cellular processes and have been associated with diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting their clinical significance (Gialluisi2021Identification; Zhuang2023Proteomic).

## Structure
The RHOT2 gene encodes the Miro2 protein, a mitochondrial Rho GTPase involved in mitochondrial trafficking. Miro2 consists of 618 amino acids and features a primary structure that includes two GTPase domains and two calcium-binding EF-hand motifs (Nahacka2022Miro; Panchal2021Miro). The secondary structure of Miro2 is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, with the EF-hand motifs forming a helix-loop-helix structure that stabilizes the protein (Panchal2021Miro). 

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with the EF-hand motifs and the C-terminal GTPase domain forming a rigid structure known as MiroS (Nahacka2022Miro). Miro2 can dimerize via a conserved hydrophobic surface in its cGTPase domain, contributing to its quaternary structure (Klosowiak2016Structural). 

Post-translational modifications of Miro2 include ubiquitination, which is mediated by Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This process is influenced by the phosphorylation of Parkin, which enhances the ubiquitination efficiency of Miro2, although it is less efficiently ubiquitinated compared to its homolog, Miro1 (Klosowiak2016Structural).

## Function
RHOT2, also known as Miro2, is a mitochondrial Rho GTPase that plays a critical role in mitochondrial dynamics and cellular energy distribution. It is embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is involved in the transport of mitochondria along microtubules and actin filaments, facilitating their movement within cells (Nahacka2022Miro). Miro2 contains calcium-binding EF-hand motifs, which are essential for its function as a calcium sensor, influencing mitochondrial transport and mitophagy, the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria (Nahacka2022Miro; Safiulina2019Mitochondrial).

Miro2 interacts with motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein, acting as an adaptor that links mitochondria to the cytoskeleton, thereby playing a significant role in mitochondrial trafficking and positioning within the cell (Nahacka2022Miro; Panchal2021Miro). This positioning is crucial for processes like cell migration and energy distribution, as mitochondria provide ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (Nahacka2022Miro). Although Miro2 cannot fully compensate for the loss of Miro1, it contributes to mitochondrial morphology and the regulation of mitochondria-ER contact sites, which are important for calcium signaling and lipid metabolism (Nahacka2022Miro).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the RHOT2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In colorectal cancer, low expression of RHOT2 is associated with increased migration and invasion of cancer cells, suggesting a role in lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in T1 colorectal cancer (Zhuang2023Proteomic). Similarly, in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), abnormal alternative splicing events of RHOT2, regulated by DDX39B, are linked to poor prognosis and tumor metastasis, indicating its involvement in cancer progression through pathways like sphingolipid metabolism and N-glycan biosynthesis (Meng2019Identification).

In neurodegenerative diseases, RHOT2 has been identified as a candidate gene for Parkinson's disease (PD). Variants in RHOT2 are enriched in PD patients and are expressed in dopaminergic neurons, suggesting a potential role in PD pathogenesis through mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress pathways (Gialluisi2021Identification). The gene's interaction with PINK1 and Parkin, crucial for mitochondrial homeostasis, further supports its involvement in PD (Gialluisi2021Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RHOT2 in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
RHOT2, also known as Miro2, is a mitochondrial Rho GTPase that plays a significant role in mitochondrial trafficking and homeostasis. It is embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacts with various proteins to facilitate its functions. RHOT2 forms complexes with TRAK1 and TRAK2, which are kinesin adaptors, enabling the movement of mitochondria along microtubules (Nahacka2022Miro; Panchal2021Miro). 

RHOT2 also interacts with the Parkinson disease-associated proteins PINK1 and PRKN. It serves as a substrate for PINK1-PRKN-dependent degradation and acts as a docking site for inactive PRKN, facilitating mitophagy by keeping PRKN in proximity to potential substrates (Safiulina2019Mitochondrial). This interaction is crucial for the removal of damaged mitochondria, as RHOT2 helps recruit PRKN to normal mitochondria, independent of PINK1 accumulation (Safiulina2019Mitochondrial).

In the context of cancer, RHOT2 is involved in mitochondrial dynamics and has been implicated in processes such as mitophagy and calcium signaling, which are essential for mitochondrial positioning and cellular responses (Nahacka2022Miro). These interactions highlight RHOT2's role in maintaining mitochondrial function and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms.
