# CLEC12A

## Overview
CLEC12A is a gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain family 12 member A, a type II transmembrane receptor protein that is part of the C-type lectin superfamily. This receptor is predominantly expressed on myeloid cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, where it functions as an inhibitory receptor involved in the regulation of the innate immune response. The CLEC12A protein is characterized by its extracellular C-type lectin-like domain, which is crucial for carbohydrate recognition and immune response modulation. It contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that recruit phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, thereby negatively regulating signaling pathways to prevent excessive inflammation. CLEC12A plays a significant role in maintaining immune homeostasis and has clinical relevance in conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia and inflammatory diseases, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Vitry2021Regulation; Morsink2019Prognostic; Neumann2014Clec12a).

## Structure
CLEC12A is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the C-type lectin superfamily. The CLEC12A protein consists of 265 amino acids and has a theoretical molecular mass of 30.8 kDa (Morsink2019Prognostic). Its structure includes an extracellular region with a single C-type lectin-like domain, characterized by six canonical cysteines typical of C-type lectins (Morsink2019Prognostic). This domain is involved in carbohydrate recognition and is crucial for the protein's function in immune response regulation.

The protein features a hydrophobic single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail. The intracellular domain contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and a YXXM motif, which are important for signal transduction. Upon phosphorylation, CLEC12A associates with protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 (Drouin2020CType; Morsink2019Prognostic).

CLEC12A is heavily glycosylated, with six putative N-glycosylation sites and one predicted O-glycosylation site, which are common post-translational modifications that may affect its stability and function (Klatt2023CLEC12A; Morsink2019Prognostic). In humans, CLEC12A is expressed as a monomer, while in mice, it is expressed as a less glycosylated dimer (Klatt2023CLEC12A).

## Function
CLEC12A, also known as C-type lectin domain family 12 member A, is a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on myeloid cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. It functions as an inhibitory receptor that plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by recognizing uric acid crystals, specifically monosodium urate (MSU), which are danger signals released from dead cells (Neumann2014Clec12a). CLEC12A modulates inflammatory responses by inhibiting Syk-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by MSU, thereby maintaining a balance between activating and inhibitory signals (Neumann2014Clec12a).

The receptor contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that recruit tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, which negatively regulate Syk signaling, preventing inappropriate immune responses (Marshall2006Human; Neumann2014Clec12a). CLEC12A is involved in the regulation of myeloid cell activation during inflammation and is downregulated under inflammatory conditions, suggesting its role in controlling myeloid cell activation (Marshall2006Human). The receptor's oligomerization and signaling are influenced by cysteine residues in its stalk domain, which are crucial for its function and cell-surface expression (Vitry2021Regulation). CLEC12A's role in immune regulation is essential for maintaining homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation in response to cell death (Dhungel2021The).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC12A is clinically significant in several diseases due to its role in immune regulation. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CLEC12A is expressed on leukemic blasts and leukemic stem cells, making it a potential marker for measurable residual disease. Low expression of CLEC12A on leukemic blasts is associated with a lower likelihood of achieving complete remission after induction chemotherapy, shorter event-free survival, and overall survival, indicating its prognostic properties (Morsink2019Prognostic). CLEC12A is also targeted in CAR-T cell therapies for AML, with dual CARs targeting both CD33 and CLEC12A showing specific anti-tumor activity (Morsink2019Prognostic).

In inflammatory diseases, CLEC12A plays a role in modulating immune responses. Reduced expression of CLEC12A enhances myeloid cell activation and inflammation, leading to increased severity of conditions like collagen antibody-induced arthritis and gout-like arthritis (Vitry2021Regulation). In rheumatoid arthritis patients, low levels of CLEC12A expression in neutrophils and monocytes correlate with higher disease activity (Vitry2021Regulation). CLEC12A also regulates neutrophil activation and cytokine release, with its reduced expression contributing to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases like gout (Paré2021The).

## Interactions
CLEC12A interacts with several proteins that play roles in its signaling and regulatory functions. It co-localizes with flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 in detergent-resistant membrane domains, which are crucial for its signaling. Antibody-induced cross-linking of CLEC12A induces flotillin oligomerization, and this interaction is essential for CLEC12A signaling, as flotillin-enriched membrane domains promote signaling (Vitry2021Regulation). 

CLEC12A's ITIM domain is phosphorylated in a Src-dependent manner, which is necessary for recruiting phosphatases like SHP-1 and SHP-2, although these interactions were not detected in neutrophils (Paré2021The; Vitry2021Regulation). The receptor also interacts with CSK, a kinase known to inhibit Src-family kinases, suggesting a role in counter-regulating MSU-stimulated signaling pathways (Paré2021The).

CLEC12A's interaction with flotillin-1 is important for its translocation to cholesterol-rich membrane domains, which is necessary for its internalization and subsequent signaling (Paré2021The). This translocation is dependent on microtubules but not on the actin cytoskeleton (Paré2021The). These interactions highlight CLEC12A's role in modulating immune responses through its interactions with membrane-associated proteins and signaling molecules.
