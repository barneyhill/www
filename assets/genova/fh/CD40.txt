# CD40

## Overview
The CD40 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, functioning primarily as a receptor involved in immune system regulation. The CD40 protein is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by cysteine-rich extracellular domains that facilitate ligand binding, particularly with the CD40 ligand (CD40L) (Singh1998The). This interaction is crucial for the activation and regulation of immune responses, including B cell proliferation, isotype switching, and the maturation of antigen-presenting cells (van2000CD40CD40; Laman2017Functions). CD40 is expressed on a variety of cell types, such as B cells, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells, and plays a significant role in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Alderson1993CD40). The signaling pathways activated by CD40, including NF-κB, MAPKs, and PI3K, are essential for cellular processes like cytokine production and apoptosis prevention (elgueta2009molecular). Given its pivotal role in immune regulation, CD40 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular disorders, highlighting its importance in both health and disease (Rizvi2008CD40–CD40; GarcíaBermúdez2012Study).

## Structure
The CD40 protein is a type I membrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, characterized by cysteine-rich extracellular domains. These domains are similar to those found in other TNFR family members, such as TNFR1 and TNFR2, and are involved in ligand binding (Singh1998The). The extracellular region of CD40 is organized into several domains, with residues 26 to 143 forming the core structure based on homology modeling with TNFR (Singh1998The). The CD40 protein consists of three domains, with domain 1 containing an AI and B2 module, and domains 2 and 3 containing AI, B1, and A2 modules, respectively. These modules form extensive interactions with the CD40 ligand (CD40L) (Singh1998The).

The CD40 protein structure is modeled with disulfide bridges organized in a ladder-like arrangement, contributing to its structural stability. The A2 module includes an additional disulfide bridge compared to TNFR, enhancing its structural integrity (Singh1998The). The stereochemical quality of the model was assessed using PROCHECK, indicating that 75% of the residues are within the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (Singh1998The). The model omits domain 4 due to uncertainty in its orientation with domain 3 (Singh1998The).

## Function
The CD40 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family and plays a critical role in the immune system. CD40 is expressed on various cell types, including B cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. It is involved in both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (van2000CD40CD40; Alderson1993CD40).

In B cells, CD40 is essential for activation, proliferation, and survival. It facilitates isotype switching, germinal center formation, and the development of B cell memory. The interaction between CD40 and its ligand, CD40L, on activated T cells is crucial for these processes, as it lowers the activation threshold for B cells and enhances their response to antigens (elgueta2009molecular; Laman2017Functions).

CD40 signaling involves the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), which activate several signaling pathways, including NF-κB, MAPKs, and PI3K. These pathways are vital for various cellular processes, such as the prevention of apoptosis and the induction of cytokine production (van2000CD40CD40; elgueta2009molecular).

In antigen-presenting cells, CD40 activation enhances the expression of costimulatory molecules and cytokines, promoting T cell activation and differentiation. This interaction is also important for the maturation of dendritic cells into potent antigen-presenting cells (van2000CD40CD40; elgueta2009molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD40 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. One significant condition linked to CD40 mutations is Hyper-IgM Syndrome (HIGM), which is characterized by defects in antibody production due to the inability to switch from IgM to other immunoglobulin isotypes. This results in increased susceptibility to infections, particularly respiratory and ear infections (Rizvi2008CD40–CD40; Danese2004The).

Alterations in CD40 expression or its interaction with CD40L are implicated in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In RA, specific polymorphisms in the CD40 gene, such as rs1883832 and rs4810485, have been associated with disease susceptibility and cardiovascular risk (Raychaudhuri2008Common; GarcíaBermúdez2012Study). In IBD, overexpression of CD40 and CD40L in the gut mucosa contributes to inflammation and disease progression (Senhaji2015The; Danese2004The).

The CD40/CD40L interaction is also involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, where it contributes to plaque destabilization and atherosclerosis through the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (Rizvi2008CD40–CD40). These interactions highlight the clinical significance of CD40 in various inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions.

## Interactions
The CD40 protein interacts with various proteins through its cytoplasmic domain, primarily involving tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs). Upon engagement with its ligand CD40L, CD40 clusters and recruits TRAF proteins, which are crucial for activating several signaling pathways. TRAF proteins, including TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6, bind to specific motifs on the CD40 cytoplasmic tail. TRAF2 and TRAF3 bind to a membrane distal domain marked by the sequence PxQxT, while TRAF6 binds to a membrane proximal domain with the sequence QxPxEx. These interactions are essential for the activation of canonical and non-canonical NFκB pathways, MAPKs, and other signaling cascades (elgueta2009molecular).

CD40 also interacts with a novel protein designated as CD40-binding protein (CD40bp), which specifically binds to the native form of CD40 but not to a mutant form. This interaction is crucial for CD40-mediated signaling pathways and involves a ThP residue in the CD40 cytoplasmic domain (Hu1994A).

The interaction between CD40 and CD40L involves polar and charged interactions, with specific residues playing a key role in stabilizing the complex. Charged residues on CD40L, such as Arg and Lys, interact with acidic residues on CD40, contributing to the binding stability (Singh1998The).
