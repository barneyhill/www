# MOSPD2

## Overview
MOSPD2 (motile sperm domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in immune cell migration and interorganelle communication. The MOSPD2 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a CRAL/TRIO domain and a major sperm protein (MSP) domain, which facilitate its role as a scaffold protein in forming membrane contact sites (MCS) between the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles (Di2018Identification). This protein is predominantly expressed in monocytes and plays a crucial role in chemokine-induced migration, impacting immune responses and inflammation resolution (Mendel2017Identification). Additionally, MOSPD2's interactions with FFAT motif-containing proteins underscore its involvement in lipid transport and cellular signaling pathways (Di2018Identification). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various clinical contexts, including cancer and immune-related conditions, highlighting its potential significance in disease progression and therapeutic targeting (Neefjes2021What; Deb2023African).

## Structure
The MOSPD2 protein is composed of 518 amino acids and includes several distinct structural domains. It features an amino-terminal CRAL/TRIO domain, which is potentially involved in binding small lipophilic molecules, and a major sperm protein (MSP) domain responsible for binding FFAT motifs, similar to VAP proteins (Di2018Identification). The MSP domain of MOSPD2 is monomeric and specifically binds the FFAT peptide, with key residues R404 and L406 playing a crucial role in this interaction (Di2018Identification). Mutations in these residues, such as R404D/L406D, abolish FFAT binding, highlighting their importance in the protein's function (Di2018Identification).

The protein also contains a potential carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain, suggesting its integration into membranes (Di2018Identification). The CRAL/TRIO domain forms a hydrophobic pocket, which may be involved in lipid transport, indicating a role in lipid-dependent processes (Di2018Identification). While the primary sequence and domain structure are well-characterized, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of MOSPD2 are not provided in the available context. The protein is implicated in forming membrane contact sites by interacting with FFAT motif-containing proteins, facilitating interorganelle communication (Di2018Identification).

## Function
MOSPD2 (motile sperm domain containing 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in the migration of human monocytes, a type of immune cell. It is predominantly expressed in monocytes and to a lesser extent in neutrophils, with minimal expression in lymphocytes (Mendel2017Identification). MOSPD2 is involved in chemokine-induced migration, facilitating signaling pathways crucial for monocyte movement, such as the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT (Mendel2017Identification). This protein is localized to the cytoplasmic membrane of monocytes, where it participates in signaling events following chemokine receptor activation (Mendel2017Identification).

In healthy human cells, MOSPD2's role in cell motility is linked to its expression on the plasma membrane of CD14+ monocytes, promoting their migration in response to chemokines (Mendel2017Identification). The protein's involvement in these processes suggests its importance in immune responses, particularly in the context of inflammation resolution and immune cell trafficking. While its specific function in healthy cells is not fully detailed, MOSPD2's expression and activity in monocytes indicate its critical role in regulating immune cell dynamics and potentially influencing inflammatory responses (Mendel2017Identification).

## Clinical Significance
MOSPD2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels or interactions. In the context of cancer, MOSPD2 is noted for its differential expression in African swine fever virus (ASFV) infected tissues, where it is among the oncogenes analyzed for expression changes, suggesting a potential role in cancer-related pathways (Deb2023African). Although the specific clinical significance of MOSPD2 mutations or expression changes in cancer is not fully detailed, its involvement in oncogenic pathways indicates a possible link to cancer progression.

MOSPD2 is also associated with intercellular signaling and immune cell function. It functions as a cell surface receptor involved in monocyte and neutrophil migrations, which may relate to its role in inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases (Neefjes2021What). The mechanism by which MOSPD2 is exposed to the extracellular space remains unclear, but it may involve unconventional secretion pathways, highlighting its potential involvement in immune responses.

Overall, while the precise clinical implications of MOSPD2 mutations or expression alterations are not exhaustively covered, its roles in cancer pathways and immune cell migration suggest significant clinical relevance in these areas. Further research is needed to fully elucidate its impact on disease progression and treatment.

## Interactions
MOSPD2 (motile sperm domain containing 2) is involved in various protein interactions, particularly through its Major Sperm Protein (MSP) domain, which binds FFAT motifs. This interaction is crucial for forming membrane contact sites (MCS) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other organelles such as endosomes, mitochondria, and the Golgi apparatus (Di2018Identification). MOSPD2 interacts with several FFAT motif-containing proteins, including STARD3, STARD3NL, ORP1L, PTPIP51, and STARD11, facilitating the tethering of the ER to these organelles (Di2018Identification).

The protein also forms clusters with VAP proteins at the ER surface, serving as a binding platform for proteins with FFAT motifs (Di2018Identification). MOSPD2's interactions are not limited to VAP proteins, as it can independently contribute to ER-endosome contacts, suggesting a unique role in lipid transport and MCS formation (Di2018Identification). These interactions highlight MOSPD2's role as a scaffold protein in interorganelle communication and material exchange, potentially compensating for the absence of VAP proteins in certain cellular contexts (Di2018Identification).
