# RENBP

## Overview
The RENBP gene encodes the renin-binding protein, which is classified as an intracellular enzyme known as N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) 2-epimerase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin system by modulating the activity of renin, thereby influencing blood pressure and electrolyte balance (Engeli1999Coexpression). The protein is characterized by its ability to bind and inactivate renin, and it catalyzes the interconversion between GlcNAc and N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc), a reaction that requires ATP (Takahashi2001Identification). The RENBP gene is located on the X chromosome and is predominantly expressed in monocytes and dendritic cells, where it may affect blood pressure regulation and salt sensitivity (Ertuglu2023Regulation). Mutations in the RENBP gene have been linked to various health conditions, including salt-sensitive hypertension and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Rechciński2022A; El2022Metabolome).

## Structure
The human renin-binding protein (RENBP) is identified as the enzyme N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) 2-epimerase. The primary structure of human RENBP consists of 417 amino acids, with an extended C-terminal region compared to its porcine counterpart (Takahashi2001Identification). The active site of this enzyme includes cysteine 380, which is crucial for its function, as determined by site-directed mutagenesis (Takahashi2001Identification). 

The protein contains a leucine-zipper motif, which is important for the formation of RENBP homodimers and RENBP-renin heterodimers, indicating its role in quaternary structure interactions (Takahashi2001Identification). The human RENBP gene is located on chromosome X, specifically in the distal Xq28 chromosomal band (Takahashi2001Identification). 

Post-translational modifications and splice variants may influence the function and stability of RENBP, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The enzyme catalyzes the interconversion between GlcNAc and N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc), requiring ATP as an effector, which suggests a potential ATP-binding site, although its exact location is not detailed in the context (Takahashi2001Identification).

## Function
The RENBP gene encodes the renin-binding protein, which functions as an intracellular enzyme with renin-binding and inactivating properties. This protein is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance by modulating the activity of renin, a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system (Engeli1999Coexpression). RENBP is identified as N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase, catalyzing the interconversion between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc), a process that requires ATP as an effector (Takahashi2001Identification). The active site of this enzyme includes cysteine 380, which is crucial for its activity (Takahashi2001Identification).

In healthy human cells, RENBP is predominantly expressed in monocytes and dendritic cells, where it plays a role in the tissue renin-angiotensin system, potentially influencing blood pressure regulation and salt sensitivity (Ertuglu2023Regulation). The gene is located on the X chromosome and consists of 11 exons (Takahashi2001Identification). Although knockout studies in mice suggest that the absence of RENBP does not affect renin expression or activity under physiological conditions, it does result in an abnormal pattern of carbohydrate excretion in urine, indicating a role in renal carbohydrate metabolism (Takahashi2001Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RENBP gene have been associated with several health conditions. A low-frequency, missense SNP in the RENBP gene, identified as rs78377269, has been linked to salt-sensitive arterial hypertension in a Han Chinese population. This SNP is associated with a larger mean arterial pressure response to dietary sodium intervention and increased odds of salt sensitivity, suggesting its contribution to salt-response hypertension (Rechciński2022A).

In a murine model of lung inflammation, the RENBP gene was found to be induced in response to hyperoxia, a condition associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The gene's expression was positively correlated with BPD status and oxygen requirement, indicating its potential role in the development of this condition (El2022Metabolome).

The RENBP gene has also been mentioned in the context of psychiatric disorders. It was identified as one of the gene regions with significant SNP associations in genome-wide association studies related to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, although specific details on its role in these conditions are not provided (Prata2019Unravelling).

These findings suggest that alterations in the RENBP gene may impact various physiological and pathological processes, including blood pressure regulation and lung inflammation.
