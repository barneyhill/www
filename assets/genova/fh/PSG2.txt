# PSG2

## Overview
Pregnancy specific beta-1-glycoprotein 2 (PSG2) is a gene that encodes a member of the pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein family, which are part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein encoded by PSG2 is primarily expressed in the placenta, particularly in the syncytiotrophoblast, and plays a crucial role in pregnancy by modulating immune responses, facilitating placental development, and supporting tissue homeostasis. PSG2 is involved in the activation of latent transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a cytokine essential for immune regulation and tissue maintenance, through its interaction with the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of TGF-β1 (Warren2018Activation). The expression of PSG2 is regulated by the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which influences its transcriptional activity and is subject to epigenetic modifications (Jeong2021Depletion). The protein's ability to interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and activate the large latent complex of TGF-β1 underscores its significance in reproductive processes and immune modulation during pregnancy (Warren2018Activation).

## Function
PSG2, a member of the pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein family, plays a significant role in activating latent transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a crucial cytokine involved in immune regulation and tissue homeostasis. PSG2, along with other PSGs, interacts with the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of TGF-β1, facilitating its activation. This process is important for modulating immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis, particularly during pregnancy (Warren2018Activation).

PSG2 is also involved in cell signaling and adhesion processes, contributing to successful pregnancy outcomes by supporting placental development and function. It is expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta, where it plays roles in immune regulation, angiogenesis, and platelet regulation, which are crucial for normal placental development (Jeong2021Depletion).

The regulation of PSG2 expression is influenced by the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which modulates its transcriptional activity. Depletion of CTCF leads to an upregulation of PSG2, accompanied by changes in histone modifications, indicating that CTCF plays a role in the epigenetic regulation of PSG2 expression (Jeong2021Depletion).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PSG2, a member of the pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoproteins (PSGs), is known to interact with the latent-associated peptide (LAP) of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). This interaction has been studied using surface plasmon resonance, which revealed that PSG2, along with other PSGs like PSG1, PSG4, PSG5, and PSG8, binds to LAP with similar kinetic parameters, suggesting a common ability among these proteins to interact with LAP (Warren2018Activation). PSG2 is also capable of activating the small latent complex (SLC) of TGF-β1, a function shared by all human PSGs. This activation process involves binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix and activating the large latent complex (LLC) of TGF-β1 (Warren2018Activation).

The B2 domain of PSG2 is particularly efficient in activating latent TGF-β1, and this activation has been demonstrated in bioassays using transformed mink lung epithelial cells (Warren2018Activation). These interactions highlight PSG2's role in modulating immune responses during pregnancy by influencing the activation of TGF-β1, a cytokine involved in various reproductive processes. However, specific interactions of PSG2 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond TGF-β1 are not detailed in the available context.
