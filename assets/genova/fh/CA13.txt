# CA13

## Overview
Carbonic anhydrase 13 (CA13) is a gene that encodes the enzyme carbonic anhydrase 13, a member of the alpha-carbonic anhydrase family. This family of enzymes is characterized by their zinc metalloenzyme activity, which facilitates the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide, a critical process in maintaining pH balance and CO2 transport in various physiological systems (Yogosawa2021Carbonic; Di2008Crystal). The CA13 gene is expressed in multiple human tissues, including the salivary glands, kidney, and small intestine, among others (Kummola2005Expression). The protein product of CA13 exhibits a structure similar to other cytosolic carbonic anhydrase isozymes, with a central beta-sheet and zinc ion coordination essential for its enzymatic function (Di2008Crystal). Although CA13 has moderate catalytic activity compared to other isozymes, it effectively binds inhibitors, indicating its potential regulatory role in enzyme activity (Kummola2005Expression; Di2008Crystal).

## Structure
The human carbonic anhydrase 13 (CA13) protein is a member of the alpha-carbonic anhydrase family, characterized by its zinc metalloenzyme activity. The primary structure of CA13 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain with about 60% sequence identity to other cytosolic isozymes such as CA I, II, and III (Kummola2005Expression). 

The secondary structure of CA13 includes a central ten-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha helices and additional beta-strands, forming a compact globular protein (Di2008Crystal). The tertiary structure is stabilized by the coordination of a zinc ion at the active site, which is coordinated by three histidine residues (His94, His96, His119) and a water molecule (Di2008Crystal). 

CA13 does not exhibit a quaternary structure as it elutes as a monomer in size-exclusion chromatography (Di2008Crystal). The protein's active site is located in a large conical cavity, divided into hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, with unique amino acid substitutions that may influence inhibitor binding (Di2008Crystal). The structure of CA13 is similar to that of CA II, with a low root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), indicating structural similarity (McDevitt2011Molecular).

## Function
Carbonic anhydrase 13 (CA13) is a member of the carbonic anhydrase family, which are zinc-containing metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide, playing a crucial role in maintaining pH homeostasis and facilitating CO2 transport in various physiological processes (Yogosawa2021Carbonic; Di2008Crystal). CA13 is expressed in several human tissues, including the salivary glands, kidney, small intestine, colon, uterus, and testis (Kummola2005Expression). 

In healthy human cells, CA13 is involved in processes such as respiration, ion transport, and pH regulation. It has moderate catalytic activity compared to other carbonic anhydrase isozymes and is inhibited by clinically used sulfonamides and sulfanilyl-derived compounds (Kummola2005Expression). The enzyme's structure includes a zinc ion coordinated by histidine residues, which is essential for its catalytic function (Di2008Crystal). Despite its lower catalytic activity, CA13 binds inhibitors like acetazolamide with efficiency similar to other carbonic anhydrases, suggesting a potential role in regulating enzyme activity through inhibitor interactions (Di2008Crystal). The specific physiological functions of CA13 in healthy tissues remain to be fully elucidated.
