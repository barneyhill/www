# ATPAF1

## Overview
ATPAF1 is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase mitochondrial F1 complex assembly factor 1, a mitochondrial protein essential for the assembly of the F1 component of ATP synthase. This protein plays a critical role in cellular energy production by facilitating the assembly of the β subunit of mitochondrial F1-ATP synthase, a key enzyme in ATP synthesis. ATPAF1 is categorized as an assembly factor, and its activity is crucial for maintaining the stability and function of ATP synthase, particularly in energy-demanding tissues such as the heart. The protein's function is vital for efficient energy conversion and mitochondrial fitness, and its deficiency can lead to significant mitochondrial dysfunction and related diseases (Zhou2021ATPAF1).

## Function
The ATPAF1 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein essential for the assembly of the F1 component of ATP synthase, a critical enzyme in cellular energy production. ATPAF1 is a nuclear gene product that facilitates the assembly of the β subunit of mitochondrial F1-ATP synthase. In healthy cells, ATPAF1 is crucial for maintaining ATP synthase activity, which synthesizes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate using the energy from an electrochemical ion gradient (Zhou2021ATPAF1). ATPAF1 interacts with the F1 β-subunit, and its loss results in decreased expression of both α and β subunits, impacting the stability and assembly of ATP synthase (Zhou2021ATPAF1).

ATPAF1 is involved in the assembly of the F1 sector of the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex, which is crucial for ATP production in eukaryotic cells. ATP synthase generates more than 90% of cellular ATP under aerobic conditions by utilizing the proton motive force from the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Zhou2021ATPAF1). The protein is active in the mitochondria, where it ensures efficient energy conversion, vital for cellular energy homeostasis (Zhou2021ATPAF1). ATPAF1 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial fitness and ATP synthase assembly, particularly in energy-demanding tissues like the heart (Zhou2021ATPAF1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ATPAF1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in mitochondrial function and related diseases. ATPAF1 is crucial for the assembly of the F1 component of ATP synthase, and its deficiency can lead to impaired ATP synthase activity, resulting in mitochondrial defects. In mice, ATPAF1 deficiency has been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, and remodeling (Zhou2021ATPAF1). The absence of ATPAF1 affects the stability of ATP5B, leading to the degradation of ATP5A, which is essential for ATP synthase assembly (Zhou2021ATPAF1).

In humans, reduced expression of ATPAF1 has been observed in patients with isolated F1Fo ATP synthase deficiency, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial defects (Čížková2008Development). Additionally, ATPAF1 has been identified as a key gene in the context of sleep deprivation and mild cognitive impairment, with its expression downregulated in both conditions. This downregulation is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment, indicating its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Liu2024Investigation). These findings underscore the importance of ATPAF1 in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and its potential role in various diseases.

## Interactions
ATPAF1 is involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, specifically interacting with the β-subunit of ATP synthase, known as ATP5B. This interaction has been confirmed through co-localization studies using immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells, demonstrating that ATPAF1 binds to the β-subunit in mammalian cells, similar to its yeast homolog Atp11p (Zhou2021ATPAF1). The interaction is crucial for the proper assembly of the F1 component of ATP synthase, as ATPAF1 is required to maintain the stability and abundance of the α- and β-subunits, ATP5A and ATP5B, respectively (Zhou2021ATPAF1).

ATPAF1's role extends to protecting ATP5B stability, and its deficiency leads to secondary degradation of ATP5A due to the stoichiometry of the enzyme complex (Zhou2021ATPAF1). The absence of ATPAF1 results in impaired ATP synthase assembly and reduced ATPase activity, highlighting its essential function in mitochondrial homeostasis and energy conversion (Zhou2021ATPAF1). There is no evidence from the provided context that ATPAF1 interacts with nucleic acids.
