# RSPH6A

## Overview
RSPH6A is a gene that encodes the protein radial spoke head 6 homolog A, which is a component of the radial spoke head structure in cilia and flagella. This protein plays a crucial role in the motility of cilia and flagella, which are essential for various cellular processes, including sperm motility and respiratory function. As a structural protein, radial spoke head 6 homolog A is involved in the regulation of dynein activity, which is necessary for the proper movement of these organelles. Mutations or altered expression of RSPH6A can lead to significant clinical conditions, particularly affecting male fertility and potentially contributing to disorders such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (Sironen2019Sperm; Ergoli2019Study).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RSPH6A gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly affecting male fertility. In patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), reduced expression of RSPH6A is associated with decreased sperm motility and fertility. This reduction in expression is thought to result from abnormal transcription regulation due to a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene, which is located near RSPH6A. The impaired expression of RSPH6A in DM1 patients contributes to reproductive abnormalities such as hypoposia, azoospermia, and oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia, highlighting its potential as a marker for fertility issues in these patients (Ergoli2019Study).

In addition, RSPH6A has been implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition characterized by defects in ciliary function leading to respiratory issues and infertility. Although RSPH6A itself is not directly associated with PCD, its depletion in mice has been shown to cause male infertility due to immotile spermatozoa, suggesting its critical role in spermatogenesis (Sironen2019Sperm). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RSPH6A in male reproductive health.
