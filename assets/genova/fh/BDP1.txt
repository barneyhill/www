# BDP1

## Overview
BDP1 is a gene that encodes the B double prime 1 protein, a critical subunit of the RNA polymerase III transcription initiation factor IIIB (TFIIIB) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the transcription initiation process by RNA polymerase III, which is responsible for transcribing small RNA molecules such as tRNA and 5S rRNA. The BDP1 protein is characterized by its SANT domain, a DNA-binding module that facilitates interactions with other components of the transcription machinery, including the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and BRF1 or BRF2, depending on the organism (Hu2015A; Gouge2017Molecular). BDP1's function is essential for the assembly and stability of the TFIIIB complex, contributing to the transition from a closed to an open pre-initiation complex, a crucial step in transcription initiation (Gouge2017Molecular). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in various biological processes and diseases, including cancer, where alterations in BDP1 expression are associated with clinical outcomes (CabarcasPetroski2022BDP1; CabarcasPetroski2022BDP1a).

## Structure
The BDP1 protein is a component of the RNA polymerase III transcription initiation factor IIIB complex. It contains a highly conserved SANT domain, which is crucial for its interaction with other components of the transcription machinery, such as Brf1-TBP and Brf2-TBP complexes (Hu2015A; Gouge2017Molecular). The SANT domain is characterized by a triple α-helical fold, which functions as a DNA-binding module (Hu2015A). This domain, along with its N-terminal and C-terminal flanking regions, forms an extended SANT domain essential for the protein's function and viability (Gouge2017Molecular).

The BDP1 protein also includes a linker region that interacts with the DNA minor groove, contributing to the stability of the TFIIIB complex (Gouge2017Molecular). The protein's structure is organized into a compact domain with additional C-terminal α-helices and an N-terminal extension forming an ordered linker (Gouge2017Molecular). In humans, BDP1 has several isoforms with C-terminal extensions characterized by a 55-residue repetitive motif, although these extensions are not strictly required for transcription (Gouge2017Molecular). The protein's quaternary structure involves its interaction with other components of the TFIIIB complex, stabilizing the pre-initiation complex without directly inducing DNA melting (Gouge2017Molecular).

## Function
The BDP1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB) complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) in human cells. Bdp1 plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stability of the TFIIIB complex, which includes TBP (TATA-binding protein) and Brf1 or Brf2, depending on the organism. This complex is responsible for recruiting Pol III to promoters and facilitating the transition from a closed to an open pre-initiation complex (PIC), a crucial step for the transcription of small RNA genes such as tRNA and 5S rRNA (Gouge2017Molecular).

Bdp1 interacts with DNA and other components of the TFIIIB complex through its SANT domain, contributing to the stability of the TFIIIB-DNA complex. This interaction is vital for DNA strand separation during the transition to an open form of the PIC (Gouge2017Molecular). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression, impacting cellular growth and proliferation. Bdp1's role in transcription initiation is crucial for maintaining the function of TFIIIB as a genomic roadblock, which can affect DNA replication and transcription termination (Gouge2017Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the BDP1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, affecting both expression levels and clinical outcomes. In breast cancer, decreased BDP1 copy number and mRNA expression are associated with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), correlating with poor clinical outcomes such as high grade, advanced stage, metastasis, recurrence, and patient death (CabarcasPetroski2022BDP1a). BDP1 expression is also linked to estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression, which are key breast cancer biomarkers (CabarcasPetroski2022BDP1a).

In lymphoma, particularly activated B-cell (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), decreased BDP1 expression correlates with poorer clinical outcomes, including higher recurrence and mortality rates (CabarcasPetroski2022BDP1). The gene's expression is significantly underexpressed in lymphoma, suggesting a potential area for further investigation (CabarcasPetroski2022BDP1).

In pediatric neuroblastoma, specific BDP1 gene variants, I1264M and V1347M, are associated with improved clinical outcomes. These variants are linked to longer overall survival, indicating their potential as prognostic biomarkers (Li2021BDP1). The study suggests that these variants may affect BDP1 mRNA expression levels, contributing to their protective phenotype in subsets of neuroblastoma patients (Li2021BDP1).

## Interactions
BDP1 is a component of the TFIIIB complex, which plays a crucial role in the transcription initiation by RNA polymerase III. BDP1 interacts with several proteins within this complex, including BRF1 and the TATA-binding protein (TBP). The interaction between BDP1 and BRF1 is facilitated by a conserved motif in BRF1, specifically the Gly328-Glu329-Gln330-Glu331-Leu332 (GEXEL) sequence, which is crucial for the formation of the TFIIIB complex and transcription initiation (Khoo2014Mapping).

BDP1 also interacts with the small nuclear RNA activating protein complex (SNAPc) in Drosophila melanogaster, where it is recruited to the U6 promoter by DmSNAPc. This interaction is specific to the U6 proximal sequence element (PSE) and does not occur with the U1 PSE, highlighting the specificity of BDP1's role in transcription initiation (Verma2018Bdp1).

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, BDP1 is phosphorylated by kinases such as PKA, Sch9, and CK2, which regulate its interaction with other proteins and its role in transcription. Phosphorylation of BDP1 opposes Maf1-mediated repression of transcription, indicating a regulatory mechanism that modulates its activity in response to cellular conditions (Lee2015Differential).
