# POTEA

## Overview
POTEA is a gene that encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member A, which is part of the POTE gene family. This family is characterized by its expression in reproductive tissues such as the prostate, ovary, testis, and placenta, and is notably implicated in various cancers (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The POTEA protein is distinguished by its structural motifs, including ankyrin repeats and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and suggest roles in maintaining cellular structural integrity and signaling pathways (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). As a member of the ankyrin domain family, POTEA is involved in linking integral membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton, crucial for cell shape and stability (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The gene's expression patterns and interactions with signaling pathways, such as the SPHK1/p65 pathway in cancer, highlight its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Shen2019POTEE).

## Structure
The POTEA protein, a member of the POTE gene family, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by several distinct domains. It includes an N-terminal cysteine-rich region, five to seven ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal spectrin-like domain, which is predicted to be mainly α-helical (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). Ankyrin repeats, composed of tandemly repeated modules of approximately 33 amino acids each, are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The presence of these domains suggests that POTEA is involved in interactions with other proteins and cell membranes.

The POTEA gene is unique within its family, being the sole member of Group I, and is characterized by having 14 exons, including three paralog-specific exons (9a to 9c) (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). Some POTE genes, including POTEA, contain a conserved 3' UTR LINE-1 element, which may play a role in their genomic dispersal (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The protein structure may also include coiled-coil domains, although specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context. The structural features of POTEA suggest its potential involvement in various cellular processes, particularly in cancer and reproductive tissues.

## Function
POTEA, a member of the POTE gene family, is characterized by its expression in tissues such as the prostate, ovary, testis, and placenta (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The protein encoded by POTEA contains ankyrin repeats and coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These domains suggest a role in maintaining cellular structural integrity and participating in signaling pathways (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The ankyrin repeats in POTEA are indicative of its potential involvement in linking integral membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape, stability, and intracellular transport (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

POTEA proteins are associated with the plasma membranes, indicating a role in cellular interactions (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The presence of coiled-coil domains may facilitate the formation of protein complexes, contributing to various cellular processes (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). Although the specific molecular functions of POTEA in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its structural features imply involvement in maintaining cellular architecture and possibly in signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
The POTEA gene, part of the POTE gene family, is implicated in various cancers due to its expression patterns. It is notably overexpressed in several cancer types, including breast, prostate, lung, colon, pancreas, and ovarian cancers, making it a candidate for cancer-targeted therapy (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). In epithelial ovarian cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer, POTEA and related POTE family genes are expressed at higher levels than in normal tissues, correlating with poor prognosis (Fan2021Cancer/testis). This suggests that alterations in POTEA expression may have clinical significance in terms of cancer prognosis.

The POTE gene family, including POTEA, has undergone significant evolutionary expansion in humans, with duplications over the last two million years. This expansion is linked to the gene's potential role in cancer progression, particularly through the expression of POTE-actin fusion proteins, which are associated with pro-apoptotic effects (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The presence of LINE elements in POTE genes provides insights into their evolutionary history and potential functional differentiation, which may contribute to their role in cancer biology (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

## Interactions
The POTEA protein, a member of the POTE ankyrin domain family, is involved in various interactions that influence cancer development. In ovarian cancer, POTEA is part of a network of associators, including RELA, HMOX2, and EZH2, which are epigenetically activated in many cancers. These interactions are significant in the epigenetic regulation of POTEA, with Group A associators (RELA, HMOX2, EZH2, p-10Y-ERBB3-1, WDR1, ERRFI1) showing stronger epigenetic links than Group B associators (PRG2, FMR1, DEFA6-(?-100), cytf_human) (Qazi2021In).

In colorectal cancer, POTEE interacts with the SPHK1/p65 signaling pathway. Overexpression of POTEE increases SPHK1 protein expression, which promotes the phosphorylation and activation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, facilitating cancer cell proliferation. This interaction suggests that POTEE may regulate SPHK1 expression, influencing p65 activation (Shen2019POTEE). The study also indicates that POTEE might act as a transcription factor or interact directly with SPHK1 to induce phosphorylation, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear (Shen2019POTEE). These interactions highlight POTEA's potential role as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
