# PAIP2

## Overview
PAIP2, or poly(A) binding protein interacting protein 2, is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of mRNA translation in eukaryotic cells. The PAIP2 protein is characterized as an unfolded protein that interacts with the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), playing a crucial role in translational repression by inhibiting PABP's ability to bind polyadenylated RNA. This interaction is mediated through two distinct motifs, PAM1 and PAM2, which bind to specific domains of PABP, thereby disrupting the formation of the translation initiation complex. PAIP2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences processes such as synaptic plasticity, memory, and spermatogenesis. Additionally, PAIP2 is involved in translation termination and is regulated through post-translational modifications like ubiquitination, which affect its stability and function (Xie2021Paip2; Khaleghpour2001Dual; Berlanga2006Regulation).

## Structure
PAIP2 is a protein characterized by its interaction with the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) and plays a role in translational repression. The primary structure of PAIP2 includes two distinct PABP binding sites: PAM1, located in the central acidic region, and PAM2, situated near the C terminus. PAM1 interacts with the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) 2 and 3 of PABP, while PAM2 binds to the PABC domain of PABP (Khaleghpour2001Dual; Karim2006A).

Structurally, PAIP2 is described as an unfolded protein, as indicated by NMR spectroscopy studies, which show significant shifts in the 15N-1H correlation spectrum upon binding to PABP (Kozlov2001Structure). Despite its lack of a defined tertiary structure, PAIP2 is functionally active in binding PABP in vitro (Kozlov2001Structure).

PAIP2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which affects its stability and degradation. The protein is more heavily ubiquitinated compared to its homolog, Paip2B, leading to a shorter half-life (Berlanga2006Regulation). PAIP2 also has splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and interactions with other proteins.

## Function
PAIP2 (poly(A) binding protein interacting protein 2) is a crucial regulator of mRNA translation in eukaryotic cells. It functions by interacting with the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), inhibiting its ability to bind to polyadenylated RNA, which is essential for translation initiation and mRNA stability (Khaleghpour2001Dual; Berlanga2006Regulation). PAIP2 achieves this by competing with other proteins, such as eIF4G and Paip1, for binding to PABP, thereby disrupting the formation of the translation initiation complex and inhibiting translation (Khaleghpour2001Dual; Karim2006A).

The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates protein synthesis and cellular growth by affecting the translation of capped and polyadenylated mRNAs (Berlanga2006Regulation). PAIP2's interaction with PABP is characterized by a two-to-one stoichiometry, forming a trimeric complex that leads to translational repression (Khaleghpour2001Dual). This regulation is significant in processes such as synaptic plasticity, memory, and spermatogenesis (Xie2021Paip2).

PAIP2 is also involved in translation termination, where it influences stop codon readthrough by modulating PABP activity, which can be beneficial in certain genetic contexts (Ivanov2019Polyadenylatebinding). The protein's levels are regulated through ubiquitination, which affects its stability and, consequently, its role in translation (Yoshida2006Poly(A) page 3 of 5).

## Clinical Significance
PAIP2 (poly(A) binding protein interacting protein 2) plays a significant role in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation, impacting various cellular processes. Alterations in PAIP2 expression have been linked to cancer, particularly in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). In these cancers, PAIP2 stabilizes VEGF-A mRNA, leading to increased expression of VEGF-A, a key factor in tumor angiogenesis. Although PAIP2 expression correlates with VEGF-A levels, it does not serve as a prognostic factor for tumor progression or patient outcomes in HNSCC (Onesto2006Vascular).

In addition to its role in cancer, PAIP2 is involved in male fertility. Studies in mice have shown that the absence of Paip2a, a variant of PAIP2, leads to male infertility due to impaired translation of mRNAs essential for spermiogenesis. This results in abnormal sperm morphology and reduced sperm count, highlighting the importance of PAIP2 in germ cell development (Yanagiya2010The). While these findings are based on animal models, they suggest potential implications for understanding male infertility in humans (Yanagiya2010The). However, the clinical significance of PAIP2 gene mutations in human diseases remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
PAIP2 interacts with the poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1) through two motifs, PAM1 and PAM2, which are crucial for its function. The PAM2 motif is particularly important as it binds to the MLLE domain of PABPC1, stabilizing both PAIP2 and PABPC1 by protecting them from degradation by the protease calpain (Xie2021Paip2). PAIP2 also competes with eIF4G for binding to PABP, inhibiting translation by disrupting the PABP-eIF4G interaction (Karim2006A). This competition is mediated by the PAM1 motif, which binds to the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of PABP (Karim2006A).

PAIP2 forms a complex with PABPC1 and RNA, but cannot bind both simultaneously due to overlapping binding sites on the RRM domains of PABPC1 (Xie2021Paip2). The interaction between PAIP2 and PABPC1 is significant in mRNA metabolism, particularly in facilitating PABPC1 dissociation from mRNA during deadenylation, which is crucial for microRNA-mediated gene silencing (Xie2021Paip2). PAIP2 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase EDD, which targets PAIP2 for degradation when PABP levels are low, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for maintaining PABP homeostasis (Yoshida2006Poly(A) page 1 of 5).
