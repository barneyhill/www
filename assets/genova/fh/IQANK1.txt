# IQANK1

## Overview
IQANK1 is a gene that encodes the protein IQ motif and ankyrin repeat containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in signal transduction and cellular scaffolding. The protein is characterized by the presence of IQ motifs, which bind to calmodulin and other calcium-binding proteins, and ankyrin repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. These structural features enable IQANK1 to play a crucial role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, thereby influencing cell shape, motility, and the spatial organization of signaling pathways. The gene has been implicated in several diseases, including schizophrenia and cancer, where its expression and potential mutations may contribute to disease pathogenesis and prognosis (Li20197lncRNA; Benjamin2022Transcriptional; Wesoly2024Structural).

## Function
IQANK1 (IQ motif and ankyrin repeat containing 1) encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of IQ motifs, which are known to bind calmodulin and other calcium-binding proteins, and ankyrin repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. These structural features suggest that IQANK1 is involved in signal transduction and cellular scaffolding, contributing to the organization and regulation of signaling complexes within the cell.

In healthy human cells, IQANK1 is implicated in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape and motility. The protein's activity is typically localized to specific cellular compartments, where it influences the spatial organization of signaling pathways. This localization is essential for the precise control of cellular signaling and the maintenance of cellular architecture. By modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling pathways, IQANK1 potentially affects cell shape and motility, which are vital for various physiological processes, including cell division, migration, and tissue organization. The protein's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and integrity.

## Clinical Significance
The IQANK1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and potential mutations. In the context of schizophrenia, IQANK1 is identified as one of the genes with significant colocalization with schizophrenia risk, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This suggests a role in the sex-dependent expression of genes associated with schizophrenia, highlighting the importance of considering sex differences in genetic studies of neuropsychiatric disorders (Benjamin2022Transcriptional).

In cancer research, IQANK1 has been associated with breast cancer prognosis. It is one of the mRNAs with a high correlation coefficient with a 7-lncRNA prognostic model for breast cancer, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-related signaling pathways. IQANK1 is also noted as a downregulated target in breast tumors, although its specific clinical significance in breast cancer remains to be fully elucidated (Li20197lncRNA).

Additionally, IQANK1 is downregulated in response to the overexpression of TMEM207 in cell lines, which is linked to the deregulation of genes involved in tumorigenesis. This suggests a possible role in the etiology of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (Wesoly2024Structural).
