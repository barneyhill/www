# MECP2

## Overview
The MECP2 gene encodes the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a critical chromatin-associated protein involved in transcriptional regulation. MeCP2 is categorized as a chromatin architectural protein due to its role in modulating chromatin structure and gene expression. It primarily functions by binding to methylated CpG sites on DNA, facilitating transcriptional repression through chromatin compaction, although it can also act as a transcriptional activator under certain conditions (Chahrour2008MeCP2; Nan1997MeCP2). The protein is predominantly expressed in the nucleus of neurons, where it plays a vital role in synaptic function and neuronal maturation, essential for normal brain development (Song2014DNA; Gonzales2010The). Mutations in the MECP2 gene are primarily associated with Rett syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, and other neurological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Amir1999Rett; Chin2019MeCP2).

## Structure
The MECP2 protein is composed of 486 amino acids and includes several distinct domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD), transcriptional repression domain (TRD), intervening domain (ID), and C-terminal domain (CTD), which is further divided into CTD-α and CTD-β (ChávezGarcía2022Multiscale). The MBD is the only domain with a known secondary structure, forming a wedge-shaped structure with a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and a C-terminal helical region (Wakefield1999The). This domain is crucial for binding to methylated CpG sequences within DNA, and its structure has been characterized using NMR spectroscopy (Wakefield1999The).

The rest of the protein is largely unstructured, with circular dichroism studies indicating it consists of approximately 35% β-strand/turn, 5% α-helix, and almost 60% unstructured regions (ChávezGarcía2022Multiscale). The ID and CTDα domains are particularly disordered (ChávezGarcía2022Multiscale). The protein's flexibility is highlighted by its ability to adopt multiple conformations, including a single globule and two globules connected by a loop, as revealed by coarse-grained simulations (ChávezGarcía2022Multiscale).

MECP2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. The protein also has multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Ho2008MeCP2).

## Function
The MECP2 gene encodes the MeCP2 protein, which plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation by binding to methylated CpG sites in DNA. This binding is essential for its function as a transcriptional repressor, as it recruits the Sin3-histone deacetylase complex, leading to chromatin compaction and transcriptional silencing (Nan1997MeCP2; Jones1998Methylated). MeCP2's repression activity is influenced by the density of methyl-CpG sites, becoming significant at densities found in bulk vertebrate genomic DNA (Nan1997MeCP2).

In addition to its role as a repressor, MeCP2 can also act as a transcriptional activator. It interacts with transcription factors such as CREB1, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism where MeCP2 can influence gene expression in both directions (Chahrour2008MeCP2). This dual role is supported by evidence showing MeCP2's involvement in transcriptional activation in specific brain regions (Samaco2011Complexities).

MeCP2 is predominantly active in the nucleus of neurons, where it influences synaptic function and plasticity, essential for normal brain development and function (Gonzales2010The). Its expression is particularly high in mature neurons, indicating its role in neuronal maturation (Song2014DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MECP2 gene are primarily associated with Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that predominantly affects females. RTT is characterized by normal early development followed by a loss of acquired skills, including speech and motor abilities, and the development of autistic features and seizures. Approximately 95% of classical RTT cases are due to mutations in MECP2, which are often de novo and occur in the paternal germline (Amir1999Rett; Chin2019MeCP2). In males, MECP2 mutations can lead to severe neonatal encephalopathy, often resulting in early death, or conditions like X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), which is associated with severe intellectual disability and motor abnormalities (Gonzales2010The).

Alterations in MECP2 expression levels, such as duplications of the MECP2 region, can also result in neurological disorders. These duplications are linked to severe mental retardation and progressive neurological symptoms, particularly in males, due to a gene dosage effect (Zachariah2012Linking; PascualAlonso2021MECP2Related). MECP2 mutations have also been implicated in other neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, although these associations are less frequent and may be influenced by detection biases (Chin2019MeCP2). The complexity of MECP2-related disorders is underscored by the variability in phenotypes, even among individuals with the same genetic alterations (PascualAlonso2021MECP2Related).

## Interactions
MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) is known for its interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin structure and gene regulation. MECP2 binds preferentially to methylated CpG sites on DNA, promoting transcriptional repression through chromatin compaction (Nikitina2007Multiple). It competes with histone H1 for chromatin binding sites, effectively displacing H1 from nucleosomes, which suggests a dynamic equilibrium in chromatin binding (Ghosh2010MeCP2).

MECP2 interacts with Lens Epithelium-derived Growth Factor (LEDGF), specifically through the ID-TRD domain of MECP2 and the PWWP-CR1 region of LEDGF. This interaction is DNA-dependent but can also occur independently of DNA (Lesire2024LEDGF). The interaction with LEDGF modulates MECP2 condensates, affecting chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation (Lesire2024LEDGF). The R306C mutation in MECP2, associated with Rett syndrome, reduces its binding affinity for LEDGF, highlighting the importance of this interaction in disease pathogenesis (Lesire2024LEDGF).

MECP2 also forms dimers or multimers, which are crucial for its ability to bind nucleosomes and compact DNA, a process that can be influenced by its interaction with LEDGF (Lesire2024LEDGF). These interactions underscore MECP2's role as a chromatin architectural protein, influencing gene expression and chromatin dynamics.
