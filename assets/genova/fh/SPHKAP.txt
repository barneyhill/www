# SPHKAP

## Overview
SPHKAP is a gene that encodes the protein SPHK1 interactor, AKAP domain containing, which functions as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) specific for type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA-RI). This protein is integral to cellular signaling, particularly in the spatial and temporal regulation of PKA signaling pathways. It is characterized by its amphipathic helix motif, which facilitates specific interactions with the PKA-RIa subunit, and contains a FFAT motif crucial for mitochondrial localization and function (Austin2024An; Kovanich2010Sphingosine). SPHKAP is involved in various cellular processes, including metabolic regulation, mitochondrial function, and glucoregulation, and has been implicated in several diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders (Austin2024An; Aye2012Reorganized; Qing2017Somatic).

## Structure
SPHKAP, also known as SPHK1 interactor, AKAP domain containing, is a protein characterized by its role as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) specific for type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA-RI). The protein contains an amphipathic helix motif, which is crucial for its interaction with the PKA-RIa subunit, facilitating hydrophobic interactions with the D/D domain of PKA-R, an antiparallel X-type four-helix bundle (Kovanich2010Sphingosine). This interaction is highly specific to PKA-RI due to the presence of specific amino acid residues, such as bulky tyrosine at position 8, which are essential for selectivity (Kovanich2010Sphingosine).

SPHKAP exists in two isoforms, SPHKAP1 and SPHKAP2, which differ by a 29 amino acid sequence resulting from alternative splicing of exon 9 (Kovanich2010Sphingosine). The protein also contains a FFAT motif, which is important for its mitochondrial localization through interaction with the VAP-B protein (Austin2024An). This motif is essential for SPHKAP's role in mitochondrial signaling and function, particularly in the context of β-cell mitochondrial remodeling (Austin2024An). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its involvement in various cellular processes, including those related to metabolic regulation and disease.

## Function
The SPHKAP gene encodes a protein known as Sphingosine kinase interacting protein, which functions as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) specific for type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA-RI) (Kovanich2010Sphingosine). SPHKAP is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with PKA-RIa, facilitating the spatial and temporal regulation of PKA signaling (Kovanich2010Sphingosine). This interaction is mediated through an amphipathic helix, which allows SPHKAP to preferentially bind to PKA-RIa over PKA-RIIa (Kovanich2010Sphingosine).

In healthy human cells, SPHKAP plays a crucial role in the compartmentalization of PKA, which is essential for the specificity of second-messenger-mediated signaling events. This compartmentalization allows for localized responses to changes in cAMP and confines phosphorylation to specific substrates, impacting various cellular processes such as hormone-mediated insulin secretion and cardiomyocyte function (Kovanich2010Sphingosine).

SPHKAP is also involved in mitochondrial function and regulation in β-cells, where it participates in a signaling hub with the GLP-1 receptor and ER-resident VAP-B. This interaction is crucial for PKA-dependent phosphorylation of MIC19, a component of the MICOS complex, which is important for mitochondrial cristae assembly and remodeling (Austin2024An). The protein's role in these processes suggests its involvement in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, contributing to metabolic processes and glucose regulation (Austin2024An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPHKAP gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, SPHKAP gene variants are associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and random blood glucose levels in non-diabetic individuals, suggesting a role in β-cell function regulation and glucoregulation (Austin2024An). These variants may affect mitochondrial function and insulin secretion, contributing to the pathophysiology of T2D (Austin2024An).

In cancer, SPHKAP mutations have been identified in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), where they are associated with poor overall survival (Qing2017Somatic). SPHKAP is also noted to be mutated in lung and ovarian cancers, although the specific clinical significance of these mutations is not fully detailed (Furukawa2011Wholeexome). In glioma, reduced expression of SPHKAP is linked to shorter survival times, indicating its potential role in tumor progression (Guangzhao2024Identification).

In cardiovascular disorders, particularly heart failure, SPHKAP is involved in altered PKA-AKAP interactions, which may contribute to the aberrant cAMP-response observed in failing hearts (Aye2012Reorganized). These findings suggest that SPHKAP plays a significant role in various diseases through its impact on cellular signaling pathways.

## Interactions
SPHKAP, also known as SPHK1 interactor, AKAP domain containing, is a protein that interacts with various cellular components, primarily through its role as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP). It specifically binds to the type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit alpha (PKA-RIa), utilizing an amphipathic helix for interaction. This binding is characterized by the presence of acidic residues in SPHKAP, which are crucial for its specificity towards PKA-RI over PKA-RII (Kovanich2010Sphingosine).

SPHKAP is involved in a tripartite inter-organelle contact and signaling hub with the endosomal GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the ER-resident protein VAP-B. This interaction is essential for mitochondrial function and β-cell activity, as it facilitates PKA-dependent phosphorylation of MIC19, a component involved in mitochondrial cristae assembly (Austin2024An). SPHKAP's interaction with VAP-B is mediated through its FFAT motif, which is crucial for its localization to mitochondria and its role in glucoregulation (Austin2024An).

In neurons, SPHKAP interacts with VAPs and is involved in supporting calcium entry and transcription factor activation at ER-plasma membrane junctions. This interaction is dependent on a phospho-FFAT motif, which is necessary for SPHKAP's association with VAPs and its role in excitation-transcription coupling (Vierra2023Neuronal).
