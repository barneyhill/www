# ISM2

## Overview
ISM2, or isthmin 2, is a gene that encodes the isthmin 2 protein, which is a member of the thrombospondin family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of mesenchymal and stromal cell activity and the modulation of inflammatory cytokine secretion. Isthmin 2 plays a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment, particularly through its interactions with the TGF-β and NF-κB signaling pathways, which are significant in the context of cancer biology (Huang2020Immune). The gene has garnered attention for its clinical significance, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its expression levels are linked to patient prognosis and survival outcomes (Liu2023An). As a result, ISM2 is being explored as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment strategies.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ISM2 (isthmin 2) has been identified as a gene with significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alterations in ISM2 expression have been associated with poor outcomes in HCC patients. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, ISM2 is considered a high-risk factor, correlating with worse prognosis and survival rates. This gene is a component of thrombospondin (THBS), which is involved in promoting mesenchymal and stromal cell activity through the TGF-β pathway and regulating inflammatory cytokine secretion via the NF-κB signaling pathway. These interactions suggest that ISM2 may contribute to the progression of HCC by influencing tumor microenvironment dynamics (Huang2020Immune).

ISM2 is also included in an immunogenic cell death (ICD) risk signature used to predict prognosis in HCC. A high ICD risk score, which incorporates ISM2, is linked to poor overall survival and is associated with various clinical parameters such as tumor stage and grade. This highlights the potential of ISM2 as a prognostic marker and a target for therapeutic strategies in HCC (Liu2023An).
