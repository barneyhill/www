# POMZP3

## Overview
The POMZP3 gene is a unique fusion gene that encodes a protein combining elements from the POM121 and ZP3 proteins. The POM-ZP3 protein, resulting from this gene, is characterized by its bipartite structure, which includes sequences homologous to both the nuclear pore complex protein POM121 and the zona pellucida glycoprotein ZP3. This fusion protein is notable for lacking the hydrophobic domain typical of zona proteins due to a frameshift mutation, which results in a truncated protein product. The POMZP3 gene is expressed in a variety of human tissues, suggesting a broader functional role beyond its potential involvement in reproductive processes, such as sperm-egg recognition. While the precise biological functions of the POM-ZP3 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its expression pattern and structural characteristics imply potential roles in nuclear transport and cellular interactions (Kipersztok1995POMZP3).

## Structure
The POMZP3 gene encodes a bipartite transcript that combines elements from the human ZP3 and a POM121 homologue. The primary structure of the POM-ZP3 protein is derived from a 1496-bp cDNA, encoding a polypeptide of 210 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 23,196 Da. The first 76 amino acids of this protein are 83% identical to residues 241-315 of rat POM121, while the next 125 amino acids are 98% identical to residues 239-363 of the human ZP3 protein (Kipersztok1995POMZP3).

The POM-ZP3 protein lacks the hydrophobic domain characteristic of zona proteins due to a frameshift mutation caused by an additional guanosine residue, which results in a truncated protein product (Kipersztok1995POMZP3). This mutation introduces multiple stop codons, leading to a unique g-amino-acid terminus (Kipersztok1995POMZP3). The transcript is expressed in multiple human tissues, indicating its potential functional significance beyond the ovary (Kipersztok1995POMZP3). The specific secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of the POM-ZP3 protein are not detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The POMZP3 gene is a fusion transcript derived from the human ZP3 gene and a POM121 homologue. It is expressed in multiple human tissues, including the ovaries, testes, spleen, thymus, lymphocytes, prostate, and intestines, suggesting a role beyond the traditional function of ZP3 in the zona pellucida, which is involved in fertilization and preventing polyspermy (Kipersztok1995POMZP3). The POMZP3 transcript is composed of a 5' region that is 77% identical to the rat POM121 gene and a 3' region that is 99% identical to the human ZP3 gene, indicating it may have functions related to both nuclear transport and reproductive processes (Kipersztok1995POMZP3).

The longest open reading frame of POMZP3 encodes a conceptual protein of 210 amino acids, with the first 76 amino acids being 83% identical to residues 241-315 of rat POM121, and the next 125 amino acids being 98% identical to residues 239-363 of the human ZP3 protein (Kipersztok1995POMZP3). This suggests that the POMZP3 protein may be involved in cellular transport processes, potentially influencing the movement of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, as well as playing a role in sperm-egg recognition during fertilization (Kipersztok1995POMZP3). However, the specific function of POMZP3 in healthy human cells remains undefined (Kipersztok1995POMZP3).
