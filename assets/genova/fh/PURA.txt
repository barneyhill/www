# PURA

## Overview
The PURA gene encodes the purine-rich element binding protein A (Pur-alpha), a nucleic acid-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular and neurological processes. Pur-alpha is characterized by its ability to bind single-stranded DNA and RNA, particularly purine-rich sequences, and is involved in transcriptional activation, RNA transport, and regulation of mRNA translation and DNA replication. Structurally, Pur-alpha contains conserved sequence-specific repeats that facilitate its binding and dimerization capabilities, essential for its function in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The protein is implicated in critical cellular functions, including cell cycle regulation and synaptic function in neurons, highlighting its importance in brain development. Mutations in the PURA gene are associated with PURA syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, and have been linked to other neurological conditions, underscoring the clinical significance of this gene and its encoded protein (Mroczek2023Neuromuscular; Daniel2018PURA; Proske2023PURA).

## Structure
The PURA gene encodes the Pur-alpha protein, which is a sequence-specific single-stranded DNA and RNA binding protein. The primary structure of Pur-alpha includes three highly conserved sequence-specific repeats known as Pur repeats I, II, and III, which fold into globular domains (Proske2023PURA). The secondary structure of Pur-alpha consists of beta sheets and alpha helices, with the beta sheets primarily involved in nucleic acid binding and the alpha helices in protein binding (Daniel2018PURA). The tertiary structure is characterized by a classical PC4-like fold in the C-terminal dimerization domain, which includes four antiparallel β-strands and one α-helix (Proske2023PURA).

The Pur-alpha protein can form homodimers or heterodimers, indicating a quaternary structure. The third Pur repeat is specifically involved in dimerization, and mutations in this domain can affect the protein's ability to unwind double-stranded DNA (Daniel2018PURA). The protein's structure is stabilized by interactions among these elements, and it is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its function (Bergemann1992Sequence). The PURA gene may produce different isoforms through alternative splicing, resulting in proteins with distinct functional properties (Bergemann1992Sequence).

## Function
The PURA gene encodes the protein Pur-alpha, a nucleic acid-binding protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, Pur-alpha is involved in transcriptional activation, RNA transport, and regulation of mRNA translation and DNA replication during the cell cycle. It binds to single-stranded DNA and RNA in a sequence-specific manner, with a preference for purine-rich sequences, which is essential for its role in gene transcription and RNA translation (Daniel2018PURA).

Pur-alpha is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it regulates transcription and remains bound to mRNA as it is processed in the cytoplasm. In neurons, it is involved in transporting mRNA transcripts to sites of translation in dendrites, playing a critical role in brain development and synaptic function (Johnson2006Role; Daniel2018PURA). The protein is also implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle, interacting with Cyclin/Cdk complexes and the Rb tumor suppressor protein to inhibit the growth of oncogenically transformed cells and block cell proliferation at specific checkpoints (Daniel2018PURA).

Overall, Pur-alpha's ability to bind nucleic acids and interact with regulatory proteins underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and neurological functions (Daniel2018PURA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PURA gene are linked to PURA syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, epileptic seizures, and feeding difficulties. These mutations impair the integrity of the PUR domains, affecting their ability to bind nucleic acids and dimerize, which are crucial for their function (Proske2023PURA). The syndrome is caused by pathogenic autosomal dominant variants in the PURA gene or deletions encompassing it, leading to symptoms such as neurodevelopmental delay, learning disabilities, neonatal hypotonia, and epilepsy (Mroczek2023Neuromuscular).

PURA gene mutations are also associated with 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome, which involves a nonrecurrent genomic deletion that may include other genes, resulting in more severe symptoms (Mroczek2023Neuromuscular). De novo mutations in PURA have been identified in patients with severe encephalopathy and other neurological conditions, including hypotonia and developmental delay (Tanaka2015De; Spangenberg2021Novel).

Alterations in PURA expression or interactions have been implicated in central nervous system diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). In ALS, PURA binds to G-rich hexanucleotide repeats in the C9ORF72 gene, potentially influencing the synthesis of neurotoxic dipeptide repeats (Daniel2018PURA).

## Interactions
The PURA gene encodes the Pur-alpha protein, which is involved in various interactions with nucleic acids and proteins. Pur-alpha binds specifically to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA, recognizing purine-rich sequences. It interacts with both DNA and RNA in a sequence-specific manner, with a preference for purine-rich strands, particularly those containing G residues (Daniel2018PURA; Weber2016Structural). 

Pur-alpha forms multiprotein complexes and interacts with several regulatory and transport proteins, conferring nucleic acid binding capabilities to proteins that lack this ability inherently (Daniel2018PURA). It binds to the HIV-1 protein Tat and the TAR RNA element, stimulating viral genome replication, and interacts with Cyclin T1, enhancing HIV-1 transcription (Daniel2018PURA). 

In the context of neurological functions, Pur-alpha binds to specific long non-coding RNAs, such as BC1 in mice and BC200 in humans, which may mediate its binding to proteins involved in mRNA transport and translation (Daniel2018PURA). It also interacts with RNA helicase Rm62, suggesting a role in RNA processing and transport (Weber2016Structural). These interactions highlight Pur-alpha's critical role in nucleic acid binding and protein interaction, essential for cellular processes and survival.
