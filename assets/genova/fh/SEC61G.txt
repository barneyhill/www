# SEC61G

## Overview
The SEC61G gene encodes the SEC61 translocon subunit gamma, a component of the SEC61 complex, which is integral to the protein translocation machinery within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is part of a heterotrimeric complex that includes SEC61α and SEC61β, playing a crucial role in the translocation of nascent polypeptides into the ER lumen and the integration of transmembrane proteins into the ER membrane (Lang2017An). The SEC61 translocon subunit gamma is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by supporting the unfolded protein response, particularly under conditions of ER stress (Gao2020SEC61G). Beyond its fundamental cellular functions, SEC61G has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ma2021SEC61G; Zheng2021Prognostic).

## Function
The SEC61G gene encodes the gamma subunit of the SEC61 complex, a critical component of the protein translocation machinery located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This complex is essential for the translocation of nascent polypeptides into the ER lumen and the integration of transmembrane proteins into the ER membrane, processes vital for proper protein synthesis and cellular function (Gao2020SEC61G; Meng2021SEC61G). The SEC61 complex, including SEC61G, facilitates the folding, modification, and transport of newly synthesized proteins, ensuring they are correctly processed and directed to their appropriate cellular destinations (Zheng2021Prognostic; Zhang2023Identification).

In healthy human cells, the SEC61 complex plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by supporting the unfolded protein response, particularly under conditions of ER stress such as hypoxia or nutrient deprivation (Zheng2021Prognostic; Gao2020SEC61G). This function is vital for the rapid growth and proliferation of cells, as it ensures that proteins are properly synthesized and functional, contributing to overall cellular health and stability (Zhang2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The SEC61G gene is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, SEC61G is highly expressed and correlates with poor prognosis. Its knockdown in breast cancer cells reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, while increasing apoptosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene. SEC61G also regulates glycolysis in these cells, contributing to cancer progression (Ma2021SEC61G). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SEC61G is overexpressed and associated with shorter overall survival. Its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, indicating its involvement in malignant behaviors. Hypomethylation of the SEC61G promoter is linked to its increased expression in LUAD (Zhang2022SEC61G; Zheng2021Prognostic).

SEC61G is also overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, highlighting its oncogenic role (Gao2020SEC61G). In kidney cancer, SEC61G is upregulated and associated with poor survival rates. It affects cell proliferation and migration through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Meng2021SEC61G). SEC61G's role in glioblastoma and gastric cancer further underscores its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target across multiple cancer types (Ma2021SEC61G; Shi2021SEC61G).

## Interactions
SEC61G, a subunit of the SEC61 translocon complex, is involved in protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It forms part of a heterotrimeric structure with SEC61α and SEC61β, facilitating the integration and translocation of nascent polypeptides (Lang2017An). SEC61G is located on the outskirts of the SEC61 complex and interacts with the ribosome, which binds to the cytosolic loops of SEC61α and the amino terminus of SEC61G, priming the complex for protein translocation (Lang2017An).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, SEC61G interacts with the cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3 (CREB3). This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting that SEC61G may promote the malignant progression of lung adenocarcinoma by modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress through its interaction with CREB3 (Zhang2022SEC61G). The interaction between SEC61G and CREB3 is significant, as SEC61G silencing leads to increased ER stress markers, which are reduced upon CREB3 overexpression, indicating a regulatory role in ER stress (Zhang2022SEC61G).
