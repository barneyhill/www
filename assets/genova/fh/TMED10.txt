# TMED10

## Overview
TMED10 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 10, a member of the p24 family of proteins. This protein is a type I single-pass transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. It is involved in the transport of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, contributing to vesicle formation and cargo selection. The protein's structure includes a luminal Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) domain, a coiled-coil domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic tail, which facilitate its interactions with various cellular components and its involvement in processes such as autophagy and protein sorting (Roberts2023The; Aber2019Transmembrane). TMED10 is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including insulin secretion, Alzheimer's disease, and ischemic stroke, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (Li2023Transmembrane; Shin2019Downregulated; Aber2019Transmembrane).

## Structure
TMED10, a member of the p24 family, is a type I single-pass transmembrane protein found in eukaryotes. Its structure is characterized by several distinct domains: a luminal Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) domain, a coiled-coil domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytosolic tail (Aber2019Transmembrane). The GOLD domain is involved in oligomerization and substrate recognition, interacting with syntaxin 17 and playing a role in dimerization (Roberts2023The; Mota2022Structural). The coiled-coil domain also contributes to oligomerization and is important for the transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins (Roberts2023The).

The transmembrane domain is crucial for protein sorting, with its length affecting TMED10's sorting capabilities (Roberts2023The). The cytoplasmic tail contains conserved COP binding motifs, facilitating interactions with coatomer protein complexes, which are essential for cargo selection and vesicle formation (Aber2019Transmembrane). TMED10's cytoplasmic domain also binds mature IL1β and interacts with proteins like ATG4B, influencing autophagy (Shin2019Downregulated; Roberts2023The).

TMED10 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions (Shin2019Downregulated). These structural features enable TMED10 to play a significant role in vesicular trafficking and cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
TMED10, or transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 10, is a crucial component of the secretory pathway in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the transport of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, playing a significant role in vesicle formation and cargo selection. TMED10 is part of the p24 family of proteins, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein transport through the secretory pathway (Aber2019Transmembrane).

In pancreatic β cells, TMED10 is localized to the plasma membrane, where it is involved in the quality control, folding, and secretion of insulin molecules. Knockdown of TMED10 impairs insulin biosynthesis and release, indicating its critical role in insulin production (Aber2019Transmembrane). TMED10 is also expressed in the grey matter of the brain, predominantly at presynaptic membranes, where it is suggested to play a role in the secretion of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, potentially influencing Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis (Aber2019Transmembrane).

TMED10 interacts with RAB21, a member of the RAB GTPases family, which modulates its localization and abundance, particularly affecting its role in cargo trafficking within cells (Del2019RAB21). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the ER and Golgi compartments (Del2019RAB21).

## Clinical Significance
TMED10 is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or interactions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), TMED10 expression is reduced, which correlates with increased amyloid-beta (Aβ) production. This downregulation enhances ATG4B protease activity, leading to increased autophagy, which may contribute to AD pathogenesis by promoting Aβ production (Shin2019Downregulated). Although no significant genetic variations in TMED10 were found in Korean AD patients, a novel SNP in TMED10 has been associated with the disease (Shin2019Downregulated).

In ischemic stroke, TMED10 is upregulated in the cerebral ischemic penumbra, providing a protective effect against neuronal damage. Its downregulation exacerbates brain damage and promotes neuronal apoptosis via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke (Li2023Transmembrane).

TMED10 is also associated with head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC), where it is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. High expression levels of TMED10, along with TMED2 and TMED9, are associated with worse survival outcomes in HNSC patients (Gao2022TMED2910).

## Interactions
TMED10, a member of the p24 family, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It directly interacts with ATG4B, a cysteine protease involved in autophagy. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of autophagy, as TMED10 suppresses ATG4B activity by recruiting it to membranes. The interaction is mediated by the C-terminal region of TMED10 and both the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of ATG4B. Under autophagy-inducing conditions, such as rapamycin treatment, the interaction between TMED10 and ATG4B is diminished, which enhances ATG4B activity and promotes autophagy (Shin2019Downregulated).

TMED10 also interacts with RAB21, a protein involved in vesicular trafficking. This interaction is enhanced when RAB21 is in its activated, GTP-bound form. RAB21 influences the localization and abundance of TMED10, particularly its presence in the cis-Golgi compartment. The interaction between TMED10 and RAB21 is essential for maintaining TMED10's function in the Golgi apparatus (Del2019RAB21).

In the context of coronavirus infections, TMED10 interacts with the envelope (E) protein of severe coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. This interaction facilitates the unconventional secretion of inflammatory cytokines, contributing to the inflammatory response during infection (Liu2024Coronavirus).
