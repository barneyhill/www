# SHC2

## Overview
SHC2 is a gene that encodes the SHC adaptor protein 2, a critical component in cellular signaling pathways. This protein functions as an adaptor, facilitating interactions between receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling molecules, thereby playing a pivotal role in processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Predominantly expressed in the nervous system, SHC adaptor protein 2 is involved in the development and maintenance of neuronal populations, as well as in mechanosensory pathways that enable cells to respond to their physical environment (Jones2007Analysis; Terada2021Shc). Additionally, SHC2 has been implicated in oncogenic pathways, where it can promote cellular transformation and resistance to programmed cell death (Pomerleau2014Met). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disorder, where specific copy number variations in SHC2 have been observed (Sasaki2011Copy).

## Function
SHC2, also known as SHC adaptor protein 2, is primarily expressed in the nervous system and plays a significant role in intracellular signaling pathways related to cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It functions as an adaptor protein, facilitating interactions between receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling molecules. This protein is involved in the development and survival of certain neuronal populations, indicating its importance in the nervous system (Jones2007Analysis).

SHC2 is active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, where it influences processes such as neuronal development and immune responses. It is implicated in mechanosensory pathways that help cells sense their physical environment, particularly through integrin signals, which are crucial for processes like anoikis, a form of programmed cell death (Terada2021Shc).

In the context of oncogenic pathways, SHC2 has been shown to promote transformation of intestinal epithelial cells, allowing them to bypass contact inhibition and form disorganized, multilayered cell populations. This suggests that SHC2 can alleviate anchorage dependence and reduce sensitivity to growth factor deprivation and anoikis in these cells (Pomerleau2014Met).

## Clinical Significance
The SHC2 gene has been implicated in multiple system atrophy (MSA), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, autonomic disturbances, and parkinsonism. A study identified a specific copy number loss of the SHC2 gene in a subset of patients with MSA, suggesting a potential causal link between SHC2 deletions and the disease. This copy number loss was observed in 10 out of 31 patients with MSA, including one of a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for the MSA phenotype, but not in control populations. The findings indicate that SHC2 may play a role in predisposing individuals to MSA, although no significant correlation was found between SHC2 copy number loss and specific MSA phenotypes like parkinsonism or cerebellar ataxia (Sasaki2011Copy).

The SHC2 gene is located in a region on chromosome 19p13.3, which is prone to genomic rearrangements, including deletions and duplications. This region's instability may contribute to the observed copy number variations associated with MSA. The study highlights the potential of CNV analysis in identifying disease-predisposing loci, particularly in phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins (Sasaki2011Copy).

## Interactions
SHC2 (SHC adaptor protein 2) is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) through its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. This interaction is significant in the context of insulin signaling, where SHC2, upon tyrosine phosphorylation, forms complexes with Grb2. These complexes are essential for the activation of downstream signaling molecules such as p21ras-GTP, which is a critical component of the Ras signaling pathway (Ouwens1994A).

SHC2 also interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Upon stimulation by growth factors like EGF, SHC2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with activated EGFR, facilitating mitogenic signal transduction. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of SHC2, which binds to specific phosphotyrosine residues on EGFR (Pelicci1992A).

In the context of oncogenic transformation, SHC2 has been shown to participate in the transformation of intestinal epithelial cells. Variants of SHC2, such as TM-Shc2, have been used to study its role in promoting oncogenic signals, which can lead to altered cell growth and resistance to anoikis, a form of programmed cell death (Pomerleau2014Met).
