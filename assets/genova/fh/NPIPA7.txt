# NPIPA7

## Overview
Nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member A7 (NPIPA7) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the nuclear pore complex, which is crucial for the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The NPIPA7 protein is part of a family of proteins that interact with the nuclear pore complex, suggesting a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport or regulation. While the specific functions of NPIPA7 remain to be fully elucidated, proteins in this family are often implicated in cellular processes such as gene expression regulation and signal transduction. Understanding the precise role of NPIPA7 could provide insights into its potential involvement in various cellular pathways and its significance in health and disease.
