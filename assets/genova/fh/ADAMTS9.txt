# ADAMTS9

## Overview
ADAMTS9 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 9, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family. This protein is a metalloprotease involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) through the cleavage of proteoglycans such as versican and aggrecan, which is crucial for maintaining ECM integrity and facilitating cellular signaling (Kern2010Reduced; Koo2007Regulation). ADAMTS9 also functions as an anti-angiogenic factor, inhibiting endothelial cell migration and tube formation, thereby playing a significant role in angiogenesis (Koo2010ADAMTS9). Additionally, the protein has a unique function in protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, mediated by its GON domain, which is independent of its protease activity (Yoshina2012Identification). Mutations in ADAMTS9 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Peters Plus Syndrome and cardiac anomalies, highlighting its importance in developmental and pathological processes (Kern2010Reduced; Dubail2016Impaired).

## Structure
ADAMTS9 is a member of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a complex modular structure. It includes a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and multiple thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) (Takeda2016ADAM). The protein also contains a cysteine-rich domain and a spacer domain, which contribute to its enzymatic activity and interactions with the extracellular matrix (PORTER2005The). ADAMTS9 has a unique C-terminal domain known as the GON domain, which is involved in protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (Yoshina2012Identification).

The TSRs in ADAMTS9 are modified by O-fucosylation, with some TSRs also undergoing glucosylation, which affects their function and stability (Holdener2019ADAMTS9). The protein undergoes N-terminal processing, involving a signal peptidase and removal of the pro-domain, which is crucial for enzyme latency and proper folding (PORTER2005The). ADAMTS9 is highly conserved and shares an identical active site sequence with ADAMTS1, although it contains more TSRs, which are potentially anti-angiogenic (Koo2010ADAMTS9). The protein's interaction with the extracellular matrix is mediated through its TSRs and spacer region, facilitating binding to components like fibronectin (PORTER2005The).

## Function
The ADAMTS9 gene encodes a metalloprotease that plays a crucial role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling by cleaving proteoglycans such as versican and aggrecan. This proteolytic activity is essential for maintaining ECM integrity and facilitating cellular signaling, which can influence smooth muscle cell phenotype and ECM component secretion (Kern2010Reduced; Koo2007Regulation). ADAMTS9 is involved in cardiovascular development and homeostasis, with its activity being critical for processes such as atrioventricular remodeling and cardiac outlet formation (Kern2010Reduced).

In addition to its role in ECM remodeling, ADAMTS9 functions as an anti-angiogenic factor in microvascular endothelial cells, inhibiting angiogenesis by suppressing endothelial cell migration and tube formation (Koo2010ADAMTS9). This activity is crucial for capillary maturation and stabilization during embryonic and regenerative angiogenesis (Koo2010ADAMTS9).

ADAMTS9 also has a novel function in protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, which is independent of its protease activity. This function is mediated by the GON domain and is essential for maintaining normal ER-to-Golgi transport and secretory functions in human cells (Yoshina2012Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADAMTS9 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. ADAMTS9 is associated with Peters Plus Syndrome (PPS), a congenital disorder characterized by ocular anomalies such as congenital corneal opacity and Peters anomaly. These conditions are thought to result from impaired secretion of ADAMTS9 due to mutations affecting the glucosyltransferase B3GLCT, which is crucial for ADAMTS9's function in ocular development (Dubail2016Impaired).

ADAMTS9 haploinsufficiency has been implicated in cardiac and aortic anomalies. In mice, reduced expression of ADAMTS9 leads to structural defects in the heart and aorta, including myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve and aortic wall anomalies. These defects are associated with decreased cleavage of versican, a proteoglycan involved in the extracellular matrix (Kern2010Reduced).

The gene is also linked to age-related macular degeneration and has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor in esophageal and nasopharyngeal cancers. Its role in inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth is highlighted by its anti-angiogenic activity and tumor suppressor function (Koo2010ADAMTS9; Przemyslaw2013ADAM).

## Interactions
ADAMTS9 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various biological processes. It interacts with fibronectin 1 (FN1), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), and ring finger protein 123 (RNF123) (Dennler2023Phylogenetic). These interactions suggest a role in extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular signaling pathways. LRP1, in particular, is involved in the internalization of ADAMTS9, as well as other ADAMTS proteins like ADAMTS4, -5, and -10, indicating a regulatory mechanism for these proteases (Dennler2023Phylogenetic).

ADAMTS9 also interacts with aggrecan, a major component of cartilage, although it exhibits less degrading activity compared to other hyalectanases such as ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 (Dennler2023Phylogenetic). This interaction is significant in the context of cartilage maintenance and degradation, potentially implicating ADAMTS9 in joint diseases.

In addition to its extracellular roles, ADAMTS9 is involved in intracellular processes, particularly in protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. This function is mediated by its GON domain, which is crucial for maintaining ER morphology and facilitating the transport of various proteins (Yoshina2012Identification).
