# TEX13B

## Overview
TEX13B is a gene that encodes the testis expressed 13B protein, which is predominantly expressed in male germ cells. This protein plays a significant role in the regulation of germ cell development and energy metabolism, particularly during spermatogenesis. TEX13B is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes critical for the balance between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, processes essential for energy production in germ cells (Kumar2022TEX13B). The protein is localized in the nuclei of germ cells, where it influences gene expression patterns necessary for proper germ cell function and development (Bellil2021Human). Mutations in the TEX13B gene have been associated with male infertility, highlighting its clinical significance in reproductive health (Kumar2022TEX13B).

## Function
The TEX13B gene is specifically expressed in male germ cells and plays a crucial role in germ cell development and male fertility. It is involved in regulating germ cell proliferation and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mouse models, which suggests a similar function in humans (Kumar2022TEX13B). TEX13B is expressed at the preleptotene stage of spermatogonia cells, indicating its role in the early stages of spermatogenesis (Kumar2022TEX13B). The gene is thought to regulate the balance between OXPHOS and glycolysis, a critical aspect of energy metabolism in germ cells (Kumar2022TEX13B).

TEX13B proteins are located in the nuclei of germ cells and are involved in transcriptional regulation during spermatogenesis. Overexpression of TEX13B in GC-2 cells has been shown to alter the expression levels of numerous genes, suggesting its role in transcriptional regulation (Bellil2021Human). The gene's function is linked to the regulation of energy metabolism, which is essential for spermatogenesis and germ cell lineage specification (Kumar2022TEX13B). These findings highlight the importance of TEX13B in maintaining the proper function and development of male germ cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TEX13B gene have been implicated in male infertility, particularly in conditions such as azoospermia, which is characterized by a lack of sperm in semen. Two specific variants, rs41300872 (p.Gly197Arg) and rs775429506 (p.Gly237Glu), have been significantly associated with this condition (Kumar2022TEX13B). Studies involving the sequencing of TEX13B in infertile men have shown significant associations between these mutations and infertility, suggesting that TEX13B mutations may have clinical significance in male infertility (Kumar2022TEX13B).

Functional studies have demonstrated that TEX13B plays a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism during spermatogenesis. Disruption of TEX13B expression can lead to altered protein expression and a shift in energy metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which is essential for germ cell growth and morphology (Kumar2022TEX13B). These findings highlight the potential impact of TEX13B mutations on male reproductive health, although the study does not directly link these mutations to specific diseases beyond infertility (Kumar2022TEX13B). The clinical significance of TEX13B mutations remains an area of active research, with ongoing studies needed to fully understand their implications.
