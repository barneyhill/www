# MYH9

## Overview
The MYH9 gene encodes the non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMII-A), a motor protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell motility, and maintenance of cell shape. As a member of the myosin superfamily, NMII-A is characterized by its ability to interact with actin filaments and hydrolyze ATP, facilitating cellular contractility and movement (AsensioJuárez2020Linking; Brito2020NonMuscle). The protein is integral to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and is involved in forming focal adhesion complexes, which are crucial for linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton (Li2008MYH9‐siRNA). MYH9 mutations are associated with a spectrum of autosomal dominant disorders known as MYH9-related diseases, which include conditions such as May-Hegglin anomaly and Sebastian syndrome, characterized by macrothrombocytopenia and other systemic manifestations (Heath2001Nonmuscle; Pecci2005Pathogenetic). The gene's diverse functional roles and its involvement in disease highlight its significance in both normal physiology and pathology.

## Structure
The MYH9 gene encodes the non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMII-A), a motor protein involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of NMII-A includes a head domain responsible for ATPase activity and actin binding, a neck region with IQ motifs for light chain binding, and a tail domain that facilitates dimerization (AsensioJuárez2020Linking; Brito2020NonMuscle). The head domain, encoded by exons 2-19, contains the actin binding site and ATP hydrolysis domains, while exons 19 and 20 encode the neck region, which is crucial for force transduction (AsensioJuárez2020Linking).

The secondary structure of NMII-A features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its functional motor domain. The coiled coil region, encoded by exons 21-40, mediates dimerization, forming the NMII hexamer, which is the basic unit of myosin filaments (AsensioJuárez2020Linking). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a hexameric complex with two heavy chains and four light chains, including two essential light chains and two regulatory light chains (Brito2020NonMuscle).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating NMII-A's function. Phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain at Ser19 and Thr18 is crucial for filament assembly and ATPase activity (AsensioJuárez2020Linking). Additionally, alternative splicing of the MYH9 gene results in multiple isoforms, contributing to its diverse functional roles (Brito2020NonMuscle).

## Function
The MYH9 gene encodes non-muscle myosin IIA (NM IIA), a motor protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes. NM IIA is involved in cytokinesis, where it forms an actomyosin contractile ring necessary for cell division (Brito2020NonMuscle). It also contributes to cell motility and the maintenance of cell shape by organizing the actin cytoskeleton and forming focal adhesion complexes, which are essential for connecting the extracellular matrix to the internal cytoskeleton (Li2008MYH9‐siRNA). NM IIA is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for actin filament organization and intracellular transport (Pecci2018MYH9:).

In healthy human cells, NM IIA is essential for maintaining cell polarity and intercellular adhesion, impacting the establishment of polarized epithelial tissues (Brito2020NonMuscle). It is also involved in the late stages of platelet biogenesis, particularly in the formation of proplatelets from mature megakaryocytes (Pecci2018MYH9:). NM IIA's role extends to the auditory system, where it is localized in the hair cells of the cochlea, essential for sound transduction (Pecci2018MYH9:). Overall, MYH9 is integral to normal cellular functions, contributing to tissue development and maintenance.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYH9 gene, which encodes nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA, are linked to a group of autosomal dominant disorders known as MYH9-related diseases (MYH9-RD). These include May-Hegglin anomaly, Sebastian syndrome, Fechtner syndrome, and Epstein syndrome. These conditions are characterized by macrothrombocytopenia, which involves the presence of large platelets and a reduced platelet count, leading to bleeding tendencies. Patients may also exhibit leukocyte inclusions, sensorineural hearing loss, cataracts, and nephritis, which can progress to end-stage renal disease (Heath2001Nonmuscle; Pecci2005Pathogenetic; Furlano2019Nefropatía).

The clinical presentation of MYH9-related disorders can vary significantly, even among individuals with the same mutation. Specific mutations, such as R702C, D1424N, E1841K, and R1933X, are associated with different syndromes and symptoms, indicating a genotype-phenotype correlation (Heath2001Nonmuscle; Kunishima2001Identification). The severity of symptoms can be influenced by the location of the mutation within the MYH9 gene, with mutations in the motor domain often linked to more severe extrahematological symptoms (Saposnik2014Mutation). These disorders are collectively referred to as MYH9-related macrothrombocytopenias due to their shared genetic cause and overlapping clinical features (Althaus2009MYH9Related).

## Interactions
MYH9, also known as non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. MYH9 interacts with non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIB (NMMHC-IIB), encoded by the MYH10 gene, through their C-terminal regions. This interaction has been confirmed in living cells using yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Marini2006Nonmuscle).

In the context of viral infections, MYH9 interacts with the GP5 protein of the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV). This interaction is essential for the internalization of the virus into cells, facilitated by MYH9 aggregation (Xue2019MYH9). MYH9 also forms part of a complex network of protein-protein interactions, organized into clusters associated with cellular functions such as cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (Hays2014Proteomics).

MYH9 interacts with Dlc1, a Rho GTPase-activating protein, in multiprotein complexes. This interaction involves phosphorylated forms of MYH9 and is linked to changes in cell morphology and cytoskeletal dynamics (Sabbir2016Dlc1). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of MYH9 in cellular processes and its potential implications in disease contexts.
