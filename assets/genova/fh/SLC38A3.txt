# SLC38A3

## Overview
The SLC38A3 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 38 member 3 (SNAT3), which is a sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter. SNAT3 is primarily expressed in astrocytes within the brain and retina, and it plays a crucial role in the transport of amino acids such as glutamine, asparagine, and histidine. This transporter is integral to the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle, which is essential for neurotransmitter replenishment and maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain. Structurally, SNAT3 is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and is involved in various physiological processes, including ammonia detoxification in the liver and pH regulation in the kidney. Mutations in SLC38A3 are linked to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Marafi2021Biallelic; Mackenzie2004Sodiumcoupled).

## Structure
The SLC38A3 gene encodes the SNAT3 protein, a sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter. SNAT3 is primarily expressed in astrocytes in the brain and retina, with mRNA also present in the liver, kidney, and other tissues (Mackenzie2004Sodiumcoupled). The protein is involved in the transport of glutamine, asparagine, and histidine, and is characterized by its coupling of amino acid transport to the exchange of H+, making it electroneutral (Mackenzie2004Sodiumcoupled).

SNAT3 is predicted to have 11 transmembrane domains, with the N-terminus located intracellularly and a large glycosylated loop between transmembrane domains V and VI being extracellular (Mackenzie2004Sodiumcoupled). This structural model is supported by hydropathy analysis and biochemical studies of related transporters (Mackenzie2004Sodiumcoupled). The protein may also have cytosolic phospholipid-binding pockets, which could influence its distribution across the plasma membrane (Marafi2021Biallelic).

The SNAT3 protein is involved in the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle, crucial for neurotransmitter replenishment in the brain (Marafi2021Biallelic). Loss-of-function variants in SLC38A3 can lead to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper function (Marafi2021Biallelic).

## Function
The SLC38A3 gene encodes the SNAT3 protein, a sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter involved in the transport of glutamine, asparagine, and histidine across cell membranes. SNAT3 plays a critical role in the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle in the brain, facilitating the release of glutamine from astrocytes, which is then taken up by neurons to synthesize neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. This cycle is essential for maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain, crucial for normal neuronal function and synaptic communication (Marafi2021Biallelic; Dong2018PKCMediated).

In the liver, SNAT3 is involved in ammonia detoxification and urea formation, while in the kidney, it contributes to pH regulation and ammoniagenesis, particularly during metabolic acidosis (Chan2015Loss; Marafi2021Biallelic). SNAT3 is also expressed in the pancreas, where it influences insulin secretion, playing a role in glucose homeostasis (Crocco2022The). The transporter is primarily localized to the plasma membrane of astrocytes in the brain and is regulated by protein kinase C, which affects its membrane trafficking and degradation (NissenMeyer2013Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC38A3 gene, which encodes the SNAT3 glutamine transporter, are associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Individuals with biallelic variants in SLC38A3 exhibit symptoms such as global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, absent speech, microcephaly, epilepsy, and visual impairment. In some cases, epilepsy is drug-resistant (Marafi2021Biallelic). The pathophysiology of DEE related to SLC38A3 mutations likely involves disruptions in glutamine homeostasis, affecting the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle in the brain (Marafi2021Biallelic).

Metabolomic analyses in affected individuals reveal abnormalities in glutamate, histidine, and nitrogen metabolism, suggesting these as potential biomarkers for the disease (Marafi2021Biallelic). Some patients respond favorably to antiseizure medications like vigabatrin and benzodiazepines, indicating a possible link between SNAT3 defects and GABA dysregulation (Marafi2021Biallelic).

Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SLC38A3, rs1858828, has been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This SNP affects the binding site for the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), which is involved in T2D (Crocco2022The).

## Interactions
The SLC38A3 gene encodes the SNAT3 protein, which is involved in the transport of glutamine and other neutral amino acids. SNAT3 participates in several interactions that regulate its function and localization. Protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates SNAT3, specifically at the serine residue S52, leading to its internalization from the plasma membrane and subsequent degradation via the proteasomal pathway. This phosphorylation is mediated by PKC isoforms such as PKCα, PKCγ, and PKCδ, and is crucial for the dynamic regulation of SNAT3's membrane presence (NissenMeyer2013Protein).

SNAT3 is also regulated by the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, which down-regulates its activity, indicating a role in the ubiquitination and degradation of the transporter (NissenMeyer2013Protein). Additionally, insulin influences SNAT3 expression through the PI3K-mTOR signaling cascade, affecting its trafficking and function (NissenMeyer2013Protein).

In the context of metabolic acidosis, NRF2 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of SNAT3 in the kidney, potentially through interactions with the transcription factor SP1. This regulation is specific to the kidney and highlights the role of NRF2 in maintaining glutamine metabolism under stress conditions (Lister2018NRF2).
