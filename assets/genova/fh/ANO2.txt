# ANO2

## Overview
ANO2 is a gene that encodes the protein anoctamin 2, a member of the anoctamin family of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs). Anoctamin 2, also known as TMEM16B, is characterized by its eight transmembrane domains and is primarily expressed in sensory tissues, such as olfactory sensory neurons and the retina (Ponissery2013Channel; Stephan2009ANO2). The protein plays a crucial role in sensory transduction processes by mediating calcium-activated chloride currents, which are essential for the depolarization of sensory neurons and the amplification of sensory signals (Benarroch2017Anoctamins; Duran2011Physiological). ANO2's function is modulated by its interaction with calmodulin and its ability to form homodimers or heterodimers with other anoctamin family members, influencing its calcium sensitivity and channel properties (Vocke2013Calmodulindependent; Ponissery2013Channel). The gene's expression and the protein's functional properties are subject to regulation through alternative splicing, which results in isoforms with distinct calcium sensitivities and activation speeds (Lee2023Intracellular).

## Structure
The ANO2 protein, also known as TMEM16B, is a calcium-activated chloride channel that is part of the anoctamin family. It is predicted to have eight transmembrane domains with both N and C termini located in the cytoplasm, a topology consistent with many ion channels (Ponissery2013Channel; Stephan2009ANO2). The primary structure of ANO2 includes various splice variants, which result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties. For instance, the presence or absence of exon 4 significantly affects the channel's calcium sensitivity and functionality (Ponissery2013Channel).

The secondary structure of ANO2 involves alpha helices, particularly in the transmembrane regions. The tertiary structure is characterized by the folding of these helices, contributing to the protein's functional conformation. ANO2 forms a homodimer, which is its quaternary structure, with each dimer consisting of 10 transmembrane α-helices (Lee2023Intracellular).

Splice variants of ANO2, such as those involving exon 14, lead to structural differences that affect calcium-dependent activation. Isoform 1, which includes exon 14, has a helical structure in the first intracellular loop, while isoform 2, lacking exon 14, has a loop-like structure (Lee2023Intracellular). These structural variations influence the protein's calcium sensitivity and activation speed (Lee2023Intracellular).

## Function
Anoctamin 2 (ANO2) is a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) that plays a significant role in sensory transduction processes, particularly in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). ANO2 is primarily localized in the cilia of these neurons, where it contributes to the amplification of odorant-induced signals. This amplification is crucial for the proper functioning of olfactory signaling, as ANO2 accounts for a substantial portion of the receptor current by enhancing the initial current generated by calcium-permeable cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (Ponissery2013Channel; Stephan2009ANO2).

The protein is involved in mediating calcium-activated chloride currents, which are essential for the depolarization of olfactory receptor neurons. This process is vital for the transmission of olfactory signals to the brain, allowing for the perception of odors (Benarroch2017Anoctamins; Duran2011Physiological). ANO2's function is characterized by its sensitivity to calcium ions, with its activity modulated by intracellular calcium levels, which influence its chloride conductance properties (Stephan2009ANO2).

In addition to its role in olfactory neurons, ANO2 is expressed in other tissues, including the retina, where it may contribute to sensory signal transduction and synaptic regulation (Milenkovic2010Evolution; Keckeis2017Anoctamin2).

## Interactions
ANO2, also known as anoctamin 2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function as a calcium-activated chloride channel. ANO2 interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner, which is crucial for its activation and inactivation processes. The RCBM domain of ANO2 contains high-affinity and low-affinity CaM-binding sites, allowing it to process distinct CaM-mediated signals (Vocke2013Calmodulindependent). 

ANO2 can form homodimers or heterodimers with ANO1, another member of the anoctamin family, which affects the stoichiometry of the CaM-RCBM complex (Vocke2013Calmodulindependent). In olfactory sensory neurons, ANO2 is suggested to form hetero-multimeric complexes with different splicing isoforms, which modulate its channel properties and calcium sensitivity (Ponissery2013Channel). 

In photoreceptor synaptic membranes, ANO2, identified as TMEM16B, interacts with synaptic adaptor proteins such as PSD95, MPP4, and VELI3, forming a presynaptic scaffold that regulates synaptic transmission (Stöhr2009TMEM16B). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving ANO2 in various cellular contexts.
