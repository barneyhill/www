# SLC22A10

## Overview
SLC22A10 is a gene in humans that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 10, which is part of the larger solute carrier (SLC) family known for facilitating the transport of organic ions across cell membranes. However, in humans, SLC22A10 is classified as a unitary pseudogene, meaning it has lost its original function due to evolutionary changes. This loss of function is primarily attributed to specific mutations, including a missense mutation at position 220, which results in the substitution of proline for leucine, affecting the protein's stability and preventing its localization to the plasma membrane (Yee2023Illuminating). Consequently, the human SLC22A10 protein lacks transporter activity, distinguishing it from its functional orthologs in great apes, where it acts as a transporter of steroid glucuronides (Yee2023Illuminating). Despite its inactivation in humans, SLC22A10 has been implicated in certain clinical contexts, such as Alzheimer's disease, where rare variants may influence disease susceptibility (Neumann2022Rare).

## Structure
The SLC22A10 protein in humans is composed of 541 amino acids, resulting from a single nucleotide insertion that causes a frameshift in the last exon, distinguishing it from the 552 amino acid isoform found in great apes (Yee2023Illuminating). This frameshift affects the protein's localization and function, as the human SLC22A10 does not localize to the plasma membrane and lacks transporter activity for typical substrates of the SLC22 family (Yee2023Illuminating). The protein is part of the SLC22 family, which typically features 12 α-helical transmembrane domains, a large extracellular loop between the first and second transmembrane domains, and an intracellular loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains (Volk2013OCTs).

A critical mutation at position 220, where proline is present in humans instead of leucine as in great apes, contributes to the inactivation of the human SLC22A10, rendering it a pseudogene (Yee2023Illuminating). This mutation affects the protein's stability and expression levels, with the proline variant showing lower expression and stability compared to the leucine variant (Yee2023Illuminating). The human SLC22A10 protein is expressed in the liver, but its specific substrates remain unidentified (Jacobsson2007Identification).

## Function
The SLC22A10 gene, part of the solute carrier family 22, is classified as an orphan transporter in humans, meaning its specific substrates and functions are not well-defined. In healthy human cells, SLC22A10 is considered a unitary pseudogene, having lost its original function due to evolutionary changes. This loss of function is primarily attributed to a missense mutation that occurred after the divergence from the common ancestor with chimpanzees, resulting in a proline at position 220 instead of leucine, which is found in great ape orthologs (Yee2023Illuminating). This mutation affects the protein's stability and prevents its expression on the plasma membrane, leading to a lack of transporter activity (Yee2023Illuminating).

In great apes, SLC22A10 functions as a transporter of steroid glucuronides, specifically estradiol-17β-glucuronide, but this activity is absent in humans due to the aforementioned mutations (Yee2023Illuminating). The human SLC22A10 protein is transcribed but remains unstable, resulting in undetectable expression levels in tissues such as the liver (Koepsell2013The; Yee2023Illuminating). Consequently, SLC22A10 does not contribute to the transport of organic anions in human physiology.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SLC22A10 gene in humans is primarily associated with its potential role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rare variants in SLC22A10 have been linked to increased susceptibility to neuronal injury and inflammation, which are key features of AD. Specifically, a deletion in the rs562147200 variant of SLC22A10 has been identified as deleterious, contributing to the downregulation of the gene's expression in the parahippocampal gyrus, a region affected in AD. This downregulation may increase vulnerability to neuronal damage and inflammation, potentially leading to neurodegeneration and dementia symptoms (Neumann2022Rare).

In humans, SLC22A10 is considered a unitary pseudogene, having lost its original transporter function due to evolutionary changes, including a prevalent nonsense variant, p.Trp96Ter, and a missense mutation, Leu220Pro. These mutations result in a lack of protein expression and transporter activity, which may have implications for cellular processes, although specific disease associations are not directly addressed (Yee2023Illuminating). The gene's loss of function in humans is thought to be an evolutionary development, with no direct clinical implications currently identified (Yee2023Illuminating).
