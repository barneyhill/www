# NTAN1

## Overview
The NTAN1 gene encodes the enzyme N-terminal asparagine amidase, a member of the CNF1/YfiH-like cysteine hydrolase family, which is integral to the N-end rule pathway of protein degradation. This pathway is a proteolytic system that determines the half-life of proteins based on their N-terminal residues. The NTAN1 enzyme specifically deamidates N-terminal asparagine residues, converting them into aspartate, thereby marking proteins for degradation. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and is implicated in various physiological processes, including cognitive functions and social behaviors. The NTAN1 protein is characterized by a unique α-β-β sandwich structure and a catalytic triad essential for its function. It operates in the cytosol and interacts with several proteins involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, highlighting its role in complex regulatory networks (Tasaki2012The; Kwon2000Altered; Park2020Structural).

## Structure
The NTAN1 protein, also known as N-terminal asparagine amidase, is characterized by a unique α-β-β sandwich structure. This tertiary structure is composed of eight α-helices, one 3_10-helix, and sixteen β-strands, which are typical of CNF1/YfiH-like cysteine hydrolases (Park2020Structural). The protein contains a conserved catalytic triad consisting of Cys75, His92, and Ser69, essential for its enzymatic activity in deamidating N-terminal asparagine (Nt-Asn) (Park2020Structural). 

NTAN1's primary sequence shows no significant similarity to other known proteins, indicating a distinct evolutionary path (Park2020Structural). The protein's structure includes a unique C-terminal region that contributes to its specificity for Nt-Asn, and it features a hydrophobic pocket that stabilizes the side chain of the second-position residue of substrate peptides (Park2020Structural). 

The NTAN1 protein does not contain motifs for membrane-spanning regions, signal sequences, or nuclear localization signals, suggesting it functions in the cytosol (Grigoryev1996A). The absence of these motifs does not preclude its potential involvement in a multiprotein targeting complex (Grigoryev1996A).

## Function
NTAN1 encodes the enzyme N-terminal asparagine amidase, which plays a crucial role in the N-end rule pathway, a proteolytic system that regulates protein degradation based on the identity of N-terminal residues. In this pathway, NTAN1 specifically deamidates N-terminal asparagine (Asn) residues to aspartate (Asp), converting tertiary destabilizing residues into secondary destabilizing ones, which are then targeted for degradation (Tasaki2007The; Tasaki2012The). This deamidation process is essential for generating N-degrons, which are recognized by N-recognins, leading to ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the protein (Tasaki2012The).

NTAN1 is part of the CNF1/YfiH-like cysteine hydrolase family and features a catalytic triad composed of Cys, His, and Ser, which is critical for its enzymatic activity (Park2020Structural). The enzyme shows a preference for substrates with hydrophobic amino acids at the second position, which are accommodated in a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the active site (Park2020Structural). NTAN1's activity is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and is implicated in various physiological processes, including memory, learning, and social behavior, as evidenced by studies on NTAN1-deficient mice (Tasaki2007The; Kwon2000Altered).

## Clinical Significance
The NTAN1 gene, encoding the N-terminal asparagine amidase, plays a significant role in the N-end rule pathway, which is crucial for protein degradation. Alterations in NTAN1 expression have been linked to various neurological and behavioral conditions. In mice, the absence of NTAN1 leads to altered social behavior, reduced spontaneous activity, and impaired spatial memory, suggesting its involvement in cognitive and behavioral regulation (Kwon2000Altered). These findings imply that similar disruptions in humans could potentially contribute to neurological disorders.

In humans, changes in NTAN1 expression have been associated with memory and social behavior issues, as well as more severe conditions such as sporadic childhood cancer and schizophrenia (CastañedaSampedro2022The). The gene's role in these conditions is thought to be linked to its involvement in the regulation of protein stability and degradation, which are critical processes in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Kwon2000Altered). While direct links to specific diseases are not fully established, the evidence suggests that NTAN1 may be a significant factor in the development of certain neurological and psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
NTAN1 interacts with various proteins and is involved in the N-end rule pathway, which regulates protein degradation. It is part of a broader protein interaction network that includes the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin (Ubr) family and arginyltransferase 1 (Ate1), suggesting its role in protein degradation pathways (Jentho2017microRNA125a3p). NTAN1 also interacts with proteins such as MAP2 and TFG, although the effect of NTAN1 overexpression on TFG was not significant in assays (Yoshida2024A). 

In the context of viral infections, NTAN1 is degraded through the proteasome pathway, a process that is independent of ubiquitylation. This degradation affects apoptosis and viral replication, indicating that NTAN1's interactions during viral infection can influence cellular responses (Wang2017A). 

NTAN1's activity is also regulated by microRNA interactions. miR-125a-3p binds to the 3' UTR of the Ntan1 gene, reducing NTAN1 protein levels, which highlights a regulatory interaction at the post-transcriptional level (Jentho2017microRNA125a3p). These interactions underscore NTAN1's role in cellular processes and its involvement in complex regulatory networks.
