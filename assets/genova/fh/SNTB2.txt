# SNTB2

## Overview
SNTB2 is a gene that encodes the syntrophin beta 2 protein, a member of the syntrophin family, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and structural organization. Syntrophin beta 2 is a cytoplasmic peripheral membrane protein that is integral to the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), linking the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane and extracellular matrix. This protein is characterized by its multiple domains, including pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a PDZ domain, and a syntrophin unique (SU) domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins and its involvement in lipid signaling and membrane phospholipid binding (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Adams1995Mouse). Syntrophin beta 2 is implicated in several physiological processes, such as insulin secretion and the regulation of ion channels, and has been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Su2018A).

## Structure
The SNTB2 gene encodes the syntrophin beta 2 protein, which is part of the syntrophin family involved in linking the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane. The protein is composed of 520 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of approximately 56,388.5 Da (Adams1995Mouse). It shares 46% identity with mouse α1-syntrophin and 55% identity with human β1-syntrophin (Adams1995Mouse). 

Syntrophin beta 2 contains several key domains: two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a PDZ domain, and a syntrophin unique (SU) domain (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Adams1995Mouse). The PH domains are involved in lipid signaling and membrane phospholipid binding, while the PDZ domain facilitates protein-protein interactions by recruiting various membrane proteins and ion channels to specific cellular locations (Bhat2012Syntrophin). The SU domain is crucial for binding to dystrophin and other components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), linking syntrophins to the membrane (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

The PDZ domain of syntrophin beta 2 is noted for its unusual features, such as marginal stability under different pH and denaturing conditions, attributed to its charge distribution (Bhat2012Syntrophin). Syntrophin beta 2 is also involved in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

## Function
SNTB2, or syntrophin beta 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling and structural organization. It is a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), which links the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby maintaining cell membrane integrity. SNTB2 is involved in the regulation of insulin granule mobilization in pancreatic β cells, a process crucial for insulin secretion. It interacts with the islet cell auto-antigen 512 (ICA512) to tether insulin granules to the cytoskeleton, restraining their mobility. Upon hyperglycemia, SNTB2 undergoes phosphorylation, leading to the dissociation of ICA512 from the cytoskeleton, which increases granule mobility and promotes insulin secretion (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

SNTB2 also plays a role in cytoskeletal organization and the regulation of channel proteins. It acts as a scaffold, promoting the formation of signaling complexes and stabilizing protein associations with the membrane. The PDZ domain of SNTB2 allows it to interact with various receptor molecules and channel proteins, linking them to the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. This interaction is essential for the proper localization and functioning of channels such as Nav1.5 in cardiac muscle and AQP4 in the brain (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SNTB2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In Burkitt lymphoma (BL), SNTB2 mutations are more frequently observed in HIV and sporadic cases and are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative cases. This suggests a potential role for SNTB2 in the oncogenic processes of BL, particularly in subtypes not linked to EBV (Panea2019The).

In the context of breast cancer, SNTB2 is part of the syntrophin family and is known to be a Cdk5 substrate, which controls the motility of secretory granules. The gene's expression is influenced by the loss of chromosome 16q, which is associated with early tumor initiation events in estrogen receptor-positive invasive breast cancer. This suggests that SNTB2 may serve as a diagnostic or prognostic marker in breast cancer (Hungermann2011Influence).

SNTB2 is also involved in Parkinson's disease (PD), where it is regulated by several miRNAs, including miR-9-5p. The gene is down-regulated in the substantia nigra of PD patients, indicating its potential involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Su2018A). Additionally, SNTB2 has been identified as a prognostic marker in lung adenocarcinoma, where it plays a role in cancer cell radioresistance (Shi2023Clinical).

## Interactions
SNTB2 (syntrophin beta 2) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role in the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). It interacts with dystrophin and utrophin, linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for maintaining muscle integrity and signal transduction (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Kramarcy1994Association). SNTB2 contains a PDZ domain that facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as the islet cell auto-antigen 512 (ICA512), which is involved in insulin granule mobilization in pancreatic β cells (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

SNTB2 also interacts with the α1D-adrenergic receptor (ADRA1D) through a C-terminal PDZ ligand interaction, which is essential for receptor plasma membrane localization and G-protein coupling (Camp2015Individual). This interaction is part of a larger complex that includes other syntrophins and the protein SCRIB, although SCRIB and syntrophins do not directly interact with each other (Camp2015Individual). These interactions highlight the role of SNTB2 in organizing molecular architectures and anchoring proteins at specific membrane sites, thereby playing a crucial role in signal transduction (Bhat2012Syntrophin).
