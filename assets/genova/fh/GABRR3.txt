# GABRR3

## Overview
The GABRR3 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor subunit rho3, which is a component of the GABA C receptor family. These receptors are categorized as ligand-gated ion channels and play a pivotal role in inhibitory neurotransmission within the central nervous system. The rho3 subunit contributes to the formation of GABA C receptors, which are distinct from GABA A and GABA B receptors due to their unique pharmacological properties, such as insensitivity to bicuculline and baclofen (Zhang2001Structure). The GABA C receptors, including those containing the rho3 subunit, are predominantly expressed in the retina, where they are integral to retinal signal processing and synaptic transmission modulation (Zhang2001Structure). The structural characteristics of the rho3 subunit, including its membrane-spanning regions and potential for post-translational modifications, are crucial for its function and interaction with other cellular components (Chebib2000GABAActivated; Zhang2001Structure).

## Structure
The GABRR3 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit rho3, which is part of the GABA C receptor family. These receptors are ligand-gated ion channels involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. The primary structure of the rho3 subunit includes amino acid sequences that form four membrane-spanning regions, known as M1 to M4, which are characteristic of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily (Zhang2001Structure). The secondary structure of these regions likely includes alpha-helices, which are common in transmembrane domains (Chebib2000GABAActivated).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices, contributing to the receptor's functional conformation. The quaternary structure of GABA C receptors, including those containing the rho3 subunit, is typically homomeric, meaning they are composed of identical subunits, although there is evidence suggesting potential co-assembly with other subunits, such as GABA A γ2-subunits (Zhang2001Structure). The intracellular loop between the M3 and M4 regions is involved in receptor modulation and interaction with intracellular molecules (Zhang2001Structure). Common post-translational modifications for GABA receptor subunits may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect receptor function and localization.

## Function
The GABRR3 gene encodes the rho3 subunit of the GABA type A receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. This receptor primarily functions by allowing chloride ions to enter neurons, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. The rho3 subunit is part of the GABA C receptors, which are distinct from the more commonly known GABA A and GABA B receptors due to their insensitivity to bicuculline and baclofen (Zhang2001Structure). 

GABA C receptors, including those containing the rho3 subunit, are primarily expressed in the retina, where they play a crucial role in retinal signal processing. They contribute to the modulation of synaptic transmission by providing sustained but slow suppression of calcium responses, which is essential for fine-tuning graded membrane potentials in retinal cells (Zhang2001Structure). The rho3 subunit is specifically expressed in retinal ganglion cells, indicating its specialized function in this region (Zhang2001Structure). 

The molecular determinants of GABA C receptors, including those involving the rho3 subunit, are linked to specific amino acid residues that define their pharmacological properties and functional roles (Zhang2001Structure).
