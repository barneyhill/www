# FOXI3

## Overview
FOXI3 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box I3 protein, a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by a conserved forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain, which is essential for their role in regulating gene expression. The FOXI3 protein is involved in various developmental processes, particularly in the formation of ectodermal organs such as teeth and hair, and plays a crucial role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process important for embryogenesis and wound healing. Mutations in the FOXI3 gene have been linked to developmental disorders, including craniofacial microsomia and congenital aural atresia, as well as dysplastic hair follicles and malformed teeth in canines. Additionally, FOXI3 is implicated in cancer progression, with its expression associated with metastasis in prostate and breast cancers (Mao2023FOXI3; Mukherjee2018A; Singh2018Foxi3).

## Structure
The FOXI3 protein is a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors, characterized by a conserved forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain. This domain is crucial for the protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression (Singh2018Foxi3). The FOXI3 protein contains several key domains, including a C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) located between amino acid residues 350-399, which is essential for transcriptional activation (Singh2018Foxi3). The protein also features a nuclear localization signal (NLS) immediately downstream of the Forkhead DNA binding domain, which is conserved across the FOXI family and is critical for nuclear entry (Mao2023FOXI3; Singh2018Foxi3).

FOXI3 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation, which modulates its activity. Specific serine residues, such as those at positions 99, 103, 258, 266, and 268, are phosphorylated, with some being conserved between mouse and human (Singh2018Foxi3). The protein interacts with the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, particularly the regulatory subunit PPP2R2A, which negatively regulates FOXI3 activity (Singh2018Foxi3). The structure of FOXI3, including its domains and post-translational modifications, plays a significant role in its function as a transcription factor.

## Function
FOXI3 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various developmental processes, particularly in the formation of ectodermal organs such as teeth and hair. It is involved in the regulation of signaling centers during morphogenesis, which are crucial for controlling cell proliferation and determining organ shape. In the context of tooth development, FOXI3 is essential for maintaining the balance between signaling center fate and proliferating bud cells, ensuring proper tooth morphogenesis and growth (Mogollón2022Foxi3).

FOXI3 is also implicated in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process vital for embryogenesis, wound healing, and potentially cancer progression. It is expressed in neural crest cells and plays a role in the development of structures such as the inner ear and pharyngeal arch derivatives. During EMT, FOXI3 functions as a molecular switch, influencing cell differentiation and ionocyte specification, which is important for ion transport and homeostasis (Mukherjee2018A).

Mutations in FOXI3 can lead to developmental abnormalities, such as malformed teeth and dysplastic hair follicles, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal developmental processes (Mukherjee2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FOXI3 gene are associated with craniofacial microsomia (CFM), a developmental disorder characterized by underdevelopment of facial structures, including ear dysplasia and microtia. Approximately 3.1% of CFM cases are linked to FOXI3 variants, with the gene playing a significant role in the condition (Mao2023FOXI3). The inheritance pattern of FOXI3-related CFM can be autosomal dominant with reduced penetrance or autosomal recessive (Mao2023FOXI3). In some cases, mutations in the nuclear localization signal of FOXI3 prevent the protein from entering the nucleus, leading to craniofacial anomalies (Mao2023FOXI3).

In canines, FOXI3 mutations result in dysplastic hair follicles, absence of the pinna, and malformed teeth, indicating its role in hair and dental development (Mukherjee2018A). In humans, FOXI3 mutations are also linked to congenital aural atresia, a condition involving malformation of the outer ear (Mukherjee2018A).

FOXI3 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in prostate and breast cancer metastasis. High expression levels of FOXI3 signature genes are observed in bone, lung, and lymph node metastases, suggesting a role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis (Mukherjee2018A).

## Interactions
FOXI3 interacts with components of the Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, which plays a significant role in modulating its activity. Specifically, FOXI3 has been shown to interact with various subunits of the PP2A holoenzyme, including the catalytic C subunit (PPP2CA or PPP2CB), the scaffold A subunit (PPP2R1A or PPP2R1B), and regulatory B subunits such as PPP2R2A and PPP2R2D. Among these, FOXI3 exhibits a strong interaction with the regulatory subunit PPP2R2A. This interaction negatively regulates FOXI3 activity, as co-expression of PPP2R2A with FOXI3 reduces FOXI3-mediated transcriptional activation, while knockdown of PPP2R2A enhances it (Singh2018Foxi3).

FOXI3 also binds directly to DNA in a sequence-specific manner, particularly to the AE4 promoter, involving consensus Forkhead binding motifs ((T/C)AAACA). Mutations in these motifs lead to decreased transcriptional activity, indicating the importance of these sequences for FOXI3's function (Singh2018Foxi3). The nuclear localization sequence (NLS) within FOXI3 is essential for its nuclear entry and subsequent transcriptional activity (Singh2018Foxi3).
