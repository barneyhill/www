# KRBA1

## Overview
KRBA1 is a gene that encodes the protein KRAB-A domain containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of a KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain. This domain is typically involved in transcriptional repression, suggesting that the protein may play a role in regulating gene expression. The KRBA1 protein has been implicated in various cellular processes, including endocytosis and trafficking, particularly through its interaction with proteins such as PAT1a. This interaction suggests a potential role in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases (Eggert2020The). Additionally, KRBA1 has been associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions, as well as cancer, indicating its broader significance in human health and disease (Alberry2020Hippocampal; Alexander2016Familial; Yan2021Identifying). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the functional roles and clinical implications of KRBA1.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KRBA1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In familial early-onset dementia, KRBA1 was identified as one of the genes carrying novel stop-gain mutations in affected individuals, suggesting its potential role in the disease's complex genetic background. This condition is characterized by early-onset dementia with a predominant tauopathy and TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa proteinopathy, but without amyloid-beta deposits (Alexander2016Familial).

In cancer, KRBA1 has been associated with poor prognosis in bladder cancer (BLCA) when linked to a higher Immune Cell Infiltration (ICI) score, classifying it as a 'negative dark gene' in this context (Yan2021Identifying). Additionally, KRBA1 is part of an autophagy-related network in cancer, with its overexpression characterizing certain tumor clusters. This suggests a role in cancer-related pathways, although the specific impact of KRBA1 mutations or expression alterations in cancer remains under investigation (Murillo2023Insights).

These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of KRBA1 in neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, although further research is needed to fully understand its role and implications.

## Interactions
KRBA1, a protein containing a KRAB domain, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been identified as a novel interaction partner of the protein PAT1a. This interaction was discovered through a yeast two-hybrid screen and further validated using GST pulldown analyses, which demonstrated that PAT1a binds specifically to GST-fusion proteins of KRBA1. This suggests that KRBA1 may play a role in the endocytosis and trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by interacting with PAT1a (Eggert2020The).

In the context of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, KRBA1's expression levels have been studied in a mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Although specific interactions involving KRBA1 were not detailed, its inclusion in gene modules associated with anxiety-like behavior and experimental treatment outcomes suggests potential involvement in related pathways (Alberry2020Hippocampal).

These interactions highlight KRBA1's potential role in transcriptional repression and cellular signaling, possibly through its KRAB domain, which is known to recruit histone-modifying enzymes to silence gene expression. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the range and implications of KRBA1's interactions.
