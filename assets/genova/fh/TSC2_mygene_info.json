is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes the growth inhibitory protein tuberin. Tuberin interacts with hamartin to form the TSC protein complex which functions in the control of cell growth. This TSC protein complex negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling which is a major regulator of anabolic cell growth. Mutations in this gene have been associated with tuberous sclerosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
