# CRIPTO

## Overview
CRIPTO, also known as TDGF1, is a gene that encodes the cripto protein, a member of the epidermal growth factor-Cripto/FRL-1/Cryptic (EGF-CFC) family. The cripto protein is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in embryonic development and cellular signaling. It functions as a co-receptor in various signaling pathways, including those involving transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) ligands, and is involved in processes such as stem cell differentiation, tissue growth, and remodeling. Cripto is characterized by its EGF-like and cysteine-rich CFC domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and receptors. While its expression is typically low in adult tissues, cripto is notably overexpressed in several cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenesis and therapy resistance (Wechselberger2005Human; Gray2006Cripto; Rodrigues2020A).

## Structure
The CRIPTO protein, a member of the EGF-CFC family, is characterized by its epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain and a cysteine-rich Cripto-FRL1-Cryptic (CFC) domain. The EGF-like domain of CRIPTO is predicted to adopt a 1-3, 2-4, 5-6 disulfide bond pattern, similar to classical EGF domains, contributing to its compact tertiary structure (Lohmeyer1997Chemical). The CFC domain features a unique disulfide pattern (C1-C4, C2-C6, C3-C5) and is structurally homologous to the von Willebrand factor type C-like domain (Marasco2006Chemical). 

CRIPTO is a glycoprotein, with glycosylation at asparagine 79 being crucial for its function, as deglycosylation results in a loss of binding ability (Aykul2017Biochemical). The protein is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety, which is a common post-translational modification for membrane proteins (Minchiotti2000Membrane-anchorage). 

The CRIPTO protein does not have a classical transmembrane domain, distinguishing it from other EGF family members (Lohmeyer1997Chemical). The protein's structure allows it to act as a co-receptor in signaling pathways, with key residues such as His104 and Trp107 in the CFC domain being crucial for receptor binding (Calvanese2006Solution).

## Function
CRIPTO, also known as TDGF1, is a multifunctional signaling protein that plays a significant role in embryonic development and cellular processes. It functions as both a soluble factor and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein, primarily active during developmental stages (Gray2006Cripto; Rodrigues2020A). In healthy human cells, CRIPTO is involved in regulating stem cell differentiation, embryonal development, and tissue growth and remodeling (Rodrigues2020A).

CRIPTO acts as a co-receptor for transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) ligands such as Nodal, GDF1, and GDF3, facilitating the formation of complexes that lead to the phosphorylation of Smad proteins, which are crucial for gene transcription regulation (Rodrigues2020A). It can modulate the TGF-β pathway by both activating and inhibiting it, depending on the context (Rodrigues2020A). The protein is also involved in the Nodal-ALK4-independent pathway, where it binds to glypican-1 and activates the tyrosine kinase c-Src, leading to the activation of downstream MAP kinase and AKT kinase pathways (Sun2008CRIPTO3).

CRIPTO's expression is generally low in adult tissues, except in specific areas like the mammary gland, where it may influence ductal epithelial cell differentiation (Sun2008CRIPTO3). Its role in maintaining the stem cell phenotype and enhancing mammary gland reconstitution capacity highlights its importance in cell biology and organismal development (Rodrigues2020A).

## Clinical Significance
CRIPTO, also known as TDGF1, is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell signaling pathways that promote tumorigenesis. It is overexpressed in numerous human carcinomas, including breast, colon, lung, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its high expression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor phenotypes (Karkampouna2018CRIPTO; Wechselberger2005Human). In breast cancer, CRIPTO overexpression is linked to high histological grade and poor clinical outcomes (Rangel2012Role). 

CRIPTO's involvement in cancer is partly due to its ability to modulate key signaling pathways such as TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin, and MAPK/ERK, which are crucial for processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell proliferation, and migration (Ruggiero2015Genetic; Gray2012CriptoGRP78). It acts as a co-receptor for TGF-β family ligands, enhancing oncogenic signaling while inhibiting tumor suppressor pathways (Gray2012CriptoGRP78). 

CRIPTO also contributes to resistance against certain cancer therapies. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations, CRIPTO1 expression induces resistance to EGFR inhibitors like erlotinib and gefitinib, suggesting a potential target for overcoming drug resistance (Park2014CRIPTO1). In HCC, CRIPTO expression is associated with resistance to sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, indicating that targeting CRIPTO pathways could enhance treatment efficacy (Karkampouna2018CRIPTO).

## Interactions
CRIPTO, a member of the EGF-CFC family, engages in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It forms a complex with the cell surface protein GRP78, a member of the HSP70 family, which is essential for its signaling functions. This interaction is crucial for CRIPTO's role in promoting cellular proliferation, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumors. Disruption of the CRIPTO/GRP78 complex inhibits CRIPTO's ability to activate the MAPK/PI3K pathways and modulate signaling of activin-A, activin-B, Nodal, and TGF-β1 (Shani2008GRP78; Kelber2009Blockade).

CRIPTO also acts as a co-receptor for Nodal, GDF1, and GDF3, interacting with activin signaling receptors. It binds to the EGF-like domain of Nodal and the CFC domain binds the activin/Nodal type I receptor ALK4, both necessary for Nodal signaling. These interactions are crucial for processes such as mesoderm and endoderm formation and cardiogenesis (Gray2012CriptoGRP78).

CRIPTO's interaction with GRP78 at the cell surface forms a complex that inhibits TGF-β signaling and enhances cell growth. The CFC domain of CRIPTO is necessary for binding GRP78, suggesting that CRIPTO may simultaneously bind TGF-β via its EGF-like domain and GRP78 via its CFC domain (Shani2008GRP78).
