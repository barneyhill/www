# SF3B3

## Overview
SF3B3 is a gene that encodes the protein splicing factor 3b subunit 3, a critical component of the spliceosome, which is involved in the pre-mRNA splicing process. The SF3B3 protein is part of the SF3b complex and plays a significant role in spliceosome assembly and function. It is characterized by three seven-bladed β-propeller domains, which are essential for its structural integrity and interaction with other spliceosomal components (Yazhini2021Rewards). As a splicing factor, SF3B3 is involved in recognizing and binding to pre-mRNA splice sites, facilitating the precise removal of introns and joining of exons (Teng2017Splicing). The gene's expression and regulation are implicated in various cancers, where it influences alternative splicing and signaling pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Xu2024SF3B3regulated; Chen2016Alternative).

## Structure
The SF3B3 protein, also known as splicing factor 3b subunit 3, is a component of the SF3b complex involved in spliceosome assembly. It features three intertwined seven-bladed β-propeller domains, designated as BPA, BPB, and BPC, which are crucial for its structural configuration and function (Yazhini2021Rewards). These domains require specific twists to align with their equivalents in the yeast Rse1 protein, indicating a degree of structural variability between species (Yazhini2021Rewards). The SF3B3 protein is located on the surface of the SF3b complex, which has a heart-shaped structure, with SF3b1, SF3b14b, and SF3b5 forming the core (Yazhini2021Rewards).

The structural differences between SF3B3 and its yeast homologue Rse1 are inherent and observed across various stages of spliceosome assembly. These differences include deviations in the positions and orientations of the BPA, BPB, and BPC domains, as well as variations in secondary structural conformation due to sequence insertions or deletions (Yazhini2021Rewards). Notably, Rse1 has a 15-residue insertion that affects the positioning of a helix compared to SF3B3, influencing the size of the V-cleft cavity at the junction of the BPA and BPC domains (Yazhini2021Rewards). These structural variations impact the protein's interactions with other components of the spliceosome, such as SF3b5 and SF3b1, and may influence spliceosome activation mechanisms (Yazhini2021Rewards).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
SF3B3 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SF3B3 is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and treatment resistance. Its knockdown reduces tumor growth and increases sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Xu2024SF3B3regulated). SF3B3 regulates mTOR alternative splicing, affecting CRC progression and metastasis by influencing pathways like lipogenesis and apoptosis (Xu2024SF3B3regulated).

In renal cancer, SF3B3 is upregulated and associated with poor clinical outcomes. It regulates the alternative splicing of EZH2, promoting tumorigenic potential. Knockdown of SF3B3 in renal cancer cells decreases cell viability and inhibits tumor growth, highlighting its role as a pro-oncogene (Chen2016Alternative).

While SF3B3 mutations are rare, its expression and splicing regulation are crucial in cancer progression. The gene's involvement in alternative splicing and its impact on various signaling pathways underscore its clinical significance as a potential target for cancer therapy (Xu2024SF3B3regulated; Chen2016Alternative).

## Interactions
SF3B3 is a component of the SF3b complex within the spliceosome, which is crucial for pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with several other proteins, including SF3B1, SF3B14b, and PHF5A, forming part of the U2 snRNP complex. SF3B3 can associate with SF3B1 to form a protein complex even in the absence of other SF3b proteins, indicating a strong interaction between these two components (Yazhini2022Sequence). 

Within the spliceosome, SF3B3 forms a heterodimer with SF3B5 and is involved in bridging the PHF5A subunit within the SF3B1 torus. This interaction is essential for the structural integrity and function of the spliceosome (Maji2019Structures). SF3B3 is positioned along the top face of the SF3B1-PHF5A complex, forming contacts with both SF3B1 and PHF5A, which suggests a role in shielding reactive groups during splicing (Teng2017Splicing).

SF3B3 also participates in interactions with RNA, playing a role in recognizing and binding to pre-mRNA splice sites. This RNA binding function is facilitated by its position within the SF3b complex, which allows it to interact with the phosphodiester backbone of intronic RNA (Teng2017Splicing; Yazhini2022Sequence).
