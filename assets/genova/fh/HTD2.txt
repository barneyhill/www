# HTD2

## Overview
The HTD2 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxyacyl-thioester dehydratase type 2, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) pathway. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP to trans-2-Enoyl-ACP, a key step in the elongation of fatty acyl chains within mitochondria. The protein plays a significant role in the production of octanoyl-ACP, a precursor for lipoic acid synthesis, which is essential for the function of several mitochondrial multienzyme complexes involved in energy metabolism (Zeng2021Htd2). HTD2's activity is vital for maintaining mitochondrial health and metabolic activity, particularly in adipocytes, and its dysfunction has been linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (Zeng2021Htd2).

## Function
The HTD2 gene encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase, which is a key component of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) pathway. This pathway is distinct from the cytoplasmic fatty acid synthesis pathway and involves the elongation of fatty acyl chains on a soluble acyl carrier protein (ACP) scaffold. HTD2 specifically catalyzes the conversion of 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP to trans-2-Enoyl-ACP, a crucial step preceding the action of MECR in the mtFAS pathway (Zeng2021Htd2).

In healthy cells, HTD2 is essential for the production of octanoyl-ACP, a precursor for lipoic acid synthesis in mitochondria. Lipoic acid is an essential cofactor for several mitochondrial multienzyme complexes, such as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which are vital for energy metabolism (Zeng2021Htd2). The enzyme's activity supports mitochondrial function and energy metabolism by facilitating lipoic acid production, which is necessary for the proper functioning of these enzyme complexes (Zeng2021Htd2).

HTD2 is active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to maintaining mitochondrial health and metabolic activity, particularly in adipocytes. Its role in the mtFAS pathway is crucial for sustaining mitochondrial function and redox balance (Zeng2021Htd2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the HTD2 gene, which encodes the enzyme hydroxyacyl-thioester dehydratase type 2, have been linked to several metabolic disorders. In conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, HTD2 expression is notably decreased in adipocytes, particularly in white adipose tissue (WAT) (Zeng2021Htd2). This downregulation is associated with a reduction in the production of α-lipoic acid, a crucial cofactor for mitochondrial enzymes, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance (Zeng2021Htd2).

The deficiency of HTD2 results in impaired mitochondrial function, characterized by decreased activity of mitochondrial complex I and increased oxidative stress, which are linked to insulin resistance in adipocytes (Zeng2021Htd2). This dysfunction is further evidenced by reduced lipoylation of mitochondrial enzymes such as PDH and OGDH, affecting their interaction with mitochondrial complex I and contributing to oxidative stress (Zeng2021Htd2). The study suggests that lipoic acid supplementation can ameliorate these effects, restoring mitochondrial function and improving insulin sensitivity (Zeng2021Htd2). These findings indicate that HTD2 plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and that its deficiency may contribute to the development of metabolic disorders.
