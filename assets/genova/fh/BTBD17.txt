# BTBD17

## Overview
BTBD17 is a gene that encodes the protein BTB domain containing 17, which is part of the BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-Ã -brac) domain-containing protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a BTB domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and often functions as a scaffold for the assembly of multi-protein complexes. The BTBD17 protein plays a role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and signal transduction, by interacting with other proteins to modulate their activity. Although the specific biological functions of BTBD17 are still being elucidated, its involvement in critical pathways suggests it may have significant implications in cellular homeostasis and disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
