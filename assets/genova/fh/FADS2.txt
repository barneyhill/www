# FADS2

## Overview
The FADS2 gene encodes the enzyme fatty acid desaturase 2, a critical component in the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in humans. This enzyme, categorized as a desaturase, is primarily involved in the desaturation process, introducing double bonds into fatty acid chains, which is essential for the conversion of essential fatty acids into longer-chain PUFAs. These longer-chain PUFAs are vital for numerous physiological functions, including the production of eicosanoids, which are signaling molecules that play roles in inflammation and immune responses (Sibbons2018Polyunsaturated). FADS2 is a membrane-bound protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, characterized by a cytochrome b5-like domain and histidine-rich regions that facilitate its enzymatic activity (Bláhová2020Assessment). Genetic variations in FADS2 can significantly impact PUFA levels in the body, influencing health outcomes related to inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders (Reynolds2018Tissue-specific).

## Structure
The FADS2 protein is a modular enzyme characterized by a cytochrome b5-like domain at the N-terminus and a main desaturation domain with three histidine-rich regions at the C-terminus (Bláhová2020Assessment). The cytochrome b5-like domain is crucial for electron transfer, allowing NADH cytochrome b5 reductase to transfer electrons directly to the catalytic site of FADS2, which is essential for the ∆6 desaturation process (Bláhová2020Assessment). 

FADS2 is a hydrophobic, membrane-bound protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, which complicates its characterization using conventional biochemical methods (Bláhová2020Assessment). The protein contains three His-boxes that coordinate two iron atoms in the active site, and these histidine residues are evolutionarily conserved (Bláhová2020Assessment). The His-boxes are consistently positioned relative to the hydrophobic domains that span the membrane bilayer (Bláhová2020Assessment).

The three-dimensional structure of FADS2 has not been determined by X-ray crystallography, and the only known animal desaturase structure is that of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase with ∆9 desaturation activity (Bláhová2020Assessment). Single amino acid changes in FADS2 can significantly alter substrate specificity, indicating that even minor changes in its primary structure can have substantial functional consequences (Bláhová2020Assessment).

## Function
The FADS2 gene encodes an enzyme known as delta-6 desaturase, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in human cells. This enzyme is involved in the desaturation process, specifically catalyzing the insertion of a double bond at the Δ6 position of α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), a rate-limiting step in converting essential fatty acids to longer-chain n-3 PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Sibbons2018Polyunsaturated). FADS2 also exhibits Δ8 and Δ4 desaturase activities, which are important for the conversion of shorter-chain PUFAs to longer-chain PUFAs, essential for producing eicosanoids, signaling molecules involved in cell proliferation and immune responses (Sibbons2018Polyunsaturated).

The enzyme is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest levels found in the liver, and significant amounts in the brain, heart, and lung (Schaeffer2006Common). FADS2 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it contributes to the regulation of cell membrane fluidity and signaling pathways, impacting inflammation regulation and other physiological processes (Sibbons2018Polyunsaturated). Genetic variations in FADS2 can influence the levels of PUFAs in the body, affecting health outcomes related to inflammation and cardiovascular diseases (Reynolds2018Tissue-specific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FADS2 gene are associated with a variety of diseases and conditions. Variants in FADS2 have been linked to metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic stroke, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs174575 are associated with higher plasma cholesterol, LDL-C, and TAG levels in diabetics (Žák2022FADS). FADS2 polymorphisms also influence the risk of atopic diseases, including eczema and allergic rhinitis, due to their impact on polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism (Lattka2009&lt; FADS&lt; i&gt).

Altered FADS2 activity is implicated in cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory conditions. The gene's variants are associated with changes in fatty acid composition, which can affect inflammatory processes and contribute to conditions like coronary artery disease (Martinelli2008FADS). FADS2 is also linked to cognitive and mental health outcomes, with certain polymorphisms potentially influencing the risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) by affecting neuroinflammation and synaptic function (Sun2018FADS1FADS2). These genetic variations highlight the clinical significance of FADS2 in various health conditions.

## Interactions
The FADS2 protein, a fatty acid desaturase, is involved in several critical interactions necessary for its function in fatty acid metabolism. It features a cytochrome b5-like domain at the N-terminus, which is essential for electron transfer during the desaturation process. This domain allows NADH cytochrome b5 reductase to transfer electrons directly to the catalytic site of FADS2. However, the cytochrome b5-like domain of FADS2 and microsomal cytochrome b5 are both required for the ∆6 desaturation process, indicating that microsomal cytochrome b5 cannot substitute for the cytochrome b5-like domain's role. Protein-protein interactions between FADS2 and microsomal cytochrome b5 are crucial for the proper function of FADS2 (Bláhová2020Assessment).

The enzyme's activity is also influenced by substrate availability, as it competes with other enzymes like stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) for substrates such as palmitic acid. In the absence of SCD activity, FADS2 can catalyze the conversion of palmitic acid to sapienic acid, highlighting its interaction with other enzymes in the lipid metabolism pathway (Park2016Palmitic). These interactions underscore the complex regulatory networks involving FADS2 and its role in lipid metabolism.
