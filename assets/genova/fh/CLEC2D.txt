# CLEC2D

## Overview
CLEC2D is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain family 2 member D, also known as lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT1). LLT1 is a member of the C-type lectin superfamily and functions primarily as a transmembrane receptor involved in immune regulation. It is expressed on activated lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and B cells, as well as antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. LLT1 serves as a ligand for the inhibitory receptor NKR-P1A (CD161) on NK cells, modulating immune responses by inhibiting NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and contributing to immune self-tolerance (Mathew2016Overexpression; Buller2020Roles). The protein's expression is inducible by various stimuli, including viral infections and mitogens, and it plays a significant role in immune cell signaling and bone metabolism (Kirkham2014Complexity; Rosen2005Cutting). LLT1's interactions and regulatory functions make it a critical component in the immune system, with implications in cancer immune evasion and potential therapeutic targeting (Mathew2016Overexpression; Powers2023Differential).

## Function
The CLEC2D gene encodes the protein lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT1), which is a member of the C-type lectin superfamily. LLT1 is primarily expressed on activated lymphocytes, including NK cells, T cells, B cells, and antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (Mathew2016Overexpression). It functions as a ligand for the inhibitory receptor NKR-P1A (CD161) on NK cells, leading to the inhibition of NK cell-mediated cytotoxic responses, which contributes to NK cell self-tolerance (Mathew2016Overexpression; Buller2020Roles). This interaction is specific and can be blocked by anti-NKR-P1A monoclonal antibodies (Rosen2005Cutting).

LLT1 expression is inducible in various immune cells upon activation by stimuli such as mitogens, viral infections, and TLR agonists (Kirkham2014Complexity). In healthy human cells, LLT1 is typically retained intracellularly with minimal surface expression, as observed in normal prostate cells (Mathew2016Overexpression). The protein is involved in immune regulation and has been implicated in bone metabolism by blocking osteoclast differentiation (Rosen2005Cutting). LLT1's role in immune cell signaling is significant, particularly in the context of NK cell function, and it is part of a larger family of C-type lectin-like receptors involved in various immune responses (Kirkham2014Complexity).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLEC2D gene, which encodes the protein LLT1, have been implicated in various cancers. In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), LLT1 is overexpressed, particularly on monocytes and NK cells, which may help cancer cells evade NK-cell immunosurveillance by interacting with the NK-cell inhibitory receptor NKRP1A (CD161) (Powers2023Differential). This interaction is also observed in prostate cancer, where LLT1 overexpression inhibits NK cell-mediated killing, contributing to immune evasion (Mathew2016Overexpression). In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), high CLEC2D expression is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis, serving as a negative predictor for overall survival (Chen2023Identification).

LLT1 expression is also noted in gliomas, where it increases with malignancy grade. Downregulation of LLT1 enhances NK cell lysis of glioma cells, suggesting its role in immune evasion (Roth2007Malignant). In non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and other cancers, LLT1 expression similarly inhibits NK cell functions, contributing to tumor immune escape (Braud2022LLT1CD161). These findings highlight the potential of targeting the LLT1-NKRP1A interaction as a therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
CLEC2D, also known as LLT1, is involved in several protein interactions that play a significant role in immune regulation. It forms homodimers and heterodimers with Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which are crucial for its function in negatively regulating IRF5-mediated antifungal immunity. These interactions enhance the binding affinity to fungal β-glucans, compared to TLR2 homodimers, and lead to the ubiquitination and degradation of MyD88, inhibiting IRF5 activation and subsequent IL-12 production (Li2023Ctype).

CLEC2D does not interact with Dectin-1 but directly interacts with TLR2, both in the presence and absence of heat-activated Candida albicans yeast containing β-glucans. This interaction is dependent on the extracellular domains of CLEC2D and TLR2, as deletion of these domains impairs their association (Li2023Ctype). The interaction between CLEC2D and TLR2 is enhanced in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells after stimulation with β-glucans (Li2023Ctype).

CLEC2D also interacts with the NK cell inhibitory receptor NKRP1A (CD161), inhibiting NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This interaction is a mechanism by which tumor cells, such as prostate cancer cells, evade immune surveillance (Mathew2016Overexpression).
