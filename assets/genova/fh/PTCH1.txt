# PTCH1

## Overview
The PTCH1 gene encodes the protein patched 1, a crucial component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is vital for embryonic development and cell differentiation. Patched 1 is a transmembrane receptor that functions primarily as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) protein, thereby regulating the expression of downstream target genes (Kogerman2002Alternative; Martinez2019Nevoid). Structurally, the protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane helices and two large extracellular domains, which facilitate its interaction with the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) ligand (Kowatsch2019Structures). The PTCH1 gene's role in maintaining normal cell growth and differentiation is underscored by its involvement in receptor-mediated endocytosis and negative feedback loops that modulate Hh pathway activity (Incardona2000Receptormediated; Rahnama2006Inhibition). Mutations in PTCH1 are linked to several clinical conditions, most notably Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), highlighting its significance in both developmental processes and disease pathogenesis (Lo2008Nevoid; Onodera2020Gorlin).

## Structure
The PTCH1 protein is a transmembrane receptor involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. It is composed of 12 transmembrane helices, organized into two RND domains, which likely originated from an internal gene duplication (Kowatsch2019Structures). The transmembrane segments 2–6 form a sterol-sensing domain (SSD), which is crucial for cholesterol metabolism and signaling (Qi2018Structures). PTCH1 also features two large extracellular domains (ECD1 and ECD2) that are involved in binding the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) ligand (Kowatsch2019Structures).

The protein exhibits pseudo-symmetry across its transmembrane domains and has a topology similar to the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) (Qi2018Structures). The ECDs undergo significant shifts upon binding with ShhN, increasing the interface between ECD1 and ECD2, which stabilizes certain segments of the protein (Gong2018Structural). The interaction between PTCH1 and Shh involves both protein-protein and lipid-based interfaces, with the palmitoylated N-terminus of Shh fitting into a space between the ECDs (Kowatsch2019Structures).

PTCH1 can undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which are important for its function (Qi2019Structural). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in regulating the Hh signaling pathway and its involvement in diseases like cancer and developmental defects (Qi2018Structures).

## Function
The PTCH1 gene encodes a receptor protein that plays a critical role in the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, which is essential for embryonic development and cell differentiation. In healthy human cells, PTCH1 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) protein, thereby preventing the activation of downstream target genes by GLI transcription factors (Kogerman2002Alternative; Martinez2019Nevoid). This inhibition is crucial for maintaining normal cell growth and differentiation, as it ensures that the HH pathway is activated only when necessary (Martinez2019Nevoid).

PTCH1 is involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) protein, a process that is dynamin-dependent and targets Shh to lysosomes for degradation. This mechanism limits the range of Shh signaling, thereby regulating its effects on cell fate determination in the ventral neural tube (Incardona2000Receptormediated). PTCH1 also participates in a negative feedback loop by repressing the expression of HH target genes, including GLI1 and PTCH1 itself, to maintain a balance between HH and PTCH1 activities (Rahnama2006Inhibition). The protein is primarily active in the cell membrane, influencing processes like tissue patterning and organogenesis (Briggs2008Cooperation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTCH1 gene are primarily associated with Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), also known as Gorlin syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities and a predisposition to various neoplasms, including basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs), and medulloblastomas (Lo2008Nevoid; Onodera2020Gorlin). The PTCH1 gene acts as a tumor suppressor, and its mutations disrupt the Hedgehog signaling pathway, leading to abnormal cell growth and tumor formation (Lo2008Nevoid; Adolphe2006Patched1).

In NBCCS, mutations in PTCH1 often result in protein truncation, contributing to the syndrome's clinical manifestations (Lo2008Nevoid). These mutations include deletions, insertions, splice site alterations, nonsense, and missense mutations, with no specific hot spots identified (Lo2008Nevoid). The two-hit hypothesis is applicable, where both alleles of the PTCH1 gene must be inactivated for tumor development (Lo2008Nevoid; Pál2023WholeExome).

PTCH1 mutations are also linked to other conditions such as osteoporosis due to altered bone metabolism and decreased SPARC expression, affecting bone mineral density (Onodera2020Gorlin). The gene's role in various cancers, including medulloblastoma and skin cancer, underscores its critical function in cellular signaling and disease development (Adolphe2006Patched1; Onodera2020Gorlin).

## Interactions
PTCH1 interacts with the Sonic Hedgehog N-terminal signaling domain (Shh-N) to form a complex that is crucial for Hedgehog signaling. This interaction involves two distinct binding sites on PTCH1, with Shh-N engaging the extracellular domains (ECDs) of PTCH1. The primary interface involves the palmitoylated N-terminal peptide of Shh-N fitting into the space between subdomains of ECD-I and ECD-II of PTCH1, stabilized by van der Waals interactions. A secondary binding site involves α-helices of Shh-N interacting with ECD-I of PTCH1 (Qi2018Structures). 

PTCH1 can form both homomeric and heteromeric complexes with PTCH2, which are important for its function in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. These complexes can exist in active and inactive conformations, with the active state being stabilized by Hedgehog ligand binding (Timmis2023The). PTCH1 also forms a 2:1 complex with Shh-N, where two PTCH1 molecules engage distinct sites on Shh-N, involving a palmitate-dominated interface and a calcium-mediated interface (Qi2018Two).

Mutations in PTCH1 or Shh-N that disrupt these interactions can significantly impair Hedgehog signaling, highlighting the importance of these protein-protein interactions in cellular processes (Qi2018Two).
