# MTUS1

## Overview
MTUS1, or microtubule-associated tumor suppressor 1, is a gene that encodes a family of proteins known as Angiotensin II AT2 Receptor-Interacting Proteins (ATIPs). These proteins, including several isoforms such as ATIP1, ATIP2, ATIP3a, ATIP3b, and ATIP4, are involved in various cellular processes, including microtubule dynamics, cardiovascular regulation, and neural differentiation. The MTUS1-encoded proteins are characterized by their structural domains, which facilitate interactions with microtubules and other cellular components, thereby influencing cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation. Notably, MTUS1 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, with its expression often reduced in several cancer types, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Bozgeyik2017MTUS1; Di2006Structural; Rozario2021In).

## Structure
The MTUS1 gene encodes a family of proteins known as Angiotensin II AT2 Receptor-Interacting Proteins (ATIPs), which include several isoforms such as ATIP1, ATIP2, ATIP3a, ATIP3b, and ATIP4. These isoforms arise from alternative splicing of the 17 exons within the MTUS1 gene, resulting in diverse tissue distributions and subcellular localizations (Di2006Structural). The ATIP proteins share a common C-terminal region that includes four coiled-coil domains, which are involved in dimerization and resemble structural domains found in intermediate filaments, suggesting roles in cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction (Di2006Structural). The amino-terminal regions of these proteins contain distinct motifs, such as mitochondrial targeting signals, leucine zippers, polyproline-rich motifs, nuclear localization signals, and putative transmembrane regions, which contribute to their specific intracellular functions (Di2006Structural).

The MTUS1 protein structure has been modeled using computational tools like I-TASSER and SWISS-MODEL, with validation through various quality estimation programs. These analyses have identified conserved regions and potential damaging non-synonymous SNPs that may affect protein stability and function (Rozario2021In). The MTUS1 gene's expression is often reduced or lost in certain cancers, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor (Di2006Structural).

## Function
The MTUS1 gene encodes a family of proteins known as angiotensin-II type 2 receptor-interacting proteins (ATIPs), which play significant roles in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, MTUS1 is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, as ATIP3 interacts with microtubules and the End binding protein 1 (EB1), affecting microtubule stability and cellular migration (Bozgeyik2017MTUS1). MTUS1 also plays a role in cardiovascular health, being involved in the development and regulation of the cardiovascular system, and is implicated in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy (Bozgeyik2017MTUS1). 

MTUS1 has anti-inflammatory functions, reducing pro-inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress, which are crucial in preventing atherosclerosis (Bozgeyik2017MTUS1). It is also expressed during fetal brain development and is involved in neural differentiation, suggesting a role in brain health (Bozgeyik2017MTUS1). The gene is implicated in vascular remodeling and the regulation of vascular senescence, indicating its importance in maintaining vascular health (Bozgeyik2017MTUS1). 

MTUS1's encoded proteins, particularly ATIP1 and ATIP3, are involved in inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and stabilizing microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Bozgeyik2017MTUS1; Di2006Structural).

## Clinical Significance
The MTUS1 gene, encoding microtubule-associated scaffold protein 1, is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a candidate tumor suppressor. Alterations in MTUS1 expression or mutations are associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several cancer types. In breast cancer, MTUS1 is significantly underexpressed, particularly in high-grade tumors and triple-negative subtypes, correlating with poor prognosis and increased metastasis (RodriguesFerreira20098p22). In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), the S1259L mutation in MTUS1 is linked to the disease, with high MTUS1 levels correlating with shorter survival times (Rozario2021In). In uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), the E960K mutation is associated with the cancer, and reduced MTUS1 expression correlates with decreased survival (Rozario2021In).

MTUS1 is also downregulated in bladder, ovarian, and lung cancers, where its reduced expression is linked to poor outcomes and advanced disease stages (Bozgeyik2017MTUS1). In oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma, MTUS1 downregulation is associated with enhanced proliferation and poor differentiation, indicating its role in cancer progression (Ding2011Down‐regulation). These findings suggest that MTUS1 plays a critical role in cancer development and could serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The MTUS1 gene encodes a family of proteins known as ATIPs, which interact with the angiotensin-II type 2 (AT2) receptor. These interactions are crucial for inhibiting ERK signaling and growth factor-induced autophosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases, thereby reducing cell proliferation (Bozgeyik2017MTUS1; Di2006Structural). ATIP3, a splice variant of MTUS1, interacts with microtubules and the End binding protein 1 (EB1), influencing microtubule dynamics and cellular processes such as mitosis and migration (Bozgeyik2017MTUS1).

MTUS1 proteins also interact with various other proteins, as identified by the STRING database. These include Angiotensin II Receptor Type 2 (AGTR2), CD274 (PDL1), Bradykinin Receptor B2 (BDKRB2), Kinesin Family Member 2C (KIF2C), Aurora kinases (AURKB), and others (Rozario2021In). In endothelial cells, MTUS1 interacts with the p38 MAPK pathway, where its silencing leads to increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and activation of NF-κB transcriptional activity, suggesting a regulatory role in cytokine production and endothelial cell activation (Wang2016MTUS1).

These interactions highlight the diverse roles of MTUS1 in cellular signaling pathways, affecting processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation, and implicating it in various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions.
