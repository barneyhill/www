# MGAT4C

## Overview
MGAT4C is a gene that encodes the enzyme mannosyl (alpha-1,3-)-glycoprotein beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, isozyme C, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is involved in the modification of N-glycans, a critical process in glycoprotein biosynthesis that affects protein folding, stability, and cell signaling. The MGAT4C protein is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to mannose residues, contributing to the structural complexity of N-glycans essential for cellular communication and function (Nagae20203D). Although the specific physiological roles of MGAT4C remain to be fully elucidated, its high expression in the adult brain suggests a potential involvement in neural functions. The gene is relatively conserved, indicating its importance in maintaining essential cellular processes (Jöud2018Identification). MGAT4C has been associated with various clinical contexts, including prostate cancer and low-grade glioma, where its expression may influence disease progression and prognosis (Jöud2018Identification; Zhu2024Machine).

## Function
MGAT4C, also known as mannosyl (alpha-1,3-)-glycoprotein beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, isozyme C, is an enzyme involved in the modification of N-glycans during glycoprotein biosynthesis. It plays a role in the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to mannose residues, which is crucial for protein folding, stability, and cell signaling. This activity is essential for proper cellular communication and function, as it influences the structural complexity of N-glycans, which are important for various physiological processes (Nagae20203D).

MGAT4C is typically active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the complex glycosylation processes necessary for diverse physiological outcomes. Although the specific enzyme activity and physiological function of MGAT4C in healthy human cells remain unclear, it is highly expressed in the adult brain, suggesting a potential role in neural functions (Nagae20203D). The gene is relatively conserved, with low genetic variation, indicating its importance in maintaining essential cellular functions (Jöud2018Identification). Despite its unclear detailed actions, MGAT4C's involvement in N-glycosylation processes suggests it may play a role in the formation of complex glycans, which are critical for cellular interactions and signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
MGAT4C has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although its precise role remains partially understood. Genetic variation in MGAT4C has been associated with prostate cancer, suggesting a potential link between alterations in this gene and cancer progression (Jöud2018Identification). In the context of low-grade glioma (LGG), MGAT4C is part of a prognostic n-glycan biosynthesis signature, where its expression is associated with a favorable prognosis. This indicates that MGAT4C may play a role in promoting N-glycan degradation, which could influence tumor progression and patient outcomes (Zhu2024Machine).

MGAT4C is also highly expressed in the adult brain, although its enzyme activity and physiological function in this tissue are not fully understood. It was cloned from a region commonly deleted in pancreatic cancer, hinting at a possible involvement in this disease, although direct associations with specific conditions remain to be clarified (Nagae20203D; Nagae2022Discovery). Despite these associations, no specific diseases or conditions have been conclusively linked to MGAT4C mutations or expression alterations, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate its clinical significance.
