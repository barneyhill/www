# POLE2

## Overview
POLE2 is a gene that encodes the DNA polymerase epsilon 2, accessory subunit, a crucial component of the DNA polymerase epsilon (Polε) complex. This protein plays a significant role in DNA replication and repair, particularly in the synthesis of the leading DNA strand, thereby ensuring genomic stability and high fidelity during cell division. As an accessory subunit, DNA polymerase epsilon 2 is involved in stabilizing the replication fork and facilitating the interaction with other replication machinery components. The protein is categorized as a part of the DNA polymerase family, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the Polε complex and its association with the CMG helicase complex. Disruptions in the function of POLE2 can lead to replication stress and genomic instability, with implications for various diseases, including cancer (Baranovskiy2017Crystal; Loeb2008DNA; Bellelli2018Polε).

## Structure
The POLE2 gene encodes the B-subunit of human DNA polymerase epsilon, which plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair. The protein structure of POLE2 includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal domain (NTD), a phosphodiesterase-like (PDE) domain, and an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domain. The NTD is connected to the rest of the molecule by a flexible linker, while the PDE and OB domains are tightly associated, forming a stable complex with the catalytic subunit (p261 C) of DNA polymerase epsilon (Baranovskiy2017Crystal).

The PDE domain features a two-layer β-sheet, and the OB domain contains a β-barrel structure. These domains are involved in the interaction with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the catalytic subunit, which includes a three-helix bundle and zinc-binding modules (Zn1 and Zn2) (Baranovskiy2017Crystal). The interaction between the B-subunit and the CTD involves 11 hydrogen bonds and numerous hydrophobic contacts, contributing to a buried surface area of 3094 Å², which is essential for the stability of the complex (Baranovskiy2017Crystal).

The B-subunit acts as a scaffold, mediating interactions with other components of the replication machinery and regulating DNA-synthesizing activity, which is vital for maintaining genome stability (Baranovskiy2017Crystal).

## Function
The POLE2 gene encodes a subunit of the DNA polymerase epsilon (Polε) complex, which is essential for DNA replication and repair in eukaryotic cells. This complex is primarily involved in the synthesis of the leading DNA strand during replication, ensuring high fidelity and genomic stability. POLE2, as part of the Polε complex, plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of the replication fork and is involved in the initiation of DNA replication (Bellelli2018Polε).

POLE2 interacts with the catalytic subunit POLE1, forming a subcomplex that is crucial for the structural integrity of Polε and its association with the CMG helicase complex, which is vital for DNA replication (Vipat2022The; Bellelli2018Polε). This interaction is necessary for the proper recruitment and stabilization of the Polε complex at the replication fork, facilitating efficient DNA synthesis (Vipat2022The).

In healthy human cells, POLE2 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to cell cycle progression and genomic integrity. Its function is critical for proper cell division and organismal development, as disruptions in its activity can lead to replication stress and genomic instability (Loeb2008DNA; Bellelli2018Polε).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the POLE2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. A novel mutation in POLE2 has been associated with combined immunodeficiency, characterized by a severe block in B-cell development and a more severe clinical evolution compared to POLE1 mutations. This mutation results in two aberrant transcripts, leading to significant disruptions in cell cycle progression, as evidenced by altered cell phase distributions in patient fibroblasts. The mutation's impact on DNA replication and repair processes highlights its role in immunodeficiency and potential cancer susceptibility (Frugoni2016A).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), POLE2 is upregulated, correlating with advanced tumor stages, increased risk of lymphatic metastasis, and poor overall survival. Knockdown studies in ESCC cell lines have shown that reducing POLE2 expression inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation, while promoting apoptosis. These findings suggest that POLE2 plays a significant role in ESCC tumorigenesis and could serve as a therapeutic target (Zhu2020POLE2).

In lung adenocarcinoma, POLE2 is highly expressed and contributes to tumor cell survival. Berberine, a natural compound, has been shown to downregulate POLE2 expression, mediated by the transcription factor FOXM1, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for targeting POLE2 in cancer treatment (Ni2022Berberine).

## Interactions
POLE2, the accessory subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in DNA replication and repair. It is known to interact with the catalytic subunit POLE1, forming part of the DNA polymerase epsilon complex, which is essential for DNA synthesis and genomic stability (Frugoni2016A).

In osteosarcoma, POLE2 interacts with CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is mediated through MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which stabilizes CD44 by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation. This stabilization of CD44 by POLE2 promotes tumor progression by enhancing cell proliferation and migration (Wang2024POLE2).

In glioblastoma, POLE2 interacts with Aurora kinase A (AURKA) to stabilize the Forkhead transcription factor FOXM1. This interaction promotes the de-ubiquitination and stabilization of FOXM1, contributing to the malignant phenotype of glioblastoma cells by enhancing cell viability and migration while inhibiting apoptosis (Zhang2022POLE2).

These interactions highlight the role of POLE2 in various cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer progression through its regulatory effects on protein stability and cell cycle progression.
