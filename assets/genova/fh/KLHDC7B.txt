# KLHDC7B

## Overview
KLHDC7B is a gene that encodes the protein kelch domain containing 7B, which is characterized by the presence of a kelch domain. This domain is known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, signal transduction, and protein degradation. The KLHDC7B protein is composed of 594 amino acids and is involved in forming multiprotein complexes that influence cellular dynamics and signaling pathways (Yahiro2021A; Ding2023A). Research has highlighted its potential involvement in cancer biology, where it may act as an oncogene, particularly in breast cancer and other malignancies, due to its role in cell proliferation and apoptosis regulation (Jeong2018A; Beltrán‐Anaya2019Expression). The protein's interactions and expression patterns suggest it could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in oncology (Ding2023A).

## Structure
The KLHDC7B protein is characterized by the presence of a Kelch domain in its C-terminal half, which is a common motif forming a four-stranded anti-parallel β-propeller structure. This domain typically consists of 5-7 repeating motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Mart�nPardillos2019Characterization; Ding2023A; Jeong2018A). The protein is composed of 594 amino acids (Mart�nPardillos2019Characterization; Ding2023A; Yahiro2021A). 

The Kelch domain is integral to the protein's function, facilitating interactions with various other proteins and participating in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal arrangement, protein degradation, and gene expression (Yahiro2021A; Ding2023A). Although specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided, the Kelch domain's β-propeller structure suggests a stable and versatile framework for binding interactions (Jeong2018A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the protein's function, although specific modifications for KLHDC7B are not detailed in the available context. The protein's role in cellular processes and its structural features suggest its involvement in complex signaling pathways and cellular dynamics (Jeong2018A).

## Function
KLHDC7B (kelch domain containing 7B) encodes a protein that is implicated in various cellular processes, primarily through its involvement in protein-protein interactions. Proteins with kelch domains, such as KLHDC7B, are known to contribute to cellular organization, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal functions. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function, although the specific molecular activities and pathways of KLHDC7B are still under investigation. The protein's role in cell biology is thought to be significant in maintaining the integrity and organization of the cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell shape, division, and intracellular transport. While the precise cellular locations where KLHDC7B is active are not fully detailed, its involvement in cytoskeletal functions suggests it may be localized to areas of the cell where structural organization is critical. Understanding the exact mechanisms and pathways involving KLHDC7B remains an area of active research, with potential implications for understanding its role in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
KLHDC7B has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and genetic mutations. In breast cancer, KLHDC7B is hypermethylated at its promoter yet upregulated, suggesting an oncogenic role. Its upregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, indicating its potential as an oncogene in breast cancer (Mart�nPardillos2019Characterization; Jeong2018A). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), particularly the immunomodulatory subtype, KLHDC7B and its associated long non-coding RNA, LncKLHDC7B, are overexpressed. This overexpression is linked to increased cell migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Beltrán‐Anaya2019Expression).

KLHDC7B is also associated with genetic alterations in other cancers, such as ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, where it frequently undergoes 'Deep Deletion'. Missense mutations like R502W have been identified in brain lower grade glioma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma, leading to protein truncation and poorer prognosis (Ding2023A). Additionally, KLHDC7B expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and is associated with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, indicating its involvement in immune-related pathways and cancer progression (Ding2023A). These findings highlight KLHDC7B's potential as a prognostic marker and target for cancer therapy.

## Interactions
KLHDC7B, a protein encoded by the KLHDC7B gene, is involved in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its kelch domains. These domains facilitate the formation of multiprotein complexes, influencing cellular processes. In cancer research, KLHDC7B has been shown to interact with 50 experimentally verified proteins, as identified through enrichment analysis and visualized in a protein-protein interaction network (Ding2023A). This network suggests that KLHDC7B may play a role in immune response and viral infection pathways.

In the context of apoptosis, KLHDC7B is implicated in the regulation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Harakiri (HRK). The expression of HRK is upregulated in cells treated with subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB), but this effect is not observed in KLHDC7B-knockdown cells, indicating that KLHDC7B regulates HRK expression during ER stress-induced apoptosis (Yahiro2021A). KLHDC7B is also involved in the PERK/ATF4/CHOP/CEBPB signaling pathway, which regulates its expression during ER stress (Yahiro2021A).

In cervical cancer, KLHDC7B interacts with Kelch-containing proteins via its C-terminal Kelch domain, and its expression is enhanced by the lnc-EBIC, which is promoted by HPV16/18 E7 protein (Wang2021HPV). These interactions suggest a role for KLHDC7B in tumorigenesis and as a potential therapeutic target.
