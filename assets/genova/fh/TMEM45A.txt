# TMEM45A

## Overview
TMEM45A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 45A, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is predominantly expressed in keratinocytes, the main cell type in the epidermis, and is implicated in processes related to keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal physiology (Hayez2016TMEM45A). While TMEM45A is not essential for epidermal morphogenesis or barrier formation, it is involved in cellular processes such as protein trafficking and secretion, primarily localized in the trans-Golgi network (Hayez2016TMEM45A). Beyond its role in normal cellular function, TMEM45A is associated with various pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where it influences cell proliferation, differentiation, and chemoresistance through interactions with signaling pathways like NFκB and TGF-β (GUO2015Inhibition; Zhang2020Transmembrane). Its involvement in DNA damage repair further underscores its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Schmit2019Characterization).

## Function
TMEM45A is a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis, suggesting a role in normal epidermal physiology and keratinization (Hayez2016TMEM45A). It is primarily located in the trans-Golgi network within keratinocytes and is not found in lysosomes or lamellar bodies, indicating its involvement in cellular processes related to protein trafficking and secretion (Hayez2016TMEM45A). Despite its high expression in keratinocytes, studies using TMEM45A knockout mice have shown that the protein is dispensable for epidermal morphogenesis, keratinization, and barrier formation, as these mice exhibit normal epidermal morphology and histopathology (Hayez2016TMEM45A).

TMEM45A expression increases from the basal to the apical layers of the epidermis, which aligns with its potential role in keratinocyte differentiation (Gerber2013Systematic). Immunohistochemical analyses have shown that TMEM45A is expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, supporting its involvement in the later stages of keratinocyte differentiation (Hayez2016TMEM45A). Despite these findings, the precise molecular and cellular functions of TMEM45A in healthy human cells remain largely unknown (Hayez2016TMEM45A).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM45A is implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers. In ovarian cancer, TMEM45A is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its silencing leads to reduced cell proliferation, increased cell cycle arrest, and decreased cell adhesion and invasion. This suggests that TMEM45A may function as an oncogene in ovarian cancer, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis (GUO2015Inhibition). In gliomas, TMEM45A overexpression promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, likely through the NFκB signaling pathway, and is correlated with reduced survival rates in patients (Zhang2020Transmembrane).

TMEM45A is also linked to chemoresistance. In HPV-positive cervical cancer, it is upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cell lines, and its knockdown reverses this resistance by increasing apoptosis (Liu2021TMEM45A). In breast and liver cancers, TMEM45A enhances chemoresistance under hypoxic conditions (Marx2020Transmembrane). Its expression is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors, contributing to its role in cancer aggressiveness and resistance to therapy (Schmit2019Characterization). These findings highlight TMEM45A as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
TMEM45A is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes, particularly in cancer. In glioma cells, TMEM45A has been shown to interact with nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB), a transcription factor involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. The expression of TMEM45A is positively correlated with NFκB levels, suggesting that TMEM45A may regulate glioma progression through NFκB signaling pathways (Herrera-Quiterio2023The; Zhang2020Transmembrane).

In ovarian cancer, TMEM45A is associated with the regulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Knockdown of TMEM45A leads to decreased levels of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, RhoA, and ROCK2 proteins, indicating that TMEM45A may influence cell adhesion and invasion through these pathways (GUO2015Inhibition; Herrera-Quiterio2023The).

TMEM45A also plays a role in DNA damage repair mechanisms. Its inactivation results in decreased recruitment of RAD51, a key protein in DNA repair, to DNA damage foci, and downregulation of EYA3, another protein involved in DNA repair. This suggests that TMEM45A may facilitate DNA repair by influencing the recruitment of repair proteins (Schmit2019Characterization).
