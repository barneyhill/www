# CST6

## Overview
CST6 is a gene that encodes the protein cystatin E/M, a member of the cystatin superfamily, which functions as a cysteine protease inhibitor. Cystatin E/M is involved in the regulation of proteolytic activity by inhibiting enzymes such as cathepsins B, L, V, and legumain, which are crucial for various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by a unique structural composition, including a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and a central α-helix, stabilized by disulfide bridges. It undergoes post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, which may affect its function and localization. Cystatin E/M plays a significant role in skin homeostasis, neural cell function, and is present in various biological fluids. Clinically, CST6 is implicated in cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts while promoting tumor growth in others, and is associated with certain skin conditions and bone diseases (Keppler2011CST6; Rivenbark2006DNA; Lalmanach2021Cystatin).

## Structure
Cystatin E/M, encoded by the CST6 gene, is a member of the cystatin superfamily and functions as a cysteine protease inhibitor. The primary structure of cystatin E/M includes a signal peptide followed by a mature peptide chain, resulting in a protein composed of 121 amino acid residues (Lalmanach2021Cystatin). The protein features a unique five-residue insertion and a deletion, distinguishing it from other cystatins (Ni1997Cystatin).

The secondary structure of cystatin E/M is characterized by a typical five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet wrapped around a central five-turn α-helix (Lalmanach2021Cystatin). The tertiary structure is stabilized by two conserved disulfide bridges, which are crucial for maintaining its conformation (Ni1997Cystatin; Lalmanach2021Cystatin). 

Cystatin E/M undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at Asn108, which results in both glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of the protein (Ni1997Cystatin; Lalmanach2021Cystatin). The glycosylated form has a molecular weight of approximately 17 kDa, while the non-glycosylated form is around 14 kDa (Keppler2011CST6). These modifications may influence the protein's interaction with target proteases and its cellular localization (Keppler2011CST6).

## Function
CST6 encodes cystatin E/M, a cysteine protease inhibitor that plays a crucial role in regulating proteolytic activity in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in inhibiting cathepsins B, L, V, and legumain, which are proteases that contribute to various cellular processes (Qiu2008Invasion; Lalmanach2021Cystatin). Cystatin E/M is highly expressed in oligodendrocytes and moderately in astrocytes, indicating its importance in neural cell function (Qiu2008Invasion). In the skin, cystatin E/M is essential for epidermal differentiation, hair follicle development, and the desquamation process, contributing to skin barrier formation (Lalmanach2021Cystatin).

Cystatin E/M is localized in the stratum granulosum of the epidermis, the outer root sheath of hair follicles, and the secretory coil epithelium of sweat glands, where it regulates the activity of proteases involved in skin homeostasis (Keppler2011CST6). It is also present in various biological fluids, including tears and breast milk, suggesting a role in maintaining protease balance in these environments (Lalmanach2021Cystatin). The protein's activity is crucial for normal cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, impacting tissue homeostasis and integrity (Lalmanach2021Cystatin).

## Clinical Significance
The CST6 gene, encoding cystatin E/M, plays a significant role in various diseases, particularly cancer. In breast cancer, CST6 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its expression is often lost due to promoter hypermethylation. This epigenetic silencing is linked to increased invasiveness and metastasis, particularly to the bone, and is associated with a poor prognosis (Jin2012Differential; Rivenbark2006DNA). CST6 hypermethylation is a common feature in breast cancer and can be reversed with DNA demethylating agents, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach (Lalmanach2021Cystatin).

In other cancers, CST6 exhibits dual roles. It acts as a tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer, where its downregulation is linked to tumor growth and metastasis (Lalmanach2021Cystatin). Conversely, in triple-negative breast cancer, CST6 may promote tumor growth and metastasis, indicating a context-dependent function (Lalmanach2021Cystatin).

Beyond cancer, CST6 mutations, such as a stop codon in exon 2, are associated with skin conditions like hypotrichosis, eczema, and impaired sweating due to the loss of protease inhibition (Lalmanach2021Cystatin). In multiple myeloma, CST6 suppresses osteolytic bone disease by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gai2022CST6).

## Interactions
Cystatin E/M (CST6) is a cysteine protease inhibitor that interacts with several proteases, including cathepsins B, L, and V, as well as legumain. It forms high-affinity complexes with these proteases, inhibiting their activity and playing a crucial role in regulating proteolytic processes (Briggs2010Cystatin). CST6 inhibits cathepsin V (CTSV) and cathepsin L (CTSL) through distinct non-overlapping sites, with inhibition constants (K_i) of 0.47 and 1.78 nM, respectively (Cheng2006Cystatin). It also inhibits legumain, a caspase-related protease, through a reactive center loop, with Asn39 being a critical residue for this interaction (Lalmanach2021Cystatin).

CST6 is involved in the regulation of epidermal differentiation and skin barrier formation by interacting with these proteases in the skin. It co-localizes with CTSV and CTSL in the stratum granulosum of human skin, suggesting a role in epidermal differentiation and hair follicle morphogenesis (Cheng2006Cystatin). CST6 also influences the processing of transglutaminase 3 (TGase 3), an enzyme involved in cornified envelope formation, by regulating CTSL activity (Cheng2006Cystatin). In addition, CST6 interacts with the NF-κB signaling pathway, inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKKβ and thereby preventing NF-κB activation, which is significant in tumor suppression (Soh2016Cystatin).
