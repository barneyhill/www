# ABO

## Overview
The ABO gene is a critical component of the human genome, encoding glycosyltransferase enzymes that are essential for the biosynthesis of A and B antigens on the surface of red blood cells. These enzymes, specifically α1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and α1,3-galactosyltransferase, are responsible for the addition of specific sugar residues to the H antigen, thereby forming the A and B blood group antigens (YIP2002Sequence; Hosoi2008Biological). The ABO gene is located on chromosome 9 and exhibits significant polymorphism, which accounts for the diversity in blood group phenotypes observed in the human population (Kominato1999Expression). The expression of these antigens is not limited to erythrocytes but extends to various epithelial and endothelial cells, as well as bodily secretions, classifying them as histo-blood group antigens (Yamamoto2012ABO). The ABO gene's role is pivotal in transfusion medicine, organ transplantation, and disease susceptibility, making it a subject of extensive research in genetics and immunology (Yamamoto2012ABO).

## Function
The ABO gene encodes glycosyltransferase enzymes that are crucial for the synthesis of A and B antigens on the surface of red blood cells. These enzymes, specifically α1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (A transferase) and α1,3-galactosyltransferase (B transferase), catalyze the transfer of specific sugar residues to the H antigen, a precursor substance, to form the A and B antigens, respectively (YIP2002Sequence; Hosoi2008Biological). The A transferase adds N-acetyl-D-galactosamine to the H antigen, while the B transferase adds D-galactose (Yamamoto2012ABO).

These antigens are not only present on red blood cells but also on epithelial and endothelial cells, and in secretions such as saliva and seminal fluid, making them histo-blood group antigens (Yamamoto2012ABO). The expression of these antigens is crucial for blood transfusion compatibility and plays a role in immune recognition and compatibility in medical procedures (Yamamoto2012ABO). The ABO gene's function in healthy human cells is primarily related to the expression of blood group antigens, which are important for cell-cell recognition and signaling (Kominato1999Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ABO gene can lead to various clinical conditions and discrepancies in blood typing. The gene's polymorphic nature results in a wide range of phenotypic expressions, which can complicate blood transfusion practices. For instance, weakened antigen expression is often observed in conditions such as leukemia, pregnancy, and certain cancers, leading to serologic discrepancies in ABO blood grouping (Olsson2001Genomic). Acquired B antigen activity can occur in patients with digestive tract diseases or tumors, and hormonal changes during pregnancy can affect antigen expression (Olsson2001Genomic).

The presence of specific mutations in the ABO gene can result in weak A and B phenotypes, which are characterized by reduced antigen expression. These mutations include missense mutations that alter enzyme activity, leading to weaker phenotypes (CHESTER2001The). The study by Olsson et al. identified several new alleles, including A weak (A w) and B weak (B w) alleles, which result from specific missense mutations (Olsson2001Genomic).

In some cases, discrepancies in blood typing are attributed to novel mutations, such as a missense mutation in exon 6, which can lead to very weak A antigen expression and absent anti-A isoagglutinins (Goebel2013A). These genetic variations underscore the complexity of the ABO gene and its phenotypic expression, which can be influenced by various genetic and environmental factors.

## Interactions
The human ABO gene is involved in the transcriptional regulation of histo-blood group antigens through interactions with specific transcription factors. A key interaction involves the transcription factor CBF/NF-Y, which binds to a minisatellite sequence located upstream of the ABO gene promoter. This minisatellite contains a 43-bp repeat unit, and the binding of CBF/NF-Y is crucial for the transcriptional activation of the ABO gene (Kominato1997Transcription). The CBF/NF-Y complex consists of three subunits (A, B, and C), and its binding to the minisatellite is necessary for the enhancer activity that regulates ABO gene expression (Kominato1997Transcription).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) have demonstrated that a specific 23-bp sequence within the minisatellite binds to nuclear factors derived from KATO III cells, specifically identifying CBF/NF-Y as the interacting factor. This interaction is specific to the 5' half of the repeat unit in the minisatellite (Kominato1997Transcription). The binding specificity was confirmed through competition assays and supershift experiments using an anti-NF-Y A-subunit-specific antibody (Kominato1997Transcription). These interactions highlight the role of CBF/NF-Y in the transcriptional regulation of the ABO gene, influencing the expression of A and B antigens.
