# APLNR

## Overview
The APLNR gene encodes the apelin receptor, a class A rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane α-helices, which are typical of GPCRs, and is involved in the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways through its interaction with the endogenous ligand apelin (Shin2017Apelinergic). The apelin receptor is implicated in the regulation of cardiovascular functions, fluid homeostasis, and energy metabolism, and is expressed in several tissues, including the brain, where it influences neurogenesis and hormone release (Ivanov2022Distribution). Variations in the APLNR gene have been associated with cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2020Association; Nowzari2018Association).

## Structure
The apelin receptor (APLNR) is a class A rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) composed of 380 amino acids, featuring the characteristic seven α-helical transmembrane (TM) segments typical of GPCRs (Shin2017Apelinergic). The receptor's secondary structure includes these transmembrane helices, with specific motifs such as the DRY/ERY motif near the end of the third TM domain, which are critical for receptor conformation and function (Zhang2018Characterization). The receptor also contains a short extramembrane eighth helix (Shin2017Apelinergic).

The tertiary structure of APLNR has been elucidated through crystallography, revealing an 'inactive-like' conformation even when bound to an agonist, suggesting that certain mutations may have produced a constitutively inactive form of the receptor (Shin2017Apelinergic). The receptor's extracellular domain is responsible for specific recognition and binding of apelin peptides, with key acidic residues in the extracellular loops (ECLs) such as D94, E174, and D284 playing crucial roles in ligand binding (Shin2017Apelinergic).

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are suggested to impact the receptor's functional expression and stability, with immunoblot analysis indicating a molecular weight higher than expected, possibly due to PTMs, although the exact modifiers remain unidentified (Kinjo2023Posttranslational).

## Function
The APLNR gene encodes the apelin receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. This receptor interacts with its endogenous ligand, apelin, to modulate several intracellular signaling pathways. APLNR is coupled with various G-proteins, including Gαi/o, Gαq/11, Gαs, and Gα12/13, which regulate diverse cellular events. For instance, activation of Gαs leads to increased cAMP levels and activation of protein kinase A (PKA), while Gαi/o inhibits adenylyl cyclase, reducing PKA activity (Ivanov2022Distribution).

The apelin receptor is involved in the regulation of cardiovascular functions, fluid homeostasis, and energy metabolism. It plays a role in blood pressure regulation and heart contractility by influencing vascular tone and promoting vasodilation (Arababadi2019APLNAPJ; Ivanov2022Distribution). APLNR signaling also contributes to neuroprotection and cell survival, particularly in neuronal models of apoptosis, by enhancing Akt phosphorylation and reducing ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Ivanov2022Distribution).

In the brain, APLNR is expressed in regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, where it is involved in neurogenesis, hormone release, and fluid homeostasis (Ivanov2022Distribution). The receptor's activity is crucial for maintaining intracellular calcium levels, cell cycle progression, and mitochondrial stability (Ivanov2022Distribution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the APLNR gene, which encodes the apelin receptor, have been associated with various cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions. Polymorphisms in the APLNR gene, such as rs11544374, have been linked to coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertension. The rs11544374 polymorphism is suggested to have a protective effect against CAD, although its association with hypertension is not significant (Nowzari2018Association). Another polymorphism, rs9943582, is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and depression in CHD patients, with the CC genotype and C allele being significant risk factors (Wang2020Association). The rs2282623 polymorphism is linked to a higher risk of anxiety in CHD patients (Wang2020Association).

In the context of myocardial infarction, specific haplotypes of the APLNR gene, such as G-C-T-C-T, are associated with an increased risk in both males and females (Li2021Association). The APLNR gene is also implicated in glioblastoma, where its signaling pathway is involved in tumor angiogenesis and may serve as a target for therapeutic interventions (Kälin2021APLNAPLNR). These findings highlight the clinical significance of APLNR gene variations in cardiovascular and other diseases.

## Interactions
The apelin receptor (APLNR) is involved in various interactions with ligands and signaling pathways. (-)-Epicatechin (EC) is a biased ligand for APLNR, favoring β-arrestin recruitment over G protein activation. EC binds to APLNR with high affinity, forming hydrogen bonds with specific residues such as Tyr182, Tyr264, Pro292, and Tyr299, which are associated with the β-arrestin pathway. This interaction induces a conformational change in APLNR that promotes β-arrestin recruitment (PortillaMartínez2022)Epicatechin page 6 of 8). 

In glioblastoma, APLNR interacts with its ligands APLN and APELA, signaling through inhibitory Gi proteins, which leads to adenylyl cyclase inhibition and increased intracellular calcium concentrations. These interactions activate extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs) involved in cell division and the PI3K/akt pathway, contributing to gliomagenesis (Kälin2021APLNAPLNR). 

The APLN/APJ pathway, where APLN is the endogenous ligand for APLNR, activates several intracellular signaling pathways, including phospholipase C-β (PLCβ), which increases intracellular Ca2+ levels and potentially induces the Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK pathways. This interaction also affects the JNK/IRS1/GSK pathway and PI3K, leading to AKT activation and mTOR and eNOS phosphorylation (Arababadi2019APLNAPJ).
