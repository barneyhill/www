# ISOC1

## Overview
ISOC1, or Isochorismatase domain-containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the isochorismatase hydrolase family. This protein is primarily localized in human liver peroxisomes and is involved in crucial cellular processes, including the modulation of inflammatory responses and peroxisome biogenesis. The ISOC1 protein plays a significant role in managing oxidative stress and inflammation, particularly in macrophages, by influencing pathways such as the AKT1/PEX11B/peroxisome pathway. It is also implicated in DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation, interacting with key proteins in these pathways. Clinically, ISOC1 is associated with the progression of various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, where its expression levels correlate with tumor aggressiveness and patient survival outcomes. Additionally, ISOC1's involvement in inflammation-related pathways suggests its potential impact on inflammation-related diseases (Lin2022ISOC1; Shi2021Isochorismatase; Gao2019Knockdown).

## Function
The ISOC1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Isochorismatase hydrolase family and is primarily active in human liver peroxisomes. It plays a significant role in modulating inflammatory responses in macrophages through the AKT1/PEX11B/peroxisome pathway. In healthy human cells, ISOC1 is involved in regulating peroxisome biogenesis, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to infections (Lin2022ISOC1). 

ISOC1 deficiency in macrophages leads to increased production of inflammatory cytokines due to the activation of AKT1, which reduces the stability of PEX11B, affecting peroxisome biogenesis and influencing inflammation (Lin2022ISOC1). The protein's function in inflammation appears to be independent of cell proliferation, and its overexpression promotes the secretion of inflammatory factors, indicating a complex role in inflammation regulation (Lin2022ISOC1). 

ISOC1 also plays a role in managing oxidative stress in macrophages, as its deficiency leads to reduced peroxisome levels and enhanced oxidative stress, evidenced by increased generation of reactive oxygen species and formation of 8-hydroxyguanosine (Lin2022ISOC1). These functions highlight ISOC1's importance in cellular metabolic processes and its potential impact on organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ISOC1 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ISOC1 is significantly upregulated in malignant tissues compared to normal lung tissues. This overexpression is associated with worse disease-free survival and a decreased 5-year survival rate. Functionally, elevated ISOC1 levels enhance cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its knockdown suppresses these tumor-promoting activities. ISOC1 also interacts with proteins involved in DNA damage repair and inflammation-related pathways, contributing to lung cancer development (Shi2021Isochorismatase).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ISOC1 expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. This increased expression correlates with larger tumor size, greater invasion, and advanced disease stages. Higher ISOC1 levels are linked to shorter disease-free survival in CRC patients. Knockdown of ISOC1 in colon cancer cell lines results in reduced proliferation and migration, and induces apoptosis, suggesting its role in cancer progression through the AKT/GSK-3β pathway (Gao2019Knockdown).

ISOC1 also plays a role in modulating inflammatory responses in macrophages. Its deficiency leads to increased production of inflammatory cytokines, implicating ISOC1 in the regulation of inflammation, which is relevant to various inflammation-related diseases (Lin2022ISOC1).

## Interactions
ISOC1, or Isochorismatase domain-containing protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ISOC1 interacts with proteins involved in the DNA damage repair pathway, including TP53, PARP1, SFPQ, and NONO. These interactions were identified through co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and mass spectrometry (MS) assays, suggesting ISOC1's role in DNA damage repair and cell cycle arrest pathways (Shi2021Isochorismatase).

ISOC1 is also implicated in inflammation-related pathways. RNA sequencing and KEGG pathway analysis have shown its involvement in pathways such as IL-17 signaling, TNF signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, NF-kappa B signaling, and chemokine signaling, indicating its role in promoting lung cancer development through these interactions (Shi2021Isochorismatase).

In the context of viral infections, ISOC1 has been identified as a potential interacting protein with the NS5 protein from Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) and Zika Virus (ZIKV). This suggests that ISOC1 may play a role in the viral life cycle or host response to infection, although the specific nature of these interactions is not detailed (Kovanich2019Analysis).
