# ANXA13

## Overview
ANXA13 is a gene that encodes the protein annexin A13, a member of the annexin family known for its calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding properties. Annexin A13 is primarily expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and plays a significant role in membrane-related processes, particularly in the apical transport of proteins within these cells. The protein exists in two isoforms, A13a and A13b, which arise from alternative splicing and exhibit distinct structural and functional characteristics. Notably, annexin A13 is involved in lipid raft-mediated delivery and interacts with proteins such as KIFC3 and Nedd4, which are crucial for vesicle formation and docking. The unique structural features of annexin A13, including its N-terminal myristoylation, facilitate its specific functions in epithelial cell transport and localization. Additionally, ANXA13 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including otitis media and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and treatment (Fathi2023Comprehensive; BizakiVallaskangas2024Genomewide; Turnay2005Structure–function).

## Structure
Annexin A13 (ANXA13) is a member of the annexin protein family, characterized by its ability to bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. The protein exists in two isoforms, A13a and A13b, generated by alternative splicing. A13a lacks a 41-residue segment present in A13b, leading to differences in their structural and functional properties (FernándezLizarbe2016Structural).

The primary structure of ANXA13 includes a unique N-terminal domain and a conserved C-terminal core domain. The secondary structure is predominantly α-helical, with AnxA13b exhibiting a high α-helical content of 70-75% (Turnay2005Structure–function). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a compact, globular shape, with the N-terminal region influencing protein stability and function (Turnay2005Structure–function).

ANXA13a features an alternative N-terminal fold that induces dimerization, forming a domain-swapped dimer that partially occludes membrane-binding surfaces (McCulloch2019An). This dimerization is regulated by unusual hydrogen-bonding interactions and is influenced by local concentrations and interacting proteins (McCulloch2019An). Myristoylation of ANXA13a allows for calcium-independent membrane association, a unique feature among annexins (McCulloch2019An).

## Function
Annexin A13 (ANXA13) is a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein primarily expressed in intestinal epithelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in membrane-related processes. ANXA13 is involved in the apical transport of proteins within epithelial cells, associating with lipid rafts and interacting with proteins such as KIFC3 and Nedd4, which are important for vesicle formation and docking at the apical membrane (Turnay2005Structure–function). The protein's myristoylation allows for calcium-independent binding to phosphatidylcholine and raft-like liposomes, facilitating its role in membrane interactions (Turnay2005Structure–function).

ANXA13 is also implicated in the lipid raft-mediated delivery of apical proteins, contributing to the maintenance of epithelial cell integrity and function (Iglesias2002Comparative). It is expressed in the small intestine, particularly in proliferating crypt epithelia and differentiated villus enterocytes, where it is transported to the apical region (Iglesias2002Comparative). The protein's interactions with membranes are modulated by calcium and pH changes, which influence its conformation and binding properties (Turnay2005Structure–function). ANXA13's unique structural features, including its N-terminal myristoylation, contribute to its specific functions in epithelial cell transport and localization (Turnay2005Structure–function).

## Clinical Significance
ANXA13 (annexin A13) has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In otitis media, particularly the secretory subtype, a genome-wide association study identified a novel locus near ANXA13. The study found that the lead variant rs3779980 was strongly associated with otitis media and eustachian tube disorders, suggesting that ANXA13 may play a role in the pathobiology of these conditions (BizakiVallaskangas2024Genomewide). Immunohistochemistry studies have shown that annexin A13 is expressed in the eustachian tube epithelium, indicating its potential involvement in eustachian tube dysfunction (BizakiVallaskangas2024Genomewide).

In cancer, ANXA13 has been studied in the context of breast and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, ANXA13 expression is upregulated in certain subtypes, such as triple-negative breast cancer, and is associated with various clinicopathological features (Fathi2023Comprehensive). In ovarian cancer, ANXA13 is downregulated, and genetic variations in the gene have a high incidence rate, which may correlate with tumorigenesis and progression (Gou2019Annexin). These findings suggest that ANXA13 could serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis and treatment in these cancers.

## Interactions
Annexin A13 (ANXA13) participates in various interactions that influence its function and localization. The AnxA13b isoform interacts with proteins such as KIFC3 and Nedd4, which are involved in vesicle formation and docking at the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells (Turnay2005Structure–function). These interactions suggest a role for AnxA13b in apical transport processes.

The AnxA13a isoform exhibits unique dimerization properties that regulate its membrane-binding ability. This dimerization involves significant surface area burial and shape complementarity, with hydrophobic interactions and unusual hydrogen bonds between acidic residues like Glu-34 and Asp-306 (McCulloch2019An). The dimerization of AnxA13a acts as a negative regulator of membrane remodeling, potentially influencing its interaction with other proteins or membrane components (McCulloch2019An).

AnxA13a can also form heteromeric assemblies with partner proteins, which may further regulate its membrane interactions (McCulloch2019An). These interactions are influenced by the protein's monomer-dimer equilibrium, which is pH-dependent and concentration-dependent (McCulloch2019An). The localization and function of AnxA13a in epithelial cells are also affected by its myristoylation status, which is crucial for its membrane targeting (McCulloch2019An).
