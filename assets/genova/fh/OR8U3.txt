# OR8U3

## Overview
The OR8U3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily U member 3, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules. The olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR8U3, play a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. These receptors are characterized by their seven transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors (Qiu2020aarFDC).
