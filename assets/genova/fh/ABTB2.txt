# ABTB2

## Overview
The ABTB2 gene encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and BTB domain containing 2, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and BTB (POZ) domains. These structural motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ABTB2 protein may play a role in forming complexes or modulating signaling pathways (Cleaver2010Genebased). While the specific functions of the ABTB2 protein are not fully elucidated, its expression has been linked to the SHH signaling pathway, particularly in the context of medulloblastoma (Vriend2019Differential). Additionally, the ABTB2 gene is involved in the formation of guanine-vacancy-bearing G-quadruplexes, although this interaction pertains to the DNA sequence rather than the protein itself (He2020Selective). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its hypomethylation in thyroid carcinoma, indicating a potential role in cancer pathology (Iqbal2022Preliminary). Further research is needed to fully understand the diverse roles of ABTB2 in cellular processes and disease.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The ABTB2 gene has been implicated in thyroid carcinoma through alterations in its methylation status. Research indicates that ABTB2 is hypomethylated in thyroid cancer patients compared to normal controls, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathology (Iqbal2022Preliminary). Hypomethylation of ABTB2 may contribute to tumor initiation and progression, highlighting the importance of epigenetic modifications in cancer development (Iqbal2022Preliminary). While the study by Iqbal et al. emphasizes the significance of DNA methylation patterns as potential biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of thyroid carcinoma, it does not provide specific information on other diseases or conditions associated with mutations or alterations in the ABTB2 gene beyond its hypomethylation in thyroid carcinoma (Iqbal2022Preliminary). The clinical significance of ABTB2 in other disorders remains an area of ongoing research, with studies exploring its role in various cellular signaling pathways and its potential impact on other types of cancer and diseases.

## Interactions
The ABTB2 protein is involved in protein-protein interactions through its ankyrin repeats and BTB (POZ) domains, which are structural motifs known for mediating such interactions. Although the specific physical interactions of ABTB2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its structural domains suggest a role in forming complexes or modulating signaling pathways (Cleaver2010Genebased). 

In the context of medulloblastoma, ABTB2 expression is strongly correlated with the expression of the SHH co-receptor BOC, suggesting a potential role in the SHH signaling pathway (Vriend2019Differential). However, the exact nature of these interactions remains to be elucidated.

Additionally, the ABTB2 gene has been studied in the context of guanine-vacancy-bearing G-quadruplexes (GVBQs), where a guanine-peptide conjugate (GRPC) binds specifically to the DNA sequence ABTB2-3233, forming GVBQ structures. This interaction is characterized by the guanine filling the G-vacancy and the RHAU23 domain capping the G-quartet terminal layer, although this does not directly involve the ABTB2 protein itself (He2020Selective). 

Overall, while ABTB2 is implicated in various biological processes, specific details of its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored.
