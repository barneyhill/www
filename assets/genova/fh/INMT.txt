# INMT

## Overview
Indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) is a gene located on chromosome 7p15.2-p15.3 that encodes the enzyme indolethylamine N-methyltransferase, a member of the methyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the N-methylation of indole compounds, such as tryptamine, and plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a compound with potential neuromodulatory and psychoactive effects (Dean2018IndolethylamineNmethyltransferase). INMT is expressed in various tissues, including the lung, brain, and pineal gland, indicating its potential physiological significance in these areas (Dean2018IndolethylamineNmethyltransferase). The enzyme also exhibits thioether-S-methyltransferase activity, contributing to the metabolism of volatile sulfur compounds (Torres2019Human). Genetic variations in the INMT gene, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, can influence its enzymatic activity and expression, impacting the synthesis of DMT and other methylated compounds (Dean2018IndolethylamineNmethyltransferase). Despite its known functions, the full spectrum of INMT's roles in human physiology and pathology remains to be fully elucidated.

## Structure
The human indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 7p15.2-p15.3 and consists of 263 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 29 kDa (Thompson1999Human; Dean2018IndolethylamineNmethyltransferase). The primary structure of INMT includes several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that result in amino acid variations, such as D28N, M205V, E219G, and F254C, which may affect the protein's function (Dean2018IndolethylamineNmethyltransferase).

The secondary structure of INMT is characterized by a class I AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase core fold, which includes a seven-stranded β sheet flanked by α helices (Peng2011Structural). The tertiary structure of INMT involves a potential disulfide bond between cysteine residues at positions 44 and 254, which may regulate enzyme activity by connecting the N- and C-terminal regions (Torres2019Human).

INMT exists in two isoforms due to alternative exon splice sites, with isoform 1 consisting of 263 amino acids and isoform 2 consisting of 262 amino acids (Dean2018IndolethylamineNmethyltransferase). The protein's structure and function are influenced by these isoforms and the presence of specific SNPs, which can alter its enzymatic activity and substrate affinity.

## Function
Indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) is an enzyme that catalyzes the N-methylation of indole compounds, such as tryptamine, using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as a methyl donor. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the biosynthesis of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a compound with proposed roles in neuromodulation and psychoactive effects (Torres2019Human; Dean2018IndolethylamineNmethyltransferase). INMT is expressed in various human tissues, including the lung, brain, and pineal gland, suggesting a potential physiological role for DMT in these areas (Dean2018IndolethylamineNmethyltransferase). 

The enzyme also exhibits thioether-S-methyltransferase (TEMT) activity, methylating volatile compounds such as dimethylsulfide (DMS) and dimethylselenide (DMSe) to their respective trimethylated products, which are essential for urinary excretion (Torres2019Human). Genetic variations in INMT, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), can affect its enzymatic activity and expression, potentially influencing the synthesis and levels of DMT and other methylated compounds (Dean2018IndolethylamineNmethyltransferase). Despite its known roles, the full range of INMT's functions in healthy human cells remains not fully understood, partly due to the promiscuity of enzymatic activity observed in early studies (Glynos2023Indolethylamine).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the INMT gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In prostate cancer, INMT is downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous ones, and its expression is significantly correlated with clinical features such as lymph node metastasis, Gleason score, PSA expression, and patient survival. Overexpression of INMT in prostate cancer cell lines inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a tumor suppressor (Jianfeng2022IndolethylamineNMethyltransferase).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), INMT is also downregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and clinical parameters like T stage and histologic grade. Hypomethylation of INMT in HNSC samples suggests a potential mechanism for its downregulation (Cui2022Poor).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), low INMT expression is associated with poor overall survival. However, it is linked to a favorable response to immunotherapy, possibly due to increased tumor immunogenicity and T-cell infiltration (Zhou2022Low).

Mutations in the INMT gene, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been associated with Hirschsprung's disease, particularly in Korean subjects. These mutations may affect serotonin levels and influence gastrointestinal function (Dean2018IndolethylamineNmethyltransferase).

## Interactions
Indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are significant in its biological functions. In the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), INMT has been shown to interact with several proteins, as identified through the STRING database. This analysis revealed 50 INMT-binding proteins, highlighting its involvement in complex protein networks (Cui2022Poor). Among these, common genes such as GNA13, GNA15, and GNG7 were identified, with INMT expression positively correlated with GNA13 and GNG7, and negatively with GNA15 (Cui2022Poor).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), a protein-protein interaction network for INMT was constructed using the STRING database and visualized with Cytoscape software. This network analysis identified hub genes within the INMT interaction network, suggesting its role in broader cellular processes (Zhou2022Low).

These interactions suggest that INMT may play a role in various signaling pathways and cellular processes, potentially influencing cancer progression and response to treatment. The identification of these interactions provides insights into the functional role of INMT in different cancer types and its potential as a therapeutic target.
