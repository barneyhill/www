# KCTD7

## Overview
KCTD7 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 7, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination and neuronal function. Despite its name, the protein does not function as a potassium channel but is instead characterized by a conserved BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions and oligomerization (Azizieh2011Progressive; Liu2013The). KCTD7 is a component of cullin 3 (CUL3) ubiquitin ligase complexes, acting as a substrate-specific adaptor that regulates the ubiquitination of target proteins, such as calpain subunits, without leading to their degradation (Metz2018KCTD7; Sharma2023Calpain). This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and neuronal excitability. Mutations in the KCTD7 gene are linked to progressive myoclonus epilepsy and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 14, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative disorders (Mastrangelo2019Progressive; Kousi2012Novel).

## Structure
KCTD7 is a protein characterized by the presence of a conserved N-terminal BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and oligomerization (Liu2013The). This domain spans residues 48 through 104 of the 289 amino acid sequence of KCTD7 (Azizieh2011Progressive). The BTB domain is crucial for forming stable pentamers, although KCTD7 may also prefer a dimeric state stabilized by interactions in the C-terminal domain (CTD) (Esposito2022Alphafold).

The CTD of KCTD7 is distinct from other KCTD proteins, forming a circle-like structure with a large central cavity, resembling a Greek krater (Esposito2022Alphafold). This unique structural organization is shared with KCTD14, another member of sub-Cluster 5B (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted). The CTD's structural features are crucial for the protein's function, particularly in its role as a component of cullin 3 (CUL3) ubiquitin ligase complexes, where it may act as a cargo adaptor for ubiquitination (Metz2018KCTD7).

KCTD7 does not contain transmembrane domains, suggesting it does not function as a channel, despite its name (Azizieh2011Progressive). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its involvement in various cellular processes, including modulation of potassium conductance and degradation of histone deacetylase HDAC1 (Azizieh2011Progressive).

## Function
The KCTD7 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating calpain activity through non-degradative ubiquitination. In healthy human cells, KCTD7 forms a complex with Cullin-3, acting as an adapter within the Cullin-3 E3 ligase complex. This interaction facilitates the ubiquitination of calpain subunits, which modulates their activity without leading to their degradation. This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal calpain activity levels, preventing hyperactivation that can lead to neurodegeneration and motor impairments (Sharma2023Calpain).

KCTD7 is also involved in the autophagy-lysosome pathway, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and the degradation of misfolded proteins. It is implicated in the regulation of autophagy, particularly under low nutrient conditions, and is necessary for processes like lipophagy, which utilizes lipid stores as an energy source. This function is supported by its role as a CUL3 adaptor, suggesting involvement in protein degradation pathways (Metz2018KCTD7).

In neurons, KCTD7 is associated with the regulation of potassium conductance, influencing neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. It interacts with cullin-3, indicating a role in cellular processes related to the plasma membrane's resting potential (Azizieh2011Progressive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCTD7 gene are associated with progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by seizures, developmental delays, and cognitive decline. Patients with KCTD7 mutations often experience myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures, ataxia, and progressive loss of motor and mental skills, leading to severe motor handicap and dementia (Metz2018KCTD7; Kousi2012Novel). The disorder typically begins in early childhood, with symptoms such as ataxia sometimes presenting initially (Kousi2012Novel).

KCTD7 mutations can include missense, stopgain, and frameshift mutations, which are often found in homozygous or compound heterozygous states (Metz2018KCTD7). These mutations disrupt normal neuronal function, potentially through altered interactions with proteins like CUL3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase component, affecting neuronal excitability and autophagy-lysosome pathways (Azizieh2011Progressive; Metz2018KCTD7).

In addition to PME, KCTD7 mutations have been linked to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 14 (CLN14), a condition characterized by lysosomal storage defects and severe neurological disabilities (Mastrangelo2019Progressive). The phenotypic spectrum of KCTD7-related disorders is broad, with some patients exhibiting symptoms such as autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or schizophrenia (Metz2018KCTD7).

## Interactions
KCTD7 interacts with Cullin-3 (CUL3) as part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is facilitated by the BTB domain of KCTD7, which allows it to function as a substrate-specific adaptor for the cullin3-based E3 ligases, playing a role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (Balasco2024A; Liu2013The). The interaction between KCTD7 and CUL3 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, and it is crucial for the regulation of calpain activity through non-degradative ubiquitination (Azizieh2011Progressive; Sharma2023Calpain). 

KCTD7 also interacts with calpain subunits, specifically CAPN2 (calpain 2) and CAPNS1, forming a complex with the Cullin-3-Rbx1-KCTD7 ligase. This interaction is necessary for the regulation of calpain activity, affecting protein activity, localization, and interactions (Sharma2023Calpain). The interaction between KCTD7 and calpain subunits is dependent on the full-length KCTD7 and specific domains of calpain, highlighting the specificity of these protein-protein interactions (Sharma2023Calpain).

Mutations in KCTD7 can disrupt its interaction with CUL3, affecting its function in ubiquitination processes and potentially leading to neurodegenerative disorders (Metz2018KCTD7).
