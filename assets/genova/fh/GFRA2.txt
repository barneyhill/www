# GFRA2

## Overview
The GFRA2 gene encodes the GDNF family receptor alpha 2, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor that plays a pivotal role in the signaling pathways of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family. This receptor is integral to the survival and maintenance of various neuronal populations, particularly motoneurons and dopaminergic neurons, by forming a complex with the RET tyrosine kinase and facilitating neurotrophic signaling. The GFRA2 protein is characterized by its involvement in neuronal differentiation, axonal growth, and synaptic plasticity, contributing to neuroprotection and repair mechanisms. Beyond its neurological functions, GFRA2 is also implicated in cardiac progenitor and early B cell biology, as well as in oncological processes, such as neuroblastoma, where it influences cell proliferation through interactions with the PI3K/AKT pathway (Souza2010Glial; Li2019GDNF).

## Structure
The GFRA2 protein is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor involved in the signaling of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family. It is expressed as a secreted protein with a primary sequence that includes residues 24-362, featuring an alkaline phosphatase signal peptide at the N-terminus and a C-terminal His 8-tag for purification purposes (Li2019CryoEM). The protein's structure includes an N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide and a C-terminal hydrophobic domain, characteristic of GPI-linked proteins, along with a hydrophilic linker region (Shepherd2004Roles).

GFRA2 forms part of a ternary complex with RET and neurturin (NRTN), where it plays a role in stabilizing the complex through its D1 domain (Li2019CryoEM). This complex formation is crucial for the activation of the RET receptor, which involves specific interactions at the C-terminal portion of the RET C-clamp (Li2019CryoEM). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may influence its function and interactions. While the context does not provide detailed information on secondary or tertiary structures, GFRA2's involvement in complex formation suggests a role in higher-order structural assemblies.

## Function
The GFRA2 gene encodes a receptor that is part of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) signaling pathway, which is crucial for the survival and maintenance of various neuronal populations. This receptor, along with other GDNF alpha receptors, forms a complex with the Ret tyrosine kinase to mediate cell survival signaling. This signaling is particularly important for the survival of motoneurons and dopaminergic neurons, protecting them from neurotoxins and potentially modulating dopamine levels in the nigrostriatal system (Souza2010Glial).

GFRA2 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface receptor that binds to GDNF ligands, facilitating the activation of the RET tyrosine kinase receptor. This pathway is involved in neuronal differentiation, axonal growth, and synaptic plasticity, contributing to neuroprotection and repair mechanisms in neuronal tissues (Li2019GDNF). Beyond the nervous system, GFRA2 is also a marker for cardiac progenitors and early B cells, indicating its role in various biological processes (Li2019GDNF). In neuroblastoma, GFRA2 is upregulated and promotes cell proliferation by interacting with PTEN and activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, suggesting its involvement in both normal cellular processes and cancer progression (Li2019GDNF).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GFRA2 gene have been implicated in several neurological and oncological conditions. In the context of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a study identified a significant association between the GFRA2 variant rs36196656 and increased disease risk in patients with GRN mutations and those with FTLD-TDP type A. This variant is located in intronic regions of GFRA2 and is predicted to affect transcription factor binding sites and histone marks, leading to a 40% reduction in GFRA2 RNA expression in homozygous carriers of the risk allele (Pottier2018Potential). The study suggests that GFRA2 may interact with progranulin, potentially serving as a receptor, although no association was found with progranulin concentrations in plasma or CSF (Pottier2018Potential).

In the realm of movement disorders, GFRA2 gene variants have been associated with tardive dyskinesia (TD), a condition characterized by involuntary movements often resulting from long-term antipsychotic use. Certain alleles within the GFRA2 gene were found to increase or decrease the risk of developing TD, highlighting the gene's role in the pharmacogenetics of neurological conditions (Souza2010Glial).

Additionally, a mutation in the GFRA2 gene was identified in a malignant granular cell tumor, suggesting a potential link to the tumor's response to the drug pazopanib, although further studies are needed to understand this relationship (Wei2015Wholegenome).

## Interactions
GFRA2 (GDNF family receptor alpha 2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. One of the key interactions of GFRA2 is with the tumor suppressor protein PTEN. This interaction has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments in neuroblastoma cells, where GFRA2 was shown to bind PTEN, influencing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The overexpression of GFRA2 leads to the activation of this pathway, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of AKT, which promotes cell proliferation by increasing Cyclin D1 expression and decreasing CDKN1A (p21) expression (Li2019GDNF).

GFRA2 also functions as a co-receptor for the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. It forms a complex with RET and its ligands, such as neurturin (NRTN), to mediate signaling pathways involved in neuronal survival and differentiation. This interaction is crucial for the activation of RET, which can trigger various downstream pathways, including the PI3K/AKT pathway, depending on the specific ligand and co-receptor involved (GarciaLavandeira2010Functional). These interactions highlight GFRA2's role in both promoting cell proliferation in cancer and supporting neuronal functions.
