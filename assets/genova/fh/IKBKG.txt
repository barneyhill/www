# IKBKG

## Overview
The IKBKG gene encodes the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), a pivotal regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which is integral to the NF-κB signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. NEMO, a regulatory protein, facilitates the activation of the IKK complex, which in turn leads to the activation of NF-κB by promoting the degradation of IκB proteins. This process allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. The structural features of NEMO, including coiled-coil domains and a leucine zipper motif, are essential for its function and interactions within the IKK complex. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination further regulate its activity. Mutations in IKBKG can result in various immunodeficiencies and developmental disorders, underscoring its critical role in normal cellular function (Siggs2010A; Hayden2008Shared; Scheidereit2006IκB).

## Structure
IKBKG, also known as NEMO, is a regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, which plays a crucial role in NF-kB signaling. The primary structure of IKBKG includes a series of coiled-coil domains and a leucine zipper motif, which are essential for its function and interactions with other proteins within the IKK complex. These structural features facilitate the protein's ability to form stable interactions with other components of the IKK complex, contributing to its regulatory role.

The tertiary structure of IKBKG is characterized by its ability to interact with other IKK components, which is critical for the assembly and function of the IKK complex. This structural arrangement allows IKBKG to effectively participate in the signaling pathways that regulate NF-kB activity.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, are vital for the functional regulation of IKBKG. These modifications can influence the protein's activity, stability, and interactions, thereby modulating the NF-kB signaling pathway. The presence of these modifications underscores the dynamic nature of IKBKG's role in cellular signaling processes.

## Function
The IKBKG gene encodes the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), a critical regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which is essential for the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This pathway plays a vital role in regulating immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. In healthy human cells, NEMO facilitates the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB proteins, which sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm. Upon degradation of IκB, NF-κB is released and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of target genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (Hayden2008Shared; Jain2001Specific).

NEMO is involved in the activation of the IKK complex through its interactions with upstream signaling adapters and its oligomerization, which is necessary for IKK activation. This process involves the phosphorylation of IKK subunits, enhancing their kinase activity and leading to the activation of NF-κB (Hayden2008Shared). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as immune system development and response to stress (Fusco2008Alterations). Mutations in IKBKG can lead to various immunodeficiencies and developmental disorders, highlighting its critical role in normal cellular function (Siggs2010A; Jain2001Specific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IKBKG gene, also known as NEMO, are associated with several diseases due to its critical role in the NF-kB signaling pathway. Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a prominent condition linked to IKBKG mutations, primarily affecting females. It is characterized by skin abnormalities, such as blistering and hyperpigmentation, and can also involve the eyes and central nervous system. The most common mutation in IP is an 11.7-kb deletion affecting exons 4 through 10, accounting for 60-80% of cases (Fusco2008Alterations; How2022Uncovering).

In males, hypomorphic mutations in IKBKG can lead to ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID), which is marked by severe susceptibility to infections and abnormal development of skin adnexa (Fusco2008Alterations). These mutations often affect the zinc finger domain, reducing but not eliminating NF-kB activation (Hanson2008Hypomorphic).

The clinical manifestations of IKBKG mutations vary depending on the type and location of the mutation, as well as the mosaic expression of the gene due to random X inactivation in females (Fusco2008Alterations). The presence of a pseudogene, IKBKGP1, complicates genetic diagnosis, necessitating advanced bioinformatics tools for accurate detection (How2022Uncovering).

## Interactions
The IKBKG gene encodes the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), which is a critical regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. NEMO interacts with IKKα and IKKβ, forming a complex essential for NF-κB activation. It binds more strongly to IKKβ than to IKKα, with the C-terminal regions of these kinases containing the NEMO-binding domain (NBD) crucial for this interaction (Scheidereit2006IκB).

NEMO also interacts with various proteins involved in NF-κB signaling, such as RIP1, TRAF2, and TRAF6. TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, catalyzes the K63-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO, which is important for NF-κB activation (Bal2017Lack). NEMO's interaction with SHARPIN, a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), is crucial for linear polyubiquitination and NF-κB pathway regulation. A splice mutation in IKBKG can impair this interaction, leading to defective NF-κB activation (Bal2017Lack).

NEMO also binds to polyubiquitin chains, with a preference for Lys63-linked chains, which are essential for recruiting TAK1 and the IKK complex to the TNF receptor, facilitating NF-κB activation (Scheidereit2006IκB). Additionally, NEMO interacts with heat shock proteins like Hsp70, which can inhibit IKK activity by disrupting NEMO's oligomeric structure (Scheidereit2006IκB).
