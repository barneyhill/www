# CEP152

## Overview
CEP152 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 152, a crucial component in the regulation of centriole duplication, a fundamental process in cell division. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate interactions with other centrosomal proteins, such as CEP63, forming a heterotetrameric complex essential for centriole biogenesis (Kim2019Molecular; Il2023Architectural). As a centrosomal protein, CEP152 plays a pivotal role in recruiting Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) to the centrosome, thereby initiating centriole duplication (Sonnen2013Human). Mutations in the CEP152 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including primary microcephaly and Seckel syndrome, highlighting its significance in maintaining genomic stability and normal cell division (Guernsey2010Mutations; Zhang2023Two).

## Structure
CEP152 is a centrosomal protein characterized by its complex molecular structure, which plays a critical role in centriole duplication. The primary structure of CEP152 includes specific amino acid sequences that form coiled-coil (CC) domains, essential for protein-protein interactions (Il2023Architectural). These coiled-coil regions facilitate the formation of a heterotetrameric complex with Cep63, a crucial step in centriole duplication (Kim2019Molecular).

The secondary structure of CEP152 is predicted to be predominantly coiled-coil conformations, contributing to its elongated and rod-like tertiary structure (Il2023Architectural). The tertiary structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions within the α-helical bundle, which is composed of tightly packed hydrophobic residues (Kim2019Molecular).

In terms of quaternary structure, CEP152 forms a heterotetrameric complex with Cep63, which can further assemble into higher-order structures such as octamers and hexadecamers. This assembly is driven by intermolecular contacts and is crucial for the cylindrical architecture around centrioles (Il2023Architectural). The N-terminal regions of CEP152 are positioned at the outermost region of this cylindrical structure, indicating an antiparallel arrangement with Cep63 (Il2023Architectural).

CEP152 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and function (Kim2019Molecular). Additionally, CEP152 has splice variant isoforms that can affect its function and localization, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
CEP152 is a critical protein involved in centriole duplication, a key process in cell division. It functions by recruiting Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) to the centrosome, which is essential for initiating centriole biogenesis. CEP152 interacts with CEP192 to facilitate the recruitment and localization of Plk4, ensuring proper centriole duplication. The interaction between CEP152 and Plk4 is mediated by electrostatic interactions, with CEP152 playing a significant role in maintaining Plk4 at the centrosome (Sonnen2013Human).

CEP152 is also involved in forming complexes with other proteins such as CEP63 and CPAP, which are crucial for centriole duplication. It is part of a hierarchical structure at the centrosome, interacting with proteins like CDK5RAP2 and WDR62, which are necessary for the recruitment of CDK2, a kinase involved in centriole duplication (Kodani2015Centriolar).

CEP152's localization to the centrosome is dependent on centriolar satellite proteins, such as CEP131, which are necessary for its proper function. Disruption of CEP152 leads to defects in centriole duplication, highlighting its essential role in maintaining genomic stability and normal cell division (Kodani2015Centriolar; Sonnen2013Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP152 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably primary microcephaly and Seckel syndrome. Primary microcephaly is characterized by a significantly reduced brain size and intellectual disability, without other syndromic abnormalities. Mutations such as a missense variant (p.Q265P) and a truncating mutation (p.R987X) have been identified in affected individuals, leading to disrupted protein function and centrosome localization (Guernsey2010Mutations). These mutations are particularly prevalent in certain subpopulations, such as Eastern Canadians, due to founder effects (Guernsey2010Mutations).

Seckel syndrome, another condition linked to CEP152 mutations, is an autosomal recessive disorder marked by growth retardation, microcephaly, and intellectual disability. Novel variants, including a splice-site variant and a nonsense mutation, have been identified in patients, leading to reduced CEP152 expression and abnormal splicing patterns (Zhang2023Two).

Alterations in CEP152 expression or interactions can also contribute to other conditions, such as epileptic encephalopathy and autism spectrum disorder, although these associations are less common (Li2024Novel). The gene's role in centrosome function and cell cycle regulation underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes.

## Interactions
CEP152 is a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in centriole duplication through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with CEP192 and PLK4, forming a complex essential for recruiting PLK4 to centrosomes, which is critical for centriole duplication. The interaction between CEP192 and PLK4 involves electrostatic interactions between the polo-box domain of PLK4 and acidic regions within CEP192 and CEP152 (Sonnen2013Human). CEP152 also interacts with CEP63 and CPAP, forming distinct complexes with these proteins, although ternary or quaternary complexes with CEP192 were not detected (Sonnen2013Human).

CEP152's localization to centrosomes is dependent on CEP192, but not vice versa. It is necessary for the centrosome localization of CEP63 and CPAP, and its depletion affects their levels (Sonnen2013Human). CEP152 interacts with the centriolar satellite protein CEP131, which is crucial for its centrosomal localization. This interaction is confirmed through reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Kodani2015Centriolar). CEP152 also interacts with CDK5RAP2 and WDR62, forming a hierarchical assembly at the centrosome necessary for centriole duplication (Kodani2015Centriolar). These interactions highlight the central role of CEP152 in the assembly and function of the centrosome.
