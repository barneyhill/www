# SPATC1L

## Overview
The SPATC1L gene encodes the protein spermatogenesis and centriole associated 1 like, which plays a pivotal role in male fertility by maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm head-tail junction during spermatogenesis. This protein is predominantly expressed in spermatogenic cells and testicular sperm, with its expression being developmentally regulated. It is characterized by a coiled-coil domain that facilitates its interaction with the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), specifically enhancing PKA activity crucial for the phosphorylation of CAPZB, a process vital for sperm stability (Kim2018SPATC). SPATC1L's function is underscored by its conservation across species, sharing significant homology with its mouse counterpart, and its involvement in broader cellular signaling pathways (Kim2018SPATC; Lecat2015A). Mutations in SPATC1L are linked to male infertility and have been implicated in cardiac conditions such as atrial fibrillation, highlighting its clinical significance (Yamada2017Identification; Kim2018SPATC).

## Structure
The SPATC1L protein is a 38-kDa protein expressed in spermatogenic cells and testicular sperm, but not in mature sperm from the epididymis, indicating a developmentally regulated expression during spermatogenesis (Kim2018SPATC). The protein is predicted to encode 342 amino acids and is localized to the neck region in testicular sperm (Kim2018SPATC). SPATC1L shares 88% amino acid sequence homology with its mouse counterpart, suggesting a conserved structure across species (Kim2018SPATC).

The protein contains a coiled-coil domain, which is responsible for its specific localization pattern within cells (Kim2018SPATC). This domain is crucial for its interaction with the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), specifically the RIa subunit, enhancing PKA activity by binding to the C-subunit binding site of RIa (Kim2018SPATC). This interaction is essential for the phosphorylation of CAPZB, a process important for maintaining the stability of the sperm head-tail junction (Kim2018SPATC).

Molecular modeling has suggested that variants in SPATC1L can significantly impact its structural stability, potentially leading to deleterious effects and resulting in truncated isoforms (Morgan2018Nextgeneration). The protein's structure is further characterized by important functional domains, such as the leucine zipper and Cdc20 binding region, which are conserved and potentially impacted by identified variants (Morgan2018Nextgeneration).

## Function
The SPATC1L gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the sperm head-tail junction during spermatogenesis. This protein is specifically expressed in male germ cells and is localized to the neck region of testicular sperm, where it is involved in the structural stability of the sperm head-tail junction (Kim2018SPATC). SPATC1L interacts with the regulatory subunit RIa of protein kinase A (PKA), enhancing PKA activity, which is essential for the phosphorylation of capping protein muscle Z-line beta (CAPZB). This phosphorylation event is believed to regulate F-actin dynamics, contributing to the stability of the sperm head-tail junction (Kim2018SPATC).

The loss of SPATC1L function in knockout mice results in male sterility due to the separation of sperm heads from tails, highlighting its critical role in sperm development and fertility (Kim2018SPATC). Additionally, SPATC1L has been implicated in cell-cell communication, as it translocates to cell junctions in response to G protein-coupled receptor signaling, suggesting a broader role in cellular signaling pathways (Lecat2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the SPATC1L gene are associated with several reproductive and cardiac conditions. In the context of male infertility, SPATC1L is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the sperm head-tail junction. Mice lacking SPATC1L exhibit male sterility due to the separation of sperm heads from tails, a condition that mirrors acephalic spermatozoa syndrome in humans, characterized by headless spermatozoa (Kim2018SPATC; Graziani2024Genetic). This condition is linked to reduced protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which is essential for the phosphorylation of proteins like CAPZB that stabilize the sperm structure (Kim2018SPATC). Heterozygous mice with reduced SPATC1L levels also show subfertility, indicating haploinsufficiency (Kim2018SPATC).

In addition to its role in fertility, SPATC1L has been identified as a susceptibility locus for atrial fibrillation (AF). A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SPATC1L, rs113710653, is associated with an increased risk of AF, suggesting a potential link between SPATC1L and cardiac conditions (Yamada2017Identification). The exact molecular mechanisms connecting SPATC1L to AF remain unclear, but genetic variations in SPATC1L may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and atrial remodeling, which are critical in the development of AF (Yamada2017Identification).

## Interactions
The SPATC1L protein is known to interact with several components of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) complex. It specifically interacts with the protein kinase cAMP-dependent type I regulatory subunit alpha (PRKAR1A, also known as RIa) and the protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha isoform 2 (PRKACA isoform 2, also known as Ca2) (Kim2018SPATC). SPATC1L binds to the C-subunit binding site in RIa, enhancing PKA activity by competitively inhibiting the association between RIa and the Ca subunit (Kim2018SPATC). This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of CAPZB, a protein that caps actin filaments, thereby stabilizing F-actin in the sperm neck region, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the sperm head-tail junction (Kim2018SPATC).

SPATC1L also interacts with A kinase anchor protein 11 (AKAP11), a scaffolding protein that interacts with the R subunit of PKA (Kim2018SPATC). The interaction between SPATC1L and RIa was confirmed through reverse co-immunoprecipitation using an anti-RIa antibody, and co-immunostaining analysis showed that SPATC1L and RIa co-localize in round spermatids and at the connecting piece in testicular sperm (Kim2018SPATC).
