# NEU1

## Overview
The NEU1 gene encodes the enzyme neuraminidase 1, a lysosomal sialidase that plays a critical role in the catabolism of sialylated glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and oligosaccharides by removing terminal sialic acids. This enzyme is a member of the sialidase family and is characterized by a beta-propeller fold, which is a structural motif common among sialidases (Bonardi2014In). Neuraminidase 1 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of sialylated compounds in lysosomes, a process that, when disrupted, leads to lysosomal storage disorders such as sialidosis (Maurice2016New). Beyond its lysosomal functions, neuraminidase 1 is also involved in modulating cell surface receptor signaling at the plasma membrane, influencing processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and immune responses (Lillehoj2012NEU1; Hyun2016The). The enzyme's activity is regulated through its interaction with other proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its stability and function (Lee2014NEU1). Mutations in the NEU1 gene can lead to significant clinical manifestations, underscoring its importance in human health and disease (Maroofian2018Parental).

## Structure
The NEU1 protein is a lysosomal sialidase involved in the removal of terminal sialic acids from sialyloconjugates. Structurally, NEU1 is part of the sialidase family and features a beta-propeller fold, which is a common structural motif among sialidases, organized in six blades composed of four antiparallel beta-sheets (Bonardi2014In). The protein contains two transmembrane domains, TM1 (residues 139-159) and TM2 (residues 316-333), which form stable α-helices in membrane-mimicking environments (Maurice2016New). TM2 is particularly important for dimerization, a process crucial for NEU1's catalytic activity at the plasma membrane (Maurice2016New).

NEU1's quaternary structure involves its association with protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) and beta-galactosidase, forming a multienzyme complex essential for its lysosomal function (Bonardi2014In). The protein's dimerization ability is highlighted by its capacity to form dimers in membrane environments, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Maurice2016New). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may also play a role in NEU1's function and stability, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The NEU1 gene encodes neuraminidase 1, an enzyme primarily localized in lysosomes, where it plays a crucial role in the removal of terminal sialic acids from sialyloconjugates. This activity is essential for the degradation of sialylated glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and oligosaccharides, preventing their accumulation in lysosomes, which is characteristic of certain lysosomal storage disorders (Maurice2016New). NEU1 is part of a multienzyme complex with protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) and beta-galactosidase, which is necessary for its proper folding, stability, and activation (Lee2014NEU1).

Beyond its lysosomal role, NEU1 is also found at the plasma membrane, where it regulates the sialylation of several receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mucin 1 (MUC1). NEU1 modulates these receptors' signaling pathways, impacting cellular responses to ligands, pathogens, and injuries (Lillehoj2012NEU1). NEU1's activity at the plasma membrane involves desialylation, which affects receptor function and cellular interactions, such as cell adhesion and migration (Lillehoj2012NEU1; Lee2014NEU1).

NEU1's function extends to influencing angiogenesis by desialylating CD31, impairing capillary-like tube formation in endothelial cells (Lee2014NEU1). Its role in healthy human cells includes modulating the sialylation of cell surface proteins, affecting processes like cell adhesion, migration, and immune responses (Hyun2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NEU1 gene are primarily associated with sialidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of sialylated glycoproteins and oligosaccharides. Sialidosis is divided into two types based on severity: Type I, a milder form with adult onset, and Type II, a more severe form with congenital or infantile onset (Maroofian2018Parental). Clinical manifestations of sialidosis include myoclonus, ataxia, seizures, and visual impairments, often accompanied by cherry-red spots in the retina (Aravindhan2018Child; Fan2020Clinical). 

Specific mutations in NEU1, such as Tyr370Cys and Gly227Arg, have been linked to varying clinical severities, with some mutations leading to catalytically inactive enzymes despite normal localization (Bonten2000Novel). The mutation p.R347Q has been identified in patients exhibiting molecular phenotypes of sialidosis, highlighting the importance of conserved residues for enzyme activity (Kwak2015Biochemical). 

Altered NEU1 expression is also implicated in cancer progression and metastasis, although the precise mechanisms remain under investigation. The identification and characterization of NEU1 mutations are crucial for accurate molecular diagnoses and understanding the clinical significance of these genetic alterations (Bonardi2014In).

## Interactions
NEU1 (neuraminidase 1) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and receptor activation. NEU1 is a component of the elastin receptor complex (ERC), which includes the elastin binding protein (EBP) and protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA). This complex is crucial for the desialylation of glycoproteins, affecting receptor activation and signaling pathways (Duca2007The; Bocquet2021Characterization).

NEU1 interacts with integrins, such as integrin beta-4 and beta-2, modulating their sialylation and influencing processes like cell adhesion and migration. In monocytes, NEU1 interacts with β2 integrin, enhancing monocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration (Bennasroune2019Elastic; Bocquet2021Characterization). NEU1 also interacts with CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, affecting the uptake of oxidized LDL by macrophages, which is significant in atherosclerosis (Kawecki2018Identification).

NEU1 is involved in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MUC1 protein signaling in human airway epithelial cells. It desialylates EGFR, affecting its activation and downstream signaling (Lillehoj2012NEU1). NEU1 also interacts with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which is essential for the activation of neurotrophin Trk receptors and cellular signaling (Bennasroune2019Elastic). These interactions highlight NEU1's central role in modulating cell receptor signaling and its involvement in multiprotein complexes.
