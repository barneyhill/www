# XRCC3

## Overview
The XRCC3 gene encodes the X-ray repair cross complementing 3 protein, a crucial component of the RAD51 family involved in DNA repair through homologous recombination. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, a critical process for preventing chromosomal aberrations and ensuring proper cell division (Yoshihara2004XRCC3). XRCC3 functions by forming complexes with other proteins, such as RAD51C, to promote homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange, essential steps in recombinational repair (Kurumizaka2001Homologous-pairing). The protein's interactions and structural features, including its unique N-terminal domain and conserved C-terminal domain, enable it to regulate RAD51 filament formation and stability, further underscoring its role in DNA repair and replication (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3). Mutations in XRCC3 have been linked to increased cancer susceptibility, highlighting its significance in tumor suppression and genomic integrity (Namazi2015Association; Brenneman2000XRCC3).

## Structure
The XRCC3 protein is a member of the RAD51 family, involved in DNA repair through homologous recombination. Its structure includes a unique N-terminal domain (NTD) that forms a distinct interface with RAD51C, facilitated by a unique linker polymerization motif. This motif allows XRCC3 to act like a C-clamp, increasing the interface area with RAD51C, which is crucial for its function in DNA repair and replication processes (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3).

XRCC3 features a conserved pocket in its C-terminal domain (CTD) that interacts with the RAD51 polymerization motif, specifically the phenylalanine (F86) residue. This interaction is essential for the formation and stabilization of RAD51 filaments, which are critical for DNA repair (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3). The protein's structure is characterized by its ability to cap RAD51 filaments at the 5' end, regulating filament growth and stability (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate XRCC3's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's quaternary structure involves its interaction with RAD51C, forming a complex that plays a significant role in DNA replication and repair (Longo2023RAD51CXRCC3).

## Function
The XRCC3 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the RAD51 family, which plays a critical role in homologous recombination, a high-fidelity DNA repair mechanism essential for maintaining chromosome stability in human cells (Yoshihara2004XRCC3). XRCC3 is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by promoting homologous recombination between sister chromatids, a process vital for eliminating chromosome aberrations before cell division (Yoshihara2004XRCC3). The protein assists Rad51 in homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange, which are crucial steps in recombinational repair (Yoshihara2004XRCC3).

XRCC3 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins involved in homologous recombination, such as replication protein A (RPA) and Rad52, to maintain genomic stability (Yoshihara2004XRCC3). It also plays a role in preventing endoreduplication, a process where DNA replication occurs without cell division, leading to increased DNA content in cells (Yoshihara2004XRCC3). XRCC3's function is crucial for cell survival, as its deficiency leads to defects in recombination, increased chromosomal aberrations, and heightened sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents (Yoshihara2004XRCC3; Cui1999The). These activities underscore XRCC3's importance in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing mutations that could lead to cancer.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the XRCC3 gene have been associated with increased susceptibility to various cancers. The XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism, resulting from a C18067T transition, is one of the most studied variants. This polymorphism has been linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer, particularly in Asian populations, and is thought to affect enzyme function and interaction with other proteins involved in DNA repair (Namazi2015Association). The same variant has also been associated with bladder cancer risk, especially among Asian populations, with significant associations observed in certain genetic models (Peng2013DNA).

In the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the XRCC3 241M variant has been correlated with the age of onset and increased levels of DNA adducts, which may influence cancer development (Farnebo2015DNA). Additionally, the XRCC3 rs861539 SNP has been linked to oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, with increased risk observed in individuals exposed to smoking and alcohol (Santos2018Clinicopathological).

XRCC3 mutations can lead to chromosomal instability and impaired cell viability, contributing to tumorigenesis. These defects are often associated with increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, highlighting XRCC3's potential role as a tumor suppressor (Brenneman2000XRCC3).

## Interactions
XRCC3 is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions essential for DNA repair through homologous recombination. It forms a stable complex with Rad51C, a Rad51 paralog, with a 1:1 stoichiometry. This complex is crucial for catalyzing homologous pairing and exhibits both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA binding activities (Kurumizaka2001Homologous-pairing). XRCC3 does not interact with Rad51 directly but is involved in the formation of two distinct complexes: one with Rad51C and another with Rad51B, Rad51D, and XRCC2, indicating its role in multiple protein assemblies (Wiese2002Interactions).

XRCC3 also interacts with the BLM protein, where it plays a role in the formation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in BLM-deficient cells. This interaction suggests that XRCC3 functions in a DNA repair pathway distinct from the canonical recombinational repair pathway (Otsuki2007Functional). Additionally, XRCC3 is part of a complex with FANCG and BRCA2, where it interacts with FANCG independently of the FA core complex, highlighting its role in stabilizing protein interactions necessary for DNA repair (Hussain2006Tetratricopeptidemotifmediated). These interactions underscore XRCC3's importance in maintaining genomic stability and its involvement in various DNA repair processes.
