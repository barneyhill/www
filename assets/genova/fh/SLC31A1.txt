# SLC31A1

## Overview
The SLC31A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 31 member 1 (CTR1), which functions as a high-affinity copper transporter in humans. This transmembrane protein is integral to maintaining copper homeostasis by facilitating the uptake of copper ions into cells. CTR1 is characterized by its three transmembrane domains and forms a homotrimeric complex that creates a channel for copper transport across the cell membrane (Kim2013SLC31; Petris2004The). The protein's structure includes methionine-rich motifs at the N-terminus, which are crucial for copper binding, and a conserved HCH motif at the C-terminus, essential for its function (Curnock2020Mammalian; Petris2004The). CTR1 is not only pivotal in copper uptake but also plays a role in the cellular accumulation of platinum-based anti-cancer drugs, such as cisplatin, highlighting its significance in both physiological and clinical contexts (Kim2013SLC31).

## Structure
The SLC31A1 gene encodes the CTR1 protein, a high-affinity copper transporter in humans. The primary structure of CTR1 consists of approximately 190 amino acids, featuring three transmembrane domains that are crucial for its function (Kim2013SLC31). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices that span the membrane, facilitating copper transport (Kim2013SLC31). 

In its quaternary structure, CTR1 forms a homo-trimer, creating a channel-like architecture essential for copper uptake. This trimerization is stabilized by a conserved GXXXG motif, which is critical for the formation of the functional multimer (Kim2013SLC31). The extracellular N-terminus of CTR1 contains methionine-rich regions, known as 'Mets' motifs, which are important for copper binding and uptake (Petris2004The). 

Post-translational modifications, such as N- and O-glycosylation at the extracellular N-terminus, may influence the protein's assembly, trafficking, and activity (Kim2013SLC31). The C-terminal region includes a conserved HCH motif, which is significant for the protein's function and copper binding (Curnock2020Mammalian). These structural features enable CTR1 to efficiently transport copper ions across the cell membrane without energy dependence (Kim2013SLC31).

## Function
The SLC31A1 gene encodes the copper transporter protein CTR1, which is essential for copper uptake in human cells. CTR1 is a high-affinity copper transporter that facilitates the entry of copper ions into cells, a critical function for maintaining copper homeostasis. This protein is characterized by three transmembrane domains and forms a homotrimeric complex that creates a channel for copper transport across the cell membrane (Maryon2007OLinked; Petris2004The). The N-terminal domain of CTR1 is rich in methionine residues, which are crucial for binding and scavenging copper from the extracellular environment (Maryon2007OLinked; Petris2004The).

CTR1 is primarily localized at the plasma membrane but can also be found in cytoplasmic vesicular compartments in some cell lines (Kim2013SLC31). It plays a significant role in copper uptake in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and intestines, where it is involved in dietary copper absorption (Kim2013SLC31; Öhrvik2014How). The protein's activity is regulated by copper levels, with higher expression under copper-deficient conditions and endocytosis triggered by elevated extracellular copper (Kim2013SLC31; Clifford2016Dynamic). CTR1 is also involved in the cellular accumulation and toxicity of platinum-based anti-cancer drugs like cisplatin, although the mechanisms for copper and cisplatin transport are distinct (Kim2013SLC31).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC31A1 gene, also known as solute carrier family 31 member 1, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in copper homeostasis and the novel cell death mechanism known as cuproptosis. Alterations in SLC31A1 expression are linked to poor prognosis in several cancers, including glioma, breast cancer, and adrenocortical carcinoma. In glioma, high SLC31A1 expression is associated with worse overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival, and it correlates with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Wang2023Cuproptosisrelated). In breast cancer, elevated SLC31A1 levels are linked to poorer overall and progression-free survival, making it an independent prognostic factor (Li2022High).

Mutations in SLC31A1 are observed in various cancers, with uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma showing the highest mutation rate. These mutations may contribute to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance, particularly in gynecological tumors and breast cancer (Qi2023Cuproptosisrelated). The gene's expression also influences immune cell infiltration, affecting tumor progression and patient prognosis (Qi2023Cuproptosisrelated; Kong2023Systematic). These findings suggest that SLC31A1 could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
SLC31A1, also known as CTR1, is a high-affinity copper transporter that plays a crucial role in copper homeostasis by facilitating copper uptake into cells. It interacts with several proteins involved in copper transport and regulation. One of its key interactions is with the copper chaperone ATOX1, which transfers copper to ATPases such as ATP7A and ATP7B. This interaction is copper-dependent and essential for the proper distribution of copper within the cell (Öhrvik2014How; Curnock2020Mammalian).

SLC31A1 is also involved in a protein-protein interaction network that includes the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS), PIK3CA, and SLC31A2, which are part of the copper homeostasis pathway. These interactions suggest that SLC31A1 may influence cancer progression through metabolic and copper-related processes (Kong2023Systematic).

In the context of cancer, SLC31A1 expression is modulated by the RNA-binding protein PTBP1, which binds to SLC31A1 mRNA and affects its stability. This interaction plays a role in the chemoresistance of osteosarcoma to cisplatin, as PTBP1 knockdown leads to increased SLC31A1 expression and enhanced cisplatin uptake (Cheng2020PTBP1).
