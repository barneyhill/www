# RIGI

## Overview
The RIGI gene encodes the RIG-I protein, a pivotal component of the innate immune system, functioning as a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor (PRR). RIG-I is primarily involved in detecting viral RNA within the cytoplasm, thereby playing a crucial role in antiviral defense mechanisms. Structurally, RIG-I is characterized by its N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), a central DExD/H-box helicase domain, and a C-terminal domain (CTD), which are essential for its function in RNA binding and signaling (Batool2021Structural; Fan2019Structures). Upon recognition of viral RNA, RIG-I undergoes conformational changes that facilitate interactions with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), triggering a signaling cascade that results in the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Rehwinkel2020RIG-I-like). The activity of RIG-I is finely regulated by post-translational modifications, ensuring a balanced immune response (Arimoto2007Negative). Mutations in the RIGI gene have been implicated in various diseases, including colon cancer and Singleton-Merten syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Song2022Mutant; Prasov2021DDX58(RIGI)).

## Structure
The RIG-I protein, encoded by the human gene RIGI, is a crucial component of the innate immune system, responsible for detecting viral RNA. Structurally, RIG-I is composed of several domains: two N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), a central DExD/H-box helicase domain, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Batool2021Structural; Fan2019Structures). The helicase domain includes Hel1, Hel2, and an insertion domain, which are essential for RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis (Batool2021Structural; Fan2019Structures). The CTD is involved in RNA recognition, particularly binding to 5' triphosphate dsRNA, and contains a zinc-binding domain (Fan2019Structures; Brisse2019Comparative).

The primary structure of RIG-I includes conserved residues crucial for its function, such as those involved in RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis (Fan2019Structures). The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, particularly in the CTD, which has a flat topology stabilized by hydrophobic residues and a conserved zinc-binding motif (Batool2021Structural). Tertiary structure involves the helicase domain forming a compact fold that undergoes conformational changes upon RNA binding (Kolakofsky2012A). Quaternary structure includes interactions with other proteins, such as the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), facilitated by the exposure of CARDs upon activation (Kolakofsky2012A).

Post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation, regulate RIG-I's activity, influencing its interaction with MAVS and subsequent signaling pathways (Fan2019Structures; Feng2012Structural). These structural features and modifications are critical for RIG-I's role in antiviral defense.

## Function
RIG-I (Retinoic acid-inducible gene I) is a crucial component of the innate immune system, functioning as a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that detects viral RNA. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm of cells, where it recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), specifically RNA from viruses, such as those with a 5'-triphosphate motif (Liu2017Host; Kell2015RIG-I). Upon binding to viral RNA, RIG-I undergoes a conformational change that exposes its caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), which are essential for signaling (Rehwinkel2020RIG-I-like). This activation leads to the interaction with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), initiating a signaling cascade that activates transcription factors like IRF3 and NF-κB (Liu2017Host; Kell2015RIG-I).

These transcription factors translocate to the nucleus, inducing the expression of type I interferons and other antiviral genes, establishing an antiviral state in the infected cell and surrounding tissue (Kell2015RIG-I). RIG-I's activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications, such as ubiquitination by TRIM25, which is crucial for its signaling function (Liu2017Host). This regulation ensures a balanced immune response, preventing excessive cytokine production and maintaining immune homeostasis (Arimoto2007Negative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RIG-I (DDX58) gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In colon cancer, frameshift mutations in RIG-I lead to increased susceptibility to colitis-related colon cancer and enhanced inflammatory responses. These mutations disrupt RIG-I mRNA translation and alter its pre-mRNA structure, impairing its interaction with DHX9 and inducing the generation of a circular RNA, circRIG-I. CircRIG-I is upregulated in colon cancers and is associated with poor outcomes, as it interacts with DDX3X to activate a signaling cascade that results in type I IFN transcription and inflammatory damage (Song2022Mutant).

RIG-I mutations are also linked to Singleton-Merten syndrome (SMS), a disorder characterized by dental and skeletal abnormalities, and type I interferonopathy, where type I IFN upregulation plays a central role (Song2022Mutant). The DDX58 p.(Glu510Val) variant is associated with a broad spectrum of ocular and systemic phenotypes, including glaucoma, and is characterized by tissue-specific activation of interferon pathways (Prasov2021DDX58(RIGI)related page 0 of 5; Prasov2021DDX58(RIGI)related page 4 of 5).

In dermatomyositis, RIG-I is significantly over-expressed in pathological muscle fibers, suggesting its role in the disease's pathogenesis (Suárez‐Calvet2014Altered). Additionally, a new pathogenic variant of DDX58 is linked to lupus nephritis due to RIG-I hyperactivation, leading to an inappropriate immune response (Peng2022Clinical).

## Interactions
RIG-I interacts with viral RNA through its helicase domain and C-terminal domain (CTD), which are crucial for RNA recognition and binding. The CTD specifically recognizes the 5′-triphosphate motif on double-stranded RNA, a key signature for RIG-I activation (Batool2021Structural; Liu2017Host). Upon binding to viral RNA, RIG-I undergoes conformational changes that release its caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), facilitating interactions with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) through CARD-CARD interactions. This interaction is essential for initiating downstream signaling pathways that lead to the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Liu2017Host; Thoresen2021The).

RIG-I's activation and signaling are regulated by post-translational modifications. Ubiquitination of RIG-I, particularly K63-linked ubiquitination by E3 ligases such as TRIM25 and Riplet, enhances its signaling activity by promoting the formation of RIG-I oligomers and filaments necessary for effective signal transmission to MAVS (Thoresen2021The). Additionally, RIG-I interacts with regulatory proteins that modulate its activity, such as SEC14L1, which competes with MAVS for RIG-I CARD binding, and ISG15, which negatively regulates RIG-I signaling in a feedback-loop manner (Liu2017Host).
