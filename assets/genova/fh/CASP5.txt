# CASP5

## Overview
Caspase-5 (CASP5) is a gene that encodes the protein caspase-5, a member of the inflammatory caspase subfamily of cysteine proteases. This protein plays a crucial role in the body's immune response, particularly in the non-canonical inflammasome pathway, which is activated by the presence of lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria. Caspase-5 is involved in the cleavage of gasdermin D, leading to pyroptosis and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 alpha and beta. The CASP5 gene is characterized by multiple mRNA variants due to alternative splicing, and the protein itself is subject to post-translational modifications that regulate its activity. Caspase-5 is primarily expressed in tissues exposed to pathogens, such as the skin, and is implicated in various inflammatory and immune-related conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and certain cancers (Rui2018The; Eckhart2024Caspase-5:; Viganò2015Human).

## Structure
Caspase-5 (CASP5) is a member of the proinflammatory protease subfamily, characterized by its involvement in the inflammatory response. The CASP5 gene consists of 10 exons, with alternative splicing resulting in at least six mRNA variants, including CASP5/a and CASP5/b, which are the main isoforms. CASP5/a mRNA contains all exons, while CASP5/b lacks the second exon (Eckhart2024Caspase-5:). The caspase-5 protein structure includes an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and a caspase domain. A shorter isoform, CASP5/c, lacks the CARD (Eckhart2024Caspase-5:).

The primary structure of caspase-5 includes a catalytic dyad with residues H267 and C315, and R371 is involved in substrate binding. Aspartate residues are predicted to be sites of proteolytic cleavage (Eckhart2024Caspase-5:). The secondary structure features beta-sheets and alpha-helices, contributing to its tertiary structure, which involves the formation of a homodimer. Caspase-5 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as cleavage for activation (Eckhart2024Caspase-5:).

Caspase-5 forms large protein complexes known as inflammasomes, crucial for its activation and function, leading to pyroptosis and the maturation of interleukin-1 family cytokines (Eckhart2024Caspase-5:).

## Function
Caspase-5 (CASP5) is a protease that plays a significant role in the inflammatory response in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the non-canonical inflammasome activation pathway, which is distinct from the canonical NLRP3-dependent pathway. This process is initiated by the detection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, leading to the activation of caspase-5 through its caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) (Eckhart2024Caspase-5:; Viganò2015Human).

Upon activation, caspase-5 cleaves gasdermin D, facilitating the formation of pores in the cell membrane. These pores allow the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1a) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b), contributing to the inflammatory response and pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (Eckhart2024Caspase-5:; Viganò2015Human). Caspase-5 is primarily expressed in tissues in contact with pathogens, such as the skin, and is crucial for the defense against infections, particularly those caused by Gram-negative bacteria (Viganò2015Human).

In human monocytes, caspase-5 is rapidly processed upon LPS stimulation, leading to the secretion of IL-1 cytokines without the need for additional signals, highlighting its role in the rapid activation of the immune response (Viganò2015Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CASP5 gene have been associated with several diseases, primarily due to its role in inflammation and immune response. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), CASP5 polymorphisms, particularly the rs9651713 variant, have been linked to an increased risk of the disease. The gene's involvement in the regulation of inflammatory responses and apoptotic processes suggests its contribution to RA pathology (Rui2018The).

CASP5 is also implicated in cancer risk. A meta-analysis identified the rs3181320*C allele in the CASP5 gene as being associated with an increased risk of various cancers, highlighting its role in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to cancer development (PAN2013CASP1).

In lung cancer, the CASP5 Val318Leu polymorphism has been studied for its potential role in predisposition to the disease. Although initial findings suggested a possible association, extended analyses did not confirm a statistically significant link, indicating the need for further research (Ulybina2009Coding).

Additionally, increased expression of CASP5 has been observed in Kawasaki Disease, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for distinguishing this condition from other febrile diseases (Rahmati2021CASP5).

## Interactions
Caspase 5 (CASP5) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of inflammation and programmed cell death. CASP5 interacts with caspase-3 in human periodontal ligament cells under mechanical stress, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction suggests a regulatory relationship where the activity of one caspase influences the other, playing a cooperative role in stretch-induced programmed cell death (PCD) (Wu2019Interaction).

CASP5 is also a component of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway in human monocytes. It is activated in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, leading to the processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α and IL-1β. This activation involves interactions with the Syk/PLCγ pathway, which regulates calcium mobilization necessary for CASP5 processing (Viganò2015Human). CASP5's role in the inflammasome is distinct from that of caspase-4, as it is specifically processed in monocytes in response to LPS, indicating a unique pathway of inflammasome activation (Viganò2015Human). These interactions highlight CASP5's involvement in both apoptotic and inflammatory processes.
