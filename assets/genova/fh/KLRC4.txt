# KLRC4

## Overview
KLRC4, or killer cell lectin-like receptor C4, is a gene that encodes a receptor protein involved in the immune system, specifically in the regulation of natural killer (NK) cell activity. The protein encoded by KLRC4 is categorized as a receptor and is part of the NKG2 family, which plays a critical role in modulating the cytotoxic functions of NK cells. These cells are essential for immune surveillance, particularly in identifying and responding to virus-infected and tumor cells. The KLRC4 gene is located within the NK complex gene region on human chromosome 12p13 and is associated with the NKG2F receptor. Although the precise function of the NKG2F receptor remains to be fully elucidated, KLRC4 is known to interact with ligands such as the nonclassical MHC protein HLA-E, facilitating NK cell function. The gene is implicated in various immune-related pathways, including cytokine receptor binding and lymphocyte-mediated immunity, and has been associated with clinical conditions such as cancer and Behçet's disease (Tan2022Systematic; Yang2017Genetic; VazquezGonzalez2019Haplotype).

## Function
KLRC4, or killer cell lectin-like receptor C4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the immune response, particularly in the regulation of natural killer (NK) cell activity. KLRC4 is part of the NKG2 family of receptors, which are encoded within the NK complex gene region on human chromosome 12p13. These receptors play a crucial role in modulating the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, which are essential for immune surveillance and the response to virus-infected and tumor cells (VazquezGonzalez2019Haplotype).

The KLRC4 gene is associated with the NKG2F receptor, although the specific function of this receptor remains unclear. The NKG2 receptors, including KLRC4, interact with ligands such as the nonclassical MHC protein HLA-E, facilitating NK cell function in monitoring MHC class I molecule expression on target cells (VazquezGonzalez2019Haplotype). KLRC4 is involved in immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis, potentially playing a role in pathogen recognition and immune regulation (Yang2017Genetic).

In the context of immune-related pathways, KLRC4 is implicated in processes such as cytokine receptor binding, lymphocyte-mediated immunity, and regulation of T-cell-mediated immunity (Tan2022Systematic). However, the exact function of KLRC4 in healthy human cells has not been extensively detailed, indicating a need for further research to fully understand its role in normal physiological contexts (Yang2017Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
KLRC4, part of the killer cell lectin-like receptor family, plays a significant role in the immune system, particularly in the modulation of natural killer (NK) cell activity. Alterations in KLRC4 expression have been associated with various clinical implications. In breast cancer, high expression levels of KLRC4-KLRK1 are linked to better overall survival, particularly in stage III breast cancer and the luminal B subtype, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Tan2021Novel). The gene's involvement in enhancing NK cell cytotoxicity indicates its importance in cancer immune surveillance, and its axis is being explored as a target in cancer immunotherapy (Tan2021Novel).

In the context of genetically complex diseases, KLRC4 has been implicated in Behçet's disease, where genetic variants in this gene were identified through SNP imputation studies (Ombrello2014Genetics). Additionally, variations in KLRC4, such as those found in specific haplotypes, can influence NK cell activity, potentially affecting cancer risk. Certain haplotypes associated with KLRC4 are linked to higher NK cell activity and a lower risk of cancer, while others are associated with reduced activity and increased cancer risk (VazquezGonzalez2019Haplotype).

## Interactions
KLRC4, also known as NKG2F, is a member of the killer cell lectin-like receptor family and is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. It is involved in immune response regulation through its interactions with other proteins. KLRC4 is known to interact with DAP12, an adaptor protein that transmits activating signals, which suggests a role in modulating NK cell activity (Han2004KLRL1). This interaction is crucial for the transmission of signals that can either activate or inhibit NK cell functions, depending on the context of the immune response.

KLRC4 is also associated with immune response pathways such as the T Cell Receptor Signaling Pathway and Natural Killer Cell Mediated Cytotoxicity, indicating its involvement in broader immune regulatory networks (Tan2022Systematic). The gene is co-expressed with other immune-related genes like GZMA, KLRD1, NKG7, and TBX21, which are involved in cytokine receptor binding and lymphocyte-mediated immunity (Tan2022Systematic). These interactions highlight KLRC4's potential role in modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of diseases such as acute myocardial infarction and certain types of cancer.
