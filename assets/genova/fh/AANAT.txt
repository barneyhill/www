# AANAT

## Overview
The AANAT gene encodes the enzyme aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase, which is a key player in the biosynthesis of melatonin, a hormone that regulates circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles. This enzyme belongs to the GCN5-related family of N-acetyltransferases (GNATs) and is primarily found in the pineal gland and retina, where it catalyzes the acetylation of arylethylamines such as serotonin and dopamine (Coon2002Melatonin; Klein2007Arylalkylamine). The activity of AANAT is tightly regulated by cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation, which facilitates its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby stabilizing the enzyme and protecting it from degradation (Iuvone2005Circadian; Ganguly2002Control). This regulation is influenced by environmental light and the circadian clock, with enzyme activity peaking at night. Mutations or disruptions in the AANAT gene can lead to altered melatonin synthesis, impacting conditions such as sleep disorders and autism spectrum disorders (Pagan2017Disruption; Roseboom1998Natural).

## Structure
The human AANAT protein is involved in the biosynthesis of melatonin and exhibits a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function (Ali2015Structural). The tertiary structure of AANAT is characterized by a three-dimensional folding pattern that is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This structure allows AANAT to undergo significant conformational changes upon substrate binding, which is unique compared to other acetyltransferases (Hickman1999The).

AANAT belongs to the GCN5-related family of N-acetyltransferases (GNATs) and contains conserved sequence motifs that are essential for its function. These motifs include a conserved cofactor binding site and a novel structure for serotonin binding (Wolf2002Xray). The enzyme's activity is regulated by its ability to undergo conformational changes, which may be influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Ali2015Structural).

The protein also interacts with other proteins, such as the 14-3-3 protein, which can affect its function and stability. A specific mutation in AANAT, A129T, is associated with delayed sleep phase syndrome, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper physiological function (Ali2015Structural).

## Function
Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the acetylation of arylethylamines, such as serotonin and dopamine, in human cells. This enzyme is crucial for the synthesis of melatonin, a hormone that regulates circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles. AANAT catalyzes the conversion of serotonin to N-acetylserotonin, which is subsequently converted to melatonin (Coon2002Melatonin; Klein2007Arylalkylamine).

AANAT's activity is regulated by cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation, which facilitates its binding to 14-3-3 proteins. This binding activates the enzyme and protects it from proteasomal degradation, ensuring high levels of activity at night when melatonin synthesis is required (Iuvone2005Circadian; Ganguly2002Control). The enzyme's regulation is influenced by environmental lighting and the circadian clock, with its activity peaking at night (Klein2007Arylalkylamine).

In addition to its role in the pineal gland, AANAT is also expressed in the retina, where it may participate in local signaling and neurotransmission, potentially involving dopamine acetylation (Klein2007Arylalkylamine). This dual role highlights AANAT's importance in both systemic and local cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AANAT gene can significantly impact melatonin synthesis, leading to various clinical implications. In the C57BL/6J mouse strain, a natural mutation in the AANAT gene results in a truncated, inactive protein due to a 102 base pair insert in the mRNA. This mutation leads to a 'knockdown' of melatonin production, which may influence reproduction and circadian rhythms (Roseboom1998Natural). 

In humans, disruptions in AANAT activity have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Studies have shown decreased AANAT activity in individuals with ASD, contributing to a global disruption of melatonin synthesis. This enzymatic deficit is linked to decreased levels of 14-3-3 proteins, which regulate AANAT activity, and increased levels of miR-451, which targets 14-3-3ζ (Pagan2017Disruption). Although rare genetic variants in AANAT are found in some individuals with ASD, they do not fully account for the high frequency of melatonin deficits observed, suggesting that post-translational regulation plays a significant role (Pagan2017Disruption). These findings highlight the potential role of AANAT in sleep disorders and other conditions related to melatonin deficiency.

## Interactions
AANAT (aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase) interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which are crucial for its regulation and stability. The binding of AANAT to 14-3-3 proteins is phosphorylation-dependent, primarily at threonine 31 (T31) and serine 205 (S205). Phosphorylation at these sites enhances AANAT's affinity for 14-3-3, with dual phosphorylation significantly increasing this interaction compared to single-site phosphorylation (Ganguly2005Melatonin). The interaction with 14-3-3 proteins stabilizes AANAT, protecting it from proteasomal degradation and modulating its enzymatic activity (Ganguly2005Melatonin; Pozdeyev2006Photic).

The binding of AANAT to 14-3-3 proteins involves the central channel of the 14-3-3 dimer, where AANAT is stabilized by interactions with the phosphopeptide binding groove (Obsil2001Crystal). This interaction is crucial for maintaining a conformation that enhances substrate binding, thereby modulating AANAT's function (Obsil2001Crystal). The phosphorylation of T31 by PKA is particularly important, as it acts as a 'gatekeeper' for subsequent binding events (Ganguly2005Melatonin).

Light exposure affects the phosphorylation status of AANAT, leading to changes in its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and subsequent enzyme degradation (Pozdeyev2006Photic). This regulation is essential for controlling melatonin synthesis in response to environmental light conditions.
