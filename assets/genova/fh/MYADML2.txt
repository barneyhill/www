# MYADML2

## Overview
The MYADML2 gene encodes the protein myeloid associated differentiation marker like 2, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a differentiation marker, playing a role in the regulation of myeloid cell differentiation. The precise mechanisms by which MYADML2 influences cellular differentiation and its interactions with other cellular components are subjects of ongoing research. Understanding the function and regulation of MYADML2 is crucial for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease, particularly in conditions related to abnormal myeloid cell differentiation.
