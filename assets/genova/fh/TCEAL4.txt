# TCEAL4

## Overview
TCEAL4 is a gene located on the X chromosome at position Xq22.1, encoding the protein transcription elongation factor A-like 4. This protein is categorized as a nuclear phosphoprotein and is involved in the regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. TCEAL4 is expressed ubiquitously across various human tissues, indicating its fundamental role in maintaining normal cellular functions. The protein interacts with components of the ubiquitin proteasome system, such as USP7 and USP11, suggesting its involvement in transcription regulation, DNA replication, and repair processes. TCEAL4 is a member of the Bex/Tceal family, which is associated with critical cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Its downregulation in several cancer types, such as anaplastic thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer, points to a potential tumor-suppressive function (NavasPérez2020Characterization; Akaishi2006Downregulation; Querques2021S18phosphorylation).

## Function
TCEAL4 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcription regulation, particularly in the elongation phase of transcription by RNA polymerase II. It is expressed ubiquitously in normal human tissues, including the thyroid gland, heart, brain, and other organs, suggesting a role in maintaining normal cellular functions across various tissues (Akaishi2006Downregulation). TCEAL4 is located on chromosome Xq22.1 and is predicted to function as a nuclear phosphoprotein, modulating transcription in a promoter context-dependent manner (Akaishi2006Downregulation).

The protein is involved in nuclear processes such as transcription and interacts with several proteins, including USP7 and USP11, which are part of the ubiquitin proteasome system. These interactions suggest that TCEAL4 may influence transcription and other nuclear processes, potentially playing roles in DNA replication and repair (Querques2021S18phosphorylation). TCEAL4 exists in two species in cells, likely due to post-translational modifications like ubiquitylation and SUMOylation, which may direct its diverse cellular roles (Querques2021S18phosphorylation). The gene is part of the Bex/Tceal family, which is associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death, indicating its involvement in critical cellular processes (NavasPérez2020Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
The TCEAL4 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), TCEAL4 expression is significantly down-regulated compared to normal thyroid tissues and differentiated thyroid cancers, such as papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs). This down-regulation is observed in all examined anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines, suggesting a role in the transformation from differentiated to anaplastic thyroid cancers (Akaishi2006Downregulation). 

TCEAL4 is also frequently downregulated in ovarian and endometrial cancers, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive role. The interaction between TCEAL4 and USP7, a nuclear deubiquitylase, is crucial for forming specific protein complexes that may influence cancer progression. Alterations in USP7 phosphorylation and TCEAL4 ubiquitylation can modulate these interactions, potentially affecting cellular processes related to cancer (Querques2021S18phosphorylation).

The down-regulation of TCEAL4 in various cancer types, including hepatic, gastric, colon, ovarian, cervical, lung, urinary bladder, renal cell carcinomas, and neuroblastomas, suggests its broader relevance in cancer biology. The absence or under-expression of TCEAL4 in 51% of the 91 cancer cell lines examined highlights its potential clinical significance in cancer diagnosis or treatment (Akaishi2006Downregulation).

## Interactions
TCEAL4, a member of the transcription elongation factor A-like family, is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in transcription regulation and other cellular processes. It is a high-confidence interactor of USP7, a deubiquitylase, and shares significant identity with TCEAL2 (Querques2021S18phosphorylation). TCEAL4 predominantly localizes in the nucleus and is implicated in nuclear processes such as transcription. It forms complexes with USP7 and USP11, where USP7 stabilizes TCEAL4, and USP11 stabilizes a mono-ubiquitylated form of TCEAL4 (TCEAL4-Ub) (Querques2021S18phosphorylation). 

The interaction between TCEAL4 and USP7 is influenced by the phosphorylation state of USP7, particularly at the S18 site, which modulates the formation of specific protein complexes (Querques2021S18phosphorylation). TCEAL4-Ub is crucial for the interaction between USP7 and USP11, suggesting that TCEAL4 acts as a scaffold for these complexes (Querques2021S18phosphorylation). TCEAL4 is also associated with proteins involved in cellular responses to stimuli, stress, the cell cycle, and the ubiquitin proteasome system, indicating its diverse cellular roles (Querques2021S18phosphorylation). These interactions highlight TCEAL4's potential involvement in tumor suppression, as it is often downregulated in cancer (Querques2021S18phosphorylation).
