# EIF1AY

## Overview
The EIF1AY gene is a Y-linked gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A, Y-linked (eIF1A), a protein integral to the initiation phase of protein synthesis. This protein is categorized as a translation initiation factor and is involved in the stabilization of the initiator Met-tRNA binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit, facilitating the assembly of the ribosomal pre-initiation complex. EIF1AY is predominantly expressed in the testis, playing a crucial role in spermatogenesis, and is also found in other tissues such as the heart, where it exhibits male-biased expression patterns. The gene's expression is regulated by the evolutionary loss of a microRNA target site, leading to its upregulation in certain tissues. EIF1AY has been implicated in various cellular processes, including translation control and immune function, and is of particular interest in studies of male-specific conditions and cancers with Y chromosome loss (Yarahmadi2019Genotyping; Godfrey2020Quantitative; Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics).

## Function
The EIF1AY gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A, Y-linked (eIF1A), which is crucial for the initiation phase of protein synthesis. This protein is involved in stabilizing the binding of the initiator Met-tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit, facilitating the assembly of the ribosomal pre-initiation complex. It plays a role in the slippage of the 40S subunit along the mRNA, preventing interactions that might fix the mRNA on the ribosome, and enhances the formation of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation initiation factors (Yarahmadi2019Genotyping). The EIF1AY protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to efficient and accurate protein translation, impacting cellular growth and function (Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics).

EIF1AY is expressed at high levels in the testis and is essential for normal spermatogenesis, with its lack of expression associated with azoospermia (Yarahmadi2019Genotyping). It is also expressed in non-reproductive tissues, such as the heart, where it shows a male-biased expression pattern, potentially contributing to sex differences in heart function and disease (Godfrey2020Quantitative). The gene's expression is regulated by the evolutionary loss of a microRNA target site, leading to its upregulation in certain tissues (Godfrey2020Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance
The EIF1AY gene, located on the Y chromosome, has been implicated in several male-specific conditions, particularly related to fertility. Mutations and variations in the EIF1AY gene have been studied in the context of non-obstructive azoospermia, a condition characterized by a lack of sperm in the semen due to impaired sperm production. Research involving Iranian patients with idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia identified nucleotide variations in the EIF1AY gene, although no statistically significant differences were found between affected individuals and controls, suggesting these variations may not have a major clinical impact (Yarahmadi2019Genotyping).

Alterations in EIF1AY expression have also been observed in cryptorchidism, a condition where one or both testes fail to descend, potentially affecting fertility. Decreased mRNA levels of EIF1AY were noted in patients after treatment with GnRHa, indicating a possible role in the molecular mechanisms underlying this condition (GegenschatzSchmid2019Genes).

In cancer research, EIF1AY has been studied for its interactions with its X chromosome paralog, EIF1AX. Loss of the Y chromosome in cancer cells can lead to increased dependency on EIF1AX, suggesting that EIF1AY may play a role in genetic buffering and could be a target for therapeutic strategies in cancers with Y chromosome loss (Köferle2021Interrogation).

## Interactions
EIF1AY, a Y-linked gene encoding a eukaryotic translation initiation factor, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in translation initiation. It plays a role in stabilizing the initiator Met-tRNA to 40S ribosomal subunits, which is essential for the assembly of the translation initiation complex (Almsned2021Transcriptomic). The protein is also implicated in broader cellular pathways, including B cell activation, cell cycle regulation, and translation control, highlighting its involvement in immune functions and mRNA transcription and processing (Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics).

In the context of cancer, EIF1AY has been studied for its functional redundancy with its X chromosome paralog, EIF1AX. This redundancy is significant in cells with loss of the Y chromosome (LOY), where the presence of EIF1AY can buffer the loss of EIF1AX, suggesting a compensatory interaction between these paralogs (Köferle2021Interrogation). The interactions of EIF1AY with other proteins have been analyzed using databases like STRING, which identified its involvement in various protein-protein interactions, although specific partners are not detailed (Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics). These interactions underscore the importance of EIF1AY in maintaining cellular functions related to translation and immune response.
