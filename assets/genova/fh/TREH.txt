# TREH

## Overview
The TREH gene encodes the enzyme trehalase, a specialized hydrolase that plays a critical role in carbohydrate metabolism by catalyzing the hydrolysis of trehalose into two glucose molecules. Trehalase is categorized as a membrane-bound enzyme, predominantly located in the brush border membranes of the kidney and intestinal villi, where it facilitates the digestion and absorption of dietary trehalose. This enzymatic function is vital for maintaining glucose homeostasis and energy production, particularly in the small intestine. The activity of trehalase is regulated through phosphorylation, which is mediated by cyclic AMP-dependent pathways, ensuring its function aligns with the body's metabolic demands. Mutations or deficiencies in the TREH gene can lead to trehalase deficiency, resulting in gastrointestinal disturbances and potential implications for metabolic health (Elbein2003New).

## Function
The human gene TREH encodes the enzyme trehalase, which is responsible for hydrolyzing trehalose, a disaccharide, into two glucose molecules. This enzymatic activity is crucial for carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in the small intestine, where trehalase aids in the digestion of dietary trehalose, preventing digestive issues such as diarrhea in individuals with trehalase deficiency (Elbein2003New). Trehalase is specifically located in the kidney brush border membranes and intestinal villi membranes, highlighting its role in nutrient absorption and glucose homeostasis (Elbein2003New).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, with the neutral trehalase being activated by cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation. This regulation ensures that trehalase activity is modulated according to the body's metabolic needs (Elbein2003New). Trehalase's specificity for trehalose and its inability to act on other disaccharides underscore its specialized function in trehalose metabolism (Elbein2003New).

In humans, the proper functioning of trehalase is essential for metabolizing trehalose found in foods like mushrooms, thereby contributing to energy production and maintaining glucose levels in the body (Elbein2003New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the TREH gene, which encodes the enzyme trehalase, can lead to trehalase deficiency. This condition affects the digestion of trehalose, a disaccharide, into glucose, potentially causing gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Individuals with trehalase deficiency may experience difficulty in digesting foods containing trehalose, which is found in mushrooms, algae, and some processed foods.

Altered TREH activity has also been implicated in metabolic disorders. Since trehalase plays a role in glucose metabolism, changes in its activity may influence blood glucose levels and contribute to conditions like diabetes. The enzyme's ability to hydrolyze trehalose into glucose is crucial for maintaining normal glucose homeostasis. Disruptions in this process could lead to imbalances in glucose levels, thereby affecting metabolic health.

Research into TREH and its associated pathways continues to explore its broader implications in metabolic diseases. Understanding the clinical significance of TREH mutations and expression alterations is essential for developing targeted therapies and dietary recommendations for affected individuals.
