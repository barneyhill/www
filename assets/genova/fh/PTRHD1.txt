# PTRHD1

## Overview
The PTRHD1 gene encodes the protein peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase domain containing 1, which is implicated in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. This protein is characterized by its involvement in protein degradation processes, particularly through its ubiquitin-like domain-binding site. Mutations in the PTRHD1 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism and intellectual disability, with clinical manifestations including early-onset Parkinsonism, cognitive impairment, and other neurological symptoms. Research has identified specific mutations, such as a homozygous 28-nucleotide frameshift deletion and homozygous missense mutations, that correlate with these phenotypes, underscoring the gene's role in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders (Kuipers2018PTRHD1; Guadagnolo2021GenotypePhenotype; Niemann2019Juvenile).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTRHD1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism and intellectual disability. A study identified a homozygous 28-nucleotide frameshift deletion in the PTRHD1 coding region in a black South African family, linking this mutation to juvenile-onset parkinsonism and intellectual disability with genome-wide significant evidence (Kuipers2018PTRHD1). Similar phenotypes have been observed in Iranian families with homozygous missense mutations in PTRHD1, further supporting its role in these conditions (Guadagnolo2021GenotypePhenotype).

The clinical manifestations of PTRHD1 mutations include early-onset Parkinsonism, typically appearing between 20-30 years of age, and are often accompanied by intellectual disability. Symptoms can include bradykinesia, rest tremor, postural instability, gait disturbance, and cognitive impairment. Some patients also experience psychiatric problems, hypersomnolence, and saccadic ocular pursuit (Niemann2019Juvenile). The PTRHD1 gene encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, and pathogenic variants are located in the ubiquitin-like domain-binding site, suggesting a disruption in protein degradation processes as a potential mechanism for disease (Guadagnolo2021GenotypePhenotype). These findings highlight the significance of PTRHD1 in the pathogenesis of juvenile parkinsonism and intellectual disability.
