# LDHC

## Overview
Lactate dehydrogenase C (LDHC) is a gene that encodes the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase C, a member of the lactate dehydrogenase family of enzymes, which are critical in the metabolic process of converting pyruvate to lactate during anaerobic glycolysis. This enzyme is categorized as an isoenzyme and is predominantly expressed in the testes, where it plays a vital role in sperm metabolism and male fertility. The LDHC protein is structurally characterized by its tetrameric quaternary structure, which is common among lactate dehydrogenases, and is essential for its enzymatic function. LDHC is involved in the production of L-2-hydroxyglutarate, a metabolite important for sperm function, and interacts with other proteins to regulate energy production in sperm cells. Clinically, LDHC has been implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with disease prognosis and potential as a therapeutic target (Dodo2018Lactate; Naik2021Targetinga; Peng2022CancerTestis).

## Structure
The molecular structure of lactate dehydrogenase C (LDHC) is characterized by its tetrameric quaternary structure, which is common among lactate dehydrogenases. Each subunit of LDHC typically consists of an alpha/beta fold, a structural motif prevalent in dehydrogenases, contributing to its enzymatic function (Holmes2009Computational). The secondary structure of LDHC includes α-helix and β-sheet formations, particularly near key functional domains such as active site residues and binding sites for coenzymes and substrates (Holmes2009Computational). 

LDHC shares a high degree of sequence conservation with other LDH proteins across different species, indicating a similar structural framework. The gene encoding LDHC is organized with seven exons, and its intron-exon boundaries are conserved across various mammals, suggesting a stable genetic architecture (Holmes2009Computational). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in LDHC, potentially affecting its enzymatic activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure is crucial for its role in sperm metabolism, as it is primarily expressed in the testes (Holmes2009Computational).

## Function
Lactate dehydrogenase C (LDHC) is an isoenzyme primarily expressed in the testes and plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, particularly in sperm cells. It catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, facilitating anaerobic glycolysis, which is essential for ATP production in environments with low oxygen levels, such as the reproductive tract. This process is vital for sperm motility and male fertility, as LDHC deficiency can lead to reduced sperm motility and infertility (Dodo2018Lactate; Thomas2020Identification).

LDHC forms a homotetramer known as the LDHC or LDHX isoform and is structurally similar to other lactate dehydrogenase isoforms, sharing significant sequence homology with LDHA and LDHB. However, LDHC is unique in its tissue specificity, being predominantly expressed in mature testis and spermatozoa, with minimal expression in other tissues (Thomas2020Identification). In the testis, LDHC is involved in the production of L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG), a metabolite that accumulates in the testis and is crucial for sperm function (Dodo2018Lactate).

LDHC's activity is linked to the expression of a sperm-specific isoform of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), indicating a functional interaction between these enzymes in supporting lactate dehydrogenase activity in sperm (Dodo2018Lactate).

## Clinical Significance
The LDHC gene, encoding lactate dehydrogenase C, has significant clinical implications in cancer. In breast cancer, LDHC is upregulated, particularly in basal-like subtypes, which are associated with poor prognosis. Silencing LDHC in breast cancer cells leads to increased DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell cycle dysregulation, suggesting its role in maintaining genomic stability. This makes LDHC a potential therapeutic target, as its inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents like cisplatin and olaparib (Naik2021Targeting; Naik2021Targetinga).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), LDHC expression is also elevated and correlates with advanced clinical stages and poor prognosis. High LDHC levels in LUAD tissues are linked to shorter overall survival, making it an independent prognostic factor. LDHC expression in serum and serum-derived exosomes shows potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy (Peng2022CancerTestis).

Additionally, the methylation status of the LDHC promoter in breast cancer is associated with the expression of DNA methyltransferases, influencing patient prognosis. A demethylated LDHC promoter correlates with shorter survival times, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhang2021Correlation).

## Interactions
Lactate dehydrogenase C (LDHC) is known to interact with other proteins, particularly within the context of sperm function and male fertility. LDHC plays a crucial role in the expression of a sperm-specific isoform of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). In the absence of LDHC, there is a significant reduction in LDHA protein levels in sperm, despite normal mRNA levels, indicating a post-transcriptional regulation mechanism. This suggests that LDHC may influence the translation or stability of LDHA protein, potentially through mechanisms involving translational control or protein stability (Dodo2018Lactate).

LDHC is also involved in the production of L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG) in the testis, which may affect mRNA methylation and translation efficiency, further implicating LDHC in the regulation of protein expression (Dodo2018Lactate). The interaction between LDHC and LDHA is essential for maintaining glycolysis and energy production in sperm, which are critical for sperm motility and fertilization ability (Dodo2018Lactate). These interactions highlight the importance of LDHC in the metabolic pathways that support male fertility.
