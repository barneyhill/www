# DGKQ

## Overview
The DGKQ gene encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase theta, a member of the kinase family involved in lipid signaling pathways. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by catalyzing the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid (PA), thereby regulating signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization (Lingelem2020Diacylglycerol). Diacylglycerol kinase theta is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum and hippocampus, indicating its significance in neural function and synaptic activity (Chen2013GAK). The protein's structure includes several domains, such as cysteine-rich zinc-binding domains and a RAS-association domain, which facilitate its interactions and functional roles in cellular signaling pathways (Chen2013GAK). DGKQ's involvement in lipid metabolism and its genetic associations with diseases like Parkinson's disease and acute myeloid leukemia underscore its clinical relevance and potential as a therapeutic target (Gravina2023Role; Sakane2016Diacylglycerol).

## Structure
The DGKQ gene encodes an 882-amino acid protein that features several distinct domains contributing to its function. It contains three cysteine-rich zinc-binding domains, which are likely involved in structural stability and interaction with other molecules (Chen2013GAK). The protein also has an N-terminal proline- and glycine-rich region, which may play a role in protein-protein interactions or flexibility (Chen2013GAK). Additionally, DGKQ includes a RAS-association domain, suggesting a potential role in signaling pathways involving RAS proteins (Chen2013GAK).

DGKQ is involved in lipid signaling pathways, specifically catalyzing the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid. This function is facilitated by its catalytic domain and a C1 domain for DAG binding. The presence of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain indicates its involvement in membrane association and possibly in interactions with phosphoinositides (Flores-Leon2023More).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate DGKQ's activity, although specific details are not provided in the context. The gene may also produce splice variant isoforms, which could result in proteins with distinct functions, but specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The DGKQ gene encodes diacylglycerol kinase theta, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid signaling by phosphorylating diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). This conversion is significant in regulating various cellular functions, including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization (Lingelem2020Diacylglycerol). DGKQ is active in the cytoplasm and associated with cellular membranes, influencing processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

In healthy human cells, DGKQ is highly expressed in the cerebellum and hippocampus, suggesting its importance in brain function (Chen2013GAK). The enzyme's activity affects the trafficking and fusion of vesicles at synaptic terminals, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Alecu2019Dysregulated). DGKQ is also involved in glycerophosphoinositol turnover and lipid signaling, processes that are crucial for cellular signaling and membrane dynamics (Alecu2019Dysregulated).

The enzyme's function in lipid metabolism is further underscored by its involvement in the retrograde transport of proteins to the Golgi apparatus, a process influenced by changes in DAG and PA levels (Lingelem2020Diacylglycerol). This role in intracellular transport processes is essential for proper cellular function and organization.

## Clinical Significance
The DGKQ gene, encoding diacylglycerol kinase theta, has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In Parkinson's disease (PD), two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1564282 and rs11248060, located in the GAK/DGKQ region, have been associated with increased susceptibility. These SNPs have been identified as potential risk factors for PD, particularly in the Chinese population, where significant differences in genotype distributions and allele frequencies were observed (Chen2013GAK; Sakane2016Diacylglycerol).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DGKQ is overexpressed in tumor samples compared to normal tissue. High expression levels of DGKQ, along with other DGK isoforms, have been linked to poorer survival outcomes in AML patients, particularly in pediatric cases as observed in the TARGET database. However, the prognostic significance of DGKQ expression in AML remains to be fully elucidated, as it does not show a significant correlation with survival in all datasets (Gravina2023Role).

These findings suggest that DGKQ plays a role in the pathogenesis of both neurological and hematological disorders, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
DGKQ (diacylglycerol kinase theta) is involved in various protein interactions, particularly in the context of Parkinson's disease. It interacts with the blood-based protein SNCA, which is implicated in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis (Gu2023Expanding). DGKQ is also part of the dopamine network, relevant to Parkinson's disease, and is most expressed in glutamatergic neurons, suggesting its involvement in synaptic functions (Gu2023Expanding).

In the context of Ras-effector signaling, DGKQ is identified as an effector in the RhoGEF-RAC-PAK signaling pathway, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Catozzi2022Reconstruction). Despite being included in a large-scale binary Ras-effector signaling network, no specific interactors for DGKQ were identified in the databases used for the study (Catozzi2022Reconstruction).

DGKQ is also associated with the TMEM175/GAK/DGKQ locus, identified as a risk locus in Parkinson's disease, suggesting potential interactions with TMEM175, although these interactions require experimental confirmation (Tang2023Transmembrane). The role of DGKQ in lipid metabolism and its genetic links to Parkinson's disease further highlight its involvement in complex protein interactions (Flores-Leon2023More).
