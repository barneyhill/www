# TNFRSF1B

## Overview
TNFRSF1B is a gene that encodes the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1B (TNFR2), a transmembrane receptor involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. As a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, TNFR2 is characterized by its extracellular cysteine-rich domains, which facilitate binding to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and its role in mediating various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell survival, and proliferation (Mullin2007Bone; Stjernberg‐Salmela2004The). The receptor is predominantly expressed on immune cells and plays a critical role in modulating immune responses and maintaining homeostasis. TNFRSF1B is implicated in several pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders, and cancer, where it influences disease progression and therapeutic outcomes (Checa2024TNFRSF1B; Carvalho2024TNFRSF1B).

## Structure
The TNFRSF1B gene encodes the tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. The protein is characterized by an extracellular domain with cysteine-rich motifs, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain (Mullin2007Bone; Stjernberg‐Salmela2004The). The extracellular region contains three to six disulfide-linked domains, which are crucial for ligand binding (Mullin2007Bone). These cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) are involved in the interaction with TNF ligands and are characterized by a high density of disulfide bridges, typically three per CRD, which constrain their structure (Magis2012An).

TNFR2 can form homotrimers, which are essential for its signaling functions (Vanamee2020On). The receptor's structure includes a pre-ligand assembly domain (PLAD) that stabilizes the CRD2 domain, facilitating ligand binding (Magis2012An). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common, potentially affecting the receptor's function and interactions (Vanamee2020On). While splice variants may exist, leading to different isoforms, specific details on these variants are not provided in the context. The receptor's structure and modifications play a significant role in its function in immune regulation and cell survival (Stjernberg‐Salmela2004The).

## Function
TNFRSF1B, also known as TNF receptor superfamily member 1B, encodes a protein that is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. This receptor primarily binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and is involved in mediating immune and inflammatory responses. It plays a role in cell survival, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation. The protein is predominantly active in the cell membrane and influences processes such as immune regulation and inflammation, contributing to organismal homeostasis and defense mechanisms.

TNFRSF1B is involved in several critical cellular processes, including apoptosis and necroptosis, particularly in response to oxidative stress and inflammatory signals. It acts as a receptor in the TNF-TNFR pathway, a significant hub regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in inflammation (Checa2024TNFRSF1B). The receptor is implicated in apoptotic pathways and inflammatory signal transduction, with its blockade shown to protect cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death (Checa2024TNFRSF1B). TNFRSF1B also plays a role in the necroptotic cell death process, particularly in γ-irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where it is crucial for the pro-angiogenic effects observed in the secretome of these cells (Simader2019Tissueregenerative). Additionally, TNFRSF1B is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function during chondrogenic differentiation, where it influences the expression of genes related to mitochondrial morphology and function (Guo2023TNFα).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TNFRSF1B gene, which encodes the TNFR2 protein, have been linked to various diseases. In autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a specific variant known as M196R is associated with the disease, although its functional impact remains unclear (Li2018Association). In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFRSF1B, such as rs1061622 and rs1061624, are associated with increased susceptibility (Qasem2019Genetic). The rs3397 SNP in TNFRSF1B is linked to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) infection, and osteoporosis, with a significant association found between this SNP and reduced gene expression, increased MAP infection, and lower osteocalcin levels (Naser2019Polymorphisms).

In cancer, TNFR2 is expressed on regulatory T cells (Tregs) and is implicated in tumor progression and immune evasion. Its overexpression is observed in various cancers, including cutaneous melanoma, where specific TNFRSF1B variants are associated with poor prognosis (Carvalho2024TNFRSF1B). TNFR2's role in cancer immunotherapy is being explored, with potential strategies targeting its expression to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis (Vanamee2017TNFR2:).

## Interactions
TNFRSF1B, also known as TNF receptor type 2 (TNFR2), is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular signaling pathways. TNFRSF1B interacts with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligands, primarily TNF-alpha, and forms complexes with intracellular adaptor proteins such as TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF5. These interactions are essential for the receptor's role in inflammatory signal transduction and cell survival pathways (Arron2002TRAF‐Mediated).

The receptor is also involved in the necroptotic pathway, as indicated by its interaction with receptor-interacting protein kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation events that lead to necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (Simader2019Tissueregenerative).

TNFRSF1B's interaction with membrane-bound TNF (mTNF) is significant in the context of γ-irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), where it mediates necroptosis, contributing to the pro-angiogenic activity of the PBMC secretome (Simader2019Tissueregenerative). These interactions highlight TNFRSF1B's role in both promoting cell survival and mediating cell death, depending on the cellular context and signaling environment.
