# CBFA2T2

## Overview
CBFA2T2 is a gene that encodes the CBFA2/RUNX1 partner transcriptional co-repressor 2, a protein primarily involved in transcriptional regulation. This protein functions as a co-repressor and plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency and germline development by stabilizing key transcription factors such as PRDM14 and OCT4 on chromatin. The CBFA2T2 protein contains several domains, including the Nervy Homology Region 1 (NHR1) and Nervy Homology Region 2 (NHR2), which are essential for its protein-protein interactions and oligomerization capabilities. These structural features enable CBFA2T2 to participate in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing, influencing various cellular and developmental processes. Additionally, CBFA2T2 is involved in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into adipogenic and osteogenic lineages, highlighting its diverse functional roles. Alterations in CBFA2T2 expression have been associated with diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia and resistance to paratuberculosis in dairy cattle, underscoring its clinical significance (Luo2020CBFA2T2; Tu2016Corepressor; Sanchez2020Identification).

## Structure
The CBFA2T2 protein, also known as CBFA2/RUNX1 partner transcriptional co-repressor 2, is involved in transcriptional regulation and contains several important domains that facilitate its function. The protein includes the Nervy Homology Region 1 (NHR1) and Nervy Homology Region 2 (NHR2) domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. The NHR2 domain, in particular, forms a four-helix bundle tetrameric structure, essential for the oligomerization of CBFA2T2. This oligomerization is critical for stabilizing transcription factors such as PRDM14 and OCT4 on chromatin, which is important for maintaining pluripotency and germline development (Tu2016Corepressor).

The NHR2 domain's ability to oligomerize provides a larger interaction surface, which is necessary for the stable binding of transcription factors (Tu2016Corepressor). A specific mutation within the NHR2 domain, known as 'm7', disrupts this oligomerization, leading to a loss of CBFA2T2's ability to occupy target genes (Tu2016Corepressor). The protein's interaction with PRDM14 is facilitated by the NHR1 domain, which is necessary and sufficient for this interaction (Kawaguchi2019Cooption). The CBFA2T2 protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
CBFA2T2, also known as CBFA2/RUNX1 partner transcriptional co-repressor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily functioning as a co-repressor. This protein plays a significant role in regulating pluripotency and germline development. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), CBFA2T2 interacts with PRDM14, a germline-specific transcription factor, forming a complex that stabilizes PRDM14 and OCT4 on chromatin. This interaction is crucial for maintaining pluripotency and the differentiation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) (Tu2016Corepressor).

CBFA2T2 is also involved in the regulation of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). During adipogenic differentiation, CBFA2T2 expression is upregulated, and its knockdown results in decreased expression of adipogenic markers and inhibited lipid droplet formation, indicating its essential role in this process (Luo2020CBFA2T2). In osteogenic differentiation, CBFA2T2 is necessary for BMP-2-induced osteogenesis, as its depletion suppresses alkaline phosphatase activity and extracellular matrix mineralization (Huang2018CBFA2T2).

CBFA2T2 is active in the nucleus, where it participates in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing, contributing to normal cellular and developmental processes (Tu2016Corepressor).

## Clinical Significance
CBFA2T2 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in transcriptional regulation. Alterations in CBFA2T2 expression have been linked to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In particular, CBFA2T2 is involved in the adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and its knockdown inhibits this process, suggesting its potential role in metabolic disorders related to adipose tissue function (Luo2020CBFA2T2).

In the context of resistance to paratuberculosis in dairy cattle, CBFA2T2 has been identified as a candidate gene. This gene is associated with resistance to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, which causes paratuberculosis, a disease with significant economic impact in the dairy industry (Sanchez2020Identification).

While the specific mutations or expression changes in CBFA2T2 related to human diseases are not detailed in the provided context, its role in transcriptional regulation and disease resistance in cattle suggests that alterations in CBFA2T2 could have significant clinical implications. Further research is needed to fully understand its impact on human health.

## Interactions
CBFA2T2 is a transcriptional co-repressor that interacts with various proteins to regulate gene expression. It forms a biochemical complex with PRDM14, a germline-specific transcription factor, and OCT4, a key pluripotency factor. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing these transcription factors on chromatin, which is essential for maintaining pluripotency and germline specification. CBFA2T2 oligomerizes to create a scaffold that supports the binding of PRDM14 and OCT4 to chromatin, enhancing their stability and function (Tu2016Corepressor).

The interaction between CBFA2T2 and PRDM14 is mediated by the pre-PR domain of PRDM14, which involves electrostatic interactions with basic amino acids on CBFA2T2. This interaction is necessary for the recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a role in transcriptional repression (Kawaguchi2019Cooption).

CBFA2T2 also participates in adipogenic differentiation by interacting with chromatin at the promoter of CEBPA, a transcription factor critical for adipogenesis. Knockdown of CBFA2T2 leads to increased levels of repressive histone marks, indicating its role in modulating chromatin structure and gene expression during adipogenesis (Luo2020CBFA2T2).
