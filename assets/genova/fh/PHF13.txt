# PHF13

## Overview
PHF13 is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 13, a chromatin-associated protein involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. The protein is characterized by a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which enables it to recognize and bind to specific histone modifications, particularly H3K4me2 and H3K4me3. This binding is crucial for its role as a transcriptional co-regulator, influencing gene expression by stabilizing transcriptional complexes at chromatin sites. PHF13 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and DNA damage response, and interacts with key components of the transcriptional machinery, such as RNA polymerase II and the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Its ability to modulate chromatin structure and gene activity highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases like cancer and HIV-1 infection (Chung2016PHF13; Sun2022PHF13; Hofmann2017Dual).

## Structure
PHF13, also known as SPOC1, is a chromatin-binding protein characterized by a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger at its C-terminal region, which is crucial for its interaction with methylated histones, specifically H3K4me2/3 (Chung2016PHF13; Hofmann2017Dual). The PHD domain of PHF13 contains a canonical Cys4-His-Cys3 (C4HC3) motif that coordinates two zinc ions, forming a well-conserved globular domain (Chung2016PHF13). The crystal structure of the PHF13 PHD domain in complex with the H3K4me3 peptide reveals that the peptide binds against the central double-strand anti-parallel beta-sheet of the PHF13 PHD domain, completing a three-stranded beta-sheet (Chung2016PHF13).

The trimethyl lysine 4 (K4me3) of the peptide is bound in an aromatic cage formed by residues F241, M246, and W255 of PHF13, and forms hydrogen bonds with M246 (Chung2016PHF13). The structure of PHF13 was determined using X-ray crystallography, with the PHD domain expressed in Escherichia coli and purified for crystallization studies (Chung2016PHF13). PHF13 also contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal and two PEST domains, which are involved in protein degradation (Hofmann2017Dual). The protein's ability to bind both DNA and methylated histones allows it to form multivalent chromatin interactions, playing a role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization (Chung2016PHF13).

## Function
PHF13 (PHD finger protein 13) is a chromatin-associated protein that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization in healthy human cells. It functions as a molecular reader of histone modifications, specifically recognizing and binding to H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 marks through its PHD domain. This interaction is essential for its role as a transcriptional co-regulator, influencing gene expression by stabilizing transcriptional complexes at chromatin sites (Chung2016PHF13).

PHF13 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and DNA damage response. It interacts with RNA polymerase II and components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), such as SUZ12, RBBP4, and RBBP7, suggesting its involvement in both activating and repressing gene expression (Chung2016PHF13). The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it binds to chromatin and DNA, facilitating the recruitment and stabilization of transcriptional machinery at active and bivalent promoters (Chung2016PHF13).

PHF13's ability to read specific histone modifications and its interactions with chromatin-associated proteins underscore its significant role in maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene activity, contributing to the proper functioning of cellular processes in healthy cells (Chung2016PHF13).

## Clinical Significance
PHF13 has been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer, due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In pancreatic cancer, PHF13 is highly expressed and associated with poor patient outcomes. Its expression is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival, as well as for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) driven by transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). Depletion of PHF13 in pancreatic cancer cells leads to reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and impaired EMT, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sun2022PHF13).

PHF13 also plays a role in HIV-1 infection. It acts as a virus restriction factor by condensing chromatin into heterochromatin, thereby reducing HIV-1 gene expression. However, the viral protein Vpr can degrade PHF13 to counteract its inhibitory effects on viral gene expression, highlighting a complex interaction between PHF13 and HIV-1 (Hofmann2017Dual).

Alterations in PHF13 expression or interactions can lead to significant biological consequences, including genomic instability and cancer progression. Its involvement in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization underscores its clinical significance as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by dysregulated gene expression (Chung2016PHF13).

## Interactions
PHF13, also known as PHD finger protein 13, is a chromatin-affiliated protein that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It acts as a molecular reader of H3K4me2/3, binding directly to these methylated histones and DNA, and indirectly associating with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and RNA polymerase II (RNA PolII) complexes (Chung2016PHF13). PHF13 interacts with components of PRC2, such as SUZ12, RBBP4, and RBBP7, and co-precipitates with RNA PolII/splicing complexes, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization (Chung2016PHF13).

PHF13 also plays a role in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer metastasis, where it interacts with EZH2, a subunit of PRC2, at poised chromatin regions. This interaction is crucial for the activation of TGFβ-stimulated genes involved in metastasis (Sun2022PHF13). In the context of HIV-1 replication, PHF13 is identified as a putative restriction factor, influencing viral integration and gene expression through its interactions with chromatin and transcriptional machinery (Hofmann2017Dual). These interactions highlight PHF13's multifaceted role in gene regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.
