# ODAD2

## Overview
The ODAD2 gene encodes the protein known as outer dynein arm docking complex subunit 2, which is a critical component of the outer dynein arm docking complex (ODA-DC) in cilia and flagella. This protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of motile cilia, which are essential for cellular movement and fluid flow across epithelial surfaces. As a part of the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, ODAD2 is integral to the proper localization and anchoring of outer dynein arms, facilitating effective ciliary motility. Beyond its structural role, ODAD2 is also involved in cellular signaling pathways, acting as a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is significant in inflammation and cancer. Mutations in ODAD2 have been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhou2023ODAD1; Zeng2023Outer; Alipourgivi2023Genetic).

## Structure


## Function
The ODAD2 gene, also known as armadillo repeat-containing protein 4 (ARMC4), encodes a protein that is a component of the outer dynein arm docking complex (ODA-DC) in cilia and flagella. This complex is essential for the proper assembly and function of motile cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that facilitate movement and fluid flow. The ODAD2 protein is active in the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, where it plays a critical role in ensuring effective motility and coordination of these structures (Zhou2023ODAD1).

In healthy human cells, ODAD2 functions as a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, a key transcription factor involved in inflammation and cancer. High expression of ODAD2 downregulates NF-κB-dependent genes, reduces NF-κB activity, and decreases cellular proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and migratory ability in vitro. In vivo, ODAD2 expression significantly decreases xenograft tumor growth, suggesting its potential tumor suppressor function in colorectal cancer (CRC) (Alipourgivi2023Genetic). Genetic alterations in ODAD2, including missense mutations and deletions, are found in approximately 7.0% of CRC patients, indicating its possible role in CRC initiation and progression (Alipourgivi2023Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ODAD2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. One of the primary conditions associated with ODAD2 mutations is primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormal organ positioning, and reduced fertility due to impaired ciliary movement. Studies in zebrafish and mice have demonstrated that ODAD2 is crucial for the proper localization and anchoring of outer dynein arms, and defects in this gene can lead to cilia immobility, contributing to PCD pathogenesis (Zeng2023Outer).

ODAD2 is also implicated in various cancers. It is differentially expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and frequently mutated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. In CRC, ODAD2 acts as a novel negative regulator of the NF-κB pathway, which is crucial in inflammation and cancer progression. High expression of ODAD2 downregulates NF-κB-dependent genes, reducing cellular proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Martin2022Using).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly related to hepatitis B virus (HBV), a specific polymorphism in ODAD2, rs7893462, has been identified as a risk factor. The AG genotype of this polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of death in HBV-HCC patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zeng2023Outer).

## Interactions
ODAD2, also known as Armadillo Repeat Containing 4 (ARMC4), is a component of the outer dynein arm docking complex (ODA-DC) in cilia. It plays a critical role in the proper localization and anchoring of outer dynein arms, which are essential for ciliary motility. ODAD2 is part of a pentameric docking complex that includes CCDC151, CCDC114, TTC25, ARMC4, and Calaxin. This complex is crucial for the docking of outer arm dyneins (OAD) onto ciliary doublet microtubules (DMT) in vertebrates (Yamaguchi2023Calaxin).

ODAD2 is required for the ciliary localization of Calaxin, suggesting that the components of the docking complex are targeted to cilia as pre-assembled units. This interaction is vital for the stabilization of the OAD-DMT interaction, with ODAD2 playing a significant role in the assembly and function of the dynein arms (Yamaguchi2023Calaxin). Mutations in ODAD2 can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) by affecting ciliary motility, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper ciliary function (Zeng2023Outer). The gene has also been implicated in various cancers, where it is differentially expressed or mutated, although specific protein interactions in these contexts are not detailed (Zeng2023Outer).
