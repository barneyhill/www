# C11orf96

## Overview
C11orf96 is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 96. This protein is characterized by its serine-rich composition and the presence of a DUF4695 domain, which is associated with various functional domains such as AlkB-like dioxygenase, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase, pleckstrin homology, and integrase catalytic domains. These associations suggest potential roles in DNA repair, oxidoreductase activity, membrane recruitment, and viral genome integration (Yang2022Molecular). The C11orf96 protein is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm, with notable expression in the kidney and spleen, indicating possible involvement in renal and immune functions (Yang2022Molecular). Although the specific functions of C11orf96 in healthy human cells are not fully understood, it is implicated in processes such as protein ubiquitination, transcriptional regulation, and ER stress-induced cell death (Yang2022Molecular). The gene's expression is modulated in response to viral infections and various cancer-related conditions, suggesting a broader role in cellular stress responses and disease mechanisms (Roška2020Differential; Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Structure
The C11orf96 protein is encoded by the 96th open reading frame on chromosome 11 and consists of 124 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 13.80 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.4 (Yang2022Molecular). The primary structure of C11orf96 is rich in serine, leucine, glutamic acid, arginine, and lysine (Yang2022Molecular). The secondary structure is composed of 61% α-helix, 4% β-turn, 33% random coil, and 2% extended chain (Yang2022Molecular). 

A notable feature of the C11orf96 protein is the DUF4695 domain, which spans amino acids 109-206. This domain is associated with several functional domains, including the Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase AlkB-like, Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase SDR, Pleckstrin homology domain, and Integrase catalytic domain, suggesting potential regulatory roles in DNA repair, oxidoreductase activity, membrane recruitment, and viral genome integration (Yang2022Molecular).

The protein is highly serine-rich, with 15 potential serine phosphorylation sites, indicating phosphorylation as a significant post-translational modification. This modification is crucial for signal transduction and protein interactions, potentially influencing processes like ER stress, protein ubiquitination, and gene transcription (Yang2022Molecular). The protein is expressed primarily in the cytoplasm, with high expression in the kidney (Yang2022Molecular).

## Function
The C11orf96 gene encodes a protein that is involved in several molecular processes, although its specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully understood. The protein is significantly upregulated following viral infection, suggesting a role in viral life cycles (Yang2022Molecular). It is rich in serine and contains multiple predicted phosphorylation sites, indicating potential involvement in post-translational modifications and signal transduction (Yang2022Molecular). The protein lacks a transmembrane structure and signal peptide but contains low complexity regions and a DUF4695 domain, which is associated with various functional domains such as AlkB-like, SDR, PH, and Integrase catalytic domains. These associations suggest potential regulatory roles in DNA repair, oxidoreductase activity, membrane recruitment, and viral genome integration (Yang2022Molecular).

C11orf96 is expressed in the cytoplasm and is highly expressed in the kidney, particularly in glomerular epithelial cells, suggesting a role in renal tubule formation (Yang2022Molecular). It is also expressed in the spleen, indicating potential involvement in immune responses (Yang2022Molecular). Protein interaction predictions suggest that C11orf96 may interact with proteins involved in ubiquitination, transcriptional regulation, and ER stress-induced cell death (Yang2022Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
C11orf96 has been implicated in various cancer-related processes and conditions. It is part of a group of genes that are preferentially down-regulated in multiple cancer types, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The protein encoded by C11orf96 may be involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress, protein ubiquitination, and gene transcription, which are critical pathways in cancer biology (Yang2022Molecular; Ershov2023Uncharacterized). 

In testicular germ cell tumors, C11orf96 expression is significantly down-regulated in certain cisplatin-resistant cell lines, indicating its potential involvement in chemoresistance mechanisms (Roška2020Differential). Additionally, C11orf96 has been identified as a potential prognostic marker in colorectal cancer, although specific clinical implications remain to be fully elucidated (Roška2020Differential).

The gene is also associated with viral infections, being significantly upregulated following such events, which suggests a role in the regulation of viral life cycles (Yang2022Molecular). Despite these associations, the precise clinical significance of C11orf96 in these contexts requires further investigation to fully understand its role in disease mechanisms.

## Interactions
The C11orf96 protein is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is predicted to interact with several proteins, including ZNF331, TM4SF19, CDCA7L, MARCH4, TMCO3, TMEM106C, and TMEM117, as identified using the STRING protein interaction prediction database (Yang2022Molecular). MARCH4, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, is involved in ubiquitination and endocytosis, suggesting that C11orf96 may play a role in protein ubiquitination modification. CDCA7L is associated with transcriptional regulation and apoptotic signaling pathways, indicating a potential role for C11orf96 in these processes as well (Yang2022Molecular).

C11orf96 is also associated with ER stress, as it interacts with TMEM117, a transmembrane protein involved in regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress (Yang2022Molecular). The protein is strictly distributed in the cytoplasm and is expressed in all tissues, with the highest levels in the kidney, suggesting a specific biological role in this organ (Yang2022Molecular). These interactions imply that C11orf96 is involved in complex cellular processes, including ER stress, protein ubiquitination, and gene transcription, although direct interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies (Yang2022Molecular).
