# ANKRA2

## Overview
ANKRA2, or ankyrin repeat family A member 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in protein-protein interactions. The protein, also named ANKRA2, is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular signaling and gene expression regulation. ANKRA2 is known to interact with class IIa histone deacetylases (HDAC4 and HDAC5), playing a critical role in transcriptional repression by recruiting these deacetylases to gene promoters. Additionally, ANKRA2 is implicated in the regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AhRR) and is involved in the endocytosis of signaling proteins through its interaction with the plasma membrane receptor megalin. The protein's function extends to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining cellular structure and function, with potential implications in disease contexts such as cancer and immune response regulation (Xu2012SequenceSpecific; Schwab2024p53; McKinsey2006Class; Oshima2007Molecular).

## Structure
The ANKRA2 protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which are common motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. ANKRA2 contains five ankyrin repeats at its C-terminus, designated ANK1 to ANK5, which stack together with four hairpin loops connecting them. These repeats form a linear solenoid architecture, contributing to the protein's secondary structure with helix-loop-helix conformations (Gao2020Structural; Xu2012SequenceSpecific). The ankyrin repeats create three hydrophobic pockets that are crucial for binding specificity, particularly recognizing the PxLPxI/L motif in various proteins such as HDAC4, megalin, and CCDC8 (Xu2012SequenceSpecific; Nie2015Ankyrin).

The tertiary structure of ANKRA2 is defined by these hydrophobic pockets, which accommodate specific residues from its binding partners, facilitating extensive hydrophobic interactions (Nie2015Ankyrin). The protein's binding surface is mostly neutral to negatively charged, contrasting with the positively charged binding groove of 14-3-3 proteins, which it can interact with in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Xu2012SequenceSpecific).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in modulating ANKRA2's interactions, particularly affecting its binding affinity and partner specificity (Xu2012SequenceSpecific). Splice variant isoforms of ANKRA2 may contribute to structural and functional diversity, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
ANKRA2, or ankyrin repeat family A member 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It contains ankyrin repeat domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing it to engage in cellular signaling and gene expression regulation. ANKRA2 interacts with the plasma membrane receptor megalin, which is involved in the endocytosis of extracellular signaling proteins, suggesting a regulatory role in megalin's function as a clearance receptor in the kidney (Xu2012SequenceSpecific).

In the nucleus, ANKRA2 interacts with class IIa histone deacetylases (HDAC4 and HDAC5), which are transcriptional corepressors. This interaction is crucial for modulating gene expression through histone deacetylation processes, as ANKRA2 can recruit HDAC5 to gene promoters, influencing transcriptional repression (McKinsey2006Class). ANKRA2 also acts as a corepressor for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AhRR), contributing to the transcriptional repression of genes like CYP1A1 under normal conditions (Oshima2007Molecular).

ANKRA2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining cellular structure and function. Its interactions with proteins like CCDC8, OBSL1, and CUL7 suggest a role in cellular processes related to protein ubiquitination and growth regulation, particularly in the context of 3M syndrome (Nie2015Ankyrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANKRA2 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, ANKRA2 is identified as a direct target of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and functions as a cofactor with RFX7 in regulating tumor suppressor genes. Non-synonymous mutations in ANKRA2 are significantly enriched in oral squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role for ANKRA2. However, only RFX7 mutations, not ANKRA2 mutations, have been associated with driver events in hematopoietic cancers (Schwab2024p53).

In cattle, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ANKRA2 gene have been linked to bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and the presence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). These genetic variations may influence the animal's ability to cope with these pathogens, indicating a role for ANKRA2 in immune response regulation (casas2011association).

ANKRA2 also interacts with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), such as HDAC4 and HDAC5, which are involved in transcriptional repression. This interaction suggests that ANKRA2 may play a role in regulating gene expression through its association with HDACs, although the clinical significance of this interaction remains unclear (McKinsey2006Class).

## Interactions
ANKRA2 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its ankyrin repeat domains, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. It specifically interacts with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), such as HDAC4 and HDAC5. These interactions are crucial for the localization and function of ANKRA2 within the cell. In the presence of HDACs, ANKRA2 localizes to the nucleus, but it redistributes to the cytoplasm upon CaMK signaling, which phosphorylates the HDACs and triggers their nuclear export (McKinsey2006Class).

ANKRA2 also acts as a corepressor in the transcriptional repression activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AhRR) complex. It is recruited alongside HDAC4 and HDAC5 to silence the CYP1A1 gene, playing a role in the AhR signaling pathway (Oshima2007Molecular).

Additionally, ANKRA2 interacts with the 3M syndrome protein CCDC8, recognizing a specific PxLPxL motif. This interaction is distinct from that of its paralog RFXANK, indicating specificity in its binding partners (Nie2015Ankyrin). ANKRA2's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and signal transduction.
