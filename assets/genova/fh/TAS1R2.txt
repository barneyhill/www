# TAS1R2

## Overview
The TAS1R2 gene encodes the taste 1 receptor member 2 protein, which is a critical component of the sweet taste receptor in humans. This protein is a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that forms a heterodimer with TAS1R3, enabling the detection of a wide array of sweet compounds, including natural sugars and artificial sweeteners (Smith2021Critically; Chandrashekar2006The). The TAS1R2 protein is characterized by a large extracellular N-terminal domain, which contains the primary binding site for sweet ligands, and a seven transmembrane domain, linked by a cysteine-rich domain (Smith2021Critically; Belloir2021Biophysical). Beyond its role in taste perception, TAS1R2 is expressed in various non-gustatory tissues, suggesting additional functions in nutrient sensing and metabolic regulation (Treesukosol2011The). Variations in the TAS1R2 gene have been linked to dietary preferences and metabolic conditions, highlighting its significance in both taste and health (RamosLopez2016Sweet; Motahari2024Association).

## Structure
The TAS1R2 protein is a component of the sweet taste receptor, functioning as a heterodimer with TAS1R3. It is a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a large extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) linked to a seven transmembrane domain (TMD) by a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) (Smith2021Critically; Belloir2021Biophysical). The NTD contains the primary binding site for sweet compounds, including natural sugars and high-potency sweeteners (Belloir2021Biophysical).

The secondary structure of TAS1R2 is predominantly α-helical, as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy, with approximately 66% α-helix and 18% β-sheet content (Belloir2021Biophysical). The protein predominantly exists as a dimer, which is significant for its function, as dimerization is required for agonist activation and G-protein coupling (Belloir2021Biophysical).

The quaternary structure involves the dimerization of TAS1R2 with TAS1R3, forming the functional sweet taste receptor. This dimerization is crucial for the receptor's ability to bind sweet ligands and activate signaling pathways (Smith2021Critically). The presence of a Venus flytrap domain (VFD) in TAS1R2 serves as the orthosteric-binding site for sweet ligands, accommodating a range of sweeteners (Smith2021Critically). The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may influence its folding and trafficking (Park2019Structural).

## Function
The TAS1R2 gene encodes a protein that forms a heterodimer with TAS1R3, functioning as a sweet taste receptor in humans. This receptor is a class C G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in detecting a wide range of sweet compounds, including natural sugars, artificial sweeteners, and sweet-tasting proteins (Smith2021Critically; Chandrashekar2006The). The TAS1R2 subunit is particularly important for recognizing different sweeteners and is involved in G protein coupling, specifically with Gα15, which is essential for signal transduction in taste cells (Xu2004Different).

The receptor's ligand-binding site is located in the Venus flytrap domain of TAS1R2, which is responsible for binding sweet ligands such as aspartame and neotame (Smith2021Critically). The TAS1R2/TAS1R3 complex is expressed in taste-receptor cells on the tongue, where it mediates the perception of sweetness, influencing dietary choices and energy intake (Treesukosol2011The; Chandrashekar2006The).

Beyond taste perception, TAS1R2 is also expressed in non-gustatory tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, suggesting a role in nutrient sensing and metabolic regulation (Treesukosol2011The). This broader expression pattern indicates that TAS1R2 may have additional functions related to glucose sensing and metabolic processes (Treesukosol2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the TAS1R2 gene have been associated with various metabolic and dietary conditions. The Val191Val variant of TAS1R2 is linked to higher carbohydrate intake and an increased risk of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) in the Mestizo population of West Mexico. Individuals with this genotype exhibit higher serum triglyceride levels and a greater prevalence of HTG, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (RamosLopez2016Sweet).

In the context of cancer, TAS1R2 mutations have been identified in approximately 5% of lung, colon, and stomach adenocarcinomas, suggesting a potential role in tumor biology. However, the direct link between TAS1R2 mutations and specific cancer outcomes remains unclear (Carey2022Impact).

The rs9701796 polymorphism in TAS1R2 has been associated with an increased risk of dental caries, particularly with the GG genotype, indicating a potential influence on oral health through dietary sugar intake (Motahari2024Association).

Additionally, the Ile191Val variant is characterized as a partial loss-of-function mutation, affecting sweet taste receptor function and potentially altering glucose metabolism, which may contribute to metabolic conditions (Serrano2021The).

## Interactions
The TAS1R2 protein forms a heterodimer with the TAS1R3 subunit to function as a sweet taste receptor. This receptor complex is unique among class C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its ability to interact with a wide variety of sweet compounds, although with low sensitivity (Behrens2016G). The TAS1R2/TAS1R3 heterodimer is activated by all sweet-tasting compounds in humans, with both subunits contributing to agonist interaction sites. The TAS1R2 subunit specifically interacts with compounds like aspartame, neotame, and monellin, while the TAS1R3 subunit interacts with the sweet modifying protein neoculin (Behrens2016G).

The primary binding site for sweet ligands is located in the Venus Flytrap (VFT) domain of TAS1R2, which interacts with sweet-tasting proteins such as brazzein and monellin (Behrens2018Structure–Function). The TAS1R2 receptor also interacts with G protein subunits, particularly gustducin, to initiate signal transduction pathways (Belloir2021Biophysical). The receptor's interaction with sweeteners involves conformational changes that lead to G protein activation, highlighting the importance of dimerization for receptor function (Belloir2021Biophysical).
