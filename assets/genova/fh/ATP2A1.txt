# ATP2A1

## Overview
The ATP2A1 gene encodes the ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transporting 1 (SERCA1), a crucial protein in the P-type ATPase family responsible for calcium ion transport in skeletal muscle cells. SERCA1 is primarily involved in the ATP-dependent translocation of calcium ions from the cytosol into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a process essential for muscle relaxation following contraction. This protein is particularly significant in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, where it predominates among SERCA isoforms, highlighting its vital role in muscle physiology and calcium homeostasis (Odermatt2000The; Guglielmi2013SERCA1). The ATP2A1 gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as Ebf3 and MyoD, ensuring its critical function in muscle-specific gene regulation (Jin2014Ebf). Mutations in ATP2A1 are linked to Brody disease, a rare myopathy characterized by impaired muscle relaxation, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Vattemi2010Brody).

## Structure
The ATP2A1 gene encodes the SERCA1 protein, a member of the P-type ATPase family, which is involved in calcium ion transport in skeletal muscle cells. The protein structure of SERCA1a, a major isoform, has been extensively studied. It consists of ten transmembrane helices and three cytoplasmic domains: the nucleotide-binding (N), phosphorylation (P), and actuator (A) domains. The N-domain is responsible for ATP binding, while the P-domain contains a conserved DKTGT motif crucial for forming a high-energy aspartyl-phosphate intermediate. The A-domain facilitates the coordination of movements between the cytoplasmic and membrane domains, essential for calcium translocation (Gorski2017StructureFunction; AguayoOrtiz2020Linking).

SERCA1a and its isoform SERCA1b differ primarily in their C-terminal regions, with SERCA1b having an additional eight highly charged amino acids. These isoforms are expressed in adult and fetal fast-twitch skeletal muscles, respectively (Gorski2017StructureFunction). The tertiary structure of SERCA isoforms is predicted to be virtually identical due to high sequence identity, although specific structural details such as domains and folds are not detailed in the excerpts (Gorski2017StructureFunction). Regulatory proteins like sarcolipin modulate SERCA1a activity by affecting its calcium affinity and kinetic turnover rate (AguayoOrtiz2020Linking).

## Function
The ATP2A1 gene encodes the SERCA1 protein, a calcium ATPase that plays a critical role in muscle function by facilitating the ATP-dependent transport of calcium ions (Ca2+) from the cytosol into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This process is essential for muscle relaxation following contraction, as it helps restore the tropomyosin-mediated inhibition of actin-myosin interaction, allowing muscle fibers to relax after they have contracted (Guglielmi2013SERCA1; Jin2014Ebf). SERCA1 is particularly important in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, where it accounts for more than 99% of SERCA isoforms, underscoring its significance in muscle physiology (Odermatt2000The).

In healthy human cells, the activity of SERCA1 ensures proper calcium homeostasis, which is crucial for normal muscle contraction and relaxation cycles. The protein is active in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a specialized organelle in muscle cells that regulates calcium ion concentrations, thereby playing a vital role in excitation-contraction coupling (Karpati1986Myopathy). The transcription factor Ebf3, along with MyoD, directly regulates the expression of ATP2A1, highlighting its role in muscle-specific gene regulation and ensuring proper muscle function, particularly in the diaphragm (Jin2014Ebf).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene, which encodes the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1 (SERCA1) protein, are associated with Brody disease, a rare inherited myopathy. This condition is characterized by exercise-induced muscle stiffness and delayed relaxation due to impaired calcium ion transport in muscle cells (Vattemi2010Brody; Odermatt2000The). Brody disease is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, although some cases suggest autosomal dominant inheritance, indicating genetic heterogeneity (Vattemi2010Brody; Guglielmi2013SERCA1).

Various mutations in ATP2A1 have been identified, including missense mutations, frameshift mutations, and in-frame deletions, all of which lead to a loss of function of the SERCA1 protein (Molenaar2020Clinical). For instance, a mutation changing proline 789 to leucine significantly reduces the enzyme's Ca2+ transport activity, contributing to the disease phenotype (Odermatt2000The). Other mutations, such as Arg 819 to Cys, have been identified but do not significantly affect Ca2+ transport activity (Odermatt2000The).

In addition to Brody disease, mutations in ATP2A1 have been linked to congenital pseudomyotonia in cattle, providing an animal model for studying the human condition (Drögemüller2008Identification). These findings underscore the critical role of ATP2A1 in muscle function and its potential involvement in other neuromuscular disorders.
