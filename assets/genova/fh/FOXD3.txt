# FOXD3

## Overview
FOXD3 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box D3 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the forkhead family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in neural crest cells, which are progenitors for diverse cell types and structures in the body (Rogers2018Specifying; Teng2008Requirement). As a transcription factor, forkhead box D3 is involved in maintaining the multipotency of these progenitor cells and preventing premature differentiation, thereby ensuring proper development and function of neural crest-derived tissues (Rogers2018Specifying). The protein's regulatory functions extend to embryonic stem cells, where it influences key developmental pathways by modulating the expression of genes such as Sox4 and Sox15 (Plank2014Transcriptional). Additionally, FOXD3 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its role as a tumor suppressor in certain cancers and its association with developmental disorders and autoimmune diseases (Hauptman2019Genes; Schunter2015A; Xu2019FOXD3).

## Structure


## Function
FOXD3 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of neural crest (NC) cells, which are multipotent progenitors contributing to various adult structures, including the peripheral and enteric nervous systems, bones, and connective tissues (Teng2008Requirement). It is involved in maintaining the multipotency of NC progenitors and suppressing premature differentiation, ensuring proper development and function of NC-derived structures (Rogers2018Specifying). FOXD3 is directly regulated by other transcription factors such as PAX7, MSX1/2, ZIC1, and ETS1, and it downregulates cell adhesion molecules like Tspan18 and N-cadherin, which are crucial for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) necessary for NC cell migration (Rogers2018Specifying).

In the context of embryonic stem cells, FOXD3 regulates several genes, including Sox4 and Sox15, influencing pathways critical for embryonic development (Plank2014Transcriptional). It acts as a transcriptional repressor for Sox15 and an activator for Sox4, playing a significant role in skeletal muscle differentiation and development (Plank2014Transcriptional). FOXD3's regulatory functions are essential for maintaining the undifferentiated state of progenitor populations and ensuring proper cell migration and differentiation into various lineages (Teng2008Requirement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FOXD3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of autoimmune diseases, a novel variant in the FOXD3 gene has been associated with vitiligo and elevated thyroid auto-antibodies. This variant, identified as -428 T, is linked to vitiligo but not to other autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, type 1 diabetes, Addison's disease, or autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (Schunter2015A).

FOXD3 also plays a role in cancer biology. In lung cancer, FOXD3 acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing tumor-initiating features and metastasis. Its downregulation is associated with higher histological grades and lymph node positivity, indicating a potential role in tumor progression (Xu2019FOXD3). In colorectal cancer, FOXD3 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene, with its downregulation linked to increased proliferation of cancer cells. Methylation in the promoter region of FOXD3 is associated with its down-regulation, which may contribute to cancer progression (Hauptman2019Genes).

Additionally, structural variants affecting FOXD3 have been linked to craniosynostosis, a condition characterized by the premature fusion of skull bones, highlighting its significance in developmental disorders (Pagnamenta2023Structural).

## Interactions
FOXD3 is known to participate in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing several developmental processes. In the context of neural crest development, FOXD3 interacts with Pax3, a transcription factor, to regulate the expression of MITF by preventing Pax3 from binding to the MITF promoter. This interaction is crucial for the proper development of cardiac neural crest cells (Nelms2010Functional). 

FOXD3 also plays a role in the regulation of Tspan18 during cranial neural crest development. Although it is not clear if FOXD3 directly binds to the Tspan18 promoter, it is necessary for the initial downregulation of Tspan18, which is essential for neural crest cell migration (Fairchild2014FoxD3). 

In murine embryonic stem cells, FOXD3 regulates the transcription of several genes, including Sox4 and Sox15, through direct interactions. It activates Sox4 and represses Sox15, highlighting its role in transcriptional regulation (Plank2014Transcriptional). 

Additionally, FOXD3 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the Grb2 gene, particularly in Huntington's disease models, where it enhances Grb2 promoter activity (Baksi2013Grb2). These interactions underscore FOXD3's multifaceted role in gene regulation and development.
