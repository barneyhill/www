# CMKLR1

## Overview
The CMKLR1 gene encodes the chemerin chemokine-like receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including immune response, metabolism, and vascular biology. As a transmembrane receptor, CMKLR1 is primarily expressed on immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages, where it mediates the recruitment and activation of these cells in response to its ligand, chemerin. This receptor is involved in both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways, depending on the context, and is also implicated in metabolic processes such as adipogenesis and insulin resistance. Additionally, CMKLR1 influences cardiovascular functions, including blood pressure regulation and angiogenesis. The receptor's interactions with chemerin and other molecules underscore its significance in health and disease, with alterations in its expression linked to conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and various cancers (Perumalsamy2017Chemokine; Kennedy2017International; Wu2022Chemerin).

## Structure
The CMKLR1 protein, also known as chemerin chemokine-like receptor 1, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in immune response and adipogenesis. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes seven transmembrane helices characteristic of GPCRs (Zhang2023Structural). The secondary structure of CMKLR1 includes these helices, which are crucial for its function as they span the cell membrane and facilitate signal transduction.

The tertiary structure of CMKLR1 is defined by the three-dimensional folding of these helices, creating a ligand-binding pocket that interacts with its endogenous ligand, chemerin, and its derivative, chemerin9. This interaction is characterized by specific hydrophobic and π-π interactions, as well as a network of polar interactions that stabilize the ligand within the binding pocket (Zhang2023Structural). The binding of chemerin9 induces conformational changes, particularly an outward displacement of transmembrane helix 6, which is a hallmark of GPCR activation (Zhang2023Structural).

CMKLR1 may also form higher-order structures, such as dimers, as part of its quaternary structure, although specific details on this aspect are not provided in the context. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate its activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The receptor's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in signaling pathways that can lead to both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects (Zhang2023Structural).

## Function
The CMKLR1 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor known as chemerin receptor 1, which is involved in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. CMKLR1 is primarily expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages, where it facilitates their recruitment and initiates early immune responses. It is activated by chemerin, a proinflammatory chemotactic agent, which can lead to both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects depending on the context (Kennedy2017International). CMKLR1 is also implicated in antibacterial and antimicrobial defense, as chemerin is abundant in human skin and inhibits bacterial growth (Kennedy2017International).

In terms of metabolism, CMKLR1 is expressed in adipose tissue and is involved in adipogenesis and energy metabolism. It influences insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and may play a role in insulin resistance (Kennedy2017International). The receptor is also associated with the cardiovascular system, where it can cause contraction of smooth muscle cells and influence blood pressure. It is involved in angiogenesis, as chemerin can induce the growth of capillary-like structures and activate signaling pathways related to cell migration and angiogenesis (Kennedy2017International). CMKLR1's multifunctional roles highlight its importance in immune regulation, metabolism, and vascular biology.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CMKLR1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. Elevated serum levels of chemerin, which interacts with CMKLR1, are associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Perumalsamy2017Chemokine; Ernst2012Disruption). In obesity and T2DM models, CMKLR1 influences glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion, and its antagonism has shown potential in improving insulin signaling and reducing inflammation (Perumalsamy2017Chemokine).

CMKLR1 is also linked to various cancers, including gastric, ovarian, liver, lung, esophageal, and colorectal cancers. High levels of chemerin, which binds to CMKLR1, are associated with cancer progression through pathways involving inflammation and increased cell proliferation (Perumalsamy2017Chemokine). In glioblastoma, the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis promotes tumor progression by enhancing mesenchymal features and tumor-associated macrophage interactions (Wu2022Chemerin).

In bone metabolism, CMKLR1 deficiency in male mice leads to lower bone mass and decreased testosterone levels, suggesting a role in osteoporosis (Zhao2018Chemokinelike). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CMKLR1 in metabolic, inflammatory, and cancer-related conditions.

## Interactions
CMKLR1, also known as chemerin chemokine-like receptor 1, engages in several significant interactions with other proteins, primarily through its role as a G protein-coupled receptor. It interacts with the chemerin-derived agonist chemerin9, which binds to CMKLR1 in an 'S-shape' mode, occupying a binding pocket open to the extracellular environment. This interaction involves key residues such as Tyr149 and Ser157 of chemerin9 forming hydrogen bonds with R224 and E283 of CMKLR1, respectively. Phe150 of chemerin9 forms a weak π-π interaction with F190 of CMKLR1 (Zhang2023Structural).

CMKLR1 also forms a complex with the G protein subunits Gαi, Gβ1, and Gγ2, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy studies. This interaction is crucial for the receptor's signaling pathways, linking extracellular agonist binding to cytoplasmic conformational changes (Zhang2023Structural). The receptor's activation involves conformational changes, particularly in TM6, with the movement of W273 and F269 being crucial for receptor activation (Zhang2023Structural).

Additionally, CMKLR1 interacts with amyloid-β peptide (Aβ42) in the context of Alzheimer's disease, where it is upregulated and colocalizes with Aβ in the hippocampus and cortex, suggesting a direct interaction that may play a role in Aβ42 clearance (Peng2014The).
