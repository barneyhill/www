# AKR1B1

## Overview
AKR1B1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B, a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the detoxification of aldehydes, which are toxic byproducts of lipid peroxidation, and plays a significant role in the polyol pathway by converting glucose to sorbitol, thus contributing to osmoregulation and cellular protection against oxidative stress (Barski2008The; O’CONNOR1999Major). The AKR1B1 protein is characterized by its monomeric structure and the presence of an (α/β)8-barrel motif, which is common among aldo-keto reductases, and it operates through an ordered bi-bi kinetic mechanism (Penning2015The; Ruiz2011Human). AKR1B1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and diabetic complications, due to its involvement in critical cellular pathways and its regulatory interactions with other proteins (Khayami2020Role; Srivastava2011Aldose).

## Structure
The AKR1B1 protein is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 34-37 kDa, primarily located in the cytoplasm (Khayami2020Role; Penning2015The). Its primary structure consists of a single polypeptide chain comprising 316 amino acids (Khayami2020Role). The secondary structure of AKR1B1 includes an (α/β)8-barrel motif, also known as a triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel, which is a common fold among aldo-keto reductases (Penning2015The; Ruiz2011Human). This structure is characterized by eight alpha-helices and eight beta-strands that form a barrel, with additional helices and loops that contribute to substrate specificity (Penning2015The).

The enzyme's active site contains a conserved NADPH-binding domain, essential for its catalytic activity (Penning2015The). The catalytic mechanism involves a conserved tetrad of amino acids: tyrosine, lysine, histidine, and aspartic acid (Penning2015The). AKR1B1 follows an ordered bi-bi kinetic mechanism, where the cofactor binds first and leaves last, with the rate of cofactor release potentially being a rate-determining step (Penning2015The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. Splice variants of AKR1B1 exist, which can result in isoforms with differing activity or stability (Penning2015The).

## Function
The AKR1B1 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, primarily involved in the detoxification of aldehydes, which are toxic products generated from lipid peroxidation. In healthy human cells, AKR1B1 catalyzes the reduction of a wide range of saturated aldehydes, including 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and phospholipid aldehydes like POVPC, with much higher efficiency than glucose, suggesting its primary role is aldehyde detoxification rather than glucose reduction (Barski2008The; O’CONNOR1999Major). This detoxification process helps neutralize the toxic effects of aldehydes and may regulate inflammation and cytokine production (Barski2008The).

AKR1B1 is also involved in the polyol pathway, converting glucose to sorbitol, which is important for osmoregulation, particularly in the kidney (Penning2007Human; O’CONNOR1999Major). This conversion helps maintain osmotic balance under conditions of osmotic stress, with the regulation of AKR1B1 involving the osmotic response element (ORE) in its promoter region (Penning2007Human). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in protecting cells against oxidative stress and sugar-mediated damage (O’CONNOR1999Major).

## Clinical Significance
The AKR1B1 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, AKR1B1 is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. In colorectal cancer (CRC), its inhibition can prevent tumor growth by affecting growth factors and increasing the expression of tumor suppressors like FOXO3A and PTEN, which suppress cell proliferation (Khayami2020Role). In breast cancer, AKR1B1 is overexpressed in certain subtypes and is linked to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for metastasis (Khayami2020Role). In gastric cancer, elevated AKR1B1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor growth, and its knockdown reduces tumor growth by suppressing the AKT-mTOR pathway (Liu2023Aberrant).

AKR1B1 is also involved in diabetic complications due to its role in the polyol pathway, where it contributes to osmotic and oxidative stress, leading to conditions like retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy (Srivastava2011Aldose). Inhibitors of AKR1B1 have been shown to alleviate these complications by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation (Srivastava2011Aldose). The gene's expression is regulated by various transcription factors, and its upregulation is linked to inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and sepsis (Chen2012Regulation).

## Interactions
AKR1B1 interacts with various proteins and participates in several signaling pathways. In pancreatic cancer, AKR1B1 interacts with the β2-adrenergic receptor (B2-AR), leading to increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels, which promotes tumorigenesis (Khayami2020Role). In hepatocellular carcinoma, AKR1B1 overexpression triggers the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway through interaction with the AKT1 kinase domain, enhancing lactate production and tumorigenicity (Khayami2020Role). 

AKR1B1 is also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer, where its expression correlates with ZEB1 and lymph node involvement (Khayami2020Role). In gastric cancer, AKR1B1 is part of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and is associated with increased proliferation, metastasis, and invasion of tumor cells (Zhou2021An). 

The protein also interacts with thyroid hormone receptors (TRα1 and TRβ1) through a thyroid hormone response element (TRE) in its promoter region, which is crucial for T3-mediated transcriptional activation (Liao2009Regulation). These interactions highlight AKR1B1's role in various cancer-related pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
