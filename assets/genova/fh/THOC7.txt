# THOC7

## Overview
THOC7 is a gene that encodes the protein THO complex subunit 7, a crucial component of the THO complex involved in mRNA processing and export. The THO complex is part of the larger transcription/export (TREX) complex, which plays a significant role in gene expression by facilitating the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. THOC7, characterized by a putative leucine zipper domain, is essential for maintaining genome stability by preventing the formation of R-loops, structures that can lead to genomic instability. It is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues and is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional elongation and mRNA packaging. The protein's interactions within the THO complex, particularly with FMIP, are critical for its function and localization, highlighting its importance in cellular biology and gene expression regulation (Kumar2020Expanding; Katahira2020Human; El2008Nuclear).

## Structure
THOC7 is a protein composed of 204 amino acids and is a component of the THO complex, which is involved in mRNA processing and export. The primary structure of THOC7 includes a putative leucine zipper (LZ) domain located between amino acids 100-155, which may facilitate protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions (El2008Nuclear). This domain is distinct from the NIF3L1 binding domain, which spans amino acids 100-204 (El2008Nuclear).

THOC7 does not contain a typical nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif, yet it is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Its nuclear localization is dependent on its interaction with FMIP, a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that contains an NLS (El2008Nuclear). The interaction between THOC7 and FMIP is mediated by the central portion of THOC7, specifically between amino acids 50-137, and the N-terminal portion of FMIP (1-199) (El2008Nuclear).

In terms of quaternary structure, THOC7 is part of the metazoan THO complex, which includes other proteins such as THOC1, THOC2, THOC3, FMIP/THOC5, and THOC6 (El2008Nuclear). The interaction with FMIP is crucial for THOC7's function and localization within the complex.

## Function
THOC7 is a component of the human THO complex, which is part of the TREX (transcription/export) complex involved in various steps of gene expression. It plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability by preventing the formation of R-loops, which are structures that can lead to genome instability. The THO complex, including THOC7, is primarily localized at repetitive sequences in the human genome, such as microsatellite and telomeric repeats. This localization is crucial for maintaining the stability of these repetitive DNA regions, which is essential for preventing genome instability that can result from transcription through these regions (Katahira2020Human).

THOC7 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is involved in mRNA processing and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to facilitate transcriptional elongation, 3'-end formation, and packaging into messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes for nuclear export. These processes are vital for efficient mRNA export and gene expression regulation, impacting various cellular functions and developmental processes (Kumar2020Expanding). The THO complex, including THOC7, is also implicated in maintaining pluripotency, hematopoiesis, and stress responses, highlighting its broad role in cell biology (Kumar2020Expanding).

## Interactions
THOC7, a component of the THO complex, is involved in several protein-protein interactions crucial for mRNA processing and export. It specifically interacts with FMIP (Fms tyrosine kinase interacting protein), forming a complex that is essential for its nuclear localization. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal portion of FMIP and the central region of THOC7, which includes part of a putative leucine zipper domain (El2008Nuclear).

Within the THO complex, THOC7 forms a parallel coiled coil with THOC5, which is vital for the dimerization and stabilization of the complex. This interaction is part of a larger tetrameric assembly involving other THO subunits like THOC1, THOC2, THOC3, THOC5, and THOC6, and is crucial for the complex's function in mRNA export (Pühringer2020Structure).

THOC7 is also part of the transcription-export (TREX) complex, which includes UAP56 and ALYREF, facilitating the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This complex binds multiple mRNA regions, aiding in the selective recognition and export of mature mRNA (Pühringer2020Structure). The interactions of THOC7 within these complexes underscore its role in gene expression regulation.
