# TYW1

## Overview
The TYW1 gene encodes the tRNA-yW synthesizing protein 1 homolog, a radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzyme that is integral to the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA, specifically in the synthesis of 4-demethylwyosine in tRNA Phe. This enzyme is categorized as a radical SAM enzyme due to its role in catalyzing complex radical-mediated reactions essential for maintaining translational fidelity during protein synthesis (Young2021Eukaryotic). In eukaryotes, the TYW1 protein is characterized by an additional flavin binding domain, which enhances its enzymatic activity through interactions with flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and iron (Young2021Eukaryotic). The gene's function is critical for preventing frameshift mutations, which can lead to various neurological disorders and have been implicated in conditions such as cerebral palsy and intellectual disability (Li2020Indepth). Furthermore, TYW1 has been associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia through the formation of fusion genes, highlighting its clinical significance (Panagopoulos2019Novel).

## Function
The TYW1 gene encodes a radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzyme that plays a crucial role in the modification of tRNA, specifically in the formation of 4-demethylwyosine-containing tRNA Phe. This enzyme catalyzes the condensation of pyruvate and N-methylguanosine-containing tRNA Phe, a process essential for the proper functioning of tRNA and, consequently, for protein synthesis (Young2021Eukaryotic). In eukaryotes, TYW1 contains an additional flavin binding domain, which is involved in the enzyme's activity by binding flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and iron, essential for its function. The enzyme is active with NAD(P)H alone, but its activity is enhanced when combined with flavin nucleotides (Young2021Eukaryotic).

The TYW1 enzyme is involved in a complex radical-mediated condensation and ring closure process that converts N-methylguanosine to 4-demethylwyosine, a modification found in tRNA Phe of many eukaryal and archaeal species (Young2021Eukaryotic). This modification is important for maintaining the translational reading frame during protein synthesis, preventing frameshift mutations that could lead to disease (GotoIto2007Structure). The presence of a flavodoxin_1 domain in eukaryotic TYW1 suggests a unique adaptation in these organisms, potentially related to the enzyme's interaction with cellular reducing systems (Young2021Eukaryotic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TYW1 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including cerebral palsy (CP) and intellectual disability (ID). Defective TYW1 leads to increased ribosomal frameshift, particularly affecting the UUU codon for phenylalanine, which reduces translational accuracy. This defect hinders neuronal proliferation and migration, resulting in reduced neurogenesis and altered neuronal layer distribution in the brain. These changes are associated with conditions such as CP and ID in patients with hypomorphic TYW1 alleles (Li2020Indepth). 

In a study focusing on a male proband with ataxic CP, compound heterozygous variants in TYW1, classified as damaging, were identified. These variants, R206C and R389Q, affect protein stability and substrate binding, contributing to the molecular etiology of CP, affecting both motion and cognition (Li2020Indepth). 

Additionally, the TYW1 gene has been implicated in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) through the identification of the IKZF1-TYW1 fusion gene. This fusion results in an out-of-frame transcript, which may have clinical implications, particularly in the context of treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Panagopoulos2019Novel).
