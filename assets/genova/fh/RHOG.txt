# RHOG

## Overview
RHOG is a gene that encodes the protein ras homolog family member G, a small GTPase belonging to the Rho family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and growth. As a molecular switch, RHOG cycles between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state, influencing various cellular processes such as cell migration, neurite outgrowth, and cell adhesion. The protein's activity is modulated by interactions with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and other regulatory proteins, which facilitate its involvement in complex signaling pathways. RHOG's function is particularly significant in processes like wound healing, tissue repair, and cancer progression, where it contributes to cell motility and invasion (Goicoechea2017A; Katoh2006Activation; Elfenbein2009Suppression).

## Function
RHOG, a member of the ras homolog gene family, encodes a small GTPase that plays a critical role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell shape, motility, and growth. In healthy human cells, RHOG is involved in the activation of Rac1, another small GTPase, through its interaction with the ELMO-Dock180 complex. This interaction facilitates the formation of lamellipodia, actin-rich protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells, thereby promoting cell migration (Katoh2006Activation).

RHOG's activity is crucial for cell motility, as its knockdown results in reduced cell migration and impaired lamellipodia formation. The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cytoskeletal reorganization necessary for processes like wound healing and tissue repair (Katoh2006Activation). RHOG also plays a role in other cellular functions, such as neurite outgrowth and cell adhesion, indicating its involvement in various biological processes (Katoh2006Activation).

The regulation of RHOG activity is linked to its interaction with specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as SGEF, which contribute to RHOG-dependent membrane ruffling and cell migration (Katoh2006Activation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RHOG gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, RHOG is frequently altered, contributing to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Dysregulation of RHOG signaling has been detected in numerous human tumors, indicating its significant role in cancer biology (del2005Rho). Specifically, RHOG is involved in the activation of Rac1, a process crucial for endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, which are key factors in cancer progression (Elfenbein2009Suppression).

Mutations in RHOG, such as Ala151Ser and Glu171Lys, have been linked to specific diseases. The Ala151Ser mutation is associated with thymoma, potentially affecting thymocyte development (Ahmad2022RhoG’s). The Glu171Lys mutation is linked to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a severe immune disorder characterized by impaired cytotoxic T lymphocyte and natural killer cell exocytosis (Ahmad2022RhoG’s).

Alterations in RHOG expression or its interactions can also impact immune cell function, contributing to immune disorders. The regulation of RHOG activity by complexes such as the S4-synectin-RhoGDI1 complex is crucial for maintaining its inactive state, and disruptions in this regulation can lead to dysregulated RHOG activity, affecting various physiological processes (Elfenbein2009Suppression).

## Interactions
RHOG, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, participates in various protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It interacts with the ELMO1 and DOCK180 complex, which is crucial for activating Rac1, a process important for cell migration (Katoh2006Activation; Elfenbein2009Suppression). This interaction facilitates the formation of lamellipodia at the leading edge of migrating cells (Katoh2006Activation).

RHOG is also involved in a complex with syndecan 4, synectin, and RhoGDI1, which maintains RHOG in an inactive state. The phosphorylation of RhoGDI1 by PKCα releases RHOG, allowing it to activate Rac1 (Elfenbein2009Suppression). This complex is essential for the baseline suppression of RHOG activity and plays a role in vascular and neural development (Elfenbein2009Suppression).

In breast cancer cells, RHOG regulates invadopodia dynamics by promoting the phosphorylation of paxillin, an adaptor protein, which is crucial for invadopodia disassembly. This process is independent of Src or FAK kinases, suggesting the involvement of an alternative kinase or phosphatase (Goicoechea2017A). RHOG's interactions in this context are primarily with SGEF and paxillin, influencing invadopodia dynamics and potentially impacting cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Goicoechea2017A).
