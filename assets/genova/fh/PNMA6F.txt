# PNMA6F

## Overview
PNMA6F is a gene that encodes the protein PNMA family member 6F, which is part of the paraneoplastic Ma (PNMA) family of proteins. These proteins are typically associated with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, which are disorders triggered by an immune response to cancerous tumors. The PNMA6F protein is believed to play a role in cellular processes related to immune response and neurological function, although its specific biological functions and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Research into PNMA6F and its protein product is ongoing, with studies focusing on its potential involvement in various signaling pathways and its implications in disease states.
