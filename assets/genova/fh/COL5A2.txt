# COL5A2

## Overview
The COL5A2 gene encodes the collagen type V alpha 2 chain, a crucial component of the fibrillar collagen family, which plays a significant role in the formation and regulation of collagen fibrils within the extracellular matrix. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its involvement in maintaining the integrity and mechanical properties of connective tissues. The collagen type V alpha 2 chain is essential for the proper assembly and organization of collagen fibrils, particularly those composed of type I collagen, influencing the diameter and spacing of these fibrils. Mutations in the COL5A2 gene are linked to classical Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (cEDS), a disorder characterized by connective tissue abnormalities. The gene's expression and interactions are also implicated in various cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions (ChanutDelalande2004Development; Ritelli2013Clinical; Zhang2024COL5A2).

## Structure
The COL5A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 chain of type V collagen, a fibrillar collagen involved in the formation of collagen fibrils. The primary structure of the COL5A2 protein consists of a repeating Gly-X-Y sequence, where X and Y are often proline and hydroxyproline, which is characteristic of collagen proteins (Fang2012Minor). The secondary structure forms a triple helix, a common feature of collagen molecules, which is crucial for its structural role in connective tissues (Fang2012Minor).

The tertiary and quaternary structures involve the assembly of three collagen chains into a triple helix and further into fibrils. The COL5A2 protein includes a cysteine-rich domain in its NH2-propeptide, which plays a crucial role in regulating fibril assembly and maintaining the extracellular matrix architecture (Ritelli2013Clinical). This domain is important for controlling the diameter of heterotypic I/V collagen fibrils.

Post-translational modifications of the COL5A2 protein include hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues and glycosylation, which are essential for the stability and function of the collagen triple helix (Fang2012Minor). The gene also undergoes alternative splicing, which can lead to different protein isoforms with distinct functions (Fang2012Minor).

## Function
The COL5A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 chain of type V collagen, a minor fibrillar collagen that plays a crucial role in the formation and regulation of collagen fibrils. In healthy human cells, type V collagen is primarily found in the extracellular matrix, where it is essential for the proper assembly and organization of collagen fibrils, particularly those composed of type I collagen. The presence of type V collagen is critical for controlling the diameter and spacing of these fibrils, which in turn affects the mechanical properties and structural integrity of connective tissues (ChanutDelalande2004Development; Truter1992Identification).

Type V collagen, including the alpha-2 chain, is involved in the formation of heterotypic collagen fibrils, which are necessary for maintaining the skin's mechanical properties and overall tissue integrity. The heterotrimeric composition of collagen V, typically consisting of two alpha-1(V) chains and one alpha-2(V) chain, is vital for dermal fibrillogenesis and the maintenance of tissue structure (ChanutDelalande2004Development). The gene's expression is regulated by specific upstream promoter regions, which ensure cell type-specific transcription, highlighting its importance in various tissues (Truter1992Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL5A2 gene are associated with classical Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (cEDS), a connective tissue disorder characterized by skin hyperextensibility, abnormal wound healing, and joint hypermobility (Ritelli2013Clinical). These mutations often result in more severe phenotypes compared to those caused by COL5A1 mutations, with symptoms including scoliosis, club feet, abdominal wall hernias, and congenital hip dislocations or dysplasia (Colman2021Clinical). The mutations in COL5A2 can lead to structural changes in the collagen type V alpha 2 chain, affecting collagen fibrillogenesis and contributing to the pathology of cEDS (Ritelli2013Clinical).

COL5A2 mutations are typically missense or in-frame exon-skipping splice mutations, which can exert a dominant negative effect by incorporating mutant α2(V)-chains into collagen molecules, disrupting extracellular matrix interactions (Ritelli2013Clinical). These mutations can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, sometimes overlapping with more severe EDS types like dermatosparaxis EDS or kyphoscoliotic EDS (Colman2021Clinical). The presence of Gly at every third residue in the collagen triple helix is crucial, and substitutions at these positions can destabilize the helix, leading to connective tissue disorders (Watanabe2016A).

## Interactions
COL5A2, the gene encoding the alpha-2 chain of type V collagen, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular behavior and disease progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), COL5A2 interacts with the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), a tumor suppressor gene. This interaction is significant in regorafenib-resistant HCC cells, where COL5A2 overexpression leads to reduced LIFR expression, promoting aggressive cancer cell behaviors such as proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conversely, COL5A2 knockdown increases LIFR expression, which mitigates these malignant characteristics (Zhang2024COL5A2).

In gastric cancer, COL5A2 is regulated by a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network involving the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) ENTPD1-AS1 and microRNA miR-144-3p. ENTPD1-AS1 enhances COL5A2 expression by sponging miR-144-3p, which otherwise would suppress COL5A2. This regulatory interaction is associated with poor prognosis and increased macrophage infiltration in gastric cancer tissues (Yuan2023ENTPD1AS1–miR1443pmediated).

These interactions highlight the role of COL5A2 in modulating cellular pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers. The gene's involvement in these interactions underscores its importance in the tumor microenvironment and its contribution to cancer progression and resistance mechanisms.
