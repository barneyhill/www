# MAGEL2

## Overview
The MAGEL2 gene encodes the MAGE family member L2 protein, which is part of the type II melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination, RNA metabolism, and circadian rhythm regulation. MAGEL2 is involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes that influence the stability and trafficking of key cellular substrates, such as membrane-bound receptors and circadian rhythm proteins. The protein's interactions with E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases are crucial for its function in endosomal transport and neuroendocrine regulation. Mutations in the MAGEL2 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including Schaaf-Yang syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Sanderson2021The; CastillaVallmanya2022Advancing).

## Structure
The MAGEL2 protein, encoded by the MAGEL2 gene, is a member of the type II MAGE protein family and consists of 1249 amino acids. The primary structure includes a proline-rich N-terminal region and a C-terminal region containing the MAGE Homology Domain (MHD) from amino acids 1027 to 1195, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Sanderson2021The; CastillaVallmanya2022Advancing). The MHD allows MAGEL2 to bind the coiled-coil domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM27 and VPS35, a subunit of the retromer cargo-selective complex, forming the MUST complex involved in retrograde endosomal transport (CastillaVallmanya2022Advancing).

The N-terminal region is intrinsically disordered, rich in proline, alanine, and glutamine, and contains motifs such as the Atrophin-1 domain and a topoisomerase II-associated PAT1 domain (Sanderson2021The). This region is associated with RNA metabolism and phase separation, contributing to the formation of biomolecular condensates like stress granules (Sanderson2021The). The protein's propensity for phase separation is indicated by a P-Score of 4.66 (Sanderson2021The).

Mutations in MAGEL2, particularly truncating mutations, are linked to Schaaf-Yang syndrome, affecting the protein's stability and localization, with the truncated form showing increased nuclear localization (CastillaVallmanya2022Advancing).

## Function
The MAGEL2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the melanoma-associated antigen gene (MAGE) family, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, MAGEL2 is involved in the regulation of protein ubiquitination, interacting with E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases to form complexes that modify key cellular substrates. This regulation is essential for processes such as vesicular and endosomal trafficking of membrane-bound receptors, nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking, and the stability of proteins related to cilia and centrosomes (Sanderson2021The; sanderson2020characterization).

MAGEL2 also plays a significant role in RNA metabolism, particularly in the regulation of mRNAs modified by m6A methylation. It interacts with YTHDF proteins, influencing mRNA-associated complexes and maintaining the steady-state levels of YTHDF2, a protein involved in mRNA metabolism (Sanderson2021The).

In the context of circadian rhythms, MAGEL2 is highly expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, modulating the ubiquitination and stability of circadian rhythm proteins such as cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). This modulation is crucial for maintaining the robustness of circadian rhythms and proper sleep-wake cycles (Carias2020A).

Additionally, MAGEL2 is involved in the regulation of secretory granule sorting mechanisms in hypothalamic neurosecretory cells, ensuring proper neuroendocrine function by preventing the lysosomal degradation of secretory granule-resident proteins (Štepihar2023Cell-specific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAGEL2 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, most notably Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Schaaf-Yang syndrome is caused by truncating mutations in the paternal allele of MAGEL2, leading to a range of symptoms including intellectual disability, developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, neonatal hypotonia, and joint contractures (McCarthy2018Schaaf‐Yang; CastillaVallmanya2022Advancing). The syndrome shares some clinical features with Prader-Willi syndrome, such as feeding difficulties and endocrine abnormalities, but becomes distinct as patients age (McCarthy2018Schaaf‐Yang; CastillaVallmanya2022Advancing).

Chitayat-Hall syndrome, characterized by distal arthrogryposis and intellectual disability, has also been linked to MAGEL2 mutations, suggesting a shared etiology with Schaaf-Yang syndrome (Jobling2018ChitayatHall). Additionally, specific MAGEL2 mutations are associated with lethal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, a more severe phenotype distinct from SYS (CastillaVallmanya2022Advancing).

MAGEL2 mutations can lead to endocrine abnormalities, including deficiencies in growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and other pituitary hormones, which are common in both SYS and PWS (CastillaVallmanya2022Advancing; Halloun2021Expanding). These mutations can also affect metabolic processes, as evidenced by altered levels of secreted amyloid-β and intracellular glutamine in SYS fibroblasts (CastillaVallmanya2022Advancing).

## Interactions
MAGEL2, a member of the MAGE protein family, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with YTHDF proteins, which are involved in mRNA metabolism. MAGEL2 forms complexes with YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting a role in mRNA-associated complexes (Sanderson2021The). The N-terminal domain of MAGEL2 is intrinsically disordered and interacts with RNA-binding proteins, including TNRC6A/B and YTHDF1/2/3, which are involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing and mRNA stability regulation (Sanderson2021The).

MAGEL2 also interacts with proteins involved in circadian rhythm regulation. It is in proximity to cryptochrome proteins CRY1 and CRY2, which are inhibitors of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex. MAGEL2 increases the nuclear localization of CRY1, influencing its function in circadian rhythm regulation (Carias2020A). Additionally, MAGEL2 interacts with USP7, a deubiquitinase, and is part of a complex that modulates the ubiquitination and stability of CRY1, affecting its nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution (Carias2020A).

These interactions highlight MAGEL2's involvement in multiprotein complexes that regulate RNA metabolism and circadian rhythms, contributing to its role in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Schaaf-Yang syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome.
