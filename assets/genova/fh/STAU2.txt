# STAU2

## Overview
STAU2, or staufen double-stranded RNA binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mRNA dynamics within cells. The STAU2 protein is characterized as an RNA-binding protein, specifically interacting with double-stranded RNA through its multiple double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs). These domains enable STAU2 to play a pivotal role in mRNA localization, stability, and translation, particularly in neuronal cells where it contributes to synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Beyond its neurological functions, STAU2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including viral replication and cancer progression, through its interactions with other proteins and RNA molecules. Alterations in STAU2 expression have been associated with neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in disease pathogenesis and potential as a biomarker (Heber2019Staufen2mediated; HeraudFarlow2014The; Condé2021STAU2).

## Structure
The STAU2 protein is characterized by its multiple double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs), which are crucial for its function in RNA binding and localization. The protein contains four dsRBDs, with dsRBDs 1 and 2, as well as dsRBDs 3 and 4, forming tandem domains that work cooperatively to achieve stable RNA recognition (Heber2019Staufen2mediated). These domains are essential for the protein's ability to bind RNA with high affinity, and they recognize RNA targets based on their structure rather than sequence (Heber2019Staufen2mediated).

The primary structure of STAU2 includes specific amino acids that are critical for RNA interaction, as mutations in these regions can affect binding kinetics (Heber2019Staufen2mediated). The secondary structure of the protein involves typical A-form double-stranded helices, as seen in the crystal structure of RNA bound by STAU2 (Heber2019Staufen2mediated).

STAU2 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function, including RNA-binding or interactions with other proteins (ALLISON2004Two). The protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (ALLISON2004Two).

## Function
STAU2 (staufen double-stranded RNA binding protein 2) is a crucial component in the regulation of mRNA within healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in mRNA localization, stability, and translation, particularly in neurons. STAU2 is involved in the formation of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, which are essential for the transport and translational repression of mRNAs during neuronal development and synaptic plasticity (HeraudFarlow2014The; Miki2011Cell). 

STAU2 interacts with several translational repressors and components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), indicating its role in translational repression during mRNA transport. It is also implicated in Staufen-mediated decay (SMD), targeting mRNAs for degradation by binding to their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and recruiting the helicase Upf1 (HeraudFarlow2014The). However, STAU2 can also stabilize certain mRNAs, as its downregulation leads to decreased levels of specific mRNAs in neurons, suggesting a preferential role in mRNA stabilization (HeraudFarlow2014The; Miki2011Cell).

In the context of synaptic plasticity, STAU2 is essential for metabotropic glutamate receptor-induced long-term depression (LTD) and is involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis, contributing to memory formation and plasticity (Graber2017UPF1; HeraudFarlow2014The). STAU2's interaction with Upf1 is crucial for the production of MAP1B protein during synaptic plasticity, highlighting its role in RNA transport and translation (Graber2017UPF1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STAU2 gene have been implicated in various neurological and cognitive disorders. In particular, STAU2 is crucial for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, as demonstrated in studies using rat models. Conditional silencing of STAU2 in the forebrain of rats leads to deficits in spatial working memory and associative learning, suggesting its significant role in cognitive functions (Berger2017Forebrainspecific). These findings indicate that dysregulation of STAU2 could contribute to cognitive impairments and potentially to neurodevelopmental disorders.

STAU2 also plays a role in breast cancer risk assessment. Increased expression of STAU2 in lymphocytes has been identified as a potential marker for breast cancer, with studies showing higher fluorescence intensity of STAU2 in T and B lymphocytes of breast cancer patients compared to healthy individuals (Puttipanyalears2021Quantitative). This suggests that STAU2 could be used in breast cancer screening and risk assessment, particularly in distinguishing between different stages of the disease.

Additionally, STAU2 is involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair processes. Its levels are controlled by the CHK1 pathway, and alterations in STAU2 expression can affect cell proliferation and DNA damage response, potentially impacting cancer progression (Condé2021STAU2).

## Interactions
STAU2 (staufen double-stranded RNA binding protein 2) is known for its interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA transport and localization. It forms ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) and is involved in the transport and localization of mRNAs to various subcellular compartments. STAU2 interacts with the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, facilitating the transport of NS1 mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which is essential for viral replication (Wang2021Viral–Host).

In the context of myeloid leukemia, STAU2 has been identified as a key regulator, interacting with chromatin-binding factors and oncogenes such as Ras, Maz, and RhoA. It influences leukemia growth by binding to mRNAs of fate determinants, similar to its role in neuronal cells (Bajaj2020An). STAU2's RNA-binding properties are mediated by its multiple double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs), which allow it to recognize complex RNA secondary structures. These domains work cooperatively to enhance RNA binding affinity, which is crucial for its function in mRNA localization and transport (Heber2019Staufen2mediated).
