# PER1

## Overview
The PER1 gene encodes the protein period circadian regulator 1, a pivotal component of the mammalian circadian clock system. This protein is integral to the regulation of circadian rhythms, which are the natural, internal processes that follow a roughly 24-hour cycle and are crucial for various physiological functions. PER1 is characterized by its PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its function in the circadian clock. The protein undergoes circadian oscillations in expression, regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which influence its stability and cellular localization. PER1 interacts with several other proteins, including transportin 1 and USP2, to modulate its nuclear localization and stability, respectively. Beyond its role in circadian regulation, PER1 is implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its broader significance in human health (MIYAZAKI2004Phosphorylation; Bacalini2021Association; Korge2018The).

## Structure
The PER1 protein is a key component of the mammalian circadian clock, characterized by its PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. The protein contains two PAS domains, PAS-A and PAS-B, which facilitate the formation of homodimers. The PAS-B domain is particularly important for dimerization, with interactions mediated by a conserved tryptophan residue (Kucera2012Unwinding). 

The secondary structure of PER1 includes a long α-helix (αN) and a β-strand (βN), with specific interactions involving residues such as Tyr200 and Trp278. The PAS-A domain features a central residue, Tyr233, which interacts with other residues like Leu202, Leu205, and Thr209 (Kucera2012Unwinding). The αE helix of PER1 contains a nuclear export signal (NES) that aligns with a consensus sequence, indicating its role in cellular localization (Kucera2012Unwinding).

PER1 is capable of binding heme within its PAS domain, as evidenced by a shift in absorption maximum upon heme binding (Kucera2012Unwinding). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its stability and function. Additionally, PER1 may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
The PER1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of circadian rhythms in human cells. PER1 is involved in the molecular mechanisms that generate and maintain these rhythms, primarily through its interactions with other clock proteins. The protein undergoes circadian oscillations in its expression, which are regulated by phosphorylation, a post-translational modification that affects its stability and cellular localization (MIYAZAKI2004Phosphorylation).

Phosphorylation of PER1 by casein kinase I isoforms, CKIε and CKIδ, is essential for its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process is crucial for the time-dependent degradation of PER1, which is necessary for maintaining the circadian clock (MIYAZAKI2004Phosphorylation). The phosphorylation state of PER1 influences its subcellular localization, with phosphorylation facilitating its nuclear entry and export, although complete phosphorylation is not required for nuclear entry (MIYAZAKI2004Phosphorylation).

In peripheral tissues, PER1 exhibits rhythmic expression patterns, peaking at specific times of the day, which aligns with its role in regulating circadian rhythms. This rhythmic expression is observed in tissues such as the oral mucosa and skin, suggesting a functional importance in maintaining the circadian pacemaker in humans (Bjarnason2001Circadian).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PER1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In endometrial carcinoma, PER1 expression is significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, with a reduction observed in 94.3% of samples. This down-regulation is associated with DNA methylation of the PER1 promoter region, suggesting that epigenetic changes contribute to its altered expression in cancer (Yeh2005Abnormal). In breast cancer, deregulated expression of PER1, along with PER2 and PER3, is linked to disruptions in circadian rhythms, potentially due to promoter methylation. This deregulation may aid cancer cell survival and promote carcinogenesis (Chen2005Deregulated).

PER1 also plays a role in tumor suppression by regulating cell cycle progression and DNA damage response pathways. Its expression affects key factors such as p53, c-Myc, and ATM, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Down-regulation of PER1 has been shown to increase cancer cell growth and tumor growth, indicating its tumor-suppressor functions (Gery2006The; Yang2009THE).

In addition to cancer, genetic polymorphisms in PER1 have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a potential link between circadian clock gene variability and neurodegenerative diseases (Bacalini2021Association).

## Interactions
PER1 (period circadian regulator 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in circadian rhythm regulation. PER1 interacts with the non-classical nuclear import carrier transportin 1 (TNPO1), which modulates its nuclear localization. This interaction is specific to PER1 and is influenced by oxidative stress, which increases TNPO1's binding to PER1 and slows its nuclear import (Korge2018The). PER1 also interacts with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP2, which modulates the ubiquitination status of PER1, affecting its stability and rhythmic expression (Yang2012Regulation).

In the context of metabolic homeostasis, PER1 interacts with GPX1, a mitochondrial enzyme, enhancing its activity and contributing to oxidative stress regulation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and is absent in PER1 knockout models, indicating its importance in metabolic processes (Sun2020PER1). Additionally, PER1 interacts with a novel protein named PIPS, which may play a role in the feedback loop or output mechanism of circadian rhythms through its interaction with PER1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (Matsuki2001A).
