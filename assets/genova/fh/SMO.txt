# SMO

## Overview
The SMO gene encodes the Smoothened, frizzled class receptor, a pivotal component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for embryonic development and cellular differentiation. The Smoothened protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain, which facilitates its role in signal transduction (Wang2013Structure). As a transmembrane receptor, Smoothened acts as a signal transducer, relaying information from extracellular Hh ligands to intracellular signaling cascades, ultimately influencing gene expression through the activation of Gli transcription factors (Huangfu2006Signaling). The regulation of Smoothened activity is complex, involving interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, which are essential for its proper function in the Hh pathway (Rohatgi2009Hedgehog). Dysregulation of SMO can lead to various pathologies, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Xie1998Activating; Lou2020Genetic).

## Structure
The SMO (smoothened, frizzled class receptor) protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. It is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) typical of GPCRs, which is crucial for its function (Wang2013Structure). The SMO receptor includes several distinct structural domains: a transmembrane domain (TMD), a hinge domain (HD), and an extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) (Zhang2017Crystal). The CRD is composed of alpha helices stabilized by disulfide bonds, similar to the Frizzled CRD, and is essential for Hedgehog signaling (Rana2013Structural).

The extracellular loops (ECLs) of SMO are longer than those in most class A GPCRs, forming a complex tertiary arrangement that stabilizes the receptor in an inactive state (Wang2013Structure). The ECL3, the longest loop, extends into the extracellular space and is stabilized by ionic interactions and disulfide bonds (Wang2013Structure). The SMO receptor also features a hydrophobic groove in the CRD, which plays a role in ligand recognition (Zhang2017Crystal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are important for SMO's function, facilitating conformational changes necessary for downstream signaling (Rana2013Structural). The receptor's structure allows for allosteric interactions between its domains, which are significant for ligand recognition and receptor activation (Zhang2017Crystal).

## Function
The SMO gene encodes the Smoothened protein, a critical component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is essential for various developmental processes and cellular functions in healthy human cells. Smoothened is a transmembrane protein with a structure similar to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and acts as a nodal point in the Hh pathway, relaying signals from Hh ligands to downstream components (Huangfu2006Signaling). In the absence of Hh ligands, the receptor Patched1 (Ptc1) inhibits Smoothened, preventing its activation. Upon ligand binding, this inhibition is relieved, allowing Smoothened to activate Gli transcription factors, which regulate target gene transcription (Rohatgi2009Hedgehog).

Smoothened's activity is closely associated with its localization to primary cilia, a process necessary for its activation. However, ciliary localization alone is not sufficient for full activation, indicating a complex, multistep activation process (Rohatgi2009Hedgehog). This process involves Smoothened transitioning between inactive and active states within the cilia, similar to the activation pathway of GPCRs (Rohatgi2009Hedgehog). The proper functioning of Smoothened in the Hh pathway is crucial for growth, cell fate decisions, and morphogenesis during development (Rohatgi2009Hedgehog).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the SMO gene are implicated in various cancers and developmental disorders. In basal cell carcinoma (BCC), activating mutations in SMO, such as p.Trp535Leu, lead to unrestrained Hedgehog signaling, contributing to tumorigenesis (Xie1998Activating; Sweeney2014Identification). These mutations can result in ligand-independent signaling, increasing GLI activity, a downstream effector of the Hedgehog pathway (Xie1998Activating). SMO mutations are also associated with ameloblastomas, where they enhance cell proliferation and are sensitive to specific inhibitors (Sweeney2014Identification).

Alterations in SMO expression levels, often due to epigenetic changes like DNA methylation, are linked to various cancers, including breast, stomach, and colon cancers. High methylation levels correlate with reduced SMO expression, affecting tumor progression (Lou2020Genetic). Overexpression of SMO and GLI2 is associated with progesterone receptor-negative breast cancers and gastric cancers (Lou2020Genetic).

In addition to cancer, SMO mutations are linked to developmental disorders such as anterior segment dysgenesis and morning glory syndrome, where compound heterozygous mutations affect ocular development (Zhang2019Compound). These mutations can lead to decreased SMO expression, contributing to the observed conditions (Zhang2019Compound).

## Interactions
The SMO (smoothened, frizzled class receptor) protein is a key component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and interacts with several proteins to mediate its function. In the absence of Hedgehog ligands, SMO is inhibited by the Patched (PTCH1) receptor. Upon ligand binding to PTCH1, SMO is released from inhibition and becomes active, allowing it to interact with downstream effectors such as the GLI family of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression (Arensdorf2016Smoothened; Robbins2012The).

SMO also interacts with G proteins, particularly the inhibitory G proteins (Gi), which play a role in the downstream signaling cascade. This interaction is crucial for the modulation of the pathway, as it can influence the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) and other signaling molecules (Robbins2012The).

The cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of SMO is involved in binding various ligands, including glucocorticoids like Budesonide, which can act as inhibitors by binding to a site distinct from the orthosteric site. This interaction suggests a potential allosteric modulation of SMO activity (Rana2013Structural). Additionally, phosphatidylinositols have been shown to bind to the SMO CRD, influencing its activity and the Hh signaling pathway (Rana2013Structural).
