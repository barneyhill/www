# TRPM5

## Overview
TRPM5 is a gene that encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5, a calcium-activated non-selective cation channel. This protein is a member of the TRP channel family, characterized by its role in various physiological processes, including taste transduction and insulin secretion. Structurally, TRPM5 forms a tetrameric complex with six transmembrane domains, facilitating its function as a voltage-sensitive channel despite lacking a classic voltage sensor (Huang2020A; Uchida2021Involvement). The channel is activated by intracellular calcium, playing a pivotal role in the perception of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes by depolarizing taste receptor cells and triggering neurotransmitter release (Philippaert2017Steviol). Beyond taste, TRPM5 is involved in glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells and mucin secretion in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, underscoring its significance in metabolic and chemosensory functions (Mitrovic2013TRPM5mediated; Philippaert2017Steviol). Alterations in TRPM5 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including metabolic disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Colsoul2010Loss; Jimenez2020TRPM).

## Structure
TRPM5 is a protein that forms a non-selective cation channel, characterized by a structure comprising six transmembrane domains with a pore-forming loop located between the fifth and sixth domains (Zhang2023TRP; Uchida2021Involvement). The channel is organized as a tetramer, with each subunit containing intracellular N- and C-termini (Uchida2021Involvement). The pore helix, a critical structural component, plays a significant role in the channel's voltage-dependent inactivation, with specific amino acids such as glutamine at position 915 and leucine at position 901 being crucial for maintaining the structural stability of the selective filter (Uchida2021Involvement).

TRPM5 lacks the classic voltage sensor found in other voltage-gated ion channels, but it is still voltage-sensitive (Huang2020A). The protein's C-terminal region does not extend significantly beyond the coiled-coil region, which is important for the assembly of TRPM proteins into tetrameric complexes (Fleig2004The). Unlike some other TRPM family members, TRPM5 does not contain an ABC-transporter-like motif and has a short C terminus with only one Walker B site, which may not be accessible to ATP (Guinamard2010The). The protein's structure and function are influenced by specific amino acid residues that form Ca2+-binding sites, although TRPM5 itself is impermeable to Ca2+ (Huang2020A; Yamaguchi2019TRPM4).

## Function
The TRPM5 gene encodes a calcium-activated non-selective cation channel that plays a crucial role in taste transduction and other physiological processes. In taste receptor cells, TRPM5 is involved in the perception of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes. It is activated by a rise in intracellular calcium, which is part of a signal transduction cascade involving phospholipase C and IP3-sensitive calcium stores. This activation leads to cell depolarization and the release of ATP neurotransmitter, which then activates afferent signaling to the brain (Philippaert2017Steviol).

Beyond taste perception, TRPM5 is also expressed in pancreatic beta-cells, where it contributes to glucose-induced insulin secretion. It regulates the frequency of glucose-induced calcium oscillations, which are essential for proper insulin release and glucose homeostasis (Philippaert2017Steviol). TRPM5's role extends to the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, where it is involved in mucin secretion from goblet cells. It facilitates calcium uptake necessary for the secretion of MUC5AC, a major component of mucus, thereby maintaining the protective mucosal barrier (Mitrovic2013TRPM5mediated). These functions highlight TRPM5's importance in various chemosensory and metabolic processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TRPM5 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. High TRPM5 mRNA expression is associated with poor survival rates in melanoma and gastric cancer patients, although this correlation is not observed in ovarian, lung, breast, or rectal cancer (Jimenez2020TRPM). In the context of metabolic disorders, TRPM5 plays a significant role in glucose homeostasis. TRPM5 deficiency in mice leads to impaired glucose tolerance and reduced insulin secretion, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (Colsoul2010Loss; Colsoul2013Insulin). In diabetic mouse models, TRPM5 expression is downregulated, which is linked to elevated plasma insulin levels and impaired glucose tolerance (Colsoul2013Insulin).

TRPM5 is also associated with taste perception and dietary behaviors. Mice lacking TRPM5 show reduced body weight gain and improved glucose tolerance when fed high-caloric diets, indicating a potential role in obesity and diet-induced glucose intolerance (Larsson2015Ablation). Additionally, the TRPM5 rs886277 polymorphism has been linked to liver fibrosis progression in HCV-infected patients, suggesting a role in hepatic conditions (Resino2021TRPM5). These findings highlight TRPM5 as a potential therapeutic target for various diseases.

## Interactions
TRPM5 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in taste transduction and other physiological processes. It is activated by intracellular calcium, which is released upon stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors linked to phospholipases type C, particularly PLCβ2. This interaction is crucial for signal transduction in taste receptor cells, leading to membrane depolarization and taste perception (Kaske2007TRPM5).

TRPM5 also interacts with calmodulin (CaM), a calcium-binding protein that modulates its function. The channel contains multiple CaM binding domains at its intracellular N- and C-termini, which can have activating or inhibitory effects. Specific CaM-binding motifs in TRPM5 include W83-V87-L92 and L84-L88-V93, with basic amino acids R85, R89, K90, and K94 playing a critical role in complex formation (Vydra2023Interaction).

In olfactory sensory neurons, TRPM5 is coexpressed with CNGA2, suggesting potential interactions between the cAMP and PLC pathways. This coexpression indicates a possible direct interaction that could be explored further, as TRPM5 is a Ca2+-activated channel and CNGA2 channels allow Ca2+ flow (Lin2007Olfactory). These interactions highlight TRPM5's involvement in complex signaling networks across different sensory systems.
