# BEND3

## Overview
BEND3 is a gene located on chromosome 6 that encodes the protein BEN domain containing 3, a transcription factor involved in transcriptional repression and chromatin organization. The BEND3 protein is characterized by the presence of four tandem BEN domains, which facilitate its interactions with DNA and other proteins. These domains are crucial for its role in maintaining pluripotency in stem cells and regulating gene expression by interacting with chromatin modifiers and transcriptional repressors. BEND3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including heterochromatin dynamics and early embryonic development, and its dysregulation is associated with several cancers, highlighting its potential as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor depending on the context (Fan2022The; Zheng2022Distinct; Naiyer2023Role).

## Structure
BEND3 is a transcription factor encoded by a gene on chromosome 6, featuring a complex molecular structure. The protein is composed of three introns and four exons, resulting in two transcriptional variants that produce the same functional protein (Naiyer2023Role). BEND3 contains a long N-terminal loop followed by four BEN domains (BD1-4), each approximately 80 amino acids in length. These domains have distinct molecular interactions and functions (Naiyer2023Role).

The BD1 domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and contains a coiled-coil domain, interacting specifically with the PICH protein through a TPR-BEN domain interface (Pitchai2017A). The BD1 domain is composed exclusively of α-helices with no beta turns (Naiyer2023Role). In contrast, the BD4 domain is characterized by six α-helices, two short helical turns, and two β-strands, forming a positively charged DNA binding channel crucial for its DNA binding properties (Zheng2022Distinct).

BEND3 forms an octameric higher-order structure, suggesting a quaternary structure with a molecular mass of approximately 800 kDa (Pitchai2017A). The protein also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the N-terminal loop, facilitating its transport into the nucleus (Naiyer2023Role). BEND3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including SUMOylation, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins and complexes (Naiyer2023Role).

## Function
BEND3 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression and chromatin organization in human cells. It is a member of the BEN domain family and contains four tandem BEN domains, with the fourth domain (BD4) being essential for its DNA binding activity. BEND3 binds to specific DNA motifs, such as YCCACGC, which are enriched near transcription start sites, and is involved in the repression of gene expression (Zheng2022Distinct). 

BEND3 is predominantly expressed in pluripotent cell types and is involved in maintaining pluripotency by repressing pro-differentiation genes. Its loss in stem-like models promotes differentiation, indicating its role in cell fate determination (Zheng2022Distinct; Naiyer2023Role). BEND3 interacts with various chromatin modifiers and transcriptional repressors, such as the NuRD complex, PRC2, and NoRC, to regulate gene expression and maintain chromatin structure (Naiyer2023Role).

BEND3 also plays a role in heterochromatin dynamics, potentially forming phase-separated liquid droplets and influencing chromatin states through DNA methylation and histone modifications (Zheng2022Distinct; Naiyer2023Role). Its activity is crucial for early embryonic development, and its absence is lethal between embryonic stages E3.5 and E6.5 (Naiyer2023Role).

## Clinical Significance
BEND3 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. Alterations in BEND3 expression are associated with cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer, leukemia, and gastric cancer. In breast cancer and leukemia, BEND3 is highly expressed and affects drug sensitivity by regulating the ABCG2 transporter, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Naiyer2023Role). In gastric cancer, BEND3 is highly expressed and linked to poor prognosis, with its expression correlating with immune infiltration and tumor microenvironment interactions (Fan2022The).

BEND3's interaction with chromatin modifiers like the NuRD complex and its involvement in epigenetic regulation highlight its potential oncogenic role. It represses genes such as p21, which is involved in cell-cycle arrest, suggesting that BEND3 may act as an oncogene by promoting cell-cycle progression (Naiyer2023Role). However, its overexpression can also lead to extensive heterochromatin formation and cell-cycle arrest, indicating a context-dependent role that may include tumor suppressor functions (Naiyer2023Role).

BEND3's expression is also associated with unfavorable outcomes in several cancers, including adrenocortical carcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, while being protective in acute myeloid leukemia (Fan2022The).

## Interactions
BEND3 (BEN domain containing 3) is involved in several protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional repression and chromatin organization. BEND3 interacts with the nucleolar-remodeling complex (NoRC), which is essential for maintaining the transcriptionally silent state of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. This interaction is facilitated by the SUMOylation of BEND3, which stabilizes the NoRC component TTF-1-interacting protein 5 (Tip5) through its association with the ubiquitin-specific protease 21 (USP21) deubiquitinase (Khan2015BEND3).

BEND3 also directly interacts with the PICH protein through its BEN domains 1 and 3 (BD1/BD3), while PICH interacts via its N-terminal TPR motif. This interaction enhances the ATPase and translocase activities of PICH, suggesting a regulatory role for BEND3 in PICH function (Pitchai2017A).

In terms of DNA interactions, the BD4 domain of BEND3 binds specifically to a DNA motif, forming a complex with a DNA duplex in a sequence-specific manner. This interaction involves both base-specific and nonbase interactions, with key residues such as Arg814 and Lys822 playing significant roles (Zheng2022Distinct).
