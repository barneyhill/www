# C22orf23

## Overview
C22orf23 is a gene located on chromosome 22 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 22 open reading frame 23. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. It is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein, and current research suggests its involvement in regulatory pathways that may influence cell growth and angiogenesis. The gene has been studied in the context of several diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions, where alterations in its expression or genetic variations have been linked to disease susceptibility and progression (Filippi2024Analysis; Patro2021MetaAnalyses). Further research is needed to fully understand the biological roles and clinical implications of C22orf23.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
C22orf23 has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression or genetic variations. In prostate cancer, C22orf23 is part of an eight-gene expression signature predictive of Gleason grade, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression and potentially in processes like cell growth and angiogenesis (Filippi2024Analysis). In glioma, a specific SNP associated with C22orf23 has shown a significant association, indicating its potential role in glioma susceptibility (Patro2021MetaAnalyses). Additionally, C22orf23 is affected by splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), which may influence its expression and contribute to glioma risk (Patro2021MetaAnalyses).

C22orf23 has also been noted in the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), where differential methylation of the gene was observed in hyperhomocysteinemic CAD patients, suggesting a possible epigenetic involvement in CAD (Sharma2014Genome). In male infertility, C22orf23 was identified as a differentially expressed gene in non-obstructive azoospermia, although its specific role in infertility remains unclear (Omolaoye2022Omics). Despite these associations, the precise clinical significance of C22orf23 in these conditions requires further investigation.
