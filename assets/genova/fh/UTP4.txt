# UTP4

## Overview
UTP4 is a gene that encodes the UTP4 small subunit processome component, a protein integral to ribosome biogenesis. This protein is a part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, specifically within the UTP-A complex, which is crucial for the maturation of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the nucleolus. Structurally, UTP4 is characterized by two 7-bladed β-propellers, which facilitate its interaction with the 5'-external transcribed spacer (5'-ETS) region of the 35S pre-rRNA, playing a pivotal role in the assembly of the 90S pre-ribosome. The protein's interactions with other components, such as Utp8, are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the SSU processome. Mutations in the human homolog of UTP4 have been linked to North American Indian childhood cirrhosis, underscoring its significance in cellular function and human health (Freed2010The; Calviño2017Structural).

## Structure
The UTP4 protein, a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome, plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. Structurally, UTP4 is characterized by two 7-bladed β-propellers arranged in tandem, with each β-blade consisting of four β-strands (Calviño2017Structural). The β-propellers are linked in a tangential arrangement, and the C-terminal β-propeller features a unique Velcro-closure, which is important for protein integrity and interaction with Utp8 (Calviño2017Structural). This Velcro-closure involves the circular permutation of β-strands to close the ring structure of the β-propeller (Calviño2017Structural).

The UTP4 protein also contains positively charged regions that serve as RNA binding sites, specifically on β-propeller-1 and β-propeller-2, facilitating its interaction with the 5'-ETS region of the 35S pre-rRNA (Calviño2017Structural). The C-terminus of UTP4 is essential for its interaction with Utp8 and the assembly of the SSU processome, as truncations in this region lead to defects in ribosome biogenesis (Freed2010The). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its function in early ribosome assembly (Calviño2017Structural).

## Function
The UTP4 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex essential for the maturation of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the nucleolus. UTP4 is part of the UTP-A complex, which is one of the earliest complexes to associate with the nascent 35S rRNA during the assembly of the 90S pre-ribosome. This complex binds to the 5'-end of the 5'-external transcribed spacer (5'-ETS) region of the pre-rRNA, playing a crucial role in the hierarchical assembly process of ribosome biogenesis (Calviño2017Structural).

UTP4 consists of two orthogonal β-propellers and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the UTP-A complex. It interacts with other proteins such as Utp8, facilitating the assembly of the 90S pre-ribosome, which is a precursor to the small ribosomal subunit (Calviño2017Structural). The protein's interaction with specific regions of the 5'-ETS, including helices and single-stranded regions, is crucial for its function (Calviño2017Structural).

Mutations in the human homolog of UTP4 are associated with North American Indian childhood cirrhosis, highlighting its importance in healthy cellular function (Freed2010The).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
UTP4, a component of the small subunit processome, is involved in various interactions crucial for ribosome biogenesis. It is a part of the UTP-A complex, which binds to the 5'-end of the pre-ribosomal RNA (5'-ETS) and is essential for the assembly of the 90S pre-ribosome (Calviño2017Structural). UTP4 interacts with the 5'-ETS region within the 35S pre-rRNA, with specific binding sites identified through UV crosslinking and cDNA deep sequencing (CRAC) (Calviño2017Structural). The protein's structure, featuring two 7-bladed β-propellers, facilitates these interactions, with positively charged regions serving as RNA binding sites (Calviño2017Structural).

UTP4 also engages in protein-protein interactions within the t-Utp subcomplex, interacting with proteins such as Utp5, Utp8, Utp10, Utp15, and Utp17 (Calviño2017Structural; Freed2010The). The C-terminus of UTP4 is particularly important for its interaction with Utp8, and mutations in this region can disrupt the assembly of the SSU processome (Freed2010The). UTP4's interaction with Utp8 involves the extended C-terminal α-helix of Utp8, which aligns with the 5'-ETS helices (Calviño2017Structural). These interactions are critical for the proper assembly and function of the ribosome.
