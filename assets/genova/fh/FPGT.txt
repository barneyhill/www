# FPGT

## Overview
The FPGT gene encodes the enzyme fucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase, which is integral to the salvage pathway of GDP-fucose synthesis. This enzyme is classified as a transferase, specifically involved in the conversion of fucose-1-phosphate and GTP to GDP-fucose. GDP-fucose is a vital substrate for fucosylation, a post-translational modification process that adds fucose to glycoconjugates, influencing cell signaling, immune responses, and development. The FPGT enzyme operates primarily in the cytosol, facilitating the incorporation of fucose into glycoproteins, which are subsequently secreted. The proper function of FPGT and the transport of GDP-fucose into the Golgi apparatus are essential for maintaining effective fucosylation, impacting various biological processes and immune functions (Liu2011Functional; Sosicka2019Therapeutic).

## Function
Fucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (FPGT) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the salvage pathway of GDP-fucose synthesis. This pathway is an alternative to the de novo synthesis of GDP-fucose from glucose or mannose. In the salvage pathway, FPGT catalyzes the conversion of fucose-1-phosphate and GTP to GDP-fucose, which is a crucial donor substrate for fucosylation processes in cells (Liu2011Functional; Sosicka2019Therapeutic).

Fucosylation, the addition of fucose to glycoconjugates, is essential for various biological functions, including cell signaling, immune response, and development. GDP-fucose, produced by FPGT, serves as a donor substrate for fucosyltransferases, which transfer fucose to target molecules (Liu2011Functional). The activity of FPGT is primarily located in the cytosol, where it facilitates the incorporation of fucose into glycoproteins, which are then rapidly secreted after being transported into the cell (Sosicka2019Therapeutic).

The transport of GDP-fucose into the Golgi apparatus and ER lumen is mediated by specific transporters, with SLC35C1 being the major provider for Golgi GDP-fucose. This transport is crucial for proper fucosylation, which is important for immune function and cellular interactions (Sosicka2019Therapeutic).
