# CDKN1B

## Overview
The CDKN1B gene encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B protein, commonly referred to as p27^Kip1, which is a critical regulator of cell cycle progression. As a member of the CIP/Kip family of CDK inhibitors, p27^Kip1 functions primarily by inhibiting cyclin-CDK complexes, thereby controlling the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation, a characteristic feature of cancer (Occhi2013A; Bencivenga2021p27Kip1). The protein is intrinsically unstructured, allowing it to interact with various molecular targets, and its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination (Bencivenga2021p27Kip1). Mutations in CDKN1B are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (MEN4) and other neoplasms, underscoring its role as a tumor suppressor gene (Alrezk2017MEN4; Lavezzi2022Case).

## Structure
The CDKN1B gene encodes the p27 protein, also known as p27^Kip1, which is a member of the CIP/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. p27 is an intrinsically unstructured protein (IUP), characterized by its lack of a stable three-dimensional structure, allowing it to interact flexibly with numerous molecular targets (Bencivenga2021p27Kip1). The protein contains a kinase inhibitory domain (KID) that interacts with Cyclin A/CDK2. This domain includes a rigid coil with a cyclin-binding RxL motif, an amphipathic α-helix, and a domain that binds CDK, which includes an amphipathic β-hairpin, a β-strand, and a 3_10-helix (Bencivenga2021p27Kip1). The 3_10-helix blocks ATP access to CDK2, inhibiting its kinase activity (Bencivenga2021p27Kip1).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, regulate the activity, localization, and stability of p27. Phosphorylation at specific residues, such as T187, Y74, Y88, and Y89, plays a crucial role in modulating its interactions and function (Bencivenga2021p27Kip1). The protein can exist in different forms, including a truncated version known as p27*, which lacks the phosphorylation site at T187, making it resistant to proteasomal degradation during the G2/M phase (Kaida2022A).

## Function
The CDKN1B gene encodes the protein p27^Kip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression in healthy human cells. p27^Kip1 primarily functions by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly those involved in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. This inhibition is essential for maintaining proper cell cycle checkpoints and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer (Occhi2013A; Singh2021Lupus).

p27^Kip1 is most active in the nucleus, where it binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin-CDK complexes, such as cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2, thereby controlling cellular proliferation (Gebauer2004Expression; Singh2021Lupus). The protein's expression and stability are maximal in the G0 and early G1 phases, and its gradual degradation during the G1 phase is associated with increased activity of these complexes, which stimulate cell proliferation (Occhi2013A).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, p27^Kip1 is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy modulation and the development of autoimmunity. It also plays complex roles in T-cell function, promoting T-cell anergy and immune tolerance (Singh2021Lupus).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDKN1B gene, which encodes the p27 protein, are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (MEN4), a syndrome characterized by tumors in endocrine organs such as the parathyroid and pituitary glands (Alrezk2017MEN4; Lavezzi2022Case). MEN4 presents with a MEN1-like phenotype but does not involve mutations in the menin gene. Instead, it is caused by germline mutations in CDKN1B, leading to a loss of tumor suppressor functions due to a truncated structure or reduced binding activity of the p27 protein (Lavezzi2022Case).

CDKN1B mutations have also been linked to various non-endocrine neoplasms, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer (Lavezzi2022Case). In sporadic parathyroid adenomas, somatic mutations in CDKN1B have been identified, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (CostaGuda2011Somatic). These mutations can lead to reduced or absent p27 expression, contributing to tumor development (CostaGuda2011Somatic).

The CDKN1B gene is also implicated in pediatric Cushing's disease, with or without an MEN4 phenotype. Variants such as the frameshift variant p.Q107Rfs*12 can lead to truncated proteins, affecting protein function and stability (Chasseloup2020Germline). These findings highlight the gene's role as a tumor susceptibility gene for both endocrine and non-endocrine neoplasms (Alrezk2017MEN4).

## Interactions
CDKN1B, also known as p27, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its function as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. It interacts with cyclin-CDK complexes, such as cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2, to inhibit their activity and control cell cycle progression (Pardi2015Functional). CDKN1B also interacts with the microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin, affecting microtubule dynamics and cellular migration (Cusan2018Landscape). Mutations in CDKN1B can disrupt these interactions, as seen with the p.E171* mutation, which affects p27's ability to interact with stathmin, impacting cancer cell migration (Cusan2018Landscape).

CDKN1B is involved in the regulation of autophagy through its interaction with SQSTM1, promoting the degradation of Mir6981 and influencing PHLPP1 protein translation (Peng2019Autophagymediated). It also stabilizes the transcription factor SP1 by upregulating HSP90, which binds to SP1, enhancing its stability and promoting SQSTM1 transcription (Peng2019Autophagymediated). Additionally, CDKN1B interacts with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc2 and Ubc3, which are involved in its ubiquitination and degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Pagano1995Role). These interactions highlight CDKN1B's role in regulating cell cycle progression, autophagy, and protein stability.
