# SEPTIN2

## Overview
SEPTIN2 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 2, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins. Septin 2 is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell polarity, and vesicle trafficking, by forming part of the septin cytoskeleton. This protein is characterized by its conserved GTPase domain, which is crucial for its ability to form hetero-oligomeric complexes, such as the SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 hexamer, that are essential for microtubule dynamics and cellular organization (Valadares2017Septin; Almeida2011Septin). Septin 2 also plays a significant role in the organization of primary cilia and acts as a diffusion barrier during cell division (Dolat2013Septin; Montagna2015Mammalian). Clinically, SEPTIN2 is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression and mutations are associated with tumorigenesis and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Cai2022LncRNA; He2019Expression).

## Structure
SEPTIN2 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, characterized by a conserved GTPase domain. The primary structure of SEPTIN2 includes an N-terminal domain, a central GTP-binding domain, and a C-terminal domain, which is often predicted to adopt a coiled-coil conformation (Almeida2011Septin). The GTPase domain of SEPTIN2 is similar to small GTP-binding proteins, featuring a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Valadares2017Septin). This domain also includes a unique structural element (SUE) important for filament formation, consisting of a small three-stranded β-sheet and two α-helices (Valadares2017Septin).

In terms of secondary structure, SEPTIN2 exhibits significant alpha-helical content at lower temperatures, transitioning to beta-sheet structures as the temperature increases, a characteristic of amyloidogenic proteins (Pissuti2012Self). The tertiary structure forms a conserved septin core, and the quaternary structure involves the formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes, such as the SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 hexamer (Valadares2017Septin).

SEPTIN2 can form dimers in solution, with dimerization facilitated by the G-interface, which stabilizes the dimer (Valadares2017Septin). The protein is also known to form amyloid-like aggregates, particularly at higher temperatures, due to its GTP-binding domain's tendency to aggregate (Pissuti2012Self). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions.

## Function
SEPTIN2 is a crucial component of the septin cytoskeleton, involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It forms part of the SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 complex, which plays a significant role in microtubule dynamics by promoting nucleation, growth, elongation, and bundling. This complex is essential for maintaining cell polarity and morphogenesis, particularly in epithelial cells and neurons (Spiliotis2021Cellular). SEPTIN2 is also involved in the organization of primary cilia, acting as a membrane diffusion barrier to maintain the localization of ciliary membrane proteins. Its depletion can lead to the loss of primary cilia and improper distribution of ciliary proteins (Dolat2013Septin).

In the context of cytokinesis, SEPTIN2 acts as a diffusion barrier, compartmentalizing cellular domains and ensuring proper cell division. It localizes at the metaphase plate during cell division, and its depletion can result in chromosome misalignment and defects in cytokinesis (Montagna2015Mammalian). SEPTIN2 also interacts with microtubule-associated proteins, such as MAP4, to modulate microtubule dynamics during mitosis and cytokinesis (Neubauer2017The). Additionally, SEPTIN2 is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, facilitating the transport of vesicles from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (Ivanov2021Novel).

## Clinical Significance
SEPTIN2 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and mutations. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SEPTIN2 is significantly overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels, correlating with lymph node metastasis, poor differentiation, and advanced TNM staging. This overexpression is associated with reduced overall survival, making SEPTIN2 an independent prognostic factor in CRC (He2019Expression). 

Mutations in SEPTIN2, particularly in the GTP-binding pocket and dimerization interfaces, are frequently observed in large intestine tumors. These mutations can disrupt septin assembly and function, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis (Angelis2016Septin). 

In breast cancer, SEPTIN2 is upregulated and plays a role in cell proliferation and migration. It is regulated by the long non-coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 through the miR-497-5p/SEPT2 axis, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Cai2022LncRNA). 

SEPTIN2 is also involved in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it interacts with Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) to promote cell cycle progression and cancer cell proliferation (Xu2018Coupling). These findings highlight SEPTIN2's role in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SEPTIN2 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It forms part of the SEPT2-6-7 complex, which is essential for recruiting the microtubule-associated protein MAP4, playing a significant role in microtubule dynamics during mitosis and cytokinesis (Neubauer2017The). SEPTIN2 also interacts with BORG proteins, which are CDC42 effector proteins, influencing septin complex organization and affecting cell polarity, cytokinesis, and vesicle transport (Neubauer2017The).

In the context of podosome maturation, SEPTIN2 is recruited to nascent podosomes and interacts with phosphoinositides (PIPs) in the plasma membrane, facilitated by its N-terminal polybasic domain. This interaction is crucial for the transition of nascent podosomes into mature, matrix-degrading organelles (Collins2019Septin2). SEPTIN2 forms a hexamer with SEPTIN6 and SEPTIN7, regulating podosome function and endothelial cell invasion (Collins2019Septin2).

SEPTIN2 is also a target of the Zika virus protease NS2B3, which cleaves SEPTIN2 at the R306 site, disrupting the septin complex and delaying cytokinesis. This interaction is linked to mitotic defects in neural progenitors, contributing to the pathogenesis of Zika virus-related conditions (Li2019Zika). SEPTIN2's interaction with the SON protein and centrosome-associated protein E (CENPE) highlights its involvement in RNA splicing, cell cycle regulation, and cell division (Desterke2019Proteinprotein).
