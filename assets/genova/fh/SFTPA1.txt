# SFTPA1

## Overview
The SFTPA1 gene encodes surfactant protein A1 (SP-A1), a member of the collectin family of proteins, which plays a pivotal role in pulmonary function and innate immunity. SP-A1 is a crucial component of the pulmonary surfactant system, responsible for reducing surface tension in the alveoli and preventing lung collapse. It is primarily expressed in alveolar type II cells and contributes to the stability and function of lung alveoli, facilitating efficient gas exchange (Floros2021Differential). Structurally, SP-A1 is characterized by its collagen-like domain and carbohydrate recognition domain, which are essential for its interaction with lipids and other proteins, forming trimeric and multimeric complexes that enhance its functional capacity (Whitsett2014The; Floros2021Human). Beyond its structural role, SP-A1 acts as a soluble pattern recognition receptor, binding to microbial surfaces and aiding in their clearance, thus playing a significant role in the innate immune response (Floros2021Differential). Mutations in the SFTPA1 gene have been linked to various pulmonary diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and familial interstitial pneumonia, highlighting its clinical significance (Doubková2019A; Takezaki2019A).

## Structure
Surfactant protein A1 (SP-A1), encoded by the SFTPA1 gene, is a crucial component of pulmonary surfactant, playing a significant role in reducing surface tension in the alveoli and participating in innate immune defense. The primary structure of SP-A1 consists of 248 amino acids, including a signal peptide, an N-terminal region, a collagen-like domain, a neck, and a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (Floros2021Human). The collagen-like domain is characterized by 23 Gly-X-Y triplets, with a notable irregularity (Pro-Cys-Pro-Pro) that introduces a kink in the structure (Floros2021Human).

The secondary structure of SP-A1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of the protein into a globular shape, which is essential for its interaction with lipids and other proteins. In its quaternary structure, SP-A1 forms trimeric complexes that can oligomerize into multimers, enhancing its functional capacity in the airway (Whitsett2014The).

Post-translational modifications of SP-A1 may include glycosylation, which is important for its stability and function in the lung environment (Whitsett2014The). The presence of cysteine at position 85 in SP-A1 allows for the formation of disulfide bonds, influencing its oligomerization and functional properties (Floros2021Human).

## Function
Surfactant protein A1 (SP-A1), encoded by the SFTPA1 gene, is a critical component of the pulmonary surfactant system, which reduces surface tension in the alveoli and prevents lung collapse. SP-A1 is primarily active in alveolar type II cells and plays a significant role in surfactant-related functions and innate immunity processes (Floros2021Differential). It contributes to the stability of lung alveoli, enabling efficient oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange (Floros2021Differential).

SP-A1 is involved in the formation and reorganization of surfactant structures, such as tubular myelin, which is essential for maintaining surfactant function in the lungs (Floros2021Human). It facilitates lipid membrane reorganization, leading to more efficient phospholipid adsorption and lower surface tension, partly due to its higher oligomerization state (Floros2021Human). SP-A1 also provides better protection against surfactant inactivation by serum proteins (Floros2021Human).

In addition to its structural roles, SP-A1 is part of the collectin family of proteins, which are involved in innate immunity. It acts as a soluble pattern recognition receptor, binding to various molecules on the surface of microorganisms and facilitating their clearance (Floros2021Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SFTPA1 gene are associated with several pulmonary diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP). A homozygous missense mutation in SFTPA1, specifically T622C, has been linked to IPF in a Japanese family, causing necroptosis of type II alveolar epithelial cells and disrupting protein secretion (Takezaki2019A). This mutation leads to impaired secretion of the SFTPA1 protein, contributing to the pathogenesis of IPF (Takezaki2019A).

Another study identified a novel germline mutation, c.532 G > A, in the SFTPA1 gene associated with familial interstitial pneumonia. This mutation results in a valine to methionine substitution, potentially disrupting protein structure and function (Doubková2019A).

Mutations in SFTPA1 are also linked to an increased risk of lung cancer, particularly in individuals over 40 years old. These mutations may affect the tumor-suppressing abilities of the SP-A protein, potentially altering immune responses and promoting tumorigenesis (van2021Genetic). The phenotypic expression of these mutations can vary significantly, with some carriers remaining asymptomatic while others develop severe lung diseases (Legendre2020Functional).

## Interactions
SFTPA1, or surfactant protein A1, is involved in various interactions that are crucial for its function in the lung. It forms complexes with other surfactant proteins, such as SFTPA2, SFTPB, and SFTPC, which are essential for surfactant homeostasis and function. In the context of cystic fibrosis, SFTPA1 interacts with SFTPB and SFTPC through several intergenic SNP-SNP interactions, indicating a significant role in modulating disease severity (Lin2018Genetic). Specifically, SFTPA1 SNP rs1136450 interacts with SFTPB SNP rs7316 and SFTPA2 SNP rs1059046, which are significant in the mild CF subgroup (Lin2018Genetic).

In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a mutation in SFTPA1 disrupts its secretion and affects its ability to form complexes with SFTPA2, highlighting its role in protein interactions within the lung (Takezaki2019A). The mutation leads to increased necroptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, mediated by pathways involving IRE1α, JNK, and Ripk3, suggesting that SFTPA1 interacts with these cellular stress pathways (Takezaki2019A). These interactions underscore the importance of SFTPA1 in maintaining lung function and responding to pulmonary diseases.
