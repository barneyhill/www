# CNTN1

## Overview
The CNTN1 gene encodes the protein contactin 1, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored neuronal cell adhesion molecule that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Contactin 1 is characterized by its six immunoglobulin-like domains and four fibronectin type III domains, which facilitate its role in neural development and cell adhesion (Chen2015Contactin; Compton2008Mutations). This protein is crucial for various neural processes, including axon guidance, synapse formation, and the stabilization of neuronal networks. It is predominantly expressed in neurons and glial cells, where it forms complexes with other proteins to maintain paranodal axoglial junctions and support myelination (Boyle2001Contactin; Ogawa2023Antibodydirected). Mutations in CNTN1 have been associated with congenital myopathies and are implicated in cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Compton2008Mutations; Gu2020Contactin).

## Structure
Contactin 1 (CNTN1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored neuronal cell adhesion molecule that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Its molecular structure is characterized by six immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and four fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, which are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and neural development (Chen2015Contactin; Veny2020Contactin1; Compton2008Mutations). The Ig domains are involved in forming globular structures through intrachain disulfide bonds, typical of immunoglobulin-like structures (Ranscht1988Sequence). The FNIII domains contribute to the protein's ability to interact with other cellular components, although CNTN1 lacks the typical cell-binding sequence found in other proteins with FNIII domains (Ranscht1988Sequence).

CNTN1 is anchored to the plasma membrane via a GPI linkage, which is a common post-translational modification that facilitates its localization to the cell surface (Chen2015Contactin; Peles1995The). This anchoring is essential for its function in mediating interactions between neurons and glial cells, as well as in the formation of neuronal microcircuitries and myelin (Veny2020Contactin1). The protein's structure allows it to participate in various developmental processes, including axon guidance and synaptogenesis (Chen2018Contactin1F3).

## Function
Contactin-1 (CNTN1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored neuronal membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the nervous system. It is involved in cell adhesion, facilitating axon guidance, synapse formation, and neuronal network stabilization. CNTN1 is primarily active in the cell membrane and contributes to signal transduction pathways that influence neural cell interactions and myelination (Boyle2001Contactin; Ogawa2023Antibodydirected).

In healthy human cells, CNTN1 is expressed in neurons and glial cells, where it forms complexes with other proteins such as Caspr and neurofascin, particularly at the paranodal axoglial junctions. This interaction is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of these junctions, which are critical for saltatory conduction in myelinated nerves (Boyle2001Contactin; Ogawa2023Antibodydirected). CNTN1 also plays a significant role in the axon initial segment (AIS), where it is involved in the assembly of the AIS extracellular matrix and the precise innervation of neurons by inhibitory interneurons, which is crucial for modulating neuronal excitability and brain circuit function (Ogawa2023Antibodydirected).

CNTN1's involvement extends to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where it is crucial for neuromuscular transmission and the establishment and stabilization of synaptic connections. Its expression at the NMJ is vital for proper nerve-muscle communication and adhesion, impacting muscle development and function (Compton2008Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CNTN1 gene, which encodes the neural adhesion molecule contactin-1, are linked to a severe form of lethal congenital myopathy. This condition is characterized by fetal akinesia and nonspecific myopathic features on muscle biopsy. The mutations lead to reduced expression of contactin-1 at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), causing defects in neuromuscular transmission and resulting in a myopathic phenotype. The disorder is part of a continuum with congenital myopathies and congenital myasthenic syndromes, highlighting the importance of NMJ adhesion proteins in muscle development (Compton2008Mutations).

CNTN1 is also implicated in various cancers, where its expression is often upregulated. In hepatocellular carcinoma, thyroid cancer, and glioblastomas, elevated CNTN1 expression correlates with tumor size, TNM stage, and poor overall survival. It is involved in cancer progression and metastasis, acting as an oncogenic protein that promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. CNTN1 activates the Notch signaling pathway, which is linked to cancer stem cell regulation and metastasis. Knockdown studies have shown that reducing CNTN1 expression can suppress cancer cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gu2020Contactin).

## Interactions
Contactin 1 (CNTN1) is a neural cell adhesion molecule that participates in various interactions crucial for nervous system development and function. CNTN1 interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ), forming a complex that modulates the development of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). This interaction inhibits OPC proliferation and promotes their maturation into oligodendrocytes, which is essential for myelination in the central nervous system (Lamprianou2011A).

CNTN1 also forms a complex with neurofascin 155, mediated by Ig1-Ig6 domain interactions. This complex is critical for the formation of paranodal myelin-axon junctions, which are necessary for effective saltatory conduction in myelinated fibers. The interaction is influenced by glycosylation patterns, which affect the binding affinity and structural plasticity of the complex (Chataigner2022Structural).

Additionally, CNTN1 interacts with receptor tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ), specifically binding to its carbonic anhydrase domain. This interaction is significant for neuronal adhesion and neurite growth, suggesting that CNTN1 acts as a functional neuronal receptor for RPTPβ (Peles1995The). CNTN1 also binds to Nr-CAM, facilitating neurite outgrowth in conjunction with RPTPβ (Sakurai1997Induction). These interactions highlight CNTN1's role in neural development and its potential involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders.
