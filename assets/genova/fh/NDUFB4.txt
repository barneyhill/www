# NDUFB4

## Overview
NDUFB4 is a gene that encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B4, a protein that is an integral component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is categorized as an accessory subunit within the complex, playing a pivotal role in the electron transport chain and ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. NDUFB4 is essential for the proper assembly and stability of complex I, contributing to the formation of subassemblies and interacting with other subunits to maintain the structural integrity of the complex (Padavannil2022The). While direct mutations in the NDUFB4 gene have not been extensively documented, its involvement in mitochondrial function suggests that alterations in its expression or function could have significant implications for mitochondrial diseases (Bianchi2011Novel; Ji2020Complex).

## Function
The NDUFB4 protein is an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain and ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. In healthy human cells, NDUFB4 is essential for the proper assembly and stability of complex I. It does not form part of the individual membrane arm subassemblies but is proposed to join during the formation of the P P -b/P D -a subassembly or the Q/P subassembly. In the fully assembled complex, NDUFB4 interacts with several other subunits, including NDUFB9, NDUFB8, ND5, NDUFB11, and ND4, and is involved in trapping lipids to the surface of the complex (Padavannil2022The).

The position of NDUFB4 binding over ND5-HL suggests it is added only after the connection of the P D -a and P D -b subassemblies, indicating that NDUFB4 acts to cement the interaction between these subassemblies during complex I biogenesis. Knockout of NDUFB4 in HEK293T cells results in incomplete assembly of the complex and a reduction in the levels of subunits in the P D -b subassembly and N-module, highlighting its essential role in maintaining complex I integrity and function (Padavannil2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the NDUFB4 gene, which encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, have been implicated in various mitochondrial dysfunctions. In a study examining patients with large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions, a decrease in NDUFB4 levels was observed, suggesting a potential link between these deletions and mitochondrial dysfunction, although the study did not directly attribute the condition to mutations in the NDUFB4 gene itself (Bianchi2011Novel). This dysfunction is particularly evident in complex I of the respiratory chain, which is crucial for cellular energy production.

In the context of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a study found that certain mutations affecting complex I stability and activity did not alter the expression of NDUFB4, indicating that while NDUFB4 is a component of complex I, its expression levels remain stable despite other mutations within the complex (Ji2020Complex). This suggests that NDUFB4 may not be directly involved in the pathogenesis of LHON, but its role in maintaining complex I integrity is crucial.

Overall, while direct mutations in NDUFB4 have not been extensively documented, its involvement in mitochondrial complex I suggests that alterations in its expression or function could contribute to mitochondrial diseases.

## Interactions
NDUFB4 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, playing a crucial role in the assembly and stability of the complex. It interacts with several other subunits within complex I, including NDUFB9, NDUFB8, ND5, NDUFB11, and ND4, through its N-terminal matrix domain. In the membrane, NDUFB4 interacts with ND5 via ND5-HL and ND4, while in the intermembrane space, it interacts with NDUFC2, NDUFB10, ND5, and ND4 (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFB4 is also involved in the formation of an electron transport chain supercomplex, as evidenced by its cross-linking with UQCR10, a subunit of complex III, in human mitoplasts. This interaction was identified using cross-linking mass spectrometry, indicating the formation of a supercomplex that includes both complex I and complex III (Linden2024Elucidation).

In the context of disease, NDUFB4 has been identified as a hub protein in protein-protein interaction networks related to painful diabetic neuropathy and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting its significant role in these conditions. It is associated with differentially expressed genes and proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and other critical pathways (Panga2019Mitochondrial; AmiriDashatan2024Introducing).
