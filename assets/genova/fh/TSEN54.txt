# TSEN54

## Overview
TSEN54 is a gene that encodes the tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 54, a crucial component of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease complex. This protein is integral to the maturation of tRNA molecules, facilitating the excision of introns from precursor tRNAs. As a scaffold protein, TSEN54 plays a pivotal role in assembling the heterotetrameric complex, which includes other subunits such as TSEN34, TSEN2, and TSEN15, and ensures the structural integrity necessary for precise tRNA splicing. The protein's structural features, including a bipartite fold and a conserved N-terminal extension, enable it to interact with pre-tRNA and other complex components, acting as a 'molecular ruler' to define intron-exon junctions. Mutations in TSEN54 are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders like pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and its expression levels have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Fu2023Comprehensive; Sekulovski2022Structural; Hayne2023Structural).

## Structure
The TSEN54 protein is a crucial component of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which is responsible for the excision of introns from precursor tRNA molecules. Structurally, TSEN54 is part of a heterotetrameric complex that includes TSEN34, TSEN2, and TSEN15. TSEN54 serves as a scaffold within this complex, playing a pivotal role in positioning the pre-tRNA for accurate cleavage (Yuan2023Recognition; Hayne2023Structural).

TSEN54 features a bipartite fold with a flexible central region, which is essential for its interaction with the RNA kinase CLP1, suggesting a regulatory role in tRNA splicing (Sekulovski2022Structural). The N-terminal extension (NTE) of TSEN54 forms a 'three-claw-clamp' conformation, contributing significantly to the buried surface area in the complex and facilitating interactions with the pre-tRNA (Yuan2023Recognition). This NTE is well-conserved across eukaryotes, indicating its evolutionary importance.

The TSEN54 subunit interacts extensively with TSEN34 and TSEN2, forming a large interface that stabilizes the complex. It acts as a 'molecular ruler,' defining intron-exon junctions to ensure precise cleavage (Hayne2023Structural; Yuan2023Recognition). The structural integrity of TSEN54 is crucial, as mutations in this protein are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia (Sekulovski2022Structural).

## Function
TSEN54 is a critical component of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which is essential for the maturation of tRNA molecules by excising introns from precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNAs). In healthy human cells, TSEN54 functions as a scaffold within the TSEN complex, facilitating the assembly and structural integrity of the complex by bringing together the catalytic subunits TSEN34 and TSEN2 (Sekulovski2022Structural; Yuan2023Recognition). It acts as a molecular ruler, defining the 3' splice site by holding the tRNA body in place, which is crucial for accurate splicing and the proper maturation of tRNAs (Sekulovski2022Structural; Hayne2023Structural).

TSEN54 interacts extensively with the pre-tRNA, particularly the acceptor stem and D-arm, positioning the tRNA for precise cleavage (Yuan2023Recognition; Hayne2023Structural). This interaction is essential for the catalytic reaction at the 3′ and 5′ splice sites, ensuring the availability of mature tRNA necessary for protein biosynthesis and cellular homeostasis (Hayne2023Structural; Yuan2023Recognition). TSEN54 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the proper functioning of protein synthesis by ensuring the availability of mature tRNA (Yuan2023Recognition).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TSEN54 gene are primarily associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH), a group of neurodegenerative disorders. Specifically, TSEN54 mutations are linked to PCH types 2, 4, and 5. PCH2 is characterized by dyskinesia, dystonia, progressive microcephaly, and a specific MRI pattern, often resulting from a common homozygous p.A307S mutation (Namavar2010Clinical; Rudaks2011Novel). PCH4 presents a more severe phenotype with prenatal symptoms such as polyhydramnios and contractures, often leading to early postnatal death. This type is frequently associated with compound heterozygosity involving the p.A307S mutation and another nonsense mutation (Namavar2010Clinical; Rudaks2011Novel). PCH5 involves compound heterozygous genotypes or splice site mutations, with clinical manifestations including developmental retardation and seizures (Ghasemi2024Broadening).

In addition to its role in PCH, TSEN54 expression is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Increased expression of TSEN54 in HCC tissues is associated with poorer prognosis and may serve as an early biomarker for the disease. This overexpression is linked to hypomethylation of the TSEN54 promoter and is more prevalent in certain ethnic groups, such as Asians (Fu2023Comprehensive).

## Interactions
The TSEN54 protein is a critical component of the human tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, interacting with other subunits such as TSEN34, TSEN2, and TSEN15 to form a functional heterotetramer. TSEN54 pairs with TSEN34 in a tail-to-tail fashion, involving a complex interface of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions, covering a contact surface area of 2287.2 Å² (Sekulovski2022Structural). This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity of the complex and assists in positioning the mature domain of pre-tRNAs (Sekulovski2022Structural).

TSEN54 also plays a significant role in recognizing and processing pre-tRNA by interacting extensively with the tRNA, particularly with the acceptor stem and D-arm, primarily through interactions with the phosphate backbone (Hayne2023Structural). It acts as a 'molecular ruler,' influencing the cleavage site by interacting with specific regions of the pre-tRNA (Hayne2023Structural).

Additionally, TSEN54 interacts with the RNA kinase CLP1, serving as an interaction hub for its recruitment. This interaction is mediated by a disordered region of TSEN54, and deletion of this region abrogates CLP1 binding (Sekulovski2022Structural). These interactions highlight TSEN54's role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the TSEN complex.
