# MKRN1

## Overview
MKRN1 (makorin ring finger protein 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, telomere stability, and protein degradation. The protein, characterized by its zinc finger motifs and a RING finger domain, facilitates protein-protein interactions and RNA binding, which are crucial for its role in ubiquitination (Kim2005Ubiquitin; Omwancha2006Makorin). MKRN1 exists in two isoforms, MKRN1-long and MKRN1-short, which differ in their structural components and functional capabilities, particularly in ubiquitination (Miroci2012Makorin). The protein is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating ribosome-associated quality control, telomere length, and transcriptional repression of key activators such as c-Jun/AP-1 and p53 (Kim2005Ubiquitin; Hildebrandt2019The; Omwancha2006Makorin). Additionally, MKRN1's interactions with viral proteins and its involvement in metabolic pathways highlight its significance in host defense mechanisms and potential implications in metabolic disorders (Kim2013Suppression; Wang2022MRKNs:).

## Structure
MKRN1 (makorin ring finger protein 1) is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes multiple zinc finger motifs and a RING finger domain. The protein contains four C3H zinc finger motifs and a single C3HC4 RING zinc finger, which are distributed throughout the protein, with three zinc fingers located in the amino-terminal half and the RING zinc finger and the fourth zinc finger in the carboxy-terminal half (Omwancha2006Makorin). These zinc fingers are involved in RNA binding and protein-protein interactions, contributing to MKRN1's role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Kim2005Ubiquitin).

MKRN1 exists in two isoforms, MKRN1-long and MKRN1-short, generated through alternative splicing and differential polyadenylation. MKRN1-long includes all four zinc fingers and the complete RING domain, while MKRN1-short lacks the fourth zinc finger and part of the RING domain, including two essential cysteine residues, which affects its ubiquitination capabilities (Miroci2012Makorin). The MKRN1-short isoform is predominant in the rat brain and is involved in translation regulation through its interaction with poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) via a PAM2-like motif (Miroci2012Makorin).

MKRN1's structure suggests its involvement in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and telomere stability, with its RING domain playing a crucial role in its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Kim2005Ubiquitin; Omwancha2006Makorin).

## Function
MKRN1 (makorin ring finger protein 1) is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its activity as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is involved in ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) by promoting ribosome stalling at poly(A) sequences, which is crucial for preventing the translation of erroneous proteins from prematurely polyadenylated transcripts. This function is mediated through its interaction with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1) and the ubiquitylation of ribosomal protein RPS10 and PABPC1, thereby maintaining proteome integrity (Hildebrandt2019The).

MKRN1 also regulates telomere length by targeting the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT, for ubiquitination and degradation, thus acting as a negative regulator of telomere length homeostasis (Kim2005Ubiquitin). In transcription regulation, MKRN1 functions as a repressor of several RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional activators, including c-Jun/AP-1 and p53, independent of its ubiquitin ligase activity (Omwancha2006Makorin; Wang2022MRKNs:).

Additionally, MKRN1 is involved in the degradation of various proteins, including p53 and p21, and interacts with viral proteins, promoting their degradation, which suggests a role in host defense mechanisms (Wang2022MRKNs:). MKRN1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as cell cycle regulation and stress responses (Omwancha2006Makorin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MKRN1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal and gastric cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MKRN1 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. High MKRN1 expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and shorter overall survival in CRC patients. MKRN1 promotes CRC metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the degradation of Smad nuclear-interacting protein 1 (SNIP1), which activates the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zhang2023MKRN1).

In gastric cancer, MKRN1 acts as a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p14ARF. MKRN1 promotes the degradation of p14ARF through ubiquitination, leading to reduced cellular senescence and increased tumorigenesis. MKRN1 overexpression is associated with well-differentiated tumors, while its depletion results in reduced tumor formation in gastric cancer models. The inverse relationship between MKRN1 and p14ARF levels suggests that MKRN1 may accelerate gastric tumorigenesis by destabilizing p14ARF (Ko2012Acceleration).

MKRN1 also plays a role in metabolic diseases by targeting PPARγ for degradation, thereby suppressing adipocyte differentiation. This suggests potential implications for obesity and related metabolic disorders (Kim2013Suppression).

## Interactions
MKRN1 (makorin ring finger protein 1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with the nuclear receptor PPARγ, targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation, which suppresses adipocyte differentiation (Kim2013Suppression). MKRN1 also interacts with PPARγ2, reducing its transcriptional activity through ubiquitination and degradation (Kim2013Suppression).

MKRN1 is involved in the ubiquitination of hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, affecting telomere length homeostasis. This interaction is dependent on the integrity of MKRN1's RING finger domain (Kim2005Ubiquitin). MKRN1 also interacts with the West Nile Virus capsid protein (WNVCp), inducing its degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway (Ko2010MKRN1).

In nerve cells, MKRN1-short, a variant of MKRN1, interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) to stimulate translation. This interaction is mediated by a PAM2-like motif within MKRN1-short and is RNA-independent (Miroci2012Makorin). During human adenovirus infection, MKRN1 interacts with the viral core protein pVII, leading to its proteasomal degradation (Inturi2018Human).
