# DOK6

## Overview
DOK6, or docking protein 6, is a gene that encodes an intracellular adaptor protein involved in neurotrophic signaling pathways. The DOK6 protein is a member of the DOK family, characterized by its pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which facilitate interactions with phospholipids and other proteins, playing a crucial role in signal transduction (Li2010Downstream; Guo2024Docking). Predominantly expressed in the peripheral nervous system, DOK6 is essential for axonal transport and myelination, interacting with receptors such as TrkC and Ret, and participating in the MEK/ERK signaling pathway (Guo2024Docking). The protein's involvement in maintaining neuronal function and its potential implications in peripheral neuropathy and cancer highlight its significance in both neurological and oncological research (Huang2023DNA; Guo2024Docking).

## Structure
DOK6 is a member of the DOK family of intracellular adaptor proteins, characterized by specific structural domains that facilitate its role in signal transduction. The protein features an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which are crucial for its interaction with phospholipids and other proteins (Li2010Downstream; Guo2024Docking). The C-terminal region of DOK6 contains multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which are important for its function and interaction with other signaling molecules (Guo2024Docking).

DOK6 is involved in neurotrophic signaling, particularly through its interaction with the TrkC receptor. This interaction is mediated by the PTB domain binding to the NPQY motif of TrkC, a process dependent on the receptor's kinase activity (Li2010Downstream). The protein also interacts with other components of the trafficking machinery, such as MAP1B, Tau, and Dynein, and plays a role in activating the ERK1/2 kinase pathway, which is essential for maintaining axonal survival and homeostasis (Guo2024Docking).

DOK6 is expressed predominantly in the peripheral nervous system, particularly in sensory neurons, and is crucial for axonal transport and myelination (Guo2024Docking). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its significant role in maintaining neuronal function and its involvement in peripheral neuropathy (Guo2024Docking).

## Function
DOK6 (docking protein 6) is an adaptor protein involved in neurotrophic signaling pathways, playing a crucial role in the maintenance and function of peripheral neurons. It selectively mediates signal transduction for TrkC and Ret receptors, but not for TrkA and TrkB, and is highly expressed in peripheral neurons, particularly in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (Guo2024Docking). DOK6 is involved in the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, interacting with the NPQY motif of the TrkC receptor, and affects the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and GSK3Î², which influences axonal transport and stability (Li2010Downstream; Guo2024Docking).

In healthy cells, DOK6 is crucial for maintaining axonal survival and homeostasis by activating the ERK1/2 kinase pathway, which is essential for axon-glia communication and myelination in the peripheral nervous system (Guo2024Docking). It interacts with proteins involved in axonal transport, such as MAP1B, Tau, and Dynein, and controls their phosphorylation, thereby influencing axonal integrity and function (Guo2024Docking). DOK6's role in neurotrophic signaling is significant for the structural and functional integrity of peripheral nerves, impacting processes like axon guidance and neuronal cell signaling (Guo2024Docking).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the DOK6 gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. DOK6 is crucial for maintaining peripheral nerve integrity, and its deletion in mice leads to symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as impaired sensory function, abnormal posture, and nerve conduction issues (Guo2024Docking). These symptoms are attributed to axonal degeneration and myelin abnormalities, highlighting the gene's role in axonal stability and myelination (Guo2024Docking).

DOK6 polymorphisms may also increase susceptibility to Hirschsprung's disease, a developmental defect characterized by the absence of enteric ganglia in the distal colon (Guo2024Docking). This suggests a broader role for DOK6 in peripheral nervous system development.

In the context of cancer, DOK6 has been identified as one of the hypermethylated genes in colorectal cancer patients with high tumor mutation burden. This hypermethylation pattern is used for early diagnostic prediction and prognostic evaluation, indicating a potential role for DOK6 in cancer diagnostics (Huang2023DNA). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DOK6 in both neurological and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
DOK6 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in neurotrophic signaling pathways. It specifically binds to the NPQY motif of the TrkC receptor via its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, with the interaction dependent on the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue Tyr516. This binding is crucial for the MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is involved in neurite outgrowth and axonal maintenance (Li2010Downstream; Guo2024Docking).

DOK6 also interacts with microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP1B, Tau, and Dynein. These interactions are essential for maintaining axonal stability and facilitating retrograde axonal transport. The binding of DOK6 to MAP1B is particularly important for the phosphorylation of MAP1B, which affects microtubule stability and myelination processes (Guo2024Docking).

In the context of gastric cancer, DOK6 is involved in multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. It interacts with receptors and signaling proteins, including EGFR and ERBB2, suggesting a role in transducing mitogenic and cell proliferation signals. These interactions may influence cancer progression and patient survival (Leong2017Chromosomal).
