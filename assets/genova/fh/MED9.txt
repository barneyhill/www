# MED9

## Overview
MED9 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 9, which is a component of the Mediator complex, a critical multi-protein assembly involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The MED9 protein is categorized as part of the middle module of the Mediator complex, where it forms a heterodimer with MED4, contributing to the structural integrity and functional flexibility of the complex (Malik2017Emerging; Larivière2013Model). This heterodimer is characterized by a 4-helix bundle fold, a structural motif that facilitates its interaction with other subunits, such as MED7 and MED21, forming a central tetramer essential for transcription regulation (Larivière2013Model). MED9's role extends to various cellular contexts, including endothelial progenitor cells, where alternative splicing may lead to different protein isoforms, potentially affecting the Mediator complex's composition and function (Rienzo2014RNASeq). Additionally, MED9 has been implicated in cardiac disease pathogenesis through its interaction with the transcription factor GATA4, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy (Franzese2024Familial).

## Structure
The MED9 protein is a component of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. Structurally, MED9 is part of the Mediator middle module and forms a heterodimer with Med4. This heterodimer is characterized by a 4-helix bundle fold, a common structural motif shared with other heterodimers like Med7C/Med21 (Larivière2013Model). The tertiary structure of the Med4/Med9 heterodimer is supported by the clustering of hydrophobic residues at the interface, which stabilizes the interaction between the two subunits (Larivière2013Model).

In the context of the quaternary structure, MED9, along with Med4, forms part of a central tetramer with the Med7/Med21 heterodimer within the middle module of the Mediator complex. This arrangement is crucial for the module's flexibility and function in transcription regulation (Larivière2013Model). The Med4/Med9-Med7C/Med21 tetramer model is further supported by cross-linking data, which provides insights into the spatial arrangement of these subunits (Larivière2013Model). The exact position of Med9 helix 1 remains uncertain, as it is represented as a semitransparent ribbon in structural models (Larivière2013Model).

## Function
MED9 is a component of the Mediator complex, a crucial multi-protein assembly involved in the regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells. The Mediator complex acts as a bridge, facilitating interactions between RNA polymerase II and various transcription factors, thereby playing a significant role in the initiation of transcription (Malik2017Emerging). MED9 is part of the middle module of the Mediator complex, which is essential for the structural integrity and function of the complex (Malik2017Emerging).

In endothelial progenitor cells, novel alternatively spliced transcripts of MED9 have been identified, which may encode different protein isoforms. These isoforms could potentially contribute to the diversity of the Mediator complex, affecting its composition and function (Rienzo2014RNASeq). The novel MED9 transcript identified in these cells is predicted to encode a truncated protein, which might have distinct regulatory roles due to its unique miRNA binding sites (Rienzo2014RNASeq).

The consistent presence of MED9 across different Mediator complex preparations suggests its stable role within the complex, contributing to its function in transcription regulation (Paoletti2006Quantitative). However, specific functions of MED9 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MED9, a subunit of the Mediator complex, is involved in various protein-protein interactions essential for transcription regulation. Within the Mediator complex, MED9 is part of the Middle module and interacts with other subunits such as MED1, MED4, MED7, MED10, MED21, and MED31. These interactions are conserved across species, including yeast and humans, indicating a fundamental role in the transcriptional machinery (Guglielmi2004A; Tsai2014Subunit).

MED9 forms a stable heterodimer with MED4, and this interaction is crucial for the structural integrity of the Middle module. The Med4/Med9 heterodimer is structurally similar to the Med7C/Med21 heterodimer, forming a tetramer model that is supported by cross-linking studies and hydrophobic residue clustering (Larivière2013Model).

In the context of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), MED9 interacts with the transcription factor GATA4, which is essential for cardiac development. GATA4 is involved in regulating alternative splicing, potentially influencing the expression of a novel MED9 isoform, MED9s, which is upregulated in DCM patients. This interaction suggests a role for MED9 in cardiac disease pathogenesis (Franzese2024Familial).
