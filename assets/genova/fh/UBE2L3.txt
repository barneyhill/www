# UBE2L3

## Overview
UBE2L3 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 L3, a critical component of the ubiquitination pathway, which is essential for protein regulation within cells. This enzyme is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. UBE2L3 primarily interacts with HECT and RBR E3 ligases, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, which is crucial for the formation of ubiquitin chains (Zhang2022Mechanism). The gene has been implicated in several autoimmune diseases and cancers, with polymorphisms in its locus associated with conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (Lewis2015UBE2L3). Additionally, UBE2L3 plays a role in the NF-kB signaling pathway and is involved in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses (Zhang2022Mechanism).

## Structure
UBE2L3, also known as UBCH7, is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process. The protein consists of 153 amino acid residues and features a highly conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Alpi2016Mechanism; Zhang2022Mechanism). The UBC domain is characterized by an α/β-fold, including an N-terminal helix (α1), a four-stranded β-meander, a short 3_10-helix, and two C-terminal helices (α3-α4) (Gundogdu2019Structural). 

The catalytic site of UBE2L3 contains a histidine residue (His119), which is crucial for its function, similar to an acidic residue found in other E2 enzymes (Alpi2016Mechanism; Zhang2022Mechanism). The enzyme's surface includes hot-spot residues such as Lys9, Phe63, Glu93, Lys96, and Lys100, which are important for interactions with HECT E3 ligases (Alpi2016Mechanism; Zhang2022Mechanism). 

UBE2L3 does not have N- or C-terminal extensions or acidic loops, which distinguishes it from other E2 enzymes (Whitcomb2018Stabilization). The protein's structure facilitates interactions with E1s, E3s, and activated ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins, although it primarily transfers ubiquitin to HECT E3 ligases due to its lack of inherent E3-independent lysine reactivity (Zhang2022Mechanism).

## Function
UBE2L3, also known as UBCH7, is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for protein regulation, including degradation, activity modulation, and cellular localization. UBE2L3 interacts primarily with HECT and RBR E3 ligases, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, which is essential for the formation of ubiquitin chains (Zhang2022Mechanism).

In the context of cell cycle regulation, UBE2L3 stabilizes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1 by forming ubiquitin conjugates that are resistant to proteasomal degradation. This stabilization delays the G1-to-S phase transition, highlighting its role in cell cycle control (Whitcomb2018Stabilization). UBE2L3 also participates in the NF-kB signaling pathway, which is critical for immune response and inflammation. It interacts with E3 ligases like LUBAC, promoting linear ubiquitin chain assembly, which is necessary for NF-kB activation (Zhang2022Mechanism).

UBE2L3 is also implicated in DNA repair mechanisms, particularly in the regulation of the protein 53BP1, influencing the choice between homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining for double-strand break repair (Zhang2022Mechanism). These functions underscore UBE2L3's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genome integrity.

## Clinical Significance
The UBE2L3 gene is clinically significant due to its association with various autoimmune diseases and certain cancers. Polymorphisms in the UBE2L3 locus have been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, psoriasis, diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The risk allele rs5754217 is notably associated with SLE and RA (Alpi2016Mechanism; Zhang2022Mechanism). Another SNP, rs140490, located in the promoter region of UBE2L3, is strongly associated with SLE and is linked to increased expression of UBE2L3 in B cells and monocytes, contributing to disease severity (Lewis2015UBE2L3).

UBE2L3 is also implicated in chronic hepatitis B virus infection and hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It plays an oncogenic role in HCC, with higher expression levels correlating with advanced tumor grade and poor survival in patients. UBE2L3 promotes proliferation and migration in HCC cell lines, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Tao2020Overexpression; Liu2018UBE2L3). These associations highlight the gene's role in immune regulation and its potential impact on disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
UBE2L3, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 L3, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in ubiquitination processes. It primarily interacts with HECT and RBR E3 ligases, forming productive E2-E3 pairs with the LUBAC complex, which is essential for linear ubiquitin chain assembly and NF-κB signaling (Alpi2016Mechanism; Zhang2022Mechanism). The LUBAC complex, composed of HOIP, HOIL-1L, and Sharpin, is vital for immune response signaling cascades (Alpi2016Mechanism).

UBE2L3 also interacts with Parkin, a protein involved in autophagy, specifically in the p62 signaling pathway, which is crucial for the autophagic clearance of depolarized mitochondria (Zhang2022Mechanism). It is involved in the ubiquitination of p53, interacting with the E6AP ubiquitin ligase (Zhang2022Mechanism).

In the context of inflammation, UBE2L3 interacts with HECT-type E3 ligases TRIP12 and AREL1 to ubiquitylate pro-IL-1β, reducing its stability and limiting IL-1β-driven inflammation (Mishra2023IL1β). These interactions are independent of inflammasomes and act post-transcriptionally to suppress inflammation (Mishra2023IL1β).
