# UVRAG

## Overview
UVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated gene) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy, DNA repair, and endocytic trafficking. The UVRAG protein is characterized by its coiled-coil and C2 domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins such as Beclin 1, playing a crucial role in autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking (Wu2018Targeting; Li2012Imperfect). It is also involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways, contributing to genomic stability and DNA repair (Yang2016Autophagic; Zhao2012A). Clinically, mutations in UVRAG have been implicated in cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, where they can disrupt normal cellular functions and promote tumorigenesis (Quach2019A; He2015Truncating). The protein's diverse roles in cellular homeostasis and disease underscore its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions.

## Structure
The UVRAG protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates its interaction with Beclin 1, a key player in autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking. The coiled-coil domain of UVRAG forms a stable heterodimer with Beclin 1, strengthened by hydrophobic interactions and electrostatically complementary pairings, including leucine zipper pairs and a salt bridge between Beclin 1 residue R203 and UVRAG residue E260 (Wu2018Targeting). This interaction is crucial for the function of UVRAG in promoting endolysosomal trafficking (Wu2018Targeting).

The UVRAG protein also contains a C2 domain, which is important for calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, although specific structural details of this domain are not provided in the context. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate UVRAG's activity, influencing its role in autophagic processes (Li2012Imperfect).

Mutations in the UVRAG coiled-coil domain, such as L246E, can significantly weaken its interaction with Beclin 1, highlighting the importance of specific residues in maintaining the stability of the heterodimeric complex (Wu2018Targeting). The UVRAG-Beclin 1 interaction is more hydrophobic compared to other interactions, such as with Atg14L, and persists even at high salt concentrations (Li2012Imperfect).

## Function
The UVRAG gene plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and facilitating DNA repair processes in human cells. It is involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, particularly in the global genomic NER (GG-NER) subpathway, where it aids in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. UVRAG interacts with the CRL4 DDB2 E3 ligase complex, promoting the recruitment of repair proteins like XPC to damaged DNA sites, which is essential for the repair of photolesions (Yang2016Autophagic). This interaction is independent of its role in autophagy, highlighting its distinct function in DNA repair (Yang2016Autophagic).

UVRAG also plays a significant role in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is crucial for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. It interacts with the DNA-PK complex, enhancing the efficiency of NHEJ repair and protecting cells from radiation-induced damage (Zhao2012A). Additionally, UVRAG is involved in maintaining centrosome stability, preventing centrosome amplification and ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Zhao2012A). These functions collectively underscore UVRAG's importance in preserving chromosomal integrity and preventing tumor progression.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the UVRAG gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. A frameshift mutation in UVRAG, known as UVRAG FS, is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) with microsatellite instability (MSI). This mutation results in a truncated protein that acts in a dominant-negative manner, disrupting normal UVRAG functions and promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis in CRC. The UVRAG FS mutation also leads to increased sensitivity to chemotherapy agents due to impaired DNA repair mechanisms, specifically affecting the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway (He2015Truncating).

In addition to CRC, UVRAG mutations are linked to increased inflammation and tumorigenesis in mice, with implications for conditions such as sepsis, intestinal colitis, and colitis-associated cancer. The mutation disrupts autophagy regulation, leading to hyperactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and increased inflammatory responses (Quach2019A).

High UVRAG expression in colorectal cancer is associated with tumor progression, immune suppression, and resistance to chemoradiotherapy. It correlates with poor overall survival, particularly in patients with right-sided colon cancer and those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (Shi2023UVRAG).

## Interactions
UVRAG interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in autophagy and endocytic trafficking. It forms a complex with Beclin 1, a key regulator of autophagy, through their coiled-coil domains. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the Beclin 1-PI3KC3 complex, which promotes autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking (Wu2018Targeting; Liang2006Autophagic). UVRAG competes with Atg14L for binding to Beclin 1, facilitating the transition of Beclin 1 into functionally active subcomplexes (Wu2018Targeting).

UVRAG also interacts with the class C vacuolar protein sorting (C-Vps) complex and endosomal SNAREs, including syntaxin 7, syntaxin 8, and Vti1b, to facilitate the assembly of a fusogenic trans-SNARE complex. This complex is essential for the homotypic fusion of late endosomes, which is critical for viral entry (Pirooz2014UVRAG).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, UVRAG interacts with the Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), particularly its N-terminal SH3 domain. This interaction is significant for the maturation of vesicles into autophagosomes, a process crucial for cellular homeostasis (Roy2014Interaction).

UVRAG's interaction with Bif-1 is also notable, as it enhances PI3KC3 lipid kinase activity and induces autophagosome formation, playing a role in both autophagy and tumorigenesis (Takahashi2007Bif1).
