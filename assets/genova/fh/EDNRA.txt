# EDNRA

## Overview
The EDNRA gene encodes the endothelin receptor type A, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor plays a pivotal role in mediating the physiological effects of endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor peptide, primarily within the cardiovascular system. EDNRA is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, where it regulates vascular tone and blood pressure by facilitating vasoconstriction. Beyond its cardiovascular functions, EDNRA is also involved in cellular proliferation, growth, and the development of neural crest-derived structures, impacting craniofacial and cardiac development. The receptor's activity is modulated through interactions with various proteins, including G proteins and β-arrestin, which influence its signaling pathways and clinical implications, such as its association with craniofacial syndromes and cardiovascular conditions (Pritchard2020Loss‐of‐function; Yasuno2011Common; Braasch2014Evolution).

## Structure
The endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane (7-TM) domains, which are typical of class A GPCRs. The primary structure of EDNRA consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, including an N-terminal extracellular domain, the 7-TM domains, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain with an eighth amphipathic helix, known as helix 8 (Pritchard2020Loss‐of‐function). The secondary structure includes these α-helical transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function as a receptor. 

The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the cell membrane, facilitating the binding of endothelin ligands to the receptor. Upon ligand binding, EDNRA undergoes conformational changes that enable G protein coupling and activation, which is essential for its role in signaling pathways (Braasch2014Evolution). 

Post-translational modifications of EDNRA may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence receptor function and signaling. The p.Q381P variant, a glutamine to proline substitution in helix 8, has been shown to impair G protein activation without affecting ligand binding, indicating its role in receptor signaling rather than ligand interaction (Pritchard2020Loss‐of‐function).

## Function
The EDNRA gene encodes the endothelin receptor type A, a G protein-coupled receptor primarily involved in mediating the effects of endothelin-1 (EDN1), a potent vasoconstrictor peptide. In healthy human cells, EDNRA is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, where it plays a critical role in regulating vascular tone and blood pressure by mediating vasoconstriction (Yasuno2011Common). This receptor is also involved in cellular proliferation and growth, contributing to the maintenance of vascular homeostasis and integrity (Dagamajalu2020A).

Upon binding with endothelin ligands, EDNRA activates intracellular signaling cascades that lead to various cellular responses, including muscle contraction and cell growth (Braasch2014Evolution). The receptor's signaling is crucial for maintaining the balance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation, which is essential for responding to hemodynamic stress and supporting vascular repair (Yasuno2011Common). EDNRA's activity is not limited to the cardiovascular system; it also plays a role in the development of neural crest-derived structures, influencing craniofacial and cardiac development (Braasch2014Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EDNRA gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Pathogenic variants in the EDNRA signaling pathway, including EDNRA itself, are linked to craniofacial syndromes such as Mandibulofacial Dysostosis with Alopecia (MFDA) and Auriculocondylar syndrome (ARCND) types 1, 2, and 3. These conditions are characterized by craniofacial malformations, although individuals with these syndromes do not typically exhibit cardiovascular defects, suggesting some residual EDNRA signaling (Pritchard2020Loss‐of‐function). A novel homozygous missense variant in EDNRA has been identified, leading to Oro-Oto-Cardiac Syndrome, which includes both craniofacial and cardiovascular malformations. This variant disrupts the recruitment of G proteins to the receptor, impairing receptor activation by its ligand, Endothelin-1 (Pritchard2020Loss‐of‐function).

In addition, the EDNRA gene is implicated in the risk of large artery atherosclerotic (LAA) stroke. The rs1878406 polymorphism in EDNRA is associated with an increased risk of LAA stroke, particularly in individuals aged 60 years or younger and in males. This polymorphism may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis (Wei2022EDNRA). Furthermore, EDNRA has been identified as a key biomarker for hypercholesterolemia and colorectal cancer, with alterations in its expression potentially linked to these conditions (Han2024Identification).

## Interactions
EDNRA, or endothelin receptor type A, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular signaling. It primarily interacts with endothelin-1 (EDN1), which binds to EDNRA and activates downstream signaling pathways, including those involving G proteins such as Gαq, Gαi, and Gα12. These interactions are crucial for EDNRA's role in cellular proliferation and migration (Pritchard2020Loss‐of‐function; Lee2022The).

EDNRA also interacts with β-arrestin, a protein that can mediate receptor desensitization and internalization. This interaction is significant in the context of colorectal cancer, where the EDN1/EDNRA/β-arrestin axis promotes cancer progression by regulating STAT3 phosphorylation. β-arrestin is involved in the modulation of STAT3 signaling, which is crucial for cancer cell growth and survival (Lee2022The).

In addition to its interactions with proteins, EDNRA is involved in transcriptional regulation. STAT3, a transcription factor, binds to the promoter regions of EDNRA, influencing its expression. This interaction forms part of a positive feedback loop that enhances EDNRA signaling in cancer progression (Lee2022The).
