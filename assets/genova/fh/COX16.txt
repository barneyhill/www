# COX16

## Overview
The COX16 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor COX16, a crucial protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV, within the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein is categorized as an inner mitochondrial membrane protein and plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of the COX2 subunit by facilitating the formation of the CuA site, essential for the proper function of cytochrome c oxidase. COX16 interacts with newly synthesized COX2 and its associated metallochaperones, such as SCO1, SCO2, and COA6, to ensure the correct assembly and metallation of COX subunits. The absence of COX16 results in reduced levels of COX2 and other subunits, leading to decreased complex IV activity and impaired mitochondrial function, which can manifest in severe clinical conditions (Aich2018COX16).

## Function
The COX16 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as complex IV, in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein is involved in the biogenesis of the COX2 subunit, specifically facilitating the formation of the CuA site, which is crucial for the proper function of cytochrome c oxidase. COX16 interacts with newly synthesized COX2 and its associated metallochaperones, such as SCO1, SCO2, and COA6, to aid in the recruitment of SCO1 to the COX2 module, a critical step for copper insertion necessary for COX2 maturation (Aich2018COX16).

COX16 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein with its C-terminus facing the intermembrane space, where it transiently interacts with COX1 assembly intermediates, facilitating the merging of COX1 and COX2 assembly lines (Aich2018COX16). In human cells, the absence of COX16 leads to a reduction in the levels of COX2 and other subunits, resulting in decreased complex IV activity and growth retardation, highlighting its essential role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Aich2018COX16).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COX16 gene are associated with severe mitochondrial disorders, primarily due to its role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. A novel homozygous nonsense variant in COX16, specifically c.244C>T (p.Arg82*), has been identified as causing cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. This deficiency leads to severe clinical manifestations, including fatal neonatal lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, and liver dysfunction. The absence of COX16 protein expression results in a complete loss of complex IV activity, as observed in patient fibroblasts (Wintjes2020A).

The pathogenicity of COX16 mutations is further supported by studies showing that functional complementation with wild-type COX16 can rescue complex IV activity in patient cells, indicating the critical role of COX16 in maintaining mitochondrial function (CaronGodon2024More). Additionally, COX16 is involved in copper delivery to the COX2 subunit, and its dysfunction can lead to impaired assembly of cytochrome c oxidase, contributing to the observed clinical symptoms (Cerqua2018COX16). These findings underscore the importance of COX16 in mitochondrial health and its potential link to mitochondrial diseases.

## Interactions
COX16 is involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV) and participates in several protein-protein interactions crucial for this process. It interacts with newly synthesized COX2 and its copper center-forming metallochaperones, including SCO1, SCO2, and COA6, facilitating the formation of the CuA site on COX2 (Aich2018COX16). COX16 is required for the recruitment of SCO1 to the COX2 module, which is essential for proper COX2 assembly (Aich2018COX16). In the absence of COX16, there is a reduction in COX2's ability to associate with SCO1 and COA6, although SCO2 association remains unaffected (Aich2018COX16).

COX16 also interacts with the MITRAC complex, particularly with MITRAC12, during the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. It facilitates the integration of COX2 into MITRAC-COX1 modules, indicating its role in merging the COX1 and COX2 assembly lines (Aich2018COX16). COX16 is part of a complex with COX11, SCO1, SCO2, and COX2, as these proteins co-immunoprecipitate in wild-type mitochondria (Nývltová2022Coordination). These interactions highlight COX16's critical role in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase by coordinating the assembly and metallation of its subunits.
