# TREM1

## Overview
TREM1 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 1) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein predominantly expressed on myeloid cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes. The TREM1 protein plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system by amplifying inflammatory responses. It achieves this by enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby facilitating the recruitment and activation of immune cells to sites of infection or tissue damage (Tessarz2008The; Bouchon2000Cutting). TREM1 interacts with the DAP12 adapter protein, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), to initiate downstream signaling pathways that lead to inflammation (Bouchon2000Cutting). Beyond its role in microbial infections, TREM1 is also involved in sterile inflammatory processes, such as those observed in chronic liver injury and gout, highlighting its broader significance in inflammatory diseases (Colonna2023The). The gene's expression and the receptor's activity are of clinical interest due to their implications in various inflammatory and infectious diseases, making TREM1 a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Schenk2007TREM1–expressing; Aldasoro2017TREM1).

## Structure


## Function
TREM1 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 1) is a receptor protein primarily expressed on neutrophils and monocytes, playing a significant role in the innate immune response. In healthy human cells, TREM1 functions as an amplifier of inflammatory signals, enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-α and IL-8. This amplification is crucial for the body's defense against infections, as it promotes the activation and recruitment of immune cells to sites of infection or tissue damage (Tessarz2008The; Bouchon2000Cutting).

TREM1 is associated with the DAP12 adapter protein, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). Upon activation, TREM1 leads to the phosphorylation of several proteins, including DAP12, PLCγ, and ERK1/2, resulting in increased intracellular calcium levels and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators (Tessarz2008The; Bouchon2000Cutting). TREM1 also synergizes with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors to enhance inflammatory responses, while reducing anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 (Tessarz2008The; Colonna2023The).

In addition to its role in microbial infections, TREM1 is involved in sterile inflammatory processes, such as those seen in gout and chronic liver injury, where it potentiates inflammation (Colonna2023The). The receptor's activity is primarily localized to the cell surface of myeloid cells, where it modulates immune responses and contributes to the regulation of inflammation (Colonna2023The).

## Clinical Significance
The TREM1 gene is clinically significant due to its role in various inflammatory and infectious diseases. Alterations in TREM1 expression are linked to the amplification of inflammatory responses, contributing to the pathogenesis of conditions such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Schenk2007TREM1–expressing; Aldasoro2017TREM1). In IBD, TREM1 expression is significantly upregulated in intestinal macrophages, correlating with disease severity. Blocking TREM1 has been shown to reduce inflammation in experimental models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Schenk2007TREM1–expressing).

The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2234246 in the TREM1 gene is associated with increased levels of soluble TREM1 (sTREM1) protein, which correlates with the severity of inflammatory diseases such as acute myocardial infarction and critical limb ischemia. The presence of the T allele is considered a risk factor, while the C allele may be protective (Aldasoro2017TREM1).

In infectious diseases, TREM1 is implicated in exacerbating inflammation during viral infections like influenza and West Nile virus, as well as in parasitic infections such as malaria, where its expression correlates with disease severity (de2020The). TREM1's role in these conditions highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TREM1 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in inflammatory signaling pathways. One of the primary interactions of TREM1 is with the adaptor protein DAP12, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This interaction is crucial for signal transduction, as DAP12 becomes phosphorylated upon TREM1 activation, leading to the recruitment of protein tyrosine kinases and initiating downstream signaling cascades (Bouchon2000Cutting).

TREM1 also interacts with spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a key player in the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunolabeling techniques, indicating a direct physical association between TREM1 and SYK. The engagement of TREM1 leads to the recruitment and activation of SYK, which subsequently activates downstream signaling molecules involved in inflammation, such as CARD9/NF-κB and NLRP3/caspase-1 pathways (Wu2021TREM1; Xu2019Microglial).

In the context of central nervous system diseases, TREM1 is also known to interact with various ligands, including high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP), which are associated with inflammatory responses (Zhang2022The). These interactions highlight TREM1's role in amplifying immune responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases.
