# NONO

## Overview
The NONO gene encodes a multifunctional nuclear protein that is a member of the Drosophila behavior/human splicing (DBHS) protein family. This protein, known as non-POU domain containing octamer binding, plays a critical role in various nuclear processes, including transcription regulation, RNA processing, and DNA repair. NONO is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, facilitated by tandem RNA recognition motifs and a NonA/paraspeckle domain, which are essential for its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids (Passon2012Structure; Duvignaud2016Structure). The protein is involved in the regulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways, influencing glucocorticoid production and steroidogenesis (Lu2015p54nrbNONO). Additionally, NONO is a key component of paraspeckles, subnuclear structures that modulate gene expression under stress conditions, and it contributes to the DNA damage response by promoting repair processes (Passon2012Structure; Knott2016The). Mutations in the NONO gene are associated with a syndromic form of intellectual developmental disorder, highlighting its significance in brain and heart development (Sewani2019Further; Giuffrida20223′UTR).

## Structure
The NONO protein, encoded by the human NONO gene, is a multifunctional nuclear RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes. It is a member of the Drosophila behavior/human splicing (DBHS) family, which includes proteins like PSPC1 and SFPQ. The primary structure of NONO includes tandem RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a NonA/paraspeckle domain (NOPS), which are crucial for its function in RNA binding and protein interactions (Passon2012Structure; Duvignaud2016Structure).

The secondary structure of NONO features a canonical fold in the RRM1 domain, characterized by a β1α1β2β3α2β4 arrangement, which is typical for RNA-binding proteins (Duvignaud2016Structure). The RRM2 domain is noncanonical, suggesting unique RNA-binding properties (Passon2012Structure).

In terms of tertiary structure, the NONO protein forms a stable homodimer or heterodimer with SFPQ, facilitated by interactions within the NOPS domain and coiled-coil regions. These interactions are essential for its localization to paraspeckles and its role in gene regulation (Passon2012Structure; Laurenzi2022Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at threonine residue Thr15, can affect NONO's RNA binding ability, highlighting the dynamic regulation of its function (Duvignaud2016Structure).

## Function
The NONO gene encodes a multifunctional nuclear protein that is part of the Drosophila behavior/human splicing (DBHS) family. This protein is involved in various nuclear processes, including transcription regulation, RNA processing, and DNA repair. NONO plays a critical role in the regulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways, which are essential for glucocorticoid production in the adrenal cortex. It regulates the transcription of the CYP17A1 gene and influences the splicing and degradation of phosphodiesterase mRNA transcripts, thereby modulating intracellular cAMP levels and steroidogenesis (Lu2015p54nrbNONO).

NONO is also a component of the CREB-TORC complex, essential for cAMP signaling. It facilitates the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to cAMP-responsive promoters, acting as a bridge between the CREB-TORC complex and the transcriptional machinery (Amelio2007A). In the context of the circadian clock, NONO interacts with PERIOD proteins to regulate the expression of the p16-Ink4A cell cycle checkpoint gene, influencing cell cycle progression and cellular senescence (Maier2013A; Kowalska2012NONO).

Additionally, NONO is involved in the formation of paraspeckles, subnuclear structures that regulate gene expression under stress conditions, and plays a role in the DNA damage response by promoting repair processes (Passon2012Structure; Knott2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NONO gene, located on chromosome Xq13.1, are associated with a syndromic form of intellectual developmental disorder known as mental retardation, X-linked, syndromic 34 (MRXS34). This condition primarily affects males and is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic facial features. Structural brain malformations, such as abnormalities of the corpus callosum and cerebellum, are common, along with congenital heart defects like left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) and Ebstein's anomaly (Sewani2019Further; Giuffrida20223′UTR; Itai2023A).

NONO mutations can also lead to a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including hypotonia and macrocephaly. Dysmorphic features such as an elongated face, slanted palpebral fissures, and frontal bossing are frequently observed (Sewani2019Further). In some cases, cardiac phenotypes like ventricular tachycardia and dilated cardiomyopathy have been reported (Itai2023A).

Alterations in NONO expression are linked to significant developmental disorders, emphasizing the gene's crucial role in heart and brain development. The gene's mutations can result in a recognizable pattern of developmental and neurological abnormalities, as well as potential cardiac issues (Giuffrida20223′UTR; Sewani2019Further).

## Interactions
The NONO protein, a member of the DBHS protein family, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing numerous cellular processes. NONO forms heterodimers with other DBHS proteins such as SFPQ and PSPC1, which is crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing (Knott2016The; Passon2012Structure). It interacts with the CREB/TORC complex to activate transcription at certain cAMP-responsive promoters by recruiting RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (Knott2016The). Conversely, NONO can repress transcription at other cAMP-responsive promoters through interaction with RASD1 (Knott2016The).

NONO is also involved in post-transcriptional regulation by interacting with long noncoding RNA lncUSMycN and N-Myc mRNA, leading to the upregulation of the N-Myc oncoprotein, which is significant in neuroblastoma progression (Knott2016The). It participates in spliceosome formation by interacting with U5 snRNA and the 5' splice site, and it is involved in pre-mRNA 3'-end processing (Knott2016The). NONO also plays a role in DNA repair by forming part of the DSB preligation complex with the Ku protein and substrate DNA (Knott2016The). These interactions underscore NONO's multifaceted role in cellular regulation.
