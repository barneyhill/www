# CHCHD2

## Overview
CHCHD2, or coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. The CHCHD2 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain, which plays a critical role in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it regulates oxidative stress response, electron transport, and mitochondrial morphology (Cornelissen2020CHCHD2; Liu2014CHCHD2). As a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein, CHCHD2 is integral to mitochondrial dynamics, interacting with various mitochondrial proteins to regulate apoptosis and mitochondrial respiration (Meng2017Loss; Ikeda2022Neurodegenerationassociated). Mutations in the CHCHD2 gene have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Ikeda2019Mutations; Kee2021Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The CHCHD2 protein is characterized by a coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain, which includes a twin CX9C motif containing four cysteine residues that form two disulfide bonds, crucial for its stability and function within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Cornelissen2020CHCHD2; Liu2014CHCHD2). The primary structure of CHCHD2 consists of 151 amino acids, with a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N-terminus and the CHCH domain at the C-terminus (Liu2014CHCHD2). The secondary structure features alpha helices, particularly in the central region of the protein, which includes a predicted α-helix N-terminal to the CX9C domain (Huang2018CHCHD2).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices, stabilized by disulfide bonds formed by the cysteine residues in the CHCH domain (Cornelissen2020CHCHD2). The quaternary structure of CHCHD2 includes its ability to form homodimers and heterodimers with CHCHD10, which is important for its function in mitochondrial maintenance and response to stress (Huang2018CHCHD2; Imai2019Twin). CHCHD2 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and localization (Kee2021Mitochondrial). The protein is also known to interact with other mitochondrial proteins, such as cytochrome c, to regulate apoptosis and mitochondrial respiration (Meng2017Loss; Ikeda2022Neurodegenerationassociated).

## Function
CHCHD2 is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. It is primarily active in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), where it regulates several key processes, including oxidative stress response, electron transport, and mitochondrial morphology (Kee2021Mitochondrial). CHCHD2 is involved in promoting cell migration and differentiation by interacting with pathways such as Akt, RhoA/ROCK, and Jnk, and by sequestering SMAD4 within mitochondria to suppress TGFβ nuclear signaling (Kee2021Mitochondrial).

In the IMS, CHCHD2 regulates electron transport between respiratory complexes by binding to cytochrome c oxidase (COX), cytochrome c, and MICS1, enhancing respiratory activity through phosphorylation at Y99 (Kee2021Mitochondrial). It also maintains mitochondrial cristae structure by interacting with OPA1 and MICS1, preventing OPA1 degradation and promoting normal mitochondrial morphology (Liu2020Chchd2; Kee2021Mitochondrial). CHCHD2 acts as an anti-apoptotic protein by binding to Bcl-xL, suppressing pro-apoptotic Bax oligomerization, and preventing cytochrome c release and apoptosis (Kee2021Mitochondrial).

Under stress conditions, such as hypoxia, CHCHD2 import into mitochondria is inhibited, leading to its accumulation in the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor for cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 2 (COX4I2) and itself, inducing the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis (Kee2021Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHCHD2 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD). These mutations can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a key pathological feature of PD. Specific mutations such as T61I and R145Q have been linked to autosomal dominant forms of late-onset PD, particularly in Asian populations (Ikeda2019Mutations; Kee2021Mitochondrial). The T61I mutation is associated with widespread α-synuclein pathology, including Lewy bodies, which are characteristic of PD (Ikeda2019Mutations).

CHCHD2 mutations are also implicated in other Lewy body disorders, such as Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) (Kee2021Mitochondrial). Additionally, CHCHD2 has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), with certain mutations like Q126X and R145Q contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced oxygen consumption (Liu2018Identification; Zhou2018PDlinked).

The gene's role in maintaining mitochondrial cristae structure and respiratory complex integrity is crucial, and its dysfunction can exacerbate oxidative stress and cell death signaling, contributing to the pathology of these neurodegenerative conditions (Meng2017Loss; Zhou2019Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
CHCHD2 is involved in several critical interactions within the mitochondria, playing a significant role in mitochondrial dynamics and stress responses. It forms heterodimers with CHCHD10, a process essential for the oligomerization of CHCHD10, which requires CHCHD2 for this function. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Frontotemporal Dementia (Huang2018CHCHD2).

CHCHD2 also interacts with the mitochondrial protease OMA1, suppressing its activity to regulate the integrated stress response (ISR) and mitochondrial dynamics. Under stress conditions, CHCHD2 translocates to the cytosol and interacts with eIF2α, attenuating ISR overactivation by suppressing eIF2α phosphorylation (Ruan2022CHCHD2).

In the context of apoptosis, CHCHD2 interacts with Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein, to inhibit Bax activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, thereby preventing apoptosis. This interaction is crucial for regulating the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (Liu2014CHCHD2).

CHCHD2's interactions extend to the MICOS complex, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial cristae structure. Mutations in CHCHD2 linked to Parkinson's Disease impair its interaction with CHCHD10, affecting the integrity of the MICOS complex and mitochondrial function (Zhou2018PDlinked).
