# FMO3

## Overview
The FMO3 gene encodes the enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase 3, a crucial component of the flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) family, which is primarily involved in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. This enzyme is categorized as a monooxygenase and is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it plays a significant role in the detoxification process by converting lipophilic compounds into more water-soluble metabolites. The FMO3 enzyme is responsible for the N-oxygenation of nucleophilic heteroatom-containing compounds, including those with nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, or selenium atoms, thereby facilitating their excretion from the body (Xu2017Genetic; Cashman2002Interindividual). Genetic variations in the FMO3 gene can lead to altered enzyme activity, which has been associated with various clinical conditions, including trimethylaminuria and cardiovascular diseases (Tang2015Gut; RobinsonCohen2016Association). The enzyme's activity is largely determined by genetic factors, as it is not typically inducible by environmental influences (Cashman2002Interindividual).

## Structure
The FMO3 protein, encoded by the FMO3 gene, is a flavin-containing monooxygenase involved in the oxidative metabolism of various xenobiotics and drugs. The primary structure of FMO3 consists of a sequence of 532 amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 58 kDa (ChhibberGoel2017Structure–Function). The protein includes two main structural domains: a smaller NADPH-binding domain and a larger FAD-binding domain, connected by a linker (ChhibberGoel2017Structure–Function). 

The tertiary structure of FMO3 has been modeled using various computational tools due to the lack of a complete 3D structure in the Protein Data Bank. These models reveal that the FAD-binding domain contains a Rossmann fold, which is crucial for FAD binding and enzymatic activity (Koukouritaki2005Discovery). The enzyme's structure also includes conserved motifs such as the FAD-binding (GXGXXG), NADP-binding (GXSXXA), and the FMO-identifying motif (FXGXXXHXXX(Y/F)), which are essential for its function (ChhibberGoel2017Structure–Function).

Mutations in FMO3 can lead to structural changes that affect its enzymatic function, as seen in various studies that have mapped these mutations onto the protein's model (ChhibberGoel2017Structure–Function). The enzyme's quaternary structure and potential post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, have not been fully elucidated in the available literature.

## Function
The FMO3 gene encodes the flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds in the human liver. FMO3 is primarily responsible for the N-oxygenation of nucleophilic heteroatom-containing compounds, including those with nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, or selenium atoms (Xu2017Genetic; Cashman2002Interindividual). This enzymatic activity aids in the detoxification process by converting potentially harmful compounds into more water-soluble metabolites that can be easily excreted (Cashman2002Interindividual).

FMO3 is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it is one of the most abundant forms of the FMO enzyme family, comparable in content to cytochrome P450 enzymes (Xu2017Genetic; Phillips2019Flavincontaining). The enzyme's activity is not generally inducible by environmental factors, suggesting that interindividual variation in FMO3 activity is primarily due to genetic differences (Cashman2002Interindividual). FMO3's role in metabolizing various pharmaceuticals and endogenous substances, such as catecholamines and trimethylamine, highlights its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of toxic substances (Xu2017Genetic; Cashman2002Interindividual).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FMO3 gene can lead to trimethylaminuria, a condition characterized by a fish-like body odor due to the accumulation of trimethylamine, as the enzyme is unable to convert it to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) (RobinsonCohen2016Association). Alterations in FMO3 expression have been linked to various health conditions, particularly in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Variants in the FMO3 gene, specifically at amino acid position 158, are associated with higher TMAO levels, which have been linked to increased mortality risk in CKD patients (Tang2015Gut; RobinsonCohen2016Association). Elevated TMAO levels, influenced by FMO3 activity, are also associated with renal dysfunction and fibrosis, suggesting a role in CKD progression (Tang2015Gut).

FMO3 is also implicated in cholesterol metabolism. Its knockdown in mice affects cholesterol balance, reducing intestinal absorption and altering plasma cholesterol distribution, which may impact conditions related to cholesterol imbalance and liver inflammation (Warrier2015The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FMO3 in managing diseases related to cholesterol and TMAO metabolism.

## Interactions
The human flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) gene is regulated by interactions with various transcription factors. Notably, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) plays a significant role in modulating FMO3 expression. C/EBPβ binds to a regulatory element within the FMO3 promoter, and mutations in this element lead to a marked reduction in promoter activity, highlighting the importance of this interaction for gene expression (Klick2008Differential). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have confirmed the binding of C/EBPβ to the FMO3 domain I element in liver tissue, indicating a direct interaction (Klick2008Differential).

The study also identified a putative HNF3b recognition site and two overlapping C/EBP recognition sites within the FMO3 domain I. HNF3b and C/EBP family members, particularly C/EBPb, bind to these sites, suggesting complex regulatory interactions at this site (Klick2008Differential). While HNF3b had minimal impact on FMO3 promoter activity, C/EBPβ significantly increased promoter activity, acting as a major regulatory factor (Klick2008Differential). These interactions suggest that FMO3 regulation involves a network of transcription factors that modulate its expression in response to various physiological conditions.
