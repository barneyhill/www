# PAGR1

## Overview
PAGR1, or PAXIP1 associated glutamate rich protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. The protein encoded by PAGR1 is a component of the MLL3/MLL4 complex, which plays a significant role in histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, an epigenetic modification crucial for gene expression regulation (Liu2022PTIPAssociated). As a transcriptional co-regulator, PAGR1 is integral to adipogenesis, influencing the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors and contributing to adipose tissue development (Lee2020MLL3MLL4Associated). Additionally, PAGR1 is involved in embryonic development, with its deficiency leading to severe developmental defects (Kumar2014Loss). The protein also participates in DNA damage repair and tumor suppression, highlighting its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Ashkin2024A).

## Function
PAGR1 (PAXIP1 associated glutamate rich protein 1) is a crucial component in various molecular processes, particularly in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. It is part of the MLL3/MLL4 complex, which is involved in histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, a key epigenetic modification that influences gene expression (Liu2022PTIPAssociated). PAGR1 plays a significant role in adipogenesis by controlling the induction of early adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, which are essential for the expression of master adipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα (Lee2020MLL3MLL4Associated). This function is critical for the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes, contributing to adipose tissue development (Lee2020MLL3MLL4Associated).

PAGR1 also interacts with phosphorylated CREB and glucocorticoid receptors to regulate gene expression during the early phase of adipogenesis (Lee2020MLL3MLL4Associated). In addition to its role in adipogenesis, PAGR1 is involved in embryonic development, with its absence leading to defects in extraembryonic tissues and embryonic lethality in mice (Kumar2014Loss). PAGR1's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Interactions
PAGR1 (PAXIP1 associated glutamate rich protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. It is a component of the MLL3/MLL4 complex, which is essential for epigenetic gene regulation. PAGR1 interacts with phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to regulate the expression of early adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. This interaction is critical for adipogenesis, as PAGR1 is recruited to the promoters of these genes, facilitating their expression (Lee2020MLL3MLL4Associated).

PAGR1 also forms a separate complex with PTIP, independent of the MLL3/MLL4 complex, which is involved in DNA damage repair (Kumar2014Loss). In the context of lung tumorigenesis, PAGR1 interacts with PAXIP1, forming a heterodimer that is implicated in tumor suppression. This complex is involved in DNA damage repair, cell cycle control, and transcription regulation, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Ashkin2024A).

These interactions underscore PAGR1's role as a transcriptional co-regulator and its involvement in various cellular pathways, including adipogenesis and tumor suppression.
