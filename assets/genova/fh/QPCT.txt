# QPCT

## Overview
The QPCT gene encodes the enzyme glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase, a zinc-dependent enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of proteins. This enzyme is responsible for converting N-terminal glutaminyl and glutamyl residues into pyroglutamate, a modification crucial for the stability and function of various bioactive peptides and proteins (Liu2023Functions; Xu2021Glutaminyl). Glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase is categorized as a cyclotransferase and is predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues, where it contributes to the maturation of hormones such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Fischer1987Identification; Huang2011Structures). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and biological activity of these molecules, underscoring its significance in physiological processes and potential implications in disease states (Booth2004Human; Xu2021Glutaminyl).

## Structure
The QPCT gene encodes the enzyme glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase, which is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins by converting N-terminal glutaminyl and glutamyl residues into pyroglutamate. The enzyme is characterized by a conserved catalytic domain of approximately 330 residues, featuring a mixed α/β architecture with a central six-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices, forming a hydrophobic core (Huang2005Crystal; Xu2021Glutaminyl). The active site of QPCT contains a single zinc ion coordinated by key residues such as Asp159, Glu202, and His330, along with a water molecule, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Vijayan2019Human; Huang2005Crystal).

QPCT exists in different isoforms, including the secretory QC (sQC) and Golgi-resident QC (gQC), which are encoded by the QPCT and QPCTL genes, respectively. These isoforms share high structural similarity but differ in their N-terminal signaling sequences, which dictate their cellular localization (Vijayan2019Human). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation contribute to the stability of the enzyme, although they do not significantly affect its catalytic activity (Vijayan2019Human).

## Function
The QPCT gene encodes the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC), which plays a crucial role in the posttranslational modification of proteins by catalyzing the conversion of N-terminal glutamine and glutamic acid residues into pyroglutamate residues (pGlu) (Liu2023Functions). This modification, known as pyroglutamylation, is essential for the maturation and stability of bioactive peptides, hormones, and proteins, protecting them from degradation and enhancing their receptor-binding capabilities (Huang2011Structures; Xu2021Glutaminyl). QC is particularly important in the maturation of hormones such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which require this modification for biological activity (Fischer1987Identification).

The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, with higher expression in neuronal tissues, including the pituitary, hypothalamus, and hippocampus, as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes (Huang2011Structures; Liu2023Functions). QC is a zinc-dependent enzyme localized in the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and secretory granules, where it contributes to protein maturation (Xu2021Glutaminyl). The presence of QC in these cellular compartments underscores its role in the secretory pathway, facilitating the proper conformation and function of peptides and proteins (Booth2004Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the QPCT gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably Huntington's disease (HD) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In Huntington's disease, QPCT is involved in modulating the aggregation of mutant huntingtin (HTT) protein, a key pathological feature of the disease. Knockdown of QPCT has been shown to reduce HTT aggregation and toxicity in various models, including mammalian cells, Drosophila, and zebrafish. This reduction is associated with increased levels of alpha B-crystallin, a molecular chaperone that suppresses polyglutamine toxicity, suggesting a protective role against HD (JimenezSanchez2015siRNA).

In renal cell carcinoma, QPCT overexpression is linked to resistance to the cancer drug sunitinib. This resistance is mediated through the stabilization of HRAS, a protein that promotes ERK pathway activation, contributing to drug resistance. High QPCT levels in tumor tissues correlate with poor responses to sunitinib therapy, indicating that QPCT expression could serve as a predictor of treatment response. Targeting the QPCT-HRAS interaction and the ERK pathway has been suggested as a potential strategy to overcome sunitinib resistance in RCC (Zhao2019DNA).

## Interactions
QPCT (glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with HRAS, a protein involved in cell signaling pathways. QPCT stabilizes HRAS by reducing its ubiquitination and degradation, which leads to increased HRAS expression. This interaction is crucial in promoting sunitinib resistance in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) by activating the ERK signaling pathway (Zhao2019DNA).

QPCT also interacts with PIK3CA, a key component of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction enhances the stability of PIK3CA by reducing its ubiquitination, thereby promoting angiogenesis and contributing to sunitinib resistance in RCC (Zhao2021QPCT). The binding of QPCT to PIK3CA was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining (Zhao2021QPCT).

Additionally, QPCT is involved in the regulation of its own expression through interactions with transcription factors. NF-κB (p65) binds to the QPCT promoter region, a process enhanced by hypomethylation, leading to increased QPCT expression. This regulatory mechanism is associated with sunitinib resistance in RCC (Zhao2019DNA). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of QPCT in cellular signaling and drug resistance.
