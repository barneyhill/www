# HOGA1

## Overview
The HOGA1 gene encodes the enzyme 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase 1, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the hydroxyproline degradation pathway. This enzyme is crucial for the metabolism of hydroxyproline, catalyzing the cleavage of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate into pyruvate and glyoxylate, thereby maintaining balanced levels of glyoxylate and oxalate in the body (Riedel20124Hydroxy2oxoglutarate; Riedel2011Structural). Disruptions in this process can lead to primary hyperoxaluria type III (PH3), a condition characterized by excessive oxalate production and kidney stone formation (Riedel2011Structural; Hoppe2012The). The HOGA1 protein is structurally similar to bacterial aldolases and functions as a tetramer, with each subunit containing an (α/β)8 TIM barrel domain (Riedel2011Structural; Oppici2017Folding). Mutations in the HOGA1 gene can lead to a deficiency in this enzyme, resulting in the clinical manifestations of PH3 (Abid2021Possible; MartinHigueras2021A).

## Structure
The HOGA1 protein, associated with Primary Hyperoxaluria Type III (PH3), has a tetrameric assembly with a molecular weight of 144 kDa, structured as a dimer of dimers, each 72 kDa in size (Riedel2011Structural; Oppici2017Folding). Each subunit of HOGA1 consists of an (α/β)8 TIM barrel domain spanning residues 26-259 and a three-helical bundle at the C-terminus from residues 260-327 (Riedel2011Structural; Oppici2017Folding). The N-terminal 25 residues form a mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is cleaved upon import into mitochondria (Oppici2017Folding).

The active site is located at the C-terminal end of the TIM barrel domain, near the monomer-monomer interface, and involves key residues such as Lys196, Tyr168, Ser77, and Asn78 (Riedel2011Structural; Oppici2017Folding). The dimer-dimer interface is stabilized by interactions between the helical bundles, while the monomer-monomer interface is formed by surface loop regions (Oppici2017Folding). The protein's structure is similar to bacterial aldolases, sharing a 31.1% sequence identity with dihydrodipicolinate synthase from Bacillus anthracis (Riedel2011Structural; Oppici2017Folding).

## Function
The HOGA1 gene encodes the enzyme 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase 1 (hHOGA), which plays a crucial role in the hydroxyproline degradation pathway. This enzyme is active in the mitochondria, where it catalyzes the cleavage of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate (HOG) into pyruvate and glyoxylate (Riedel20124Hydroxy2oxoglutarate; Riedel2011Structural). This process is essential for maintaining balanced levels of glyoxylate and oxalate in the body, as disruptions can lead to excessive oxalate production, contributing to conditions such as primary hyperoxaluria type 3 (PH3) (Riedel2011Structural; Hoppe2012The).

In healthy human cells, hHOGA is involved in the metabolism of hydroxyproline, an amino acid derivative, and its activity is crucial for preventing the accumulation of glyoxylate and oxalate, which can lead to kidney stones (Riedel20124Hydroxy2oxoglutarate; Riedel2011Structural). The enzyme's function is supported by its structural similarity to bacterial dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) enzymes, sharing conserved residues involved in catalysis and substrate specificity (Riedel2011Structural). hHOGA's activity is not stereospecific for the R or S forms of HOG, and it may exist in various oligomeric states, such as dimers and tetramers, in solution (Riedel2011Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HOGA1 gene are associated with primary hyperoxaluria type III (PH3), a rare genetic disorder characterized by excessive oxalate production, leading to recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis. PH3 is generally less severe than primary hyperoxaluria types I and II, with many patients maintaining preserved renal function, although some cases can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Abid2021Possible; Fang2019Nine). The condition is caused by pathogenic sequence variants in the HOGA1 gene, which result in a deficiency of the enzyme 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase, disrupting glyoxylate metabolism and causing oxalate accumulation (MartinHigueras2021A; Hoppe2012The).

The most common mutations include c.700+5G>T and c.944_946delAGG (p.Glu315del), which account for a significant proportion of variant alleles in affected populations (Abid2021Possible; Monico2011Primary). These mutations are associated with a loss-of-function mechanism, leading to increased oxalate production (Hoppe2012The). Some heterozygous carriers of HOGA1 mutations may also experience idiopathic calcium oxalate stone disease, suggesting a potential predisposition to calcium-oxalate urolithiasis (Monico2011Primary). The prevalence of PH3 is estimated to be 1 to 3 per million, with a carrier frequency of 1:185, indicating that some individuals may remain undiagnosed or asymptomatic (Abid2021Possible).

## Interactions
HOGA1, or 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase 1, is known to interact with La family RNA-binding proteins (LARPs), including LARP1, LARP4, LARP4B, and LARP7. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating a physical association between HOGA1 and these proteins. The interaction with LARP7 is particularly significant as it affects LARP7 protein levels through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Overexpression of HOGA1 increases LARP7 ubiquitination, while knocking down HOGA1 decreases it. This interaction plays a role in regulating the cell cycle and tumorigenesis, as LARP7 is an oncogene that promotes cell cycle transition via the CDK1 complex. The loss of HOGA1 expression leads to increased levels of CDK1, CCNB1, and CCNB2, facilitating cell cycle progression, whereas overexpression of HOGA1 results in decreased levels of these proteins. The regulatory effects of HOGA1 on these proteins are negated when LARP7 is depleted, highlighting the importance of the HOGA1-LARP7 interaction in cancer progression (Tong2022Proteogenomic). 

There is no specific information provided in the context about HOGA1's interactions with nucleic acids or its involvement in multiprotein complexes beyond these interactions with LARPs.
