# GSTO1

## Overview
Glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase omega 1-1 (GSTO1-1), a member of the glutathione S-transferase family. This enzyme is categorized as a transferase, specifically involved in cellular detoxification and redox homeostasis. GSTO1-1 is characterized by its unique structural features, including a thioredoxin fold and a reactive cysteine residue at its catalytic site, which distinguishes it from other GST classes (Ramkumar2016Mechanistic). The enzyme plays a critical role in the glutathionylation and deglutathionylation of proteins, contributing to the regulation of oxidative stress and cellular signaling pathways (Board2016Structure). GSTO1-1 is also involved in the biotransformation of arsenic and modulates calcium channels, influencing processes such as apoptosis and inflammation (Yin2001Immunohistochemistry; TanakaKagawa2003Functional). Its expression in various tissues and involvement in key cellular processes make it a significant focus of research, particularly in the context of diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Board2016Structure).

## Structure
Glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) is a member of the glutathione S-transferase family, characterized by its unique structural features. The primary structure of GSTO1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional properties. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of GSTO1 forms a distinct three-dimensional shape, often featuring a thioredoxin fold, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Ramkumar2016Mechanistic).

GSTO1 contains a reactive cysteine residue at its catalytic site, distinguishing it from other GST classes that typically have tyrosine or serine residues. This cysteine allows GSTO1 to catalyze thioltransferase reactions similar to glutaredoxins (Ramkumar2016Mechanistic). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. GSTO1 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may result in variations in its structure and function (Dai2019StructureBased).

The quaternary structure of GSTO1 has not been explicitly detailed in the provided context, and specific domains or prominent folds beyond the thioredoxin fold are not mentioned.

## Function
The human gene GSTO1 encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase omega 1-1 (GSTO1-1), which plays a crucial role in cellular redox homeostasis and detoxification processes. GSTO1-1 is involved in the glutathionylation and deglutathionylation of proteins, protecting protein thiols from irreversible oxidation under oxidative stress. This activity is essential for maintaining cellular redox balance and modulating protein function, acting as a regulatory switch that affects enzyme activities and cellular pathways (Board2016Structure).

GSTO1-1 is also implicated in the biotransformation of arsenic, catalyzing the reduction of monomethylarsonic acid, a key step in detoxifying inorganic arsenic (TanakaKagawa2003Functional). The enzyme exhibits thioltransferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities, which are not common among other mammalian GSTs, and these activities contribute to maintaining intracellular sulfhydryl status, crucial for protecting cells against oxidative stress (TanakaKagawa2003Functional).

GSTO1-1 is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, macrophages, and glial cells, and is involved in modulating calcium channels, which can influence cellular processes like apoptosis and inflammation (Yin2001Immunohistochemistry). Its activity in these processes highlights its importance in cellular signaling and stress response.

## Clinical Significance
GSTO1 (glutathione S-transferase omega 1) has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In cancer, GSTO1 is associated with drug resistance and is upregulated in several types, including pancreatic, esophageal, colorectal, and ovarian cancers. Its nuclear localization in cancer cells suggests a protective role against oxidative stress in nuclear components (Board2016Structure). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the GSTO1*C/C genotype is linked to shorter survival in male patients, indicating a higher mortality risk. GSTO1 expression is higher in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and it interacts with key signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt/mTOR, which are crucial for cancer cell survival (Radic2019GSTO1*CC).

GSTO1 also plays a role in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where genetic variations have been linked to the age at onset. The GSTO1 D140 allele is associated with a decreased risk of familial Parkinson's disease (Board2016Structure). In inflammation, GSTO1-1 is involved in the processing of IL-1β in monocytes, and its deficiency affects the expression of NADPH oxidase 1 and the generation of reactive oxygen species, highlighting its role in inflammatory responses (Board2016Structure).

## Interactions
GSTO1 (glutathione S-transferase omega 1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It physically interacts with kinases such as Akt and MEK1/2 in human neuroblastoma cells, modulating their activation through both enzyme activity and direct protein-protein interactions (Saisawang2019Glutathione). GSTO1-1 also interacts with Ryanodine receptors (RyRs), inhibiting RyR2 and activating RyR1, with these interactions being dependent on its active site cysteine residue (Cys 32) (menon2015biological).

GSTO1-1 is implicated in the posttranslational processing of IL-1β in monocytes, interacting with components of the inflammasome complex, such as ASC, which is necessary for IL-1β synthesis (menon2015biological). It also plays a role in the glutathionylation and deglutathionylation of proteins, including β-actin and the β subunit of ATP synthase, which are crucial for maintaining cellular function under oxidative stress (menon2015biological; Board2016Structure). These interactions highlight GSTO1-1's involvement in regulating oxidative stress responses and inflammatory pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in related diseases.
