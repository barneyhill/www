# C1orf54

## Overview
C1orf54 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 54. This protein is predominantly expressed in the kidney, particularly within tubular epithelial cells, and is also found in the small intestine. It plays a significant role in cellular processes, including the proliferation of tubular epithelial cells, which is essential for kidney function and repair, especially following injury. The protein's activity is mediated through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, a critical pathway for cell survival and growth (Xie2018Tubular). While the precise molecular functions of the protein remain to be fully elucidated, its expression pattern suggests a specialized role in maintaining kidney health. Additionally, C1orf54 has been implicated in various health conditions, including acute kidney injury, neuropsychiatric disorders, and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and its relevance in clinical research (Zhang2021Multiple; Feng2022Identification; Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Function
C1orf54 is a gene that encodes a protein highly expressed in the kidney, particularly in tubular epithelial cells (TECs), and is also present in the small intestine. In healthy cells, C1orf54 is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of TECs, suggesting a role in cellular processes that occur in these compartments (Xie2018Tubular). The protein is involved in promoting TEC proliferation, which is crucial for kidney function and repair, particularly after injury. This proliferative effect is mediated through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, a key pathway in cell survival and growth (Xie2018Tubular).

Although the specific functions of C1orf54 in healthy cells were not reported prior to the study, its expression pattern and involvement in cellular signaling suggest it may play a role in maintaining kidney health and function. The gene's expression is significantly lower in other organs such as the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and skeletal muscle, indicating a more specialized function in the kidney and possibly the small intestine (Xie2018Tubular). Further research is needed to fully elucidate its molecular interactions and precise role in cellular and organismal biology.

## Clinical Significance
C1orf54 has been implicated in several health conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In the context of acute kidney injury (AKI), C1orf54 is highly expressed in kidney tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and plays a protective role. Its expression decreases following kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and C1orf54-knockout mice exhibit impaired TEC proliferation and delayed recovery, leading to worsened renal function and higher mortality. Conversely, overexpression of C1orf54 enhances TEC proliferation and kidney repair, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for kidney injuries (Xie2018Tubular).

In neuropsychiatric disorders, C1orf54 is involved in the regulation of neuronal phenotypes. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near the VPS45 gene affects the expression of C1orf54, contributing to altered synaptic development and function in neurons, which is relevant to schizophrenia (SZ) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (Zhang2021Multiple).

C1orf54 has also been identified as a potential candidate gene with diagnostic value in bipolar affective disorder with metabolic syndrome, showing moderate diagnostic potential in machine learning analyses (Feng2022Identification). In cancer research, C1orf54 is included among genes with altered expression in certain cancers, although its specific clinical significance in cancer remains less pronounced (Liu2019Gene; Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
