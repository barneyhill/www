# GPALPP1

## Overview
GPALPP1 is a gene that encodes the GPALPP motifs containing 1 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA editing and cell adhesion. The protein is characterized by its motifs that are implicated in the regulation of RNA processing, potentially influencing gene expression and cellular function. Although the precise biological role of GPALPP motifs containing 1 remains to be fully elucidated, its involvement in RNA editing, particularly by the ADAR1p110 isoform, suggests a regulatory function in post-transcriptional modification (Kleinova2023The). The gene's expression levels have been associated with several diseases, such as follicular lymphoma, where it is overexpressed, and colorectal and endometrial cancers, where it is downregulated, indicating its potential role in disease pathogenesis and progression (DuśSzachniewicz2021LargeScale; Rahman2020Determination).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
GPALPP1 has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In follicular lymphoma, GPALPP1 is significantly overrepresented, with at least a 20-fold higher abundance in lymphoma patients compared to controls. This suggests a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis, particularly in the remodeling of cell adhesion pathways, which are crucial in lymphomagenesis (DuśSzachniewicz2021LargeScale).

In contrast, GPALPP1 is downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC), indicating a possible involvement in these cancers as well. The study by Rahman et al. identified GPALPP1 as one of the down-regulated genes in these conditions, although specific diseases or conditions associated with mutations or alterations in GPALPP1 were not detailed (Rahman2020Determination).

Additionally, GPALPP1 is a site preferentially edited by the ADAR1p110 isoform in RNA editing studies. While the study did not directly link GPALPP1 to specific diseases, the editing patterns suggest a role in RNA processing that could influence disease mechanisms (Kleinova2023The). These findings highlight the gene's potential clinical significance in various pathological contexts.
