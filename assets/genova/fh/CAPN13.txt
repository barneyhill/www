# CAPN13

## Overview
CAPN13 is a gene that encodes the protein calpain 13, a member of the calpain family of proteins, which are characterized by their calcium-dependent cysteine protease activity. Calpain 13 plays a role in various cellular processes by modulating the activity of its substrates through proteolytic cleavage. The protein is distinguished by its structural domains, including a protease core and calcium-binding regions, which are essential for its enzymatic function and activation in the presence of calcium ions. Calpain 13 is involved in the regulation of cellular functions through its ability to undergo post-translational modifications and exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect its activity and localization within different tissues (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
CAPN13, or calpain 13, is a member of the calpain family, characterized by its calcium-dependent cysteine protease activity. The primary structure of CAPN13 consists of amino acid sequences that form specific domains, including a protease core essential for its enzymatic function and calcium-binding domains that facilitate its activation in the presence of calcium ions. The secondary structure of CAPN13 typically involves the formation of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the stability and functionality of the protein.

The tertiary structure of CAPN13 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is crucial for its interaction with substrates and other cellular components. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of multiple subunits, which is a common feature among calpain proteins, allowing them to form functional complexes.

CAPN13 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and localization within the cell. Additionally, CAPN13 has splice variant isoforms, which may result in differences in its function and distribution across various tissues. These isoforms can influence the protein's role in cellular processes and its response to physiological conditions.
