# SAMD13

## Overview
Sterile alpha motif domain containing 13 (SAMD13) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain. This domain is known for its role in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the SAMD13 protein may be involved in various cellular processes through such interactions. Although the precise biological functions of the SAMD13 protein remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in the regulation of immune responses and cancer progression, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Yoo2023SAMD13). The gene's expression and methylation patterns have been associated with clinical outcomes in cancer, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Yoo2023SAMD13).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
SAMD13 has been identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with its overexpression linked to poor clinical outcomes such as shorter overall survival, disease-specific survival, disease-free interval, and progression-free interval in HCC patients (Yoo2023SAMD13). High SAMD13 expression is associated with advanced tumor stages and high-grade tumors, indicating its role in aggressive cancer phenotypes (Yoo2023SAMD13). 

The gene's expression is notably upregulated in HCC and correlates with poor prognosis, as confirmed by validation studies using GEO datasets and immunohistochemical analysis (Yoo2023SAMD13). SAMD13 is also linked to immune cell infiltration, including B cells, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, which are crucial in the tumor microenvironment and influence tumor progression and prognosis (Yoo2023SAMD13). 

Methylation patterns of SAMD13 are significantly altered in HCC, with lower methylation levels in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This hypomethylation is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that methylation status could be used to predict patient outcomes and guide treatment strategies (Yoo2023SAMD13). SAMD13 expression is also linked to acquired drug resistance, particularly in chemotherapy-resistant cell lines, and shows a positive correlation with immune checkpoint blockade genes, indicating its potential role in immunotherapy (Yoo2023SAMD13).
