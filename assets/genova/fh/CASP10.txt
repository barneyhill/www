# CASP10

## Overview
The CASP10 gene encodes caspase-10, a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis, particularly within the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. As an initiator caspase, caspase-10 is involved in death receptor signaling, functioning alongside or independently of caspase-8 to mediate cell death through pathways such as Fas and TRAIL receptor signaling (Wang2001Caspase10). The protein is characterized by its caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and death effector domains (DEDs), which facilitate its interactions within the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (Wang2001Caspase10). Caspase-10 is also implicated in erythroid differentiation, where it contributes to mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 activation (Lamarque2022Role). Mutations in CASP10 have been linked to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and various cancers, underscoring its clinical significance in apoptosis and immune regulation (Shin2002Inactivating; Cerutti2007Coinherited).

## Structure
Caspase-10 (CASP10) is a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease family, involved in apoptosis. The primary structure of caspase-10 includes a sequence of amino acids that form various isoforms through alternative splicing, such as caspase-10a, -10b, -10c, -10d, and the novel caspase-10g (Sprick2002Caspase10; Wang2007Cloning). Caspase-10g is a unique splice variant that lacks the large and small subunits typical of other isoforms, containing only the death-effector domain (DED) in its prodomain (Wang2007Cloning).

The secondary structure of caspase-10 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its catalytic domain. The tertiary structure forms a catalytic domain with p20 and p10 subunits, essential for its enzymatic activity (Wachmann2010Activation). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, a critical step for activation, as caspase-10 is expressed as a latent monomeric pro-caspase and activated by dimerization (Wachmann2010Activation).

Caspase-10 contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (Wachmann2010Activation). The presence of different isoforms, such as the catalytically inactive caspase-10c, highlights the functional diversity within the CASP10 gene (Sprick2002Caspase10).

## Function
Caspase-10, encoded by the CASP10 gene, is an initiator caspase involved in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, particularly in death receptor signaling. It plays a crucial role in mediating apoptosis through Fas and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor pathways. Caspase-10 can function independently of caspase-8, suggesting distinct roles in apoptosis (Wang2001Caspase10). It is highly expressed in primary T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells, where it becomes activated upon recruitment to the Fas signaling complex (Wang2001Caspase10).

In addition to its role in apoptosis, caspase-10 is involved in erythroid differentiation. It is activated early in erythroid terminal differentiation, leading to the cleavage of BID into active forms that are necessary for mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent caspase-3 activation, promoting terminal differentiation (Lamarque2022Role). The caspase-10-P13-tBID axis is essential for erythropoiesis, providing a positive stimulus for the maturation of early erythroid progenitors (Lamarque2022Role). Caspase-10's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which influences its role in cell survival and differentiation (Lamarque2022Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CASP10 gene are associated with several diseases, primarily autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and certain cancers. In ALPS, CASP10 mutations, such as P501L and Y446C, lead to decreased caspase-10 activity, contributing to defective apoptosis and lymphocyte accumulation. These mutations often occur alongside Fas mutations, exacerbating the apoptotic defect and contributing to the syndrome's development (Cerutti2007Coinherited). Some CASP10 variants, like V410I, may offer protection against severe ALPS, while others, such as I406L and Leu522Ile, impair apoptosis and are linked to ALPS-like phenotypes (Miano2019FAS‐mediated).

In non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), CASP10 mutations are found in approximately 14.5% of cases, leading to impaired apoptosis by affecting the death receptor signaling pathway. These mutations are primarily located in the prodomain and p17 large subunit, resulting in structural changes that hinder necessary apoptotic interactions (Shin2002Inactivating). CASP10 mutations have also been identified in colon cancer, where they may contribute to tumorigenesis by disrupting apoptosis (Oh2010Mutational). The role of CASP10 in these conditions highlights its significance in maintaining immune system balance and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation.

## Interactions
Caspase 10 (CASP10) is involved in several key interactions within the apoptosis signaling pathways. It interacts with the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) through its death effector domains (DEDs), forming part of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (Wang2001Caspase10). This interaction is crucial for its role in Fas and TRAIL receptor-mediated apoptosis, where CASP10 is recruited to the Fas signaling complex in primary T lymphocytes and becomes activated (Wang2001Caspase10).

CASP10 can form both homotypic and heterotypic complexes with caspase-8, another initiator caspase in the apoptosis pathway. These interactions are significant as they suggest that CASP10 and caspase-8 can compete for binding to FADD, potentially regulating each other's activity within the Fas signaling complex (Wang2001Caspase10). The study of these interactions has shown that CASP10 has distinct cleavage specificities compared to caspase-8, and is more resistant to certain caspase inhibitors, indicating differences in substrate specificity or cleavage efficiency (Wang2001Caspase10).

Mutations in CASP10 have been associated with impaired FAS-mediated apoptosis, as seen in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and ALPS-like conditions, where CASP10 variants affect its interaction with CASP8 and other apoptotic proteins (Miano2019FAS‐mediated).
