# ADSS1

## Overview
The ADSS1 gene encodes the enzyme adenylosuccinate synthase 1, which plays a pivotal role in the purine nucleotide cycle, a crucial pathway for cellular energy metabolism. This enzyme is classified as a synthetase and is involved in the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to adenylosuccinate, a precursor in the synthesis of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (Xia2000Electrical). The ADSS1 protein is characterized by conserved structural features typical of adenylosuccinate synthetases, including a glycine-rich phosphate-binding loop and a guanine-specific binding region (Sun2005Molecular). Predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue, ADSS1 is essential for maintaining energy balance, particularly during increased metabolic demands such as exercise (Sun2005Molecular). The gene's expression is regulated by cardiac-specific transcription factors and is linked to the calcineurin/NFAT3 signaling pathway, highlighting its importance in cardiac development and function (Xia2000Electrical). Mutations or dysregulation of ADSS1 have been associated with clinical conditions affecting muscle and cardiac health, underscoring its critical role in metabolic processes (AlAbdi2023Diagnostic; Xia2000Electrical).

## Structure
The ADSS1 protein, encoded by the human ADSS1 gene, is involved in purine biosynthesis. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a 457-amino-acid open reading frame with a molecular mass of 50,208 Daltons and an isoelectric point of 8.76 (Sun2005Molecular). The protein contains conserved sequence and structural features typical of adenylosuccinate synthetases, including a glycine-rich phosphate-binding loop and a guanine-specific binding region, which are homologous to other GTP-binding proteins (Sun2005Molecular). 

The tertiary structure of ADSS1 likely forms a globular shape, often featuring a Rossmann fold, which is common in nucleotide-binding proteins. The quaternary structure of ADSS1 may involve the formation of homodimers or homotetramers, as suggested by studies on similar proteins (Borza2003Variations). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate the activity of ADSS1, although specific modifications for this protein are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variants could result in different isoforms with potentially distinct functions, but specific variants are not mentioned in the context. The ADSS1 gene is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue, indicating its role in muscle metabolism (Sun2005Molecular).

## Function
The ADSS1 gene encodes adenylosuccinate synthetase 1, an enzyme involved in the purine nucleotide cycle, which is crucial for energy metabolism in cells. ADSS1 catalyzes the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to adenylosuccinate, a key step in the synthesis of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (Xia2000Electrical). This enzyme is particularly important in muscle tissues, including cardiac muscle, where it plays a role in maintaining energy balance during periods of increased metabolic demand, such as exercise (Borza2003Variations).

In cardiac cells, ADSS1 is regulated by specific transcription factors, including NKX2.5, GATA4, and MEF2C, which bind to a cardiac-specific enhancer upstream of the gene. This regulation is essential for the high-level expression of ADSS1 in the heart, particularly during development and in response to physiological stimuli like electrical pacing (Xia2000Electrical). The enzyme's activity is linked to the calcineurin/NFAT3 signaling pathway, which is activated by electrical stimulation in neonatal cardiac myocytes, leading to increased ADSS1 expression (Xia2000Electrical).

ADSS1's role in the purine nucleotide cycle also impacts glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic beta cells, where it helps maintain nucleotide balance necessary for insulin exocytosis (Gooding2015Adenylosuccinate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ADSS1 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. In family F8399, a recessive phenotype linked to the ADSS1 gene results in embryonic lethality, which is more severe than typical dominant phenotypes. This highlights the critical role of ADSS1 in early development and its potential impact on viability when mutated (AlAbdi2023Diagnostic).

In the context of cardiac health, the ADSS1 gene is implicated in cardiac hypertrophy. Electrical stimulation of neonatal cardiac myocytes activates pathways that up-regulate ADSS1, which is crucial for cardiac energy metabolism. This suggests that alterations in ADSS1 expression could influence cardiac function and potentially contribute to hypertrophic conditions (Xia2000Electrical).

The ADSS1 gene's role in muscle function is also significant. It is involved in the purine nucleotide cycle, and its dysfunction may affect muscle integrity and energy homeostasis. While specific diseases directly linked to ADSS1 mutations are not detailed, its involvement in critical metabolic pathways suggests that disruptions could lead to metabolic disorders or myopathies (Xia2000Electrical).
