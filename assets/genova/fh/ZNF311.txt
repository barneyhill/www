# ZNF311

## Overview
ZNF311 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 311, which is categorized as a transcription regulator due to its role in binding specific DNA sequences to influence gene expression. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, by modulating the transcription of target genes (Pooley2013A). ZNF311 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the transcriptional regulation landscape. The gene is located on chromosome 6 at position 6p22.1 and has been linked to telomere biology, although its precise function in telomere maintenance is not fully elucidated (Pooley2013A). Additionally, ZNF311 is involved in DNA methylation and gene expression patterns, particularly in the human placenta, where it exhibits sexual dimorphism in methylation and expression during early gestation (Gonzalez2024Sexually). The protein's classification as a zinc finger protein underscores its role in DNA binding and transcription regulation (Yeung2016DNA).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF311, a zinc finger protein, functions primarily as a transcription regulator, influencing gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, by modulating the transcription of target genes. ZNF311 is typically active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in shaping the transcriptional landscape of the cell (Pooley2013A).

In the context of telomere biology, ZNF311 has been associated with telomere length, although its exact role in telomere maintenance is not fully understood. The gene is located at 6p22.1, and while its association with telomere length has not reached genome-wide significance, it remains a potential area of interest for further research (Pooley2013A).

ZNF311 is also implicated in DNA methylation and gene expression patterns, particularly in the human placenta during the first trimester. It is associated with differentially methylated regions, showing significant female-hypermethylation and higher expression in males, although this sexual dimorphism diminishes later in gestation (Gonzalez2024Sexually). The protein's involvement in DNA binding and transcription regulation is further supported by its classification as a zinc finger protein (Yeung2016DNA).
