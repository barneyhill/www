# OR10H2

## Overview
The OR10H2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily H member 2, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their role in signal transduction across cell membranes. OR10H2 is primarily involved in the olfactory transduction pathway, where it binds specific odorant molecules in the olfactory epithelium, contributing to the sense of smell. Beyond its olfactory function, OR10H2 is ectopically expressed in nonolfactory tissues, such as human cumulus cells, where it may play a role in oocyte maturation and fertilization potential. This receptor's interaction with serotonin and subsequent activation of adenylyl cyclase type 3 (AC3) suggests a broader physiological significance, potentially influencing reproductive processes (DAEIFARSHBAF2020Expression).

## Function
OR10H2 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the olfactory transduction pathway, a process critical for the perception of smell. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which detects odor molecules and initiates a signal transduction cascade. In healthy human cells, OR10H2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory signals processed by the brain.

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR10H2 is ectopically expressed in nonolfactory tissues, such as human cumulus cells, where it may have additional physiological functions. The gene is implicated in oocyte maturation and fertilization potential, acting as a potential biomarker for high-quality and fertilizable MII oocytes. OR10H2 may influence oocyte development by activating adenylyl cyclase type 3 (AC3) and increasing cAMP production in cumulus cells, which helps prevent apoptosis and supports oocyte survival. The activation of OR10H2 through serotonin is proposed to enhance fertilization success by preventing cumulus cell senescence and improving oocyte survival (DAEIFARSHBAF2020Expression).

## Interactions
OR10H2, an olfactory receptor gene, is implicated in interactions that influence oocyte maturation and fertilization potential. It functions as a G protein-coupled receptor for serotonin, which upon binding, activates adenylate cyclase 3 (AC3). This activation leads to increased production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in cumulus cells, a process that helps prevent apoptosis and supports oocyte survival (DAEIFARSHBAF2020Expression). The interaction between OR10H2 and serotonin suggests a role in maintaining cumulus cell health and improving oocyte viability, potentially enhancing fertilization outcomes (DAEIFARSHBAF2020Expression).

The expression of OR10H2 is stage-specific during oocyte development, with significant expression from the Metaphase I stage onward, indicating its involvement in the maturation process (DAEIFARSHBAF2020Expression). The study also highlights the potential of OR10H2 as a biomarker for high-quality oocytes, suggesting its utility in assisted reproduction techniques (DAEIFARSHBAF2020Expression). While OR10H2 is located in a region of chromosome 19 that is commonly gained in ovarian carcinomas, specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Micci2010Array‐CGH).
