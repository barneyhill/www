# MAGEE2

## Overview
The MAGEE2 gene encodes the protein MAGE family member E2, which is part of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family. This family of proteins is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. MAGEE2, in particular, has been studied for its role in disease pathogenesis and prognosis, especially in the context of cancer and genetic disorders. The protein encoded by MAGEE2 is implicated in the modulation of immune responses and may have a role in brain development, as suggested by its association with sexual dimorphism in brain size. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to conditions such as familial Behçet’s disease and breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease susceptibility and prognosis (Szpak2021A; Okuzaki2016Microarray; Jia2019Prognostic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAGEE2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In familial Behçet’s disease (BD), a nonsense mutation in MAGEE2 was identified in all patients studied, suggesting its potential involvement in the disease's pathogenesis. This mutation results in a truncated protein and is significantly more frequent in BD patients compared to the general population, indicating a possible genetic marker for BD (Okuzaki2016Microarray).

In breast cancer, the expression levels of MAGEE2 have been associated with different prognostic outcomes depending on the cancer subtype. High mRNA expression levels of MAGEE2 are linked to improved relapse-free survival in basal-like breast cancer, suggesting a favorable prognostic value. However, in TP53 wild-type breast cancer, high MAGEE2 expression correlates with worse relapse-free survival, indicating that its clinical significance may vary with genetic context (Jia2019Prognostic).

The MAGEE2 gene has also been associated with sexual dimorphism in brain size. A nonsense allele at rs1343879, leading to MAGEE2 truncation, is linked to larger brain volumes in males and smaller volumes in females, suggesting a role in brain morphogenesis and potential evolutionary significance (Szpak2021A).
