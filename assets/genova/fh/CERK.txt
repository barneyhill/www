# CERK

## Overview
Ceramide kinase (CERK) is a gene that encodes the enzyme ceramide kinase, a member of the kinase family, which is pivotal in the phosphorylation of ceramide to form ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P). This enzyme is integral to lipid signaling pathways, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation. CERK is predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, where it modulates sphingolipid homeostasis and participates in inflammatory responses by activating cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (Wijesinghe2007Ceramide; Arana2010Ceramide). The protein's structure includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK)-like catalytic domain, which are essential for its function and interaction with other cellular components (Rovina2006A; Carré2004Ceramide). CERK's activity is regulated by calcium ions and phosphorylation, and it has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhu2021Ceramide; Mallela2019Regulation).

## Structure
Ceramide kinase (CERK) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the phosphorylation of ceramide to produce ceramide-1-phosphate. The primary structure of CERK includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain located at the N-terminus, which is essential for its catalytic activity and membrane association (Carré2004Ceramide). The PH domain is characterized by a seven-stranded β-sandwich structure capped with a C-terminal α-helix, a common feature in the human genome (Rovina2006A). 

A notable structural feature of CERK is the β6-β7 loop within the PH domain, which is extended and contains two additional β-strands. This loop is critical for the protein's localization to the Golgi complex and its binding to polyphosphoinositides and phosphatidic acid (Rovina2006A). Mutations in this loop can impair localization and reduce enzymatic activity, highlighting its importance in maintaining the functional conformation of CERK (Rovina2006A).

CERK also contains a diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK)-like catalytic domain centrally located in its structure (Carré2004Ceramide). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as myristoylation at the N-terminal glycine, which is crucial for its function (Carré2004Ceramide). Multiple splice variants of CERK exist, potentially leading to isoforms with distinct functions (Rovina2009Subcellular).

## Function
Ceramide kinase (CERK) is an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of ceramide to produce ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), a bioactive lipid involved in various cellular processes. CERK is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, where it plays a crucial role in lipid signaling pathways (Mallela2019Regulation; Wijesinghe2007Ceramide). C1P, the product of CERK activity, is involved in stimulating DNA synthesis, promoting cell division, and inhibiting apoptosis, thereby contributing to cell survival and proliferation (Wijesinghe2007Ceramide).

CERK is also implicated in inflammatory responses, as C1P acts as a positive allosteric activator of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), enhancing its interaction with phosphatidylcholine and facilitating the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor in eicosanoid synthesis (Wijesinghe2007Ceramide; Arana2010Ceramide). This positions CERK as a significant player in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses.

In addition to its role in inflammation, CERK is involved in the regulation of sphingolipid homeostasis, which is essential for maintaining cellular integrity and function (Mallela2019Regulation). The enzyme's activity is modulated by calcium ions and phosphorylation, which influence its function and localization within the cell (Wijesinghe2007Ceramide; Arana2010Ceramide).

## Clinical Significance
CERK (ceramide kinase) has significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and metabolic disorders. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CERK is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal breast tissues, contributing to chemoresistance and poor prognosis. This overexpression is linked to the activation of oncogenic pathways such as Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, promoting tumor growth and migration. Inhibition of CERK has been shown to sensitize TNBC cells to chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2021Ceramide).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS mutations, CERK plays a crucial role in cell survival and chemotherapy resistance. CERK inhibition leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and ferroptosis, reducing cell survival. This effect is mediated through the AKT pathway, where CERK activity promotes AKT activation, which in turn suppresses ROS production and ferroptosis (Vu2022Ceramide).

In metabolic disorders, CERK is implicated in insulin resistance. Elevated levels of miR-34a lead to CERK inhibition, resulting in ceramide accumulation and impaired insulin signaling, contributing to insulin resistance in aging skeletal muscle (Kukreti2020MicroRNA‐34a). These findings highlight CERK as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various diseases.

## Interactions
Ceramide kinase (CERK) is known to interact with various proteins, influencing its activity and cellular functions. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of CERK is crucial for its interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which regulates its translocation to the plasma membrane and affects ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) levels (Kim2006The). This interaction is essential for CERK's catalytic activity, particularly involving the Leu10 residue within the PH domain (Arana2010Ceramide).

CERK activity is also modulated by calcium ions and may be regulated through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes (Arana2010Ceramide). Although direct interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, CERK is known to bind and activate phospholipase A2, indicating a potential protein interaction (Don2008A). The enzyme's subcellular localization and activity are influenced by its C-terminal sequences, which are involved in nuclear export and Golgi association (Rovina2009Subcellular). The PH domain's promiscuous phosphoinositide binding profile suggests a broad range of potential interactions, although specific binding partners have not been reported (Rovina2009Subcellular).
