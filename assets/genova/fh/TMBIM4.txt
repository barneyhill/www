# TMBIM4

## Overview
TMBIM4, or transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 4, is a gene that encodes a protein known as GAAP (Golgi Anti-Apoptotic Protein). This protein is a member of the TMBIM family, characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains, which facilitate its integration into cellular membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. TMBIM4 plays a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis and maintaining calcium homeostasis within cells. It is highly conserved across species and is expressed in most human tissues, where it modulates calcium dynamics and protects cells from apoptosis induced by various stimuli. The protein's ability to influence cell adhesion, migration, and mitochondrial metabolism further underscores its significance in cellular processes related to survival and stress responses (Almeida2020Stimulation; RojasRivera2014TMBIM).

## Structure
TMBIM4, also known as GAAP, is a protein characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains, typically containing seven such domains, which facilitate its integration into cellular membranes like the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Henke2011The; RojasRivera2014TMBIM). The protein is part of the TMBIM family, which is known for a conserved motif termed UPF0005, encoding six or seven transmembrane-spanning regions (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). This motif is crucial for the protein's function in apoptosis regulation and calcium homeostasis.

TMBIM4 is involved in modulating ER calcium levels and apoptosis, with its expression reducing ER calcium content and diminishing calcium release mediated by the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). The protein can oligomerize in a pH-regulated manner, which may impact its antiapoptotic activity, although a mutant form that cannot oligomerize retains its function (RojasRivera2014TMBIM).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, influencing its functional properties. Variants of TMBIM4 can arise from alternative splicing, potentially affecting its role in cellular processes (Zhang2021The). The protein's structure and function are conserved across species, highlighting its evolutionary significance in regulating cell death (RojasRivera2014TMBIM).

## Function
TMBIM4, also known as GAAP, is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death. It is highly conserved across species and is expressed in most human tissues, primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). TMBIM4 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating calcium (Ca2+) dynamics within the ER, reducing ER calcium content, and diminishing calcium release mediated by the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). This regulation of calcium homeostasis is critical for cell survival, as it impacts the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis.

TMBIM4 exhibits broad antiapoptotic activity, protecting cells from apoptosis induced by various stimuli, including Bax overexpression and treatments with staurosporine, doxorubicin, and C2-ceramide (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). It also influences cell adhesion and migration, partly through the stimulation of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane via store-operated Ca2+ entry (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). Additionally, TMBIM4 is involved in enhancing mitochondrial metabolism and proteolytic cell invasion through a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-dependent mechanism, highlighting its role in cellular processes related to invasion and migration (Almeida2020Stimulation).

## Clinical Significance
TMBIM4, also known as transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 4, is implicated in various diseases due to its role in regulating apoptosis and cellular stress responses. Alterations in TMBIM4 expression have been associated with cancer progression and metastasis. In particular, TMBIM4 is upregulated in cancer patients, which correlates with reduced survival scores and is linked to specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms. This upregulation affects cell adhesion and migration, notably in human osteosarcoma and cervical cancer cells, through mechanisms involving store-operated calcium entry (RojasRivera2014TMBIM).

In the context of hypertension, TMBIM4 expression increases in response to angiotensin II-induced hypertension in mice, suggesting a role in blood pressure regulation. TMBIM4 may inhibit apoptosis and modulate calcium signaling, potentially influencing blood pressure by affecting vascular smooth muscle cells (Liang2017Singletrait).

TMBIM4 also plays a protective role against environmental toxins, as demonstrated in zebrafish models. TMBIM4-deficient zebrafish embryos exposed to triclocarban (TCC) exhibit increased apoptosis and mortality, indicating that TMBIM4 is crucial for mitigating TCC-induced embryonic toxicity by regulating autophagy and apoptosis pathways (Hu2021tmbim4).

## Interactions
TMBIM4, also known as the Golgi Anti-Apoptotic Protein (GAAP), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in regulating apoptosis and calcium homeostasis. TMBIM4 physically associates with inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation studies. This interaction is essential for controlling ER calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis, which is vital for cell survival and preventing apoptosis (RojasRivera2014TMBIM).

TMBIM4 also interacts with proteins involved in cell invasion processes. It enhances mitochondrial metabolism and proteolytic cell invasion through a mechanism dependent on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This involves increased activity of the protease MMP2, which is linked to extracellular matrix degradation and cell invasion (Almeida2020Stimulation).

Additionally, TMBIM4 is part of the TMBIM family, which includes other proteins like TMBIM6 and TMBIM2. These proteins interact with anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, suggesting a role in modulating apoptotic pathways (JiménezGonzález2019Deciphering). These interactions highlight TMBIM4's involvement in complex cellular processes related to apoptosis and cell migration.
