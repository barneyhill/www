# PPP2R2C

## Overview
The PPP2R2C gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit Bgamma, a crucial component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, which is a serine/threonine phosphatase. This regulatory subunit is integral to the PP2A holoenzyme, influencing its substrate specificity and enzymatic activity. Predominantly expressed in the brain, the Bgamma subunit plays a significant role in neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity, suggesting its involvement in cognitive functions and central nervous system development (Strack1998Brain; Backx2010PPP2R2C). The protein's structure, characterized by a 7-bladed WD40 propeller, facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for its regulatory functions (Iannotta2023PAK6mediated). Dysregulation of PPP2R2C has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining healthy brain function (Vaneynde2022The).

## Structure
The PPP2R2C gene encodes the Bγ subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is a regulatory subunit involved in determining the enzyme's substrate specificity and activity. The protein is composed of 447 amino acids and is highly expressed in the brain, with a notable 4.7-kb transcript (Hu2000Molecular). The molecular structure of PPP2R2C is characterized by a 7-bladed WD40 propeller, a common structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Iannotta2023PAK6mediated). This structure is crucial for its role in the PP2A holoenzyme, which is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic subunit, a structural subunit, and a regulatory subunit like PPP2R2C (Clark2019Protein).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in the function of PPP2R2C. Specifically, phosphorylation at the S381 residue by PAK6 affects its interaction with LRRK2, a protein associated with Parkinson's disease, and influences its subcellular localization (Iannotta2023PAK6mediated). This phosphorylation does not impact the formation of the PP2A holoenzyme but is crucial for guiding PPP2R2C to specific substrates (Iannotta2023PAK6mediated). The regulatory subunit's diversity, including PPP2R2C, contributes to the functional complexity and specificity of PP2A (Clark2019Protein).

## Function
The PPP2R2C gene encodes the Bgamma regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes, including cell-cycle regulation, control of cell growth, and regulation of multiple signal transduction pathways. PP2A is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic subunit, a structural subunit, and a variable regulatory subunit, such as Bgamma, which modulates substrate selectivity and catalytic activity (Backx2010PPP2R2C; Hu2000Molecular).

The Bgamma subunit, encoded by PPP2R2C, is predominantly expressed in the brain, with its expression sharply increasing after birth. This suggests a specific role in the central nervous system, particularly in neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity. The subunit is thought to target the PP2A holoenzyme to specific cytoskeletal and membrane structures, facilitating processes such as axon outgrowth and synapse formation (Strack1998Brain; Backx2010PPP2R2C).

High expression of PPP2R2C in the hippocampus, a region associated with learning and memory, indicates its potential involvement in cognitive functions. Dysregulation of PP2A subunits, including Bgamma, has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting the importance of PPP2R2C in maintaining healthy brain function (Backx2010PPP2R2C).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and disruptions in the PPP2R2C gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurological conditions. The gene is implicated in autosomal dominant intellectual disability (ID), as evidenced by a familial reciprocal translocation that disrupts PPP2R2C, leading to mild ID, epilepsy, and behavioral problems. This translocation has been observed in a family where affected individuals presented with learning difficulties, autism spectrum disorder characteristics, and late-onset epilepsy (Vaneynde2022The; Backx2010PPP2R2C).

PPP2R2C is also involved in the regulation of the LRRK2-PP2A complex, which is significant in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). PAK6-mediated phosphorylation of PPP2R2C at the S381 site affects its interaction with LRRK2, a protein associated with PD. This phosphorylation influences the subcellular localization and binding of PPP2R2C, potentially impacting pathways related to autophagy and LRRK2 activity, which are relevant to neurodegenerative diseases (Iannotta2023PAK6mediated).

While the exact mechanisms by which PPP2R2C disruption leads to these conditions are not fully understood, its role in synaptic plasticity and brain function suggests that alterations in its expression or function can have significant clinical implications (Vaneynde2022The).

## Interactions
PPP2R2C, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), participates in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is phosphorylated by PAK6 at the serine 381 (S381) site, which is crucial for its interaction with LRRK2, a kinase associated with Parkinson's disease. This phosphorylation does not affect the formation of the PP2A holoenzyme but influences the subcellular localization of PPP2R2C and its binding to LRRK2 (Iannotta2023PAK6mediated). The interaction between PPP2R2C and LRRK2 is reduced when the S381 site is mutated to a phosphodeficient form (S381A), indicating the importance of this phosphorylation for their interaction (Iannotta2023PAK6mediated).

PPP2R2C also plays a role in the mTOR signaling pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of S6K, a downstream target, thereby suppressing glioma cell proliferation. Although PPP2R2C does not directly interact with S6K, it enhances the binding of the PP2A catalytic subunit with S6K, suggesting an indirect mechanism of action (Fan2013Over). This interaction highlights PPP2R2C's potential as a tumor suppressor in human brain cancers (Fan2013Over).
