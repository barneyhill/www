# GH1

## Overview
The GH1 gene encodes the growth hormone 1 (GH1) protein, a pivotal component in human growth and metabolism. Located on chromosome 17q23, GH1 is part of a gene cluster that has evolved through duplication and divergence, resulting in multiple homologous genes (Millar2003Novel). The GH1 protein, a single-chain polypeptide of 191 amino acids, is primarily secreted by the pituitary gland and functions as a key regulator of postnatal growth, influencing skeletal development, muscle mass, and metabolic processes (Rodriguez2007Molecular; Millar2003Novel). It achieves these effects by binding to the growth hormone receptor (GHR), activating intracellular signaling pathways such as the JAK-2/STAT pathway, which in turn stimulates the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (Waters2006New; Millar2008Growth). Mutations in the GH1 gene can lead to various growth hormone deficiencies and growth disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Mullis2010Genetics; Öztürk2023PhenotypeGenotype).

## Structure
The growth hormone 1 (GH1) protein is a single polypeptide chain consisting of 191 amino acids. Its secondary structure is characterized by a bundle of four antiparallel alpha-helices, which are separated by connecting loops (Millar2003Novel). The tertiary structure of GH1 forms a compact, globular shape, which is crucial for its biological function. The protein contains two binding sites for the growth hormone receptor (GHR), facilitating receptor dimerization and activation (Millar2003Novel).

Post-translational modifications of GH1 include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are important for its stability and function. The GH1 gene is located on chromosome 17q23 and is part of a cluster of highly homologous genes, which have arisen through gene duplication and divergence (Millar2003Novel). Splice variants of the GH1 gene can lead to different isoforms, each with distinct functions, potentially affecting growth and metabolism (Huang2024The).

Mutations in the GH1 gene can lead to structural deformations, impairing protein folding and reducing bioactivity. Some mutations affect regions of the GH molecule that interact with the GHR, potentially altering binding affinity and protein interactions (Millar2003Novel).

## Function
The GH1 gene encodes the human growth hormone (GH), a crucial protein for growth and metabolism. GH is primarily secreted by the pituitary gland and acts on various tissues, including the liver, to stimulate the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which mediates many of GH's growth-promoting effects (Millar2008Growth; Rodriguez2007Molecular). GH promotes postnatal growth by influencing skeletal and soft tissue development, bone turnover, and muscle mass. It also plays a role in regulating immune function and metabolism, impacting lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (Millar2008Growth; Millar2010Characterisation).

At the molecular level, GH exerts its effects by binding to the growth hormone receptor (GHR), leading to receptor dimerization and activation of intracellular signaling pathways, such as the JAK-2/STAT pathway. This activation results in the transactivation of GH-responsive genes, which are crucial for growth and metabolic regulation (Waters2006New; Millar2008Growth). The GH1 gene's expression is regulated by a proximal promoter and a locus control region, ensuring high-level, somatotroph-specific expression in the pituitary gland (Millar2008Growth). Variations in the GH1 gene can influence its expression and are associated with differences in human stature and metabolic outcomes (Horan2003Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GH1 gene, which encodes the growth hormone, are associated with various forms of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and short stature. These mutations can lead to isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD), which manifests in several types, including autosomal recessive (IGHD IA and IB), autosomal dominant (IGHD II), and X-linked (IGHD III) forms (Mullis2010Genetics; Öztürk2023PhenotypeGenotype). IGHD IA is characterized by severe growth impairment and hypoglycemia, often due to GH1 gene deletions, while IGHD IB involves low but detectable levels of growth hormone (Öztürk2023PhenotypeGenotype; Li2021Mutations).

Mutations in GH1 can include missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations, which may affect the structure and function of the growth hormone, leading to varying degrees of growth failure (Alatzoglou2009Expanding; Millar2003Novel). For instance, missense mutations can disrupt the JAK/STAT signaling pathway or GH receptor binding, contributing to short stature (Millar2003Novel). Some mutations result in a dominant-negative effect, particularly in IGHD type II, where the mutated hormone interferes with normal hormone function (Li2021Mutations).

Alterations in GH1 expression can also impact growth and metabolism, with overexpression potentially leading to conditions like gigantism or acromegaly (Öztürk2023PhenotypeGenotype). The complexity and variability of GH1 mutations underscore the importance of genetic screening in diagnosing and managing growth-related disorders (Alatzoglou2009Expanding).

## Interactions
The GH1 gene, encoding human growth hormone, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its expression and function. The GH1 promoter region contains several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect its expression by altering transcription factor binding. These SNPs are located within binding sites for transcription factors such as NF1, Sp1, Pit-1, and the vitamin D receptor (VDRE). Differential binding of these transcription factors to the GH1 promoter is influenced by the specific alleles present at these SNP sites, affecting the gene's expression levels (Horan2003Human).

The transcriptional regulation of the GH1 gene is also modulated by interactions with nuclear factor I (NF-I) and activator protein 2 (AP-2), which bind in a mutually exclusive manner to overlapping sequences on the promoter. This binding is crucial for the transactivation of the GH1 gene, with NF-I and AP-2 competing for the same binding site, thereby influencing the gene's transcriptional activity (Courtois1990Nuclear).

Additionally, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mediates negative feedback on GH1 expression by disrupting the interaction between the transcription factor Pit-1/POU1F1 and the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), thereby inhibiting GH1 gene expression (Romero2012InsulinLike).
