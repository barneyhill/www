# ORMDL1

## Overview
ORMDL1 is a gene that encodes the ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 1, a transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is a member of the highly conserved ORMDL family and plays a critical role in the regulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis by modulating the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme responsible for the initial step in sphingolipid synthesis (Hjelmqvist2002ORMDL; Breslow2010Orm). ORMDL1 functions as a negative regulator, forming a complex with SPT to maintain sphingolipid homeostasis and prevent the accumulation of potentially harmful sphingolipid metabolites (Siow2012Mammalian; Clarke2019The). The protein's regulatory role is essential for various physiological processes, including myelination and neurological function, and its function is conserved across species (Hjelmqvist2002ORMDL; Clarke2019The).

## Structure
The ORMDL1 protein is a member of the ORMDL family, which is highly conserved across species and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It is characterized by four transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-termini facing the cytosolic side of the ER (Davis2019Transmembrane). The primary structure of ORMDL1 consists of 153 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 17.4 kDa (Hjelmqvist2002ORMDL). 

The secondary structure includes hydrophobic regions that form the transmembrane domains, which are crucial for anchoring the protein within the ER membrane (Davis2019Transmembrane). The tertiary structure is suggested to include a large cytosolic loop between the second and third transmembrane domains, which may play a role in the protein's regulatory functions (Davis2019Transmembrane). 

ORMDL1 is involved in the regulation of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), a key enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis, and its structure is essential for this regulatory role (Davis2018OrmORMDL). The protein's interactions with other proteins in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway highlight its importance in cellular lipid homeostasis (Davis2018OrmORMDL).

## Function
ORMDL1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis, a critical process for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis. The ORMDL1 protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a key role in modulating the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme responsible for the first step in sphingolipid synthesis (Hjelmqvist2002ORMDL; Breslow2010Orm). By forming a complex with SPT, ORMDL1 acts as a negative regulator of sphingolipid production, ensuring that sphingolipid levels remain balanced within the cell (Siow2012Mammalian; Breslow2010Orm).

ORMDL1 is part of a feedback mechanism that responds to elevated levels of ceramide, a sphingolipid metabolite, by inhibiting SPT activity. This regulation prevents the accumulation of bioactive sphingolipid metabolites that could disrupt cellular functions (Siow2012Mammalian; Clarke2019The). The protein's role in sphingolipid homeostasis is crucial for normal physiological processes, such as myelination and neurological function, as demonstrated in knockout studies where the absence of ORMDL1 leads to dysmyelination and neurological abnormalities (Clarke2019The). ORMDL1's function is conserved across species, highlighting its essential role in cellular and organismal health (Hjelmqvist2002ORMDL).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ORMDL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and immune-related conditions. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), ORMDL1 is significantly upregulated, and its high expression is associated with lower overall survival rates. Genetic alterations such as gene gain and shallow deletion of ORMDL1 are linked to a worse prognosis in DLBCL, suggesting its potential role as a tumorigenic factor and a prognostic biomarker (Zhu2020Expression). In colorectal cancer (CRC), however, ORMDL1 is upregulated and associated with favorable outcomes, including reduced metastasis and improved overall survival. This suggests a protective role in CRC, potentially serving as a prognostic marker (Wang2021ORMDL1).

Beyond cancer, ORMDL1's role in sphingolipid metabolism links it to immune cell homeostasis. The simultaneous deletion of ORMDL1 and ORMDL3 in mice disrupts immune cell balance, leading to reduced spleen sizes and diminished immune cell content, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune function (Demkova2024Simultaneous). These findings underscore the complex role of ORMDL1 in disease, influenced by its regulatory effects on sphingolipid biosynthesis.

## Interactions
ORMDL1 is a regulatory protein that interacts with the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex, which is crucial for sphingolipid biosynthesis. ORMDL1, along with its homologs ORMDL2 and ORMDL3, forms a stable complex with SPT, specifically binding to the N-terminal transmembrane domain of SPTLC1, a subunit of the SPT complex. This interaction negatively regulates SPT activity, thereby modulating sphingolipid synthesis (Lone2022SPTLC1; Davis2019The).

The ORMDL proteins, including ORMDL1, are involved in feedback inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis by sensing ceramide levels. This interaction is crucial for maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis, as elevated ceramide levels lead to the inhibition of SPT activity through the ORMDL-SPT complex (Davis2019The; Clarke2019The). The ORMDL-SPT complex is directly regulated by ceramide, which induces a conformational change within the complex, reducing SPT activity without involving phosphorylation (Davis2019The).

ORMDL1's interaction with SPT is essential for preventing the accumulation of toxic sphingolipid precursors, which could interfere with physiological processes such as myelination (Clarke2019The). The Asn2 and Asn13 residues in ORMDL are important for maintaining the inactive conformation of the SPT-ORMDL complex and for ceramide binding, respectively (Xie2023Ceramide).
